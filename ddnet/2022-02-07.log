10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What about add a donation banner, once a month on client start?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Like Wikipedia does from time to time.
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Maybe only to players with >100 points. 
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Open source projects needs funds... And players need to know it
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Good idea
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No. We are covering the donations fine so far, no need to annoy people. And even if we don't cover them, I'm fine to cover the rest of the costs. We are not aiming to earn money, so there is no purpose in getting people to donate over the amount of server costs we have
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Just add ads in client
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> :greenthing:
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> add ad before demo replay
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, ads are annoying
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> shop.ddnet.tw pay 10 bucks and get 1000 points \:D
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Ads are bad. 
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If cost is covered, no message has to be sent. Messages to cover cost could be accepted, let's say, once every six months or less. 
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I would appreciate a reminder. 
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Or add checkbox: never bother me again about donation. 
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> People don't know about server cost etc.
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Idk even if donation request exists in the welcome screen. it would be nice too.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> costs are covered currently, deen is happy to cover the rest. discussion is kinda moot
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I think announcing donations in the client would be nice. Currently its discord and website only right? So maybe in the client news next to changelog and tourney announcements. There could be latest donations displayed so its a nice shoutout and can be motivating to pay if others see it. And it also reminds client users that donations are a thing
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I think what deen meant is that he doesnt want to bother people when there already is a stable income
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Non profit income that is
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Wohoo afaik server cost is already mentioned here https://ddnet.tw/funding/
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Wikimedia bothers people once a year.
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> With email spam
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet is funded, why do you see need for action?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> @heinrich5991 thx for sponsoring the ger servers btw
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Just saw it on the site
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome ðŸ™‚ it mostly started with a server I had lying around anyway
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I also want to make servers, it sounds very interesting
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh, not physically lying around ðŸ˜„ just a rented server
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It is just an idea, inform people about what's behind the game.
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Add a reminder at bottom line of client update news?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Ahh okay haha
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> kids wont understand it anyway
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and adults know that nothing is free xd
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Wohoo)
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ddnet wiki is not mentioned in the funds ðŸ‘€
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @poggonaut poggers fddr fixed
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> could you save your afkler on multeasy? they want to change map
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> could you save your afkler on multeasy? they want to change map for a newer version of multeasy
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon ^
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @HappyFray nice of you, but I'm ok with keeping the server running with just him on it (but after timeout won't be able to reconnect)
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since it's pw protected now
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ah ok
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Awkah> Hi, I stopped playing CS:GO and decided to give away my inventory. Here is my trade link, take something for yourself - https://steamcomunite.com/trodeofer/new/?partner=1161248708&token=X7Eb7R1v
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> Hi,
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> I just tried to register a new account and I noticed several minor issues.
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> For example, this language select is completely useless - the only option you can select is English, so why do we even have it there xd.
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> And also, there you can see this thingy:
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> > The items marked with * are required profile fields and need to be filled out.
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> That is useless too, because there is no single field with the "*" symbol. Or you can actually add those *-symbols to the required fields xd
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> 
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> Maybe you could fix it in future
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/940259800057540698/unknown.png
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't want to customize the forum, makes upgrades harder
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Angle units on this game?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚· what do you mean? ðŸ™‚
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> What is the measurement system in this game?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Strange degrees, strange radians? xd
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw ive had multiple friends new to the game tell me the sounds are way too loud by default and they all immediately turn off the main menu music
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if other people have similar experiences maybe it could be lowered by default?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadams> build directly in the game during the game
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have this in every game i install
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you considered turning down the global volume @Im 'corneum? ^^
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ðŸ‘º
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> my global is always around 20 and in websites around the middle of the sliders
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mine is at 3, I think ðŸ˜„
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> on zoom i have to go down to 2 and i cant find the option to make it more silent or navigate windows sound options douring a meeting
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I have it at 10
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> heinrich has cat ears confirmed
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> furry, i knew it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn\: what imports does your python frametime code need?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol it depends on your headphone ohms on how loud things are
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ig
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have mine on max just so i have at least one constant
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I've looked for undo feature in editor and now I see it existed and you want to remove it :saddo:
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Wohoo the undo feature mainly crashes your client ðŸ˜‰
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```python
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> import numpy as np
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> import re
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> from glob import glob
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think that's it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how do i execute it tho, so i get .png xd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Chairn)
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> on windows my sound would be at 2 or 3
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> also the main menu music is quieter than the volume from other stuff like youtube
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i think the only thing that is really loud is gun sound
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wdym? I just screenshot it, but you can use plt.savefig
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.html
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe i'm just too dumb for python xd
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nothing opens for me xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do i have to execute it with some special python module or just run python3 on it?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do you even data science jupjupjapstur?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just want 1 trillion fps in teeworlds, thats my only life goal
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> do you run ipython or just python?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> python3
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try it with ipython3
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd wasnt even installed, but still doesnt to anything xd
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was the code you posted complete?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe it misses a .show() or smth
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```python
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> from IPython import get_ipython
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'qt')    ## backend is Qt
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> add this to change the backend of matplotlib
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now, it should open a window with the figure inside
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ImportError: 
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     Could not load requested Qt binding. Please ensure that
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     PyQt4 >= 4.7, PyQt5, PySide >= 1.0.3 or PySide2 is available,
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     and only one is imported per session.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     Currently-imported Qt library:                              'pyqt5'
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```probs im missing some installs xD
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe as well, but using the last command, it"s not needed so i never use .show()
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try another backend
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah wait, outdated page
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/backends.html#the-builtin-backends
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i recommend working with anaconda to solve this kind of lib problems
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD why is this so hard
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems like all these backends are outdated
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what if you just do .show() after?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> without specifying any backend?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried that but doesnt work
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it works fine for me so i guess one of your package is not linked or compiled properly
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I heard commenting out the majority of a Code base can improve runtime performance.
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if i don't specify any backend, i get this:
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fd9c13c6208>]
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if i do plt.show() after, it draws the figure
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true i only tested it with python3
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not ipython3
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ty
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly it doesnt load correctly tho xd
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it only loads 1 of the three log files
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how did you install ipython?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> over apt
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> should i use pip?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but can it load multiple log files normally?
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> using glob yes
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the first one loads correct, just the other twos are empty
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i iterate over the file list
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, i also get 6 graphs, but only 2 are filled xD
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or is it bcs of the show?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, show only at the very end
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> outside every loop
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah now it works xd
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or you can use plt.figure() to create a new figure at the start of every iteration
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> python syntax killed me once again
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if its too crowded
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and then show at the end of every iteration
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nah im fine xd
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i used python with blender only, so i'm nobo
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i use it to treat data from experiments
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i even found a lib to export matplotlib figures in latex ðŸ˜„
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there are always 100 trillion ways todo the same thing in python xD
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i tested the code in python3, and it also works without using ipython
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i do need a show()
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah seems to work
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe your imports fixed it somehow, dunno \:D
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i always use ipython, so much more convenient, plus it has sql history
