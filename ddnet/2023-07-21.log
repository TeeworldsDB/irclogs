00:08 < bridge_> <bencie.> Looks like someone's busy coding on GitHub! üòÑüë®‚Äçüíª
00:12 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i would say smth to clyde but i kind of like not being muted
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think u can in this server
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> has to be enabled by admins
00:13 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> good
07:08 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> that question is probably sad as hell, but i just cloned DDNet, everything worked fine until i build and ran it for the first time, i have no mouse input, any ideas?
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1046959204470095922/1131730707035725944/aaaa.mp4
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> explain
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> red tp resets velocity and hook, both tees should go to 0.50
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> so when flung there should be no horizontal momentum
07:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> red tp resets velocity and hook, both tees should go to 0.50 on the x
07:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> how does it go left
07:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> are you sure there was no key input?
07:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> unsure
07:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> the other tee input display is on by default and would show it
07:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> this isn‚Äôt my clip
07:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lets take this convo to # bugs, otherwise we get scolded by the devs
07:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lets take this convo to  #bugs, otherwise we get scolded by the devs
07:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> it‚Äôs physics so it‚Äôs not a bug
07:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> just want to know why
07:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1131823826246844466/image.png
07:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol what is this
07:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> crawler? my ip isnt linked to anywhere
07:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1131824042446422117/image.png
07:49 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> is the question about the person connected from singapore or about the bad request?
07:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh now i see, request header or use https i guess?
08:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #showroom moment xd
08:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think so
08:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe u did not read what i wrote
08:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> or u are just being cheeky
08:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vps?
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> what, mine or singapore's
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> mine is on my pc
08:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wuatstthenimage
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk what that means
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> some random singaporian ip accessing my home server
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> only open on that port
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> how did it find it
08:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> exactly, open on one port
08:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> and they found that one open port
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes... how
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> u think there is a server somewhere testing every possible ip with every possible port at a time?
08:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> crawling all internet ips
08:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ^
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> i guess
08:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> get an auth
08:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not just 1 server
08:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> millions
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea i mean
08:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> always
08:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its a common thing for my home assistant as well
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> ig it's differnt from web crawler
08:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> they ping every possible ip combination with every possible port
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> only heard of those
08:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> they get a response? they try to connect
08:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also u using a low port
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
08:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> im just doing crude automation stuff using ios shortcuts lol
08:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> when i get a text send http request to my computer and log the timestamp üòÉ
08:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> neat feature. capability to be absolutely insanely insecure
08:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use self signed cert
08:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i was gonna say, please get a simple keyword auth for that LOL
08:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or a simple ssh
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea yea
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> im raw dogging atm
08:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lmao
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> no reason not to. no important data
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> the crawler running windows is funny to me
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> esp the latest version
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's kinda why i thoughtit could be something else
09:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they proba fake the user agent ofc
09:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> windows is more user like
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> i forgot u can fake that tbh
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am web dev 1% of the time
09:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> i despise useur agents
09:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> they are so unhelpful
09:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> why only send 1 string and not a universally understood client code
09:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> that can simply be broken down into concrete stuff like os type and major version and minor version and browser
09:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> i haven't checked on the new user identity thing in a while. wonder if that's good yet
11:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ryozuki FFR. I don't have a question tho
11:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rip xd
11:36 < bridge_> <learath2> They are a relic of the past
11:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> üòÉ?
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what new user identity thing?
11:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> I couldn‚Äôt tell you anything about it other than it‚Äôs meant to replace traditional user agents
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah yea
11:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt remember
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that exists
11:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> more about user agent identity though
11:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea sry that‚Äôs what i meant
11:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Client Hints?
11:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Client_Hints
11:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ye
11:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> Idk if u have a mdn page and it looks familiar i could tell you
11:39 < bridge_> <learath2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints
11:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> I believe this is what I was remembering
11:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API
11:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> Same thing just the js api
11:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I believe microsoft(?) blocked brave from binggpt(?) using client hints, causing the first browsre to lie about its identity already
11:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> ‚òπÔ∏è
11:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> Better than having to pick through a string
11:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> And they‚Äôre always like ‚ÄúMicrosoft probably sorta gecko sorta chrome apple webkit safari‚Äù
11:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there's a library for that
11:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> Aint nobody got time for that
11:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> give me a valid reason for checking the user agent
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt know
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> I needed it at some point
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> Don‚Äôt remember
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> Ah right default options for a downloads page
11:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, so you wanted to know the platform. I see
11:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yeah
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> I ended up not finishing that because another guy didn‚Äôt like how I implemented the cool dropdown thing
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> platform/version/arch
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> it was kino, as the kids say
11:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> but the dropdowns on the HTML input element are pretty uncustomizable, so i did it from scratch. looked way better but this obviously has repercussions
11:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> I ended up not finishing that because another guy didn‚Äôt like how I implemented the cool dropdown breadcrumb combo thing
12:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Another one is browser specifics, webkit and gecko have some differences due to either non-conformance, different interpretations of the standard or sometimes flat out specific extensions
12:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I feel like this is a worse reason. detecting the incompatibilties or working around them seems saner
13:13 < bridge_> <learath2> How though? If not for the user agent and prior knowledge about the oddities of the rendering and js engines, how would you work around them? Your best option in that case seems to be just avoiding the oddities to begin with
13:14 < bridge_> <learath2> Which is usually possible tbf but still there are some webkit or gecko only things that are very tempting to use üòÖ
13:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> why the hell is my mouse inverted after building ddnet ingame üòÑ
13:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> and who setup mousesens_ui to be 500 at startup
13:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> *slaps*
13:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> and who set up mousesens_ui to be 500 at startup
13:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> and who set up mousesens_ui to be 200 at startup
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah sucks hard xD
13:41 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> any idea how to reinvert my mouse? i cant seem to find a way to quickly fix that
13:41 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its annoying üòÑ
14:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what does that mean?
14:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how is it inverted
14:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont understand
14:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> the Y and X axis of my mouse go in different directions, and my mousewheel glitches my mouse to oblivion aswell
14:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Try same mouse with different computer and different mouse with same computer
14:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and disable controller support
14:36 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> its only ingame, it works just fine outside, also only happens on linux, windows works just fine aswell, i never turned on controller support
14:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its a bug in your linux distro. which are you using. what desktop environment?
14:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet gnome
14:37 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am on manjaro atm, same happened on arch aswell, never had that issue till today
14:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> gnome is for weaklings
14:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so yes i am using gnome ._.
14:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway, in all my life i never seen a mouse giving inverted achsis
14:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try KDE
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> SAME - its SO weird!
14:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or something else
14:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its a wayland issue
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try gnome with x11 or other way around
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> usually u simply have to logout for that and then there is a dropdown
14:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but even that depends on your setup xD
14:41 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i'll try out another desktop enviroment and will try gnomex11 aswell, gimme like 10 to come back to ya if it doesnt fix it lol
14:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, cya then
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i recommend i3wm
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or sway if wayland
14:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> could you not check for their existence instead?
14:46 < bridge_> <learath2> For rendering differences no, you usually just end up spamming the css with multiple different ways of doing it and usually one is completely unsupported on the other engine so it gets dropped
14:47 < bridge_> <learath2> (That‚Äôs what is done btw, idk anyone who generates css on the fly for different browsers, so maybe my hypothetical use case isn‚Äôt all that interesting)
14:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in the past when css had less features it was common ye
14:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> --moz-my-feature
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but now i rarely see it
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but ye browser ignores css it doesnt recognize
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://caniuse.com/
15:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki the pagination thing is a bit weird. I'm not clicking on the second page whereas I have scrolled down a little before pagination was a thing
15:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why can a mobile browser not handle 1000 servers on a page?
15:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the web is not done
15:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why are u so into removing the pagination
15:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a normal thing
15:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm observing I'm not going to later pages
15:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if I'm an outlier or if that's fine, that's fine
15:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well idk nobody else is giving feedback for now xd
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i want to rethink a bit the layout anyway
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is lot of wasted space on desktop
15:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Map Size: NaN kb
15:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xD
15:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 one thing i dislike about all in 1 is that u wont probs ever scroll to bottom
15:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and there i have the footer with the license and source
15:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1131938624137596928/image.png
15:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I saw that footer before you implemented pagination, I think
15:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> maybe you could add it at the top?
15:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> interrupting the content for the copyright notice seems intuitively bad IMO
15:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> interrupting the content for the copyright notice intuitively seems bad IMO

15:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wrong player sorting (probably applying post-processing to player count but not to sorting)
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm. I thought my browser would make a request to master1.ddnet.org, but it doesn't(?)
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah it doesnt cuz SSR
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it will when i make it refresh or add a button
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of generating HTML on the server, and is what SvelteKit does by default. It's important for performance and resilience, and is very beneficial for search engine optimization (SEO) ‚Äî while some search engines can index content that is rendered in the browser with JavaScript, it happens less frequently and reliably.
15:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, cool üôÇ
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe no pagination with the typical button to go up
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i plan to add filters
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gamemode etc
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and search ofc
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then ill do request diffing
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and show events
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just gotta add million undefined checks
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do ddnet servers with reserved slots show 63 always?
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant i know this info to show 64 (1 reserved)
15:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
15:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, that's internal ot the server. is it interesting for the server list anywy?
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just wanted to show as most info as possible
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its ok xd
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its non intuitive that a mod can join even sv shows full
15:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> a mod is above the law
15:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> :p
15:48 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i think its annoying how a mod can join a 63/63 server, make it 64/64, and instantly returns back to 63/63 if someone leaves
15:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's kinda by design
15:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the reserved slot is not tracked separately
15:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Is this desired? I've thought about this a couple of times before but never came to a conclusion myself
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it seems like a net-positive for moderation, making it more likely that a slot is open for an incoming moderator
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (in the case of more than one moderator existing for a server)
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @learath2 close this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5558 ? :trollet:
16:03 < bridge_> <learath2> I like it as is, if you don‚Äôt want it as is maybe closing is the best
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> by as is u mean the change in the pr?
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u like it then fix the conflicts
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Why fix the conflicts if it‚Äôs not getting merged?
16:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> fixing conflicts only makes sense if someone wants to merge it
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was confused by ur wording
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i thought u wanted it in
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also like it as is
16:05 < bridge_> <learath2> Someone else needs to want it in, I wouldn‚Äôt merge my own üòÑ
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well nobody said anything for 6 months ima close it
16:05 < bridge_> <learath2> (fwiw I also liked the very first version with a hardcoded multiplier)
16:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> reason is meh
16:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> either we want it or not
16:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we shouldn't encourage someone to open a new PR if we don't want it
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean if there is no activity its prob not wanted
16:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then say that instead of tellign people to create a PR I guess
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> feel free to edit my comment
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont mind
16:07 < bridge_> <learath2> Fwiw it was a requested feature, but we took so long that people that wanted it probably got used to the bar as is üòÑ
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> workin as intended :KEKL:
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i updated it to "closing as its not wanted right now"
16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3954
16:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Status: I want to add it and see how it goes.
16:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> still my opinion
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the ci on that one is stalled or smth
16:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> CI requirements changed since the PR was opened
16:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you want to merge it, I can rebase it on top of master
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont mind merging it
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but unsure about backlash
16:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> could you add a comment so that I remember rebasing it?
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> done
16:32 < bridge_> <bencie.> what happens to the ranks that use this exploit to gain a better time
16:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> @jupeyy_keks i tried everything, still same issue
16:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i changed enviroment, computer's. equipment, i used different distrobutions of lionux, i used different ways to build DDNet
16:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> everything comes back to inverted mouse
16:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i have NO idea what i am doing wrong
16:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Have you tried with older versions of DDNet?
17:06 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 do you have any idea what could be causing those visual bugs in #6885? I tried replacing the lines with dots, but they still have these steps. This makes it look like it would be a bug in the envelope evaluation function, but the animations appear to be smooth
17:06 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6885
17:08 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> yes üò¶
17:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> The step-ladder pattern is likely because bezier curves are only approximated that far
17:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't think you have to handle it in your PR, but it would be nice to fix anyway if it's possible
17:28 < bridge_> <marmare_314> So the spikes if two points are close together could then also just be from the evaluation even though the animations are smooth?
17:29 < bridge_> <robyt3> You mean specifically with bezier curves? The other bug with lines after the last point happened with linear envelopes even
17:32 < bridge_> <marmare_314> No I mean the second picture I sent. That one happens with all types of curves
17:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ok, I found a fix for the step-ladder pattern
17:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> Bezier curves are using the time in milliseconds as int whereas other envelopes use the time in milliseconds as float/double
17:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> Do you have a map where I can test if this fixes the other issue?
17:38 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Not really, but its easy to reproduce. Just move any two envpoints (that are not at exactly the same value) as close together as possible
17:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ok, so for some reason this bug was also fixed by using double instead of int for the time in milliseconds
17:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'll make a PR in a moment, it shouldn't conflict with yours
17:44 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Where exactly did you need to change it?
17:44 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Oh alright
17:53 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 I just noticed that i changed the behaviour of the tangent handles in my PR. Previously they were restricted between 0 and the env point or the envpoint and the last envpoint. In my PR they are now restricted to the next envpoint. But it does not appear to make a difference for the curves that can be created, but its probably nicer to use without the restriction. Should I just make this a one-sided restriction? (ie the out-tangent cann
17:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, probably better to preserve the old behavior
17:57 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> after screenshot doesnt work
17:58 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> nvm
17:58 < bridge_> <robyt3> Doesn't work in the preview yeah
18:00 < bridge_> <learath2> The step thing is probably easily fixed by linearly interpreting between points instead of doing a zero order hold
18:05 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, just saw the pr that makes more sense
18:05 < bridge_> <learath2> I was wondering why it wasnt a first order approximation to begin with
18:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> looks weird anyway, counting in nano and converting to milli?
18:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> looked weird anyway, counting in nano and converting to milli?
18:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> sry for asking weird questions all the time btw! - im just curious all the time >_<
18:16 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> sry for asking weird questions btw! - im just curious all the time >_<
18:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> feel free to ask anything
18:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as long as its not botting
18:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:17 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> haha! üòÑ
18:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the amount of new ppl chatting here that want to code bots is astounding
18:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> why would you want that
18:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> thats the most boring part of it
18:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye, contributing and having ur part in ddnet forever is more amazing
18:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> actually
18:20 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> couldnt you btw just use a float for the Value's and have x1 and x2 for example connected via a float point? considering straight lines i suppose. dunno how you code curves >
18:21 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> im thinking for example x1 = 0; x2 = 1;  t= 0.5;  and have em connected through t?
18:26 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or is that inaccurate?
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i havent looked at the pr and idk much about this
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> me neither lol
18:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i was just thinking about Learath2's idea of using linearly interpretation
18:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> The editor interpolates each segment between two envelope points using 15 straight line segments
19:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i still didnt find the problem with the inverted mouse btw üòÑ - its insanity
19:05 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> outside of ddnet it works perfectly, ddnet just glitches my mouse to infinity
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Try different mouse
19:07 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i used 3 already üòõ
19:10 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i'll try a steam release, if that one doesnt work i am throwing my pc out of the window
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u change xinput or smth
19:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am not using debian so i dont have xinput by default
19:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i really have no clue
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well xinput is not debian specific
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its x11 utility to set input stuff
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess u use wayland
19:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> even if, it would change everything, but its game specific
19:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> okay so its not DDNet specific, i was able to recreate the issue with 2 older version's and the original teeworlds client, so it definitly is an issue on my side...
19:54 < bridge_> <lararo> IM GAY
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> u say xinput i think windows üòµ‚Äçüí´
20:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did ya try wayland
20:39 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> wayland as in bitmap? no i did not
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno what you mean, but wayland is basically a x11 alternative
20:44 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh i dont know that one, let me have a look
21:09 < bridge_> <chairn> lol, all browsers lied about their identity because microsoft made some stuff faster with IE back then
21:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> WAYLAND FIXED IT
21:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> JUPSTAR I LOVE YOU
21:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> now i can finally start developing my own bot client *dab*
21:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> only took me like 10 hours
21:18 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ooof
21:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:29 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> *for legal reasons thats a joke, do not ban me* i repeat *DO NOT BAN ME* >_<
21:44 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 i can now join ger10 again :)
21:44 < ChillerDragon> my ip didnt change i didnt change anything on my side so i assume you fixed it
