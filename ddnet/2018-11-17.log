15:39 <+Learath2> News page in client needs proper line wrapping
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Just a fish> is there any post about the new (maybe old?) css on the forum?
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen some ppl reported me that ddnet-server didnt update with client, idk if happens with all
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some ppl, its just 1 tho
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> well, probably no write permissions or the server was running while they were updating the client
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> apparently that doesn't work on Windows sometimes
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> updating never works on windows
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> (for me)
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> but it may be just steam doing weird things so ddnet can't update
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, it's confirmed that it doesn't work if you're running steam
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> DDKitty PLEASE
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> or just let me replace my ninja skin
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> xd
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> without replacing my current ninja skin cause yeah
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander_> i mean not renaming the original ninja skin
