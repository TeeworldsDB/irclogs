00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You can take a look on my try to improve the automatic completion of player names in chat. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4826
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ill check a bit later, thanks
02:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i think you are on the right track to be case-insensitive, since doesnt tab order normally follow this
02:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wait i misread what you said
02:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no, it should be case-insensitive, so in your case of Daniel and david "da" should match Daniel first
02:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> are the memory issues completely fixed?
08:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> added more stuff to https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Development

11:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadams> hi
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> Hi everyone, tried to compile server part on windows, but got issue with type redefinition:
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> 
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> `\src\engine\storage.h(13): error C2011: IStorage: 'struct' type redefinition
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\include\10.0.19041.0\um\objidl.h(9985): note: see declaration of "IStorage"`
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> 
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> I checked git history, It appears after migration to new mysql/sqlite implimentation, and succeed compiled if disable mysql flag
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> I looked for how this can be solved, in fact, either rename the interface, or add include guard __IStorage_INTERFACE_DEFINED__ to some root file where the classes from the SDK have not yet been included. (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/fixing-com-interface-redefinition-error/)
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> 
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> Do you know who to write to and who can help with this? ðŸ™‚
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Hi Faulty. So I guess we shouldn't use the name IStorage?
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But this is something we have been using forever I think, I don't see why it would appear with mysql only
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Which file is failing to compile?
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> In general, there are two issues when compiling under windows
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> The first is that in MySQL connector library was removed my_bool (https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=85131), but I was able to fix this myself by replacing it with a bool, I think maybe noone face that problem as in MariaDB it still exist and maybe it user more often 
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> The second - failed to compile \src\engine\storage.h
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> I think renaming helps, but it's really weird for me because it's an annoying naming constraint

13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think we actually don't support MySQL at the moment, there was a bug recently
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Can you check if the include guard in the right cpp file helps?
13:27 <+ChillerDragon> @deen could u reopen https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4816 for me? :) 
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> I tried the first and second option, it's extremely sad..
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> 1. Renaming is very difficult, a lot of uses, and after simple replacing it didnâ€™t work for me
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> 2. Also failed to disable the interface from SDK by guard, errors appeared on dependent files from SDK that use some internal stuff defined inside interface part
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> So if no other proposals seems I need to find linux/mac machine to continue development ðŸ˜•

13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the wonders of using an open source operating system
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using btrfs you can have more games in the deck ssd due to transparent compression

16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wrong chat xd
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Did you add an `#include <windows.h>` somewhere? Try adding `#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` in the line before including the windows header, if that line isn't there already.
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone know why the github CI is missing on this change? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4829
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's why I asked in which cpp file it's happening
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the file is not included in cmakelist
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ha, thanks!
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Didn't know that github ci can detect this
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I was expecting it to run and throw an error in cmake then
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> seems like it's unrelated to that and a partial outage of github actions in general
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://www.githubstatus.com/
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that tool looks like a missed oportunity to use rust again :monkalaugh:
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Would someone familiar with the Quads Render System please explain to me what the following code is for:
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> When do I need to use this and if this is used so often why isn't this done with every sprite added to a container?
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Would someone familiar with the Quads Render System please explain to me what the following code is for:
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);

19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the vulkan guy appeared :poggers:
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when release 16.0
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```js
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> gender = 1 // Male
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> gender = 0 // Female
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> gender = undefined // Non binary
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> ```
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Want me to continue?
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> No, you have to go back a step first. How did it come to the determination that Male = 1 is, there must first be formed by the committee a consortium, which then forms a working group that forms an opinion about it in the working circle. Should probably be discussed more in off-topic.
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> did u ping me
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <shiro> and yes u can continue
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> When do we use Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 1, 1, 0); instead of  Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno, when you want to flip it or smth
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Salmon De KÃ¶hler> 1 - true, 0 - false
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Salmon De KÃ¶hler> ONLY MANS NO WOMANS
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> with my PR 3 weeks ago I forgot to copy the last two lines from the plyaers.cpp OnInit() into the nameplates.cpp, right?
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v>     Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 1.f);
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v>     Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(0.f);
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3268986d91b9fe4a3845f231a3263e18022159df/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L795-L796
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4697/files
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its added to the end of the function to reset to the default values
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you only need default values then you dont need to call these functions
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If these are the default values anyway why is written almost before each QuadContainerAddSprite()   Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);, couldn't we just set these as default values and only set other values explicitly. I haven't dealt with the Graphics architecture so explicitly. but it is noticeable that "Graphics()->QuadsSetSubset(0, 0, 1, 1);" is used 47 times, other values only 12 times. 
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> e.g. I am working on the hud.cpp, the command is executed 8 times and always only with the default values. is this necessary? Are the u, v coordinates also influenced by something else?
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the compiler can get rid of the dublicate calls
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not needed, but who cares x
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> d
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> As someone who does not know this graphics system, I would assume that it is necessary to set the values again and again. 
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The program doesn't care, but to me as a programmer I find it annoying. To have one line of code that doesn't bring any more information and that dozens of times.
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will at least remove the obviously duplicate calls when revising the HUD.
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just make sure the call at the end is there
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i copy and paste all my code anyway
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its not an extra line
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> is it possible to make shotgun not automatic on a ddnet server?
