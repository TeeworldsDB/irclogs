00:00 <@deen> Savander: the site is so slow for me that i can't scroll and i don't like how it hides so much important information
00:04 < Savander> it hides?
00:05 < Savander> btw 
00:05 < Savander> i have problems on ddnet servers
00:05 < Savander> it looks like conection problem
00:05 < Savander> but i see other people
00:05 < Savander> and chat messages
00:05 < Savander> i mean, they moving
00:15 < Savander> btw, you generally don't like this desing i guess?
00:15 < Savander> design*

04:06 < o_be_one> deen, is it you on V4ROYAL ?
04:06 < o_be_one> V3ROYAL*
04:09 < o_be_one> !help
04:09 < o_be_one> !twp deen 
04:09 < Nimda> deen is currently playing blmapV3ROYAL on server : DDNet GER - BLOCKER xRoThx #2 [DDraceNetwork].
04:09 < o_be_one> !ddnetpeak
04:09 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 215
04:09 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
04:46 <@deen> nope, I'm finishing my master thesis still :P
11:34 <@EastByte> Savander: hard to reproduce :/
11:52 <@EastByte> afk
14:07 < o_be_one> hello :)
14:08 < Savander> Savander,  what is hard?
14:09 <@heinrich5991> Savander: I believe you highlighted the wrong person
14:09 < Savander> hahaha
14:09 < Savander> xD
14:09 < Savander> yes... EastByte what is hard * xD?
14:19 < o_be_one> you really want to know :D ?
14:19 < Savander> yes xD
14:23 <@EastByte> Savander | i have problems on ddnet servers
14:23 <@EastByte> Savander | it looks like conection problem
14:23 <@EastByte> Savander | but i see other people
14:23 <@EastByte> Savander | and chat messages
14:23 <@EastByte> Savander | i mean, they moving
14:23 < Savander> :/
14:23 < Savander> i had it twice
14:23 < Savander> yesterday :/
14:23 < Savander> don't know how to reproduce
14:23 <@EastByte> vali also notified me about that
14:24 <@EastByte> I guess you are using ddnet client?
14:24 < Savander> yes
14:27 <@EastByte> Savander: would help me if you enable debug and tell me about the terminal output the next time it happens
14:27 < Savander> you mean, gdb?
14:27 <@EastByte> (I mean the external terminal)
14:27 <@EastByte> nah
14:27 <@EastByte> just f1 -> "debug 1"
14:27 < Savander> oh
14:27 <@EastByte> and look into the extern terminal
14:28 < Savander> so many data
14:28 < Savander> there xd
14:32 <@EastByte> maybe I should play tw the whole day (the bug should show up at some point :D)
14:33 <@EastByte> but I guess such a bug can also be caused due to ddos attacks
14:35 < Savander> maybe
14:35 < Savander> now i trying
14:35 < Savander> to save stream into file
14:35 < Savander> on windows
14:35 < Savander> on linux is pretty simple
14:35 < Savander> ..
14:35 < Savander> xd
14:38 <@EastByte> maybe you should use the logfile conf
14:38 < Savander> yes!
14:38 < Savander> i did it.
14:38 < Savander> :>
14:38 < Savander> it was simple like on linux..
14:38 < Savander> just .bat extensions
14:39 < Savander> doesn't work as i supposed
14:39 < Savander> xD
14:39 < Savander> perfect
14:39 < Savander> debug 1
14:39 < Savander> when i cant move etc
14:39 < Savander> or whole the time?
14:40 <@EastByte> just when you can't move
14:40 <@EastByte> but it sounds pretty like client -> ddnet link broke
14:40 <@EastByte> but ddnet -> client still worked
14:41 <@EastByte> typical issue caused by ddos protections
14:44 <@EastByte> finally finished deathrun :)
14:44 < Savander> nice
15:13 <@EastByte> Chairn: so you are not artkis?
15:13 <@EastByte> interesting =)
15:13 < Chairn> :D
15:14 < Chairn> i dont even know why he asked this :D
15:14 <@EastByte> btw. have you noticed some problems yesterday? (like you couldn't move but still saw the gameplay)
15:28 < Chairn> hum, not reall
15:28 < Chairn> y
15:28 <@EastByte> k
18:42 < Nimda> Black day by Ray just released on Moderate at 2015-08-19 18:37
19:06 < Chairn> there is some serious chat delay in game
19:06 < Chairn> am i the only one?
19:09 <@EastByte> let me check
20:37 <@deen> o_be_one: i shut down the GER/GER2 block servers
20:39 < Savander> for ever?
20:41 < o_be_one> deen: why ? :o
20:42 <@deen> 1. xrothx isn't paying for the GER server anymore, he wanted block servers
20:42 <@deen> 2. i don't like the mod
20:42 <@deen> 3. it attracts ddosers
20:43 < o_be_one> ok i understand
20:43 <@deen> 4. there are many other people in europe who can host block servers, like you
20:43 < o_be_one> i havent shutdowned my servers so they'll just back on them
20:43 <@deen> so players can just play elsewhere and won't even notice a difference
20:43 < o_be_one> they'll notice
20:43 <@deen> and in return the other ddnet players get fewer ddos attacks
20:44 < o_be_one> cause you anti-ddos was awesome, first, and cause you maintain it
20:44 < o_be_one> and theres no admin, btw
20:44 < o_be_one> well, deen , how mutch it costs ?
20:44 <@deen> i never maintained the block servers
20:44 <@deen>  how much what costs?
20:44 < o_be_one> why not get a host especially for blockers ?
20:44 <@deen> because i don't like the block server
20:44 <@deen> it just seems like a place for ddosers and script kiddies to meet
20:45 < o_be_one> ok, vali is back so you just give up for a poor kid ? Oo
20:45 <@deen> i wrote the reasons above
20:45 < WolfAlex> deen: bug: if i open the spec menu(rshift), and the server moves me out of spec (zcatch for example) the window is still there
20:46 <@EastByte> create an issue
20:46 < o_be_one> you have hosted it for a while just for xrothx ? Oo
20:46 < WolfAlex> EastByte: you know how lazy i am :D but ok :D
20:46 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah
20:46 <@deen> o_be_one: i would have shut it down looong ago if he didn't pay 35 â‚¬ / month for them
20:47 < o_be_one> well no problem, when will you shut it ?
20:47 <@deen> he gave me the servers on the ONE condition that i run his block servers on it
20:47 <@deen> it's already down :P
20:47 <@deen> for 15 min
20:48 < o_be_one> ok other question, can my own server be indexed in DDNet ?
20:48 <@EastByte> there were ~60 players on it, and no one gave a shit about the broadcast announcements
20:48 < o_be_one> you wrong, there was many plaers whos plays often DDRace :/
20:48 <@deen> o_be_one: hm, I'd prefer not to maintain a list of trusted servers that are not  ddnet
20:49 < o_be_one> but i know how hard it could be to host blockers, i was the previous host ..
20:49 <@deen> o_be_one: see it as an opportunity for your job
20:49 <@deen> you'll get all kinds of ddos attacks to deal with!
20:49 < o_be_one> sure it will
20:50 < o_be_one> but anti-spoof work and other stuffs was good too, so these work will stop :/
20:50 <@deen> i told them to search for r0x.fr servers in the broadcast btw
20:50 <@deen> and play there instead
20:50 <@EastByte> o_be_one: they are not only important for block
20:50 < o_be_one> i have to switch it to ddnet
20:50 < o_be_one> my xxlddrace has issues ...
20:51 < o_be_one> and ive made the choice to switch all my servers to DDNet cause of updates and security fix
20:51 <@EastByte> great
20:51 < o_be_one> ill just keep one server on xxlddrace cause of popular member area
20:51 < o_be_one> most of my servers was already ddnet bin, but kepts 3 on xxlddrace
20:51 < o_be_one> can we hope to see member area in the future in ddnet ? i think no :/
20:52 <@deen> i don't like these features
20:52 <@deen> if you really need it, i guess someone could add it in a clean way and disable it by default
20:53 < o_be_one> in ddnet branch ?
20:53 < o_be_one> (sorry im not friendly on how works git ... just basics)
20:53 <@deen> yeah, we just have 1 branch and i want to keep it that way
20:54 <@deen> no need to use any complicated git stuff with ddnet
20:54 < o_be_one> oh thats nice, maybe i can find someone (like fstd :D ?) to add it ^^
20:56 < fstd> only if you rename your bash scripts to *.bash or change the shebang to #!/bin/sh :P
20:56 < o_be_one> ahahah x) ! 
20:57 < fstd> i'm not kidding
20:57 < o_be_one> no no i know, you're right ^^
20:57 < o_be_one> i'll use .bash :p
20:57 < fstd> but your script doesn't use any bash-specifics, i think
20:58 < o_be_one> i think yes it has, cause if i use sh some of them (not all) just crash, like my firewall script (not in public repo)
20:58 < o_be_one> and i use bash as interpreter so it's most convenient for me
20:59 < fstd> okay
20:59 < fstd> (i don't mind bash as an interactive shell either)
21:00 < fstd> it's just notoriously slow and big, which makes it a poor choice for scripts
21:00 < fstd> even aside from portability concerns, that is
21:01 < o_be_one> i must to be more precise with dev i know, thats what i try with every new comonent
21:01 < o_be_one> component
21:01 < o_be_one> some of my scripts are really shitty and poor :/ idk how they can "work".
21:02 < o_be_one> but i have to work on r0x.fr release 6 ... I have to do a better infrastructure with HA for web. And i have to put my wildcard SSL too, btw
21:08 <@deen> I made the website design a bit simpler, was annoyed by all the gradients and fancy borders making the site slow
21:08 <@deen> and i think it looks better that way
21:09 <@EastByte> you should continue working on your master thesis
21:10 <@deen> EastByte: i turned it in today
21:10 <@EastByte> oh cool
21:10 <@EastByte> did you reach 60 pages?
21:10 < Savander> I should continue work on new ddnet website, or not. 
21:10 <@deen> why do you ask?^^
21:10 < Savander> ?
21:10 <@deen> Savander: i don't know, i don't like modern web design =/
21:10 <@deen> Savander: maybe ask in forum what others think?
21:10 <@EastByte> you said something about 60 pages
21:11 < Savander> It's your website
21:11 <@deen> Savander: but i'm not the only one who gets to look at the website
21:11 <@deen> and i honestly have no idea what other people think looks good
21:11 < Savander> don't want ot give you additional work
21:11 < Savander> on personalizing this website
21:11 < Savander> with your layout system
21:11 <@deen> EastByte: kind of: http://felsin9.de/nnis/phi/thesis/thesis.pdf
21:11 < Savander> or additional scripts
21:12 <@EastByte> Lo
21:12 < Savander> So yes, it's your decisioon in general
21:12 <@EastByte> :o *
21:12 <@deen> Savander: well, if it's great and people like it, it would be work well invested
21:12 <@deen> Savander: but from what I've seen with your design it puts the wrong things in the focus
21:13 <@deen> and instead the more important things are hidden in sub-menus
21:13 < o_be_one> if sv_pauseable set to 0, players can spectate but staying in game right ?
21:13 < Savander> i need to know, which
21:13 < Savander> because generally i show other things
21:13 <@deen> o_be_one: right
21:13 <@deen> Savander: well, forum posts and threads are not important
21:13 <@deen> and all the important stuff is hidden in the DDNet tab at top
21:13 < o_be_one> i think ddnet design must be modern
21:13 <@deen> and why is there a player search directly on the site?
21:14 < o_be_one> to modernise TW in mind too
21:14 < o_be_one> and cause DDNet bin is modernising it
21:14 < Savander> in my opinion it looks nice
21:14 < Savander> it fit to website
21:14 < Savander> i mean this box at top
21:14 < Savander> And it's main function which is used
21:14 <@deen> Savander: yeah, but searching for players is not that important, it shouldn'T be the first thing at the top of the main site
21:14 < Savander> by people
21:15 < Savander> i like suggestions, really
21:15 < Savander> don't want to do everything as i want
21:15 < Savander> becasue then i need to change a lot of things
21:15 < Savander> you know
21:15 <@deen> oh, and i don't like when the top bar always stays there even if you scroll
21:15 < Savander> it makes additional work for me :p
21:15 < Savander> it's modern thing ^^>
21:15 < Savander> now on website, side menu
21:16 < Savander> is still there
21:16 <@deen> it's modern thing but it's shit, no one will do it in 5 years
21:16 <@deen> Savander: no
21:16 <@deen> Savander: i changed that, it was too slow
21:16 <@deen> Savander: and stupid to maintain
21:16 < Savander> okay, i can do it
21:16 < Savander> static
21:16 < Savander> it's simple :P
21:16 <@deen> if you want to go to the menu just press "Home" on your keyboard, not that difficult
21:16 <@deen> no need to clutter the entire screen
21:17 <@deen> but anyway, i don't know about the design, if you should continue etc
21:17 <@EastByte> ddnet block ger down and now block chile has the most players on one server
21:17 <@deen> is it done with some framework? boot strap?
21:17 < Savander> yes
21:17 < Savander> like your http://ddnet.tw/status/
21:17 < Savander> i mean, this table
21:17 < Savander> with servers
21:17 <@deen> well, that's not my code, i just stole it
21:18 < Savander> ^^
21:18 < Savander> but yes, im using bootstrap
21:18 <@deen> EastByte: no it doesn#'t, 2 DDNet GER servers are more full
21:18 <@EastByte> ah, I meant blocker servers only
21:18 <@EastByte> where is the rest of the blockers?
21:19 <@deen> r0x i guess
21:19 <@EastByte> pretty spread then
21:19 <@deen> or they saw the fault in their way of life and stopped playing block
21:19 <@EastByte> :D
21:19 <@deen> ooor they can't read and are waiting for GER Block to come back
21:20 < Savander> i don't understand block
21:20 < Savander> why people playing it
21:20 < Savander> o.O
21:20 < Savander> it's boring xd
21:20 <@deen> Savander: it's like city i think, more about talking and community and not playing
21:20 < Savander> facebook, irc, chats?
21:20 < Savander> xD
21:21 <@EastByte> it mainly is about betrayal and getting betrayed
21:21 < Savander> i'll never understand idea of this mod.
21:21 <@EastByte> but there also are skilled people with awesome movement (which looks kinda cool)
21:22 < Savander> deen,  what i should do
21:22 < o_be_one> Savander: i love playing block :/
21:22 < Savander> with guys who using "zClient"
21:22 < Savander> i mean
21:22 < o_be_one> idk why, it's just funny for me
21:22 < Savander> he can fly on his hook
21:23 < Savander> (fast hooking)
21:23 < o_be_one> i block sometime, i talk with many players, i troll ..
21:23 <@EastByte> looks like my antispoof patch breaks some compatibility with zclient
21:23 <@deen> Savander: tell them not to use a bot client and kick them if they don't stop using bot
21:23 <@EastByte> no idea how that happens
21:23 < Savander> okay
21:23 < o_be_one> EastByte: yes it's hard to trust someone, but i trust like 3 or 4 tees and never got problem with them since many years
21:24 < o_be_one> is antispoof patch in DDNet 8.1.1 ?
21:24 <@EastByte> you can just update your server bin
21:24 < o_be_one> deen: you're write, it's more like community ... Some tees just do ... nothing, just talking, saying they like their friends, happy to see them, etc.
21:24 <@EastByte> it's in the master branch
21:25 < o_be_one> EastByte: yes i've downloaded 8.1.1, next restart of my V3ROYAL will be full ddnet ready
21:25 <@deen> o_be_one: cool
21:25 < o_be_one> updated config file too
21:25 < Savander> EastByte hoh_
21:25 < Savander> ?
21:25 <@EastByte> ehm, you should better load/build it from github
21:25 < o_be_one> i need secure server for my players, and has you seen, its very weak actually cause of poor shitty players -_-
21:26 < o_be_one> why EastByte ?
21:26 <@EastByte> server binarys are only updated on new git tag, right?
21:26 < o_be_one> deen: can i see conf file from your blmapV3R please ?
21:27 <@deen> map config?
21:27 <@deen> it has none
21:27 <@deen> but server config it has
21:27 < o_be_one> serv config
21:28 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/blockxrothx.cfg
21:29 < o_be_one> thanks a lot
21:30 <@EastByte> o_be_one: if it's about server hosting you should rather compile the binaries by yourself
21:30 < o_be_one> ddnet work with 68 slots ? (for xxlddrace ive 68 slots with 4 reserved
21:30 <@EastByte> huh?
21:30 < o_be_one> EastByte: but it will more up to date by this way or not ?
21:30 <@deen> nope, 64 only
21:30 < o_be_one> ok
21:30 <@deen> including reserved
21:30 <@EastByte> o_be_one: by pulling the updates yourself you will always be up to date
21:31 <@deen> that reminds me, release new ddnet client?
21:31 <@deen> or anything that needs to be fixed before?
21:31 <@EastByte> wait
21:31 < o_be_one> sv_team was 0 Oo
21:32 < o_be_one> EastByte: actually i have just to get last ddnet bin and rename it and put in prod, restart the serv and its ok
21:32 <@deen> o_be_one: well, but it doesn't have EastByte's new antispoof yet
21:32 < o_be_one> oh ok
21:32 <@deen> the version is from 9 days ago
21:32 <@EastByte> o_be_one: those bins aren't up to date
21:33 < o_be_one> oh so on website its like "stable", and on github it's like "may be unstable"
21:33 <@EastByte> yea
21:33 <@deen> right
21:33 < o_be_one> ok thats really good to know
21:33 <@deen> and also "deen is too lazy to release new versions often"
21:33 < o_be_one> lol
21:33 <@deen> once every 1-3 weeks should be good enough
21:33 < o_be_one> ive just to compile with baam i think ?
21:33 <@EastByte> and east might push some important security update, which needs to be added immediately :p
21:34 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, bam server_release
21:34 <@EastByte> deen: let's wait for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/291 (see comment)
21:34 <@EastByte> and I wanted to change something relating server info
21:34 < o_be_one> ok good my compile environment is already ready for that, good :) thanks for help
21:35 < o_be_one> i dont understand what is "sv_map_window" ? Oo
21:35 <@deen> o_be_one: basically how fast the server tries to upload the map to you
21:35 <@deen> but if it's too fast that's bad too because then packets won't reach the client
21:36 < o_be_one> ok, was 60 on V3R, but default is 15
21:36 < o_be_one> is it like in kbps ?
21:36 <@deen> no
21:37 <@deen> didn't look at the code, but i guess the server sends 15 chunks/packets until it needs a response from the client that they'v been received
21:40 < o_be_one> ok
21:41 < o_be_one> well i think ive forget nothing, i have just to compile latest source and i'll be ok
21:41 < o_be_one> well EastByte is your antispoof working without problem actually ?
21:43 <@EastByte> Just test it, you can disable the vital part if there are problems
21:43 <@EastByte> sv_vanilla_antispoof 0/1
21:43 < o_be_one> ok good to know ty :)
21:51 < o_be_one> ok all is ready, thanks for support, i'll restart in 1h i think
21:51 < o_be_one> after work :p
21:51 <@EastByte> Also afk for an hour
21:52 < o_be_one> i must tell you that im little sad to see that DDNet will not host blockers anymore :(
21:52 <@deen> o_be_one: i thought you were mad that we did host block servers
21:52 < o_be_one> and wanted to let you know that i think you have hosted it really well
21:52 <@deen> because your players moved to them
21:53 <@deen> i hosted it well by doing nothing?^^ then everyone can do that!
21:53 < o_be_one> deen: yes cause didnt understood xrothx (and i dont understand him today too ..)
21:53 <@EastByte> Internaps fault for stability :P
21:54 < o_be_one> but no problem with DDNet, just surprised cause you have accepted it
21:54 <@deen> EastByte: actually i had to move the ictf servers to GER2 because the ping jumps around too much on GER and ddos attacks
21:55 < o_be_one> but ... btw, i'm like in the staff and i'm happy to take part of this adventure, thats why i wanted to let my server as ddnet part event if it blockers
21:55 < o_be_one> but actually i must enhance my anti-ddos :p soon, soon ;)
21:56 < o_be_one> deen: you made a lot ... remember when you started to host it with xrothx
21:56 < o_be_one> you did war against lamers
21:56 < o_be_one> with ddnet team, you did all to stop them ...
21:56 < o_be_one> and i'm pretty sure that many ddnet updates was from different kinds of attak
21:57 < o_be_one> so you have enhanced ddnet security by this way
21:57 < o_be_one> you did a good job, and i think dev never gone faster than when you hosted it
21:59 < o_be_one> well, just wanted to let you know
21:59 < o_be_one> i go to home now :D
22:02 < Savander> deen, you prefer bright website or we can make it dark?
22:02 <@deen> i think bright, it's not a hacking website
22:02 < Savander> or maybe
22:02 < Savander> with switch
22:03 <@deen> nope
22:03 < Savander> i mean, in night dark design
22:03 <@deen> nope
22:03 < Savander> looks kinda better
22:03 <@deen> at night just reduce your screen brightness, don't redesign websites with a night mode
22:03 < Savander> okay!
22:04 < Savander> we have new idea
22:04 < Savander> about design.. i mean, ddnet.savander.pl <- outdated
22:08 < o_be_one> lol
22:09 < Savander> o_be_one, ?
22:11 < o_be_one> i like deens answer about dark website at night :p
22:11 < o_be_one> and brithness
22:31 <@deen> EastByte: hmm, GER has 40% packet loss
22:31 <@deen> for me at least
22:33 <@EastByte> yea looked pretty laggy ingame
22:33 <@EastByte> I did a Capture on the firewall panel
22:33 <@EastByte> but nothing suspicious in there
22:38 <@deen> just server problems i guess =/
22:38 <@deen> or telekom problems
22:39 < Savander> i don't have problems
22:39 < Savander> with ger
22:40 < Savander> 0% packetloss
22:41 <@EastByte> I'm not at the telekom
22:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vssu4
22:43 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master f62bb18 def: /map and /mapinfo improvement (fixes #292)
22:44 < Chairn> EastByte: i solved the thing about hitting grenade in zcatch and not dying
22:45 < Chairn> its because there is (stupid) protection
22:45 < Savander> ?
22:45 < Chairn> if you shoot someone that was not on your screen when you shot, that guy cant die
22:45 < Savander> not possible
22:45 < Savander> protection works only
22:45 < Chairn> i just did
22:46 < Savander> 1  (or maybe a bit more than one second)
22:46 < Savander> after respawn.
22:46 < Savander> that's all.
22:46 < Savander> to prevent spawn kills.
22:46 < Chairn> not on teevision
22:47 < Savander> because
22:47 < Savander> it's my feature?
22:47 < Savander> it's only on ddnet.
22:47 < Savander> (and on servers with my zcatch modification)
22:49 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zCatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L888-L889
22:49 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zCatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L93-L94
22:49 < Savander> that's all.
22:50 < Savander> it can't works like you saying
22:52 < Chairn> so how do you explain that sometimes you take a grenade and dont die?
22:52 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zCatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp
22:54 < Chairn> sometimes but not at respawn
22:54 < Savander> don't know
22:54 < Savander> it's not because of my protection
22:55 < Chairn> ddos
22:55 <@EastByte> deen: interesting, "The traffic could not be captured."
22:56 < o_be_one> oh just forgot to ask deen, can i have the latest V3R running ?
22:56 <@EastByte> helpful ddos analysing tool xd
22:57 <@EastByte> deen: hopefully the nfoservers host just has network problems
23:03 <@deen> Apparent attack causing loss
23:03 <@deen> Aug 19 2015 02:01:50 PM PT 	We are currently investigating what appears to be a DDoS attack in Frankfurt. Problems started a few minutes ago and this is causing heavy packet loss for customers at this location. 
23:04 <@EastByte> maybe not directed against ddnet?
23:04 <@deen> I hope this isn't a consequence of shutting down the block servers
23:04 <@deen> =/
23:04 <@EastByte> I said it! :D
23:04 <@deen> but this never happened before
23:04 < Savander> lol
23:04 <@deen> and now it happens exactly when i shut down the servers
23:05 < Savander> frustrated players started ddosing .
23:05 <@deen> if the hoster finds out it's our fault that their entire network is down, we'll get thrown out 100%
23:05 < Savander> deen, , what you did!@
23:05 <@EastByte> that would be interesting
23:05 <@deen> EastByte: no, it wouldn't
23:05 <@deen> i was thrown out at too many hosters already
23:05 <@EastByte> right
23:14 < o_be_one> oO
23:14 < o_be_one> well they didnt read about drop of blockers, btw ...
23:14 < o_be_one> all asks me "why ddnet is down :o"
23:14 < o_be_one> lol
23:17 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/41ZJiSbo8016
23:18 <@EastByte> hm?
23:20 <@EastByte> is that a traceroute?
23:20 < Savander> yes
23:20 <@EastByte> ah
23:23 <@EastByte> !twp vali
23:23 < Nimda> vali is currently playing blmapV5 on server : DDNet GER - BLOCKER 64p [DDRaceNetwork].
23:23 <@EastByte> oh look, it's back
23:24 <@EastByte> or not
23:24 < Savander> DDnet Ger blocker?:D
23:24 <@deen> fake server obviously
23:24 < Savander> from france
23:24 < Savander> i guess
23:25 <@deen> still 95% packet loss on GER
23:25 <@deen> strange that nfoservers has such trouble for the first time with ddos attacks
23:25 <@deen> i guess it's their infrastructure getting ddosed so they can't just nullroute it
23:34 <@EastByte> vali claims to know whose fault it is, which indicates it might be an attack against ddnet 
23:34 <@EastByte> well I shouldn't listen to him anyways
23:43 < Chairn> this phacrum...
23:53 <@deen> EastByte: hm, other servers at the location are reachable again, guess they null-routed us...
23:53 <@deen> well, others are reachable but still have some packet loss
23:53 <@deen> so null-routing us wasn't 100% effective
23:53 <@deen> Update @ 23:40 CEST: The target IP address has been null-routed, restoring normal connectivity. We are still investigating what happened and why our systems did not properly handle it. 
23:53 <@deen> oh well =/
23:54 < Savander> ;/
23:55 <@deen> EastByte: maybe it was the fault of your firewall rules :P
23:59 <@EastByte> deen: no idea how they could affect anything xd
23:59 <@deen> well, the attack could've been directed at our ip after all
