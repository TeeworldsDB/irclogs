02:39 < bridge> <yagopx> Does anyone know how to open tas on ddrace?
02:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> sus
02:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> sus. why would you want to run Tool Assisted Speedrun software in combination with Teeworlds. :monkaHmm:
03:00 < bridge> <yagopx> speedrun in servers private
03:17 < bridge> <yagopx> tas can run .exe? to make a run

13:08 < bridge> <Learath2> @Robyt3 for #6293 I haven't really had the time to check but I thought passing a bitset would just entail passing the underlying unsigned. That's why I suggested passing by value. I think if we want to make it any power of 2 in the future, the references can be added in that patch.
13:08 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6293
13:08 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm fairly happy with my t440p 😄
14:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> Regarding the account discussion in #general. And my concern to not be able to move progress from a name to an account. Do the ddnet servers store some identifiers like MAC Address?
14:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> MAC should be part of the networking from my understanding
14:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> MAC should be part of the networking from my understanding. But I doubt DDNet covers for that. Because then banning players shouldn't be a problem.
14:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> MAC should be part of the networking from my understanding. But I doubt DDNet covers for that. Because then banning players shouldn't be a problem.
14:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> 
14:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> Edit: Ah nevermind. Forgot my Cisco years. It's ports that handle traffic between outside servers, router and local client.

14:08 < bridge> <DefaultO> Edit: Ah nevermind. Forgot my Cisco years. It's ports that handle traffic between outside servers and router. And network table. For router and local client.

14:10 < bridge> <DefaultO>

14:11 < bridge> <DefaultO> Edit: Ah nevermind. Forgot my Cisco years. It's ports that handle traffic outgoing and incoming from the public IP. And network table.

14:41 < bridge> <deen> And we can't trust the DDNet client because it's open source and anyone can change it to report a fake mac address
14:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> Didn't think about it that way
14:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> Might troll a bit in Growtopia then
14:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> And ban all MAC-Addresses using TMAC
14:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> And something like a MAC + MachineGUID (Windows) combination can't be used either because that wouldn't be cross platform.
14:50 < bridge> <Patiga> anything that the client sends can be faked
14:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea but try to fake a combination of multiple identifiers + region change and what not
14:52 < bridge> <deen> super easy, just enter anything you want
14:52 < bridge> <deen> we can't trust the client, period
14:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea but the argument was getting other people banned
14:52 < bridge> <deen> and we don't want any of the weird spyware that makes sure you don't modify the client
14:53 < bridge> <deen> ok, didn't understand it that way. I thought it's about banning cheaters
14:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> You would have to know their location, ISP information, name, and multiple identifiers have to match.
14:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> Which would be a lot of failed attempts to get someone like you banned
14:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> But I guess being able to ban griefers and rule breakers will never be a thing
14:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> Unless you get an actual anticheat. Which is too pricey and overkill for an open source project.
14:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> Unless you get an actual anticheat. Which is too pricey and overkill for an open source project. Byfron looked promising. Daax loved it.
14:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im against anti cheat software of any kind
14:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they are predatory and spyware
14:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the kernel ones even more
14:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> >overkill
14:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> But they are effective
14:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for now maybe
14:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cheats and anticheats is always a constant race
14:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> Next best thing is streaming the game
14:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
14:58 < bridge> <noby> plenty of ways to cheat even while streaming
14:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea but Teeworlds isn't' infested by professional hackers
14:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> No. Not streaming as in recording your gameplay.
14:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> professional hackers arent paid  to "hack" a open source game no one cares about
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the real professionals often have morals
14:59 < bridge> <noby> oh i see
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the ones without already work for bad actors, and there is no money to be made here
14:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> No. Not streaming as in recording your gameplay. Streaning like Stadia.
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we only have a kid
15:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> Forget about it
15:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> That would be too complicated to do
15:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> You would have to allow only DDNet clients
15:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> And thats not what would ever happen
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im now trying to learn genetic algorithms, always wanted to
15:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Are they really? Is there any game out there devoid of hacks?
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think devoid of obvious hacks might be enough
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Is there even that? Even kernel anticheats are running on untrusted hardware
15:32 < bridge> <Learath2> At the end of the day I can attach a kernel debugger or load my own module before theirs
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have heard that there are fewer obvious hacks in valorant
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> kernel debugger: probably not? load own module before theirs: works, but only for n=1
15:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea they are punishing cheaters pretty well. Spoofers get detected. And they have to buy another game copy and probably another month of their cheat. Which can get pricy. EFT for example costs 70€ (EoD), and a cheat for that game costs you easily 200€. Most of them even keep selling subscriptions when they are detected. So foul play makes the life of a cheater hard as well.
15:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Iirc windows allows you to attach all the way at the start. All that remains is to monkeypatch out the ways they would detect the attached debugger

So foul play makes the life of a cheater hard as well.
15:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> 
15:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> There is no public cheat provider that hasn't been hit.
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's entirely irrelevant to me if I want to play the game without cheaters
15:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > There is no public cheat provider that hasn't been hit. 
15:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> source?
15:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> It should be relevant though
15:34 < bridge> <Learath2> The actual deterrant there isn't that the anticheat is amazing. It' the price
15:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> because the script kiddies writing hacks for this game atm
15:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> won't be able to get around an actual anticheat
15:34 < bridge> <noby> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9bmMX82iY>
15:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes, and the fact that nothing stays undetected for ever
15:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> so cheating is expensive overall
15:35 < bridge> <noby> it will always be easier to create cheats than it will be to prevent and detect them, especialy in open source games. not that it isnt worth trying
15:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if I play their game, why is it relevant what they do with cheaters? the only relevant thing for *me* is that they're providing a cheat-free environment
15:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sure, they prboably have to do something with cheaters
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that's not what should interest me, I think
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they can do the harshest things possible, and if that's not providing a cheat-free environment, that's completely useless for me
15:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes. as long the cheater can control the environment the game and the anticheat gets run in. there will be cheat.
15:36 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah I don't think we have anyone with the skills to beat a real commercial anticheat here in the community. But eitherway, it doesnt apply to an opensource game. We'd need to only allow the precompiled client
15:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes. as long the cheater can control the environment the game and the anticheat gets run in. there will be cheats.
15:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's the problem
15:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> and your serversided bot detection doesn't pickup mouse movement
15:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> and your serversided bot detection doesn't pickup injected mouse movement
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (note that I don't think that this is a particularly bad problem)
15:37 < bridge> <noby> why wouldnt it?
15:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> ask heinrich
15:37 < bridge> <noby> the server cant know whether the mouse movement is coming from the client itself, or some sort of network/memory injection
15:38 < bridge> <noby> it just sees the inputs
15:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Not sure which you mean
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that we're an open-source game
15:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> the clients out there write the rotation
15:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> i assume you do some delta checks
15:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> mouse input injection makes the rotation look legit to the server
15:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Most of the successful anticheats rely on some sort of binary verification along with active monitoring of the game memory. Both can vary with self compiled versions of the game
15:40 < bridge> <noby> i dont think theres anything inherent about mouse input injection
15:40 < bridge> <noby> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dok3HItgiVA> ie. it can be done in client too
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yep, but a blacklist would suffice, no?
15:40 < bridge> <noby> if this is what you mean
15:40 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea and nearly every shot was detected as suspicious
15:41 < bridge> <noby> yes and why would it not have done the same thing if the inputs had came from an external source?
15:41 < bridge> <noby> it would be the same inputs
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> in the case of a triggerbot
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> not so much
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> if we talk about aimbot detection
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> it matters
15:41 < bridge> <noby> dont see how
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> not so much. you detect it using reaction time.
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> it smooths the rotation
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> automatically
15:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> just like normal mouse movement
15:42 < bridge> <noby> yeah so does the client
15:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is it relevant that it's input via a mouse?
15:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can do that in software, too
15:42 < bridge> <noby> the client is aiming in this video
15:42 < bridge> <Learath2> But blacklists are pretty fragile
15:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's not how you should set up an anticheat
15:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> binary verrification, integrity checks
15:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> and an open connection from the anticheat to the ddnet servers
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> VAC caught a lot of people back in the day by monitoring a single variable in the game memory. Old csgo cheats used to just enable the outlines for all players as if in spectator mode
15:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in case of @DefaultO's ideas, being open source is a problem
15:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> it's called glow
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> That kind of monitoring is probably the most reliable. That boolean should never be true while in a normal competitive game
15:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, sounds fine to me
15:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> and glow + radar is detected and decreases your trust factor if not done properly
15:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> same with not running VAC (Vac bypasses) while playing CS:GO
15:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> steam detects that the anticheat isn't running/doesn't work as intended
15:45 < bridge> <noby> unfortunately i think all of these ideas fall foul of this^
15:46 < bridge> <deen> I think fortunately. I wouldn't want this kind of software on my system and so I don't want to impose it on DDNet players either
15:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> you probably got the malware on your PC already
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, it's not nice to punish well-behaving people
15:46 < bridge> <noby> i mean unfortunate because it limits the possibilities of anti cheat software. but is worth it in the end
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no?
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also how is that a good argument?
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> you want to tell me he doesn't play anything else?
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're already eating bad food, why stop eating this particular one
15:47 < bridge> <deen> most definitely not. I haven't played other games for decades
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> fair point then
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> your point isn't fair though
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> because those are in most games
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just because other bad things exist
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't mean we have to do a bad thing
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> don't start the discussion people started because of vanguard
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> when golden standard anticheats like that one existed for a decade already before it
15:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> and no one complained about those until one started to run when the system boots up
15:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> and no one complained about those until one of them started to run when the system boots up
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not true
15:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> it is true
15:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's exactly what happened
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wanna bet 5 bucks? 🙂
15:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> on what
15:49 < bridge> <deen> I always complained about them
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can show you a wikipedia article
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that people complained before vanguard
15:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> i didn't hear any complains
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hence they didn't exist
15:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> ESEA was a topic once, because they shipped a crypto miner with it once
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I believe you, in that you haven't heard about it
15:50 < bridge> <gotroyb> Why not just make the game so that is it fun even if the other side is a bot? If others players have enough power to ruin your fun, does it really mater if it's a bot or not?
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> although apparently you did hear about something like that
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but that wasnt the anticheat being bad
15:50 < bridge> <deen> that's difficult. people like getting good times, and pros can beat the best time easier
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's mostly about speedrunners
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> that was an ex-employee abusing his power
15:50 < bridge> <noby> bots in pvp generally always ruin the fun, especially instagib
15:50 < bridge> <deen> that's difficult. people like getting good times, and bots can beat the best time easier
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> that was an (now) ex-employee abusing his power
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> that was an (now) ex-employee abusing his power as a developer
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rest of the people are probably not that affected by bots already
15:51 < bridge> <deen> For a non-competitive mode like City bots don't matter I guess
15:51 < bridge> <noby> havent played it much but from how i understand it botting is even a problem there
15:52 < bridge> <deen> I thought City is the Metaverse of Teeworlds, people just walk around and chat?
15:52 < bridge> <noby> there is pvp elements so aimbot helps, and there is money farming elements so scripts to find farming spots and stay there would help too
15:52 < bridge> <noby> yeah but some people take it seriously
15:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> i mean how your anti measurements work now is good enough
15:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> runescape doesn't do it differently
15:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw I'm not convinced about kernel level anticheats. It's just that serious enough people with the actual skills to beat them make hundreds of thousands per year at some company so they don't have to do this kind of stuff for a couple extra bucks
15:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> some server sided heuristics from botwatch and player reports
15:54 < bridge> <Learath2> As long as the underlying hardware can't be trusted there is no anticheat that is unbeatable
15:54 < bridge> <yeeeey> 4 teams fng is there such a thing?
15:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like you advocating for trusted computing
15:54 < bridge> <Izanagi> I’m for kernel level acs as long as it is from a trusted and reputable company
15:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's why stadia was sacry
15:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's why stadia was scary
15:54 < bridge> <noby> 5.181.50.244:8360 yes
15:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, even then. output is analog, input is analog. it's a lost cause
15:55 < bridge> <yeeeey> Through ddnet or teeworld need to come in?
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can still have an aimbot for stadia
15:55 < bridge> <noby> i do think i could do some more work on how the heuristics work but the approach seems like the best bet for tw
15:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Well if you want really unbeatable anticheat you want special purpose built computers, with tamper detection, filled to the brim with epoxy and same for peripherals 😄
15:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There is dfng now which has 64 teams 😮 which is playable from teeworlds and ddnet
15:56 < bridge> <noby> oh yeah dfng
15:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe a bit more recording could benefit the game as well
15:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe a bit more logging/recording could benefit the game as well
15:56 < bridge> <noby> @Learath2  ^
15:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Even that isn't a 100% but that brings the cost of beating it so high that it's absolutely pointless
15:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe a bit more logging/recording could benefit the game as well
15:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> for banning trolls/deleting cheated records
15:57 < bridge> <noby> teehistorian is already doing a good job with that, but maybe some automatic analysis of these logs would be good
15:57 < bridge> <Learath2> You will be required to have 2 webcams pointing at you while playing, ezclap
15:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe a bit more logging/recording could benefit the game as well
15:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> for banning trolls/deleting cheated records. player provided proof in #reports isn't good enough to ban people if mods/admins/devs don't see it happening in action.
15:57 < bridge> <noby> the bot mouse can be hidden under the desk while u move a fake mouse around that isnt plugged in
15:58 < bridge> <deen> You're putting more thought into this than the people making voting machines 😄
15:58 < bridge> <gotroyb> I'd mention here that we'll try to make dfng gameplay so botting would be worse than useless.
15:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> won't help if the hardware is under your control
15:58 < bridge> <Learath2> I detest cheaters
15:58 < bridge> <deen> Countries will be taken over by unelected dictators, but at least DDNet server will know client is real 😄
15:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> DRM protection is nothing different
15:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> on consoles
15:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> yet shock attacks, etc. grant a shell
15:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> yet shock attacks, etc. grant a shell which get used to break that protection
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the most reliable woudl be the client not knowing enemy positions at all, which for the glow is needed, i guess they know for prediction thoi
15:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Ofc it will, I'll also fill the case with epoxy and they will be powered by huge batteries, not removable
15:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> xd
15:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's not how real life works
15:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> right to repair
16:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is also on linux btw
16:00 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm obviously joking btw. Everyone that has read a thing or two about security of this kind knows that you have to have an attacker model
16:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea linux is a whole different rabbit hole
16:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i  know linux also have some virus yada yada, but most aimed at servers
16:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> people gpu passthrough to run dma cheats on it
16:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Not every system can be built to resist attacks from the chinese state
16:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> people gpu passthrough to run dma cheats on it
16:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> also most anticheats work worse on linux
16:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @DefaultO btw do u work as some sort of security engineer
16:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> people gpu passthrough to run dma cheats on it
16:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> also most anticheats work worse on linux or don't even support it
16:01 < bridge> <noby> 99% of the attacker model is just random kids who google teeworlds bot client
16:01 < bridge> <noby> and install the first ~~malware~~ that pops up
16:01 < bridge> <Learath2> You know what would actually work though? Real ID verification with accounts
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's what they do in asia I believe
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> for league of legends definetly
16:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> they have their own client
16:02 < bridge> <Learath2> You cheat, you are permabanned. Good luck forging a new id and commiting an actual crime bozo
16:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the world is not  that easy either
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> you not only get permabanned in that one game
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do you get back after that?
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> you usually get banned in all other games as well
16:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ppl would circumvent that also
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds dystopian
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> but that's how it works on the other side of the earth
16:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> ever heard of social credit score?
16:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 just one extreme example, briving or a corrupted officer that issues ids
16:03 < bridge> <gotroyb> Just make players eat a nanotechnology pill and upload their brain data and verify input.
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't really exist AFAIK
16:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> it does
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> source?
16:03 < bridge> <Learath2> You file an appeal ofc
16:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> first send them to @noby just to be sure
16:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RErdSr0iAcs
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no videos, please
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> somethign I can read
16:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> best would be a wikipedia article
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc  credit score does exist
16:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if that really exists, it'll have a wikipedia article
16:04 < bridge> <Learath2> But how many people will risk an actual crime with dozens of years of prison entailed to play a teegame
16:04 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#:~:text=The%20social%20credit%20system%20is%20an%20extension%20of%20the%20risk,financial%20infidelity%20and%20counterfeit%20goods.
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fixed link
16:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> that video isn't bad either
16:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> shows humans protesting
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > The Social Credit System has generated a large amount of misreporting and misconceptions in the media due to translation errors, sensationalism, conflicting information and lack of comprehensive analysis.[4][18][19][20] Examples of these misconceptions include widespread misassumption that Chinese citizens are rewarded and punished based on a numerical score assigned by the system, that its decisions are taken by AI and that it constantly mo
16:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> in a city that was turned into a dictatorship
16:05 < bridge> <noby> i think most people on tw would strongly reject any sort of system that links their ingame presence with their real id
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> from that article
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not just ppl on tw, most would
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in any game
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or platform
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:06 < bridge> <noby> true
16:06 < bridge> <Learath2> I honestly do believe some form of real accountability is the only thing that can stop people from these kinds of moral degeneracy
16:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> no one will know
16:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> asians are pretty damn good at winning this cyberwar
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its good and extremely bad
16:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> and not letting any information out
16:06 < bridge> <noby> i would rather pay money for tw than have to show my ID to play
16:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> we are using discord at the very moment
16:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> cheater
16:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> which is owned mostly by tencent
16:06 < bridge> <noby> no u
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it discourages for example whistleblowers
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> which is owned mostly by tencent
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> which they wouldn't have invested in, if they wouldn't profit from our valueable data
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're saying you're sure that the social credit system exists, but that information cannot appear on wikipedia about it because it's secret?
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds counterintuitive
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> pretty much
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> similiar to north korea
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not rly bruv
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're better informed than wikipedia?
16:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> @noby here's a funny talk from the CEO of Battlestate games (Escape From Tarkov) mentioning that without cheaters = no money <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxSzfiyr7BI&list=WL&t=2349s>
16:07 < bridge> <Learath2> I'd actually be okay with that too, there has to be some material consequence
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wikipedia would be the first to have it
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> not a lot of the people living there were able to escape
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you study this field?
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> not a lot of the people living there were able to escape
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> and failed escapes will punish the whole family tree
16:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> @noby here's a funny talk from the CEO of Battlestate games (Escape From Tarkov) mentioning that without cheaters = no money <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxSzfiyr7BI&list=WL&t=2349s> (use translations)
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially because its about china
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if it was  about united states i woudl believe you that wikipedia would have censorship
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in which case i would refer to wikileaks
16:08 < bridge> <Learath2> I believe there was some form of actual social credit system trialed in shanghai, nothing as insane as the conspiracies, but still. Let me see if I can find it
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i saw something about a score in case u recycled correctly or not xd
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean some cars in germany have a scoring system that shows how environmentally friendly you drive
16:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> To battle the problems of cheaters add somewhat good bot detection with moderators, cosmetics and accounts. If someone is banned they lose their cosmetics and have to buy them again. 🤑
16:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be an instance of that
16:09 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s22tMR4YoN0
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> another video
16:09 < bridge> <DefaultO> if you travel there
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> they won't let you leave tourist routes
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can find you videos about the earth being flat
16:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh it's even on that page anyway, apparently they never made an actual scoring system out of it, just some lists of people
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can find videos about the earth being flat
16:10 < bridge> <noby> that works better in some mods than others though i think; often the people using bots on servers like this are just random players who dont join enough to make an account
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> but we both don't believe what they say
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> it's not as extreme as I might point it out
16:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that's why I don't count youtube as a relevant source
16:11 < bridge> <DefaultO> but it is a real thing, and makes sure they keep in line with the communist party
16:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> force accounts :banhammer:
16:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you keep saying that, I'd like to have a reliable source
16:11 < bridge> <DefaultO> travel there yourself
16:11 < bridge> <Learath2> How would you feel about a UID of sorts that would prove you are a single unique person but you don't have to show us your id at any time?
16:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you don't think you'd come up with excuses why I didn't see it there?
16:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "you didn't look closely enough"
16:11 < bridge> <noby> that would be good, but not sure how it would be implemented
16:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would asking a good friend who was there count?
16:12 < bridge> <noby> then these random players would just make throwaway accounts
16:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Like a govt api for it. We give you a challange, you go on a govt website, you log in with your id, you enter the challange, get a response, give it to us
16:12 < bridge> <Learath2> It'd be so cool
16:12 < bridge> <yeeeey> I wish there was variety in the game ddnet
16:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Imagine no more people spamming
16:12 < bridge> <noby> that sounds sort of exploitable
16:13 < bridge> <Voxel> yes because cosmetics definitely help with cheaters
16:13 < bridge> <noby> if someone manages to reverse it then they get the info of every player
16:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you will still get money from ppl who use cheats and buy cosmetics
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the gov and  apis are a thing that rarely works
16:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> they don't but atleast you get money
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they are slow technological wise
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and would underspend
16:13 < bridge> <Learath2> It's non reversible, just a message with a MAC
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the api doesnt give u votes
16:13 < bridge> <Voxel> whar
16:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm just joking xD
16:14 < bridge> <noby> what is stopping people from just giving a fake identifier
16:14 < bridge> <Learath2> True, thus we must have a revolution to protect our games integrity
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would first have the AGPL revolution
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and abolish patents
16:14 < bridge> <Learath2> The MAC, you can't forge a govt response. So you must log in to their portal with your real id
16:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> do whatever you want. but you haven't even looked at the video containing real footage and sources of their system.
16:15 < bridge> <noby> but then the tw server would recieve an identifier that links u to ur id
16:16 < bridge> <noby> it would be cool if there was a real way to link u to ur pc hardware, more anonymous but still generally does a good job of preventing evasion
16:16 < bridge> <Learath2> We only get the message `is_real_person: true, number_of_prev_acct: 0`
16:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can spoof your hardware identifiers
16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> and I doubt ddnet would be able to do a better job than anticheats
16:17 < bridge> <noby> thats why i said, if there was a real way
16:17 < bridge> <noby> because there isnt
16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> and I doubt ddnet would be able to do a better job than anticheats at identifying fake information
16:17 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm sure I can engineer something like this to be actually cryptographically robust given enough time. If only there was political will 😭
16:17 < bridge> <noby> hmm true, i wonder if it would be possible to brute force it though
16:18 < bridge> <Learath2> During covid a lot of governments and researchers played around with cryptographically anonymous pandemic tracking. I'm sure I can repurpose sth like that
16:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm typically not watching videos. I'd probably ask for the sources of that video next. are they provided?
16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> There is ddrace/fng/dfng/zcatch/KoG/ and ctf(tho noone plays it)
16:19 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, mine is just a dream. I know everyone enjoys some level of moral degeneracy so there would never be support for anything like this
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems you can only request specific fields of the german ID card
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but not a generic hash of all the fields or so
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so we'd have to hash the stuff serverside and have the users trust us
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds bad
16:20 < bridge> <noby> i think most people dont actively enjoy degeneracy they just enjoy privacy and convienence and free/open source games and other factors that make preventing degeneracy more difficult
16:20 < bridge> <Learath2> It's actually impossible as it currently stands. Govts would need to be lobbied to set up something like this, a 0 knowledge proof of person existing and being unique api
16:21 < bridge> <yeeeey> I'm not talking about modes, but about blocks
16:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you code your own. I did so with zogtib in dfng (the spikes and later goals)
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean the german ID card is already pretty close, no?
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not there yet, though
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and not in our target demographic I guess
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> people under the age of 18 don't need to have one
16:22 < bridge> <noby> the NSA probably already knows everyone in america who has ever downloaded a cheat client just ask them for access to this data 🕵️
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have, please don't ban me
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you probably did, too, @noby
16:23 < bridge> <Learath2> I also love privacy, which is why I wouldn't want to handle ids either
16:23 < bridge> <noby> guilty
16:23 < bridge> <noby> it was just a test
16:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> must be a rule breaker because scared to identify yourself
16:24 < bridge> <noby> people can do all kinds of harm thru knowing someones real info
16:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> must be a rule breaker because scared to identify yourself
16:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> sounds pretty much like traffic stops in the us
16:24 < bridge> <Learath2> But is there an api for it where we can get a token of sorts that we'd have no way of connecting back to the id and we don't even get to see the id in the first place?
16:24 < bridge> <noby> doxxing swatting intefering with their work or family etc
16:24 < bridge> <noby> even if they are doing nothing wrong
16:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> yeyeye
16:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, but it's close
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I could imagine it being implemented, actually, if one wanted to go that way
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> businesses might also be interested in knowing that something is a person
16:26 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, how does this work? Do you mean the card can electronically provide these?
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I used it before, to log into the tax office system
16:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> already is on the other side of the world
16:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1069639906852347924/Register-LOL-Korean-Account.png
16:27 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess the issue there is that letting us even query the card the users must trust that we only ask for the field we say we ask for
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, the app shows which data is transmitted
16:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh, that's cool. The italian one just has a certificate on it which you can log into stuff with 😛
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> isnt that solved with oauth scopes?
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Croatia also has very similar online services, so does turkey. But the difference is that these businesses and governments have no need to avoid seeing the id number or the name and stuff
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.3
16:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I literally only want to know that this is a person and they havent registered on my service before
16:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> eu has this principle of data minimization
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could argue (as a business) that you want this
16:31 < bridge> <Learath2> I have new goal, become successful game developer so I can effectively lobby the eu government
16:31 < bridge> <deen> I thought I was being clever when I set my German ID card not to support online support 😄 Now I'm always annoyed that I have to authenticate in person or via snail mail instead of with phone + id card, haha
16:31 < bridge> <deen> not to support online auth*
16:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Why did you do that?
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also did that the first time around
16:32 < bridge> <deen> Evil state watching me! How dare they!
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps being scared of ways they could screw this up
16:32 < bridge> <deen> (I don't remember exactly, so long ago)
16:32 < bridge> <Learath2> But it's fine if you never plug it into anything, no? 😛
16:32 < bridge> <deen> it's NFC, so works over some (small) distance
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was that disablable?
16:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh fancy. My turkish id card only has a standard smartcard chip thingy connection
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use a smartphone to use the german ID card
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's pretty neat
16:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought I'd have to buy hardware
16:34 < bridge> <deen> I think I got a form to sign and told them I won't so they disabled it
16:34 < bridge> <deen> But maybe something changed inbetween
16:34 < bridge> <Learath2> I have a smartcard reader exactly for this
16:35 < bridge> <deen> Like this: https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/ausweisapp2/handbuch/1.14/de/Windows/settings-pin-management-eid-deactivated.html
17:48 < bridge> <Avolicious> eID has been settled by the european comission in the past 2 years. Now european member states are in charge to implement ^^

19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u should make a blog post about how u modified a running server to put a finish line
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i totally missed that
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Adrenaline 5, an absolutely insane and insanely faily map, was cut by Pipou into two parts with kill tiles being replaced with teleport tiles. Initially we had the map released in its entirety on December 10, but after realizing that it was too long, cut it into two parts and released the second part a week later. This required adding a finish tile using gdb on the already running servers, so that players could finish in the middle of the map alr
21:11 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm guessing gdb? You just need to pause execution inside somewhere with easy access to the tiles array
22:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/01/30/cargo-sparse-protocol.html
22:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ohh finally
