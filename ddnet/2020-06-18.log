00:52 < Omiro> Hello dear developers of best game in the world! I sorry for disturbing you are from your's work or smth else. But i have question to you are
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 1 am
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but, u shouldnt ask to ask, just ask
01:44 <+Omiro> oh thanks ^^
01:44 <+Omiro> So, who giving master bans to other peoples?
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> noby
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Hey guys, i have a question: is there a thing like TWRequest.php thats like newer and better
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Piepow made a teestalker webapp long ago so they told me that someone probably has a better thing like it
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I know there is <status.tw> but i dont like the fact that its not open source and their api is not really good so i wanted to know if anyone can help
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And of course it's 3:30 AM, no one is gonna answer at this time
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexandar for DDNet we have a hacky solution in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet.py#L722 based on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet7status.py for 0.7 and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/teeworlds.py for 0.6
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexandar> :pepeH: i should change a nickname eh, 2nd time i get pinged by accident
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
10:32 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Does ddnet use multiple SQL read/write server?
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems so
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just looked into the config file
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Where we had the crash there was indeed just one SQL server, and connection to it kept failing
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon if we have the same default skin, we already map that
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> yes i just realized :D
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> sorry
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> ok but on unique i at least see my own greensward
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> and 0.7 to 0.7 should work without problems
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> supporting all custom skins
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> oh okay i just realized i now see my own skin after chaning it
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> but not when i rejoin
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 to 0.7 works without problems already
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast from what I could test, it's really hard to test with more then 2-3 clients when my laptop would rather become a grill
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> not for me
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> only one client needed for me to test it
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> when i join i have default skin
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OH that's the bug
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It happened to me like 2 times
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could never reproduce it again
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> i can consitantly
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> thats not how u spoell it huh?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> consistently
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> ty
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> spell* also :D
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> yea that should be fixed
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you add some dbg_msg s in teeinfo.cpp? see why tf your skin is getting mapped to default
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> but also it would be nice if the 0.7 body is "greensward" that it shows greensward in 0.6
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> any functions or lines you have in mind?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually not teeinfo.cpp
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in gamecontext.cpp:L1410
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well L1420
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> before and after the fromsixup
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592477083.png
12:45 <+ChillerDragon> that looks good
12:45 <+ChillerDragon> afk for a sec
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> print Info.m_apSkinPartNames[1] instead afterwards
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> also good
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ChillerDragtroll
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> omg burn it with fire https://github.com/MrEAlderson/Rekit
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> why would anyone port tw to java :D
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 seems like cammostripes is even sent over the wire if i understood that correctly https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592479429.png
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> maybe the client just doent understands it
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, it is entirely possible I'm forgetting a part of the protocol
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I have to respond to a STARTINFO though, do I?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @deen so the only thing you have is a python version
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Is it possible to integrate that into a website
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Im not really experienced with py
13:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i think on connection the client expects NETMSGTYPE_SV_CLIENTINFO which includes the initial skin and there currently part 1 and 2 are empty
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> from the client https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592480333.png
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/14d26d42925f472f34b76b97df9024640dc3a82a/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1056
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592480464.png
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I'm not sending the correct clientinfo?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh so weird
13:48 <+ChillerDragon> ok my wireshark was wrong that was a message from the client
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon can you check for a `CNetMsg_Sv_ClientInfo` on the client side where m_Local is 1?
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592483672.png
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> there is only 1 tee on my server so its always m_Local when i print CNetMsg_Sv_ClientInfo
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> something with the skin colors is weird
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you should check what's sent
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh it happens if I build with release, doesn't if I build with debug
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what about RelWithDebInfo?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> trying that next
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep happens \o/
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I see the problem
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh, I fixed it but the fact that it worked in debug mode concerns me
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> things that only work in dbg mode (read: without compiler optimizations) ive seen a couple times in the past and, i was told its likely due to failing to zero some memory somewhere, but the actual problems turned out to be related to casting different sizes of memory chunks to other types carelessly without regard for the signedness
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and some of the optimizations it would do would cause it to break horribly there
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the way this one happened there is no uninitialized memory to go wrong :/
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it a signedness thing?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like doing `*(unsigned int *)mem = 0xffffffff;` if the mem was signed char type
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or something along those lines
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> issue is that I was calling ToSixup for the skins of sixup players, which is obv not needed
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but calling tosixup shouldn't destroy the skin completely, yet it does in the release build and doesn't in the debug
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the things i saw before that work only in debug build are related to compiler optimizations and also *sometimes* generate a warning on some oses/gcc versions tahts like "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing"
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, UB is nasty. you could try ubsan, @Learath2 ðŸ˜‰
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> -fsanitize=undefined?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> never heard it as ubsan before ðŸ˜„
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I ran this through ubsan before, didn't really find it :/
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html @noby
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeahh
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it check for the same type of thing that causes the "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing" warning?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm I'm usually good at spotting this kind of thing
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it's uninitialized memory, how did valgrind miss this even
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby apparently not ðŸ˜®
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ooo
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought ubsan checked for all undefined behavior
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> hey learath how to use c# in ddnet serverÂ¿
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a fast ub checker, some types require a massive amount of instrumentation
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess i was accidentaly right before about uninitialized memory
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but also assumed that it would be caught by these tools
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @bubbacio only C++ works with the server
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> ðŸ˜¦
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @bubbacio I mean you could probably add hooks for C#
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> ok ty
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it will probably be more work than just using c++
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C# is very dynamic, but that'll be a huge undertaking ðŸ˜„
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 that would require more knowledge of C++ than it would be to do it in C++
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> js runs in ddnet svÂ¿
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> lol
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> ok
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The server is entirely in C++
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can extend the server code in c as well
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> getting it to work with other languages will be a lot harder i think
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did add a V8 engine at one point though but never really did anything except messing around with chat command hooks
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> same with lua
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I wonder how I should initialise this thing
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> :justatest:
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://reviews.llvm.org/D32199
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I can use inline initializers now that we are not stuck with C++03
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this adds `-fsanitize=type`
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that sounds cool
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's not merged yet, but I can't quite figure out the UI
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so that will catch the warning i was trying to describe?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but I think it's not merged yet
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cool lol
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, did you know that ASan allocates like 64 terabytes of ram? ðŸ˜„
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you know every haskell programs allocates a similar maount
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, what for?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the GC I'd guess, for easy "allocation"
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah yeah, haskell is garbage collected
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you see whether this thing is merged already or not, @Learath2?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the TSan?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks merged
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah no it's not
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The LLVM part and the Runtime still seems to be waiting on a review
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the last comment suggests some big change happened with llvm that these diffs need to be modified for
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm  very baffled, why would my default member initializer would get ignored for a constructor that doesn't set that field?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh great I'm stupid
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even better idk how to fix this
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> strncpy is undefined if the src and the destination are overlapping
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay I will do something very ugly and hope god will forgive me for it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm we do have a bit of UB though
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like unrelated to this patch
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The amount of things ubsan finds in the client is also very scary
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon that should fix the skin thing, the only thing that remains there is the color conversion
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which after 4 hours of staring at it, idk how to fix
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do so much division by zero ðŸ˜›
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> division by zero?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> float? int should trap, right?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep float
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh no, I seem to have something wrong about the color code in ddnet ðŸ˜¦
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually I just forgot that the hsl cone has points that map to multiple points on the rgb cube
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should get client QA people ðŸ˜„
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao lmk when you roll out the bot with the github cog
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> weekend i guess
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 nice did you also add greensward? <3
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I want to support all ddnet skins, but I can't do that with this linear lookup
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> ok nice
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, maybe I could, I think the current skin system also only uses linear lookups, can't be that bad
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> if its onle like 30ish skins it should be fast enough
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723255145252651059/unknown.png
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github updating its design
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2276#issue-436713977
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Note that the server exits when creating tables failed. Since the tables are created by default, it has to be disabled explicitly (e.g. `add_sqlserver r teeworlds record teeworlds PASSWORD "localhost" 3306 0`) if the servers should start even when the database connection fails.
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but it shouldn't crash
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that was just an additional note for our server set up
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should I fix it?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I have set the table create to 0 already on the affected servers
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Can we have an Unfreeze entity on the Switch zone layer? If Deep and Undeep is there as well as Freeze, why not add Unfreeze for more possibilites for mapping puzzle maps or mapping different ways to approach races?
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh 2263 is interesting, I didn't think a character could exist without it's core being a part of the gameworld
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Freeze is only there so you can freeze for different times, switch number counts as number of seconds. For unfreeze this makes no sense
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah, also surprised me
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like a wonder that we only had this crash with super and not with many more features
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you get to that state btw?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with /spec
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on spec-enabled maps
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh when you spec your core is removed but the ccharacter still exists?
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah interesting that we didn't hit this more often
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like having two sources of truth for super ðŸ˜¦
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen can you specify what makes switchable unfreeze "useless"?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The others are not switchable @Cellegen
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> on switch layer, you can turn on and off with the right switch tiles: Freeze, Deep and Undeep
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wdym its not switchable?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> every single tile on the switch layer has it's potential to be turned off and on by the current switch tiles those do that
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> have you tried switching freeze tiles on and off?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> every single tile on the switch layer has it's potential to be turned off and on by the current switch tiles that do that
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i remember it working back then, some puzzle maps have that mechanic
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I also thought those  were only on the switch layer to adjust duration
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you have some map as an example?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> game layer and switch layer are a big diff, idk where you came with that assumption
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Puzzle box by Soapy sandwich and another map which i cant find
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the problem with adding the seconds they should freeze for in the front layer is that the data structure doesnt really allow for that. meanwhile in the switch layer each tile stores 2 more numbers. this is probably why someone thought timed freeze tiles could fit in there, while not actually being switchable
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but it's a well known puzzle map
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> So how exactly would it work if what i believed was totally incorrect?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nvm puzzle map does not use that
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nvm puzzle box does not use that
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly don't think switchable freeze exists
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though it might be a cool idea
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh no
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> a different tileset would do the trick so it won't get replaced
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sounds like either losing the kinda sensible layer structure or backwards compatibility
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm i guess the timed freeze tile would fit well in the speedup layer
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Learath2 i saw it the other way around, I'm not used to think that the numbers on the Switch tiles are indicators for the amount of seconds these are active. Tho having tiles with switchable capabilities might be easier if one of the features have that
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I once wanted to add a lot more to the switch code, like basic logic operators and stuff
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Patiga i wouldn't call it well done on the Speedup layer as it's name stands different approaches
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ðŸ˜® i would love to play with them in the editor once you're done
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> since there is only one tile in the speedup layer so far, i believe that it could be used for such diverse tiles
