12:53 < Shiki> deen: is it possible to close #210 for comments? at the moment conversation we have there is completely off-topic and I've created #211 for that specific problem
12:54 <@deen> i don't think you can close issues in github
12:54 <@deen> which leads to people spamming popular issues in some projects
12:54 < Shiki> I saw several other people doing it on other issues
12:55 <@deen> ah, i can lock it, you're right!
12:56 <@deen> done, thanks
12:56 < Shiki> thanks for closing it!
13:32 < Savander> hi
14:08 <@deen> hi Savander
16:12 < Savander> Some standards for graphics to teeworlds?
16:12 < Savander> width x height
16:12 < Savander> png/jpg?
16:12 < Savander> :D
16:20 <@deen> rgba png
16:20 <@deen> no indexed colors
16:36 <@deen> i would very much like bpg instead, would be perfect for compact file size, like opus for audio
16:42 < Savander> what you think? http://savander.pl/upload/jaw'eld.png

19:53 <@deen> nice
19:55 < Savander> i have a map.. but i'm too weak for her :D
19:55 <@deen> that's a bad sign
19:55 <@deen> from my experience mappers should always make maps that they can finish
19:55 <@deen> usually finish easily even
19:56 < Savander> i can do every single part!
19:57 < Savander> but
19:57 < Savander> but it's hard
20:04 < Savander> (without last 3 parts, because i didn't test it yet )
20:19 <@deen> ok
