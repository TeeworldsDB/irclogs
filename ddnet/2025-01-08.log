01:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @jupeyy_keks when direct merge
01:28 < bridge> <totar> what is the point of opening the pull request if you're jupstar? you can merge the branch directly into main after letting it run the CI right?
01:28 < bridge> <totar> oh the branch isn't on ddnet/ddnet-rs I guess
01:48 < bridge> <Ewan> well prs also help for tracking features and such even if you're the only author
01:48 < bridge> <Ewan> everything is much easier to discern in the commit history too because usually u can just click the pr # and get the change's explanation instantly
02:16 < bridge> <totar> commit descriptions exist
02:50 < bridge> <Ewan> it's hard to find discussions related to those commits just by the message
02:50 < bridge> <Ewan> not if there's a pr
02:50 < bridge> <Ewan> also it's a good indication of how many things you can put on your changelog etc
02:53 < bridge> <kebscs> its just jupeyy making these, there are no discussions
02:53 < bridge> <kebscs> its just jupeyy making and insta merging these, there are no discussions
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> good for personally tracking as well
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> u can have a better description on some change with a pr
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> makes u look like a better programmer when u merge more pull requests
05:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> jupstar on his way trying to beat deen's contributions in 2025
06:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i used libtw2 just for compression/map loading, im not really satisfied with the api it gives so im going to make my own
08:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i used libtw2 just for compression map loading and snapshots, im not really satisfied with the api it gives so im going to make my own
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What bothers you about it’s api?
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can’t beat deen. He is number 1 commit farmer. He gets every merge commit within seconds and even is the first to do the new year copyright commit.
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Give deen 2 years and he has more commits in ddnet-rs than jupstar
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GitHub commits have comments too
09:00 < bridge> <pioooooo> how can I get the center of the screen
09:14 < ChillerDragon> i think ``Graphics()->ScreenWidth()
09:14 < ChillerDragon> omg weechat pasting
09:14 < ChillerDragon> ``Graphics()->ScreenWidth() / 2``
09:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh sry i mean the world position of screen center

09:34 < bridge> <louis> its more efficient
09:34 < bridge> <louis> trust me bro
10:03 < bridge> <totar> does the github bot not post opened issues here anymore?
10:22 < bridge> <learath2> So if you have -1 and -2 in a dict as keys it's a guaranteed overlapping bucket
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
10:29 < bridge> <totar> wtf lol
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> With a merge queue I could simply queue them and if ci fails I'd get a message about it
10:38 < bridge> <0xdeen> oops, I changed that accidentally probably, checking
10:38 < bridge> <totar> it might just be down rn idk
11:56 < bridge> <chairn> @robyt3 why not std::cbrt here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b17d6ed497e6ab942c91c1b6c69fda5e071efecb/src/game/client/render_map.cpp#L127 ?

12:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Didn't know there was an std function for that when transplanting the bezier envelope code, feel free to make a PR to replace it
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> There is also probably possible uses of `std::hypot`in some places 😄
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pioooooo that position should be in the snapshot. If you have are in game it should be your characters position. And if you are spectating it should be in the spectator info. At least in vanilla teeworlds not sure if ddnet added anything on top.
13:16 < bridge> <zhn> you can just tweak libtw as i did, its not that hard and eats less time imo
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> something like that it is untested code tho @pioooooo https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/pf
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what did you do with libtw2? @zhn the econ stuff?
13:19 < bridge> <zhn> 0.5 0.6 0.7 bridge server
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cool send
13:20 < bridge> <zhn> still wip
13:20 < bridge> <zhn> also i deleted half of the code eventually with no commit
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> proprietary moment
13:29 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @louis.place why doe
13:29 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> at that point maybe just rcon command to spawn in anything
13:29 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> at that point maybe just rcon command to spawn in anything (like projectiles)
13:30 < bridge> <louis> i put two use cases in the issue description
13:30 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i guess first one makes sense but whens the last time ddnet had a tournament
13:32 < bridge> <louis> trust the process
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats what i did already
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> boring af
14:03 < bridge> <zhn> reimplementing tw protocol 101 time feels less boring i suppose xd
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> the goal is actually to learn rust
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> so i just do random stuff with a game i like and a language i want to learn
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> it's a win win
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> I should also write a libtw, libtw4
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon: Did you ever end up making a golang one?
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> ah, ye
16:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> ChillerDragon: thanks, it's a bit hard to figure it out myself
16:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> currently trying to improve the automap usability. here are my two ideas:
16:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - reference layer: you can set which layer the chosen layer will automap to. meaning that if you set it to the game layer it will automap based on that instead of itself
16:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - guide layer: an extra rule for checking if a tile on a different layer is something. EXTREMELY useful for if you want to do cross layer design. the layer chosen doesnt read it as a reference, but just as a guide for chosen rules
16:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> maybe i could add in a modulo rule to make checker patterns much easier
16:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @soulyvevo @louis.place what are your thoughts
16:59 < bridge> <zhn> @essigautomat and yours
17:01 < bridge> <louis> guide layer would allow for nice things but probably pretty complicated, not sure how youd design that
17:01 < bridge> <louis> reference feature probably wont be used by me at least unless it can replicate autofiller functionality
17:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh right! good point
17:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> maybe it will have an autofiller section when its set to game layer
17:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> sussy
17:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> mod can just login with a different username
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They want to be logged in rcon while stalking
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which is a legitimate demand
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
17:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> ahh right
17:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> the username becomes green when in rcon
17:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It is powering the best client goofworlds @learath2 https://github.com/teeworlds-go/goofworlds
17:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And the proxy that brings capitalism to china servers https://github.com/teeworlds-go/proxy
17:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you make it work?
18:39 < bridge> <Assa> ??? Sorry I don't understand what you are talking about, did I miss some context?
18:41 < bridge> <Assa> I guess you are limited by the group you are in. Paras can be different otherwise, but I guess this is possible
18:43 < bridge> <Assa> You could add a new keyword after INDEX like LAYER
18:50 < bridge> <Assa> oh god imagine `POS 0 -1 FULL LAYER GAME`
18:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sad :(

19:01 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think that game tiles feature ignores parallax and offsets so this could be done the same way
19:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> my honest reaction: :poggers2:
19:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> okay who fucked up naming a file VERSION in the ffmpeg lib

20:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> is the photoshoot server down? I've been getting "no answer from the server yet" any time I tried last few days
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xfaulty sos i spawn frozen on Unstable what happend?

22:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Does it write "bad client" in chat?
22:31 < bridge> <totar> will https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8959 get reviewed?
22:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ^^^^
23:02 < bridge> <zhn> 1 message above i suppose xd
23:05 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> o yes i want that
23:27 < bridge> <teero777> @heinrich5991 can you review #8959
23:27 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8959
23:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No chat was pretty empty. It didn’t even show my login message I think. And if I connect with the same client again it works as if the first client logged into the frozen account already.
23:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you don’t know what happend maybe I am not the only case. I connected to the server because of the unusually low player count.
