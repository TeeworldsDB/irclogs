11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft is 500k$ tc offered in places in US?
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> Remote Compiler Engineer - $500-600k TC
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got this email
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:42 < bridge> <avolicious> Lets take it & build up a teeworlds ddos protection
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a intro call tomorrow with them
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i can get us salary in eu im gonna be rich
11:55 < bridge> <zhn> u'll get us taxes as well i think xd
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i will pay taxes in spain
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i were to get 300k per year i would pay 40% irpf
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> it would get me 15k net per month
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its crazy
11:56 < bridge> <zhn> income tax i mean
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what does tc mean
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i love my internet
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1331215911604195428/image.png?ex=6790ceee&is=678f7d6e&hm=d4a5a70600531553de6b39374e1844ad16271c1cc85725804cea8c580d69e8ae&
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> total compensation
11:56 < bridge> <zhn> telecursor
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> so the 500k isnt all salary
11:56 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its probs stocks and other stuff
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> make sense
11:57 < bridge> <avolicious> Ask for 1M just because you like fluid numbers
11:57 < bridge> <avolicious> 1_000_000 looks better than 500_000
11:57 < bridge> <zhn> ask calculated salary like (500k * temperature in spain in celcius)
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The US-Spain income tax treaty is a vital tool for taxpayers who have financial interests or earn income in both the United States and Spain. This treaty plays a crucial role in preventing double taxation, ensuring that individuals and businesses are not taxed on the same income by both countries.
11:58 < bridge> <avolicious> :feelsbossman:
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks like spain has a tax treaty
11:58 < bridge> <zhn> nice
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> my tc **was** 34k usd
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> my tc right now is like 55k i think
11:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, see for example https://www.levels.fyi/leaderboard/Software-Engineer/Senior-Engineer/country/United-States/
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats crazy
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how much is base salary
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh it says there
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 190k base
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 300k stocks
12:00 < bridge> <oxyzo.> telecursor costs 500k$???:poggers2:
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the url
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so most is stocks
12:01 < bridge> <avolicious> only in US
12:01 < bridge> <avolicious> in europe telecursor is much cheaper
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is telecursor?
12:01 < bridge> <avolicious> :pepeHappy:
12:01 < bridge> <avolicious> tc = telecursor
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah xd
12:02 < bridge> <zhn> get tced
12:02 < bridge> <zhn> my tc is probably -$100
12:03 < bridge> <avolicious> 499.900? got a discount, huh?
12:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> tced iea
12:03 < bridge> <zhn> compensating in negative :troll:
12:03 < bridge> <avolicious> they sent you the telecursor +100 USD?
12:39 < bridge> <louis> ive never heard of this for a remote compiler engineer
12:40 < bridge> <louis> maybe for meta phd ML engineer
12:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @louis.place u live in texas right
13:01 < bridge> <louis> used to
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://x.com/Acyn/status/1881513509680505199
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:26 < bridge> <zhn> yawhoo
15:48 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> In my physical area it probably won‚Äôt go above $350
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> but it doesn‚Äôt mean much because remote work exists
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> you will just have to flip your sleep schedule on its head if there‚Äôs no European offices
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i don‚Äôt think with that salary you‚Äôd get to be super hands off
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> or with that compensation that is
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> you will just have to flip your sleep schedule on its head if there‚Äôs no European office
15:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i don‚Äôt think with that salary you‚Äôd get to be super hands off as far as meetings & things go but idk
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah xd i wont believe it till the end
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> they probs expect more from me than what i know rn idk
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe not, since they know im european, idk
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah but that time boundary is more of a reason to just not hire you
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> then why they contact me
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> oh idk
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think there is lot of ppl that work in compilers
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn‚Äôt see that part
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the bonus of niche stuff
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
15:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess if they know that & they still reached out then they think it might work
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> the hr guy even proposed the meeting using gmt timezone
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> im gmt+1 tho
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah, i thought this was something you found online. i wouldn‚Äôt be worried timezones in that case
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well im pretty good at my current job so im not crazy about it
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah, i thought this was something you found online. i wouldn‚Äôt be worried timezones in this case
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> they reached out to me by email
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i went back and read that part
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> good luck, whatever you do
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if it works its nice of not i move on
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i get it ill donate 1k to ddnet
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> xdd awesome
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1331280426630647943/image.png?ex=67910b03&is=678fb983&hm=000e1e263ad7cb4ddd5f740ad7963bde4bdb09a297ce37616bcd23f389a07a3a&
16:45 < bridge> <Sans> How would I create an interval once I connect to a server?
16:45 < bridge> <zhn> create what
16:46 < bridge> <Sans> Basically, once I'm connected to a server, every some amount of time I want to run a function
16:46 < bridge> <Sans> in ts/js, you'd do something like that with an interval
16:46 < bridge> <zhn> from client side?
16:46 < bridge> <Sans> idk the cpp equivalent
16:46 < bridge> <Sans> yeah
16:47 < bridge> <zhn> you have to add `m_SomethingTick` somewhere accessible and check it on every tick (that's how you do it on server side, does client have OnTick function too?)
16:47 < bridge> <Sans> lemme check
16:47 < bridge> <Sans> doesnt look like it
16:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> modulus operator might work here
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> something like m_MyTick % 60 == 0
16:50 < bridge> <Sans> how would I check if the client is connected to a server?
16:50 < bridge> <zhn> by client state
16:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
16:50 < bridge> <zhn> ctrl+f `CLIENTSTATE`
16:50 < bridge> <Sans> ah found it
16:50 < bridge> <zhn> instead of ticks you'll probably have to stick to OnRender (or similar) function and fetch delta time with `time()` function
16:51 < bridge> <zhn> ah wait this one is from 0.5 src xd
16:52 < bridge> <zhn> it's just `STATE_`
16:52 < bridge> <Sans> Can I use Client::Run?
16:52 < bridge> <Sans> for that
16:52 < bridge> <zhn> for what?
16:52 < bridge> <Sans> .
16:53 < bridge> <Sans> Can I use CClient::Run?
16:53 < bridge> <zhn> it's entrypoint of client, why would you want to check it there
16:53 < bridge> <Sans> im not sure where else
16:53 < bridge> <zhn> what you want to do in first place
16:53 < bridge> <zhn> shady fetch points of player? xd
16:53 < bridge> <Sans> .
16:54 < bridge> <Sans> not really lol
16:54 < bridge> <zhn> create new component and do it there
16:54 < bridge> <Sans> The idea is to run some F1 commands every 60s or so
16:54 < bridge> <zhn> you'll have to check it in main thread with if statement anyway
16:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no hacks
16:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> how dare you
16:54 < bridge> <Sans> yeah, ddnet mod creating cheats :Bruh:
16:54 < bridge> <Sans> smh
17:59 < bridge> <karxnn1> help
17:59 < bridge> <karxnn1> pls help mod
18:35 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 could you review #9160?

19:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> Hot
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that the reason compiling on msys is so hard:
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://stackoverflow.com/a/60798994
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs we don't default msys to `TARGET_OS "windows"`
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i currently tried to fix the fng2 CI and was going crazy why it didnt find a missing library xD
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's so random that mingw-cmake is smth completely different than msys cmake but they are both in same PATH
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> changing to  `if((CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Windows") OR (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "MSYS"))` indeed fixed it
22:19 < bridge> <APFFF> The new spectate utilities are AWESOME! Big ups to whoever made them!
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> you might just be using it wrong
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> mingw-cmake is not a thing you should need to specify
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> if you‚Äôre using the environments correctly then your toolchain‚Äôs version of said tool will be in the PATH
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> so if you have msys cmake installed, but not e.g. ucrt64 cmake, it‚Äôll fall back to the former even in the ucrt shell & break things dramatically
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but why should it fail like that
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not patch the cmake to allow msys too
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the msys env/shell are for compiling codebases making use of linux APIs (sys/*.h and whatnot)
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> they are compiled against the msys runtime which is based on cygwin, there‚Äôs a lot of emulation logic in place
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that has runtime overhead?
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of targeting windows it‚Äôs targeting linux codepaths under a windows compatibility layer. this is how the env itself is developed
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yes, that‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt use the MSYS shell for anything that doesn‚Äôt need it
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> UCRT64 is the same as MSYS64 but it links against a runtime which is virtually guaranteed to be installed on all windows machines nowadays
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> so you don‚Äôt even have the added overhead of shipping the msvc runtime
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just hate that when using the mingw shell, i cannot just pacman -S cmake
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but have to use some mingw prefix
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> use pacboy
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it detects
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> pacman -S pactoys
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> pacboy -S cmake -> mingw-w64-x86_64-ucrt-cmakr
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> or w/e
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> using ucrt env should be drop in for you btw
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs recommended over mingw64 envs
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs recommended over mingw64 env
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want as few windows as possible üò¨
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt ucrt with windows libs
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > UCRT (Universal C Runtime) is a newer version which is also used by Microsoft Visual Studio by default. It should work and behave as if the code was compiled with MSVC.
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> why is that bad?
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs calling convention and not much else
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs just about linkage
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs basically the closest thing window has to a shared runtime
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs basically the closest thing windows has to a shared runtime
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> just wanna be clear here the alternative is MSVCRT
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> read: microsoft visual studio 2015 c++ redistributable
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> you either ship the DLLs or ask the user to install it
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> so i think it‚Äôs a win
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd have thought the alternative is static linking xd
23:11 < bridge> <Ewan> you could
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> make a huge executable for no reason
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that only really has benefits on linuxes imo where api stability is actually a concern across c runtime versions
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like that yeah..
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no but srsly, i have no idea how mingw works. i assume it does kernel calls and for runtime uses stdlibc++
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> libstdc++ = GCC STL
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> libc++ = clang STL
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you can use either depending on ur compiler or flags
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> the runtime is required for windows to make sense of C functions
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs C on windows was sort of an afterthought
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> the C++ logic usually works above that
