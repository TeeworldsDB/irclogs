00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> If u know c u can use it in c++ code
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> hello developers, who can say me how use cmake in console (cmd)?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> @Dev
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With MSVC or MinGW?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> MinGW
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did you get mingw? with msys2?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> idk i was donwload ddnet source xD and i need compile .exe but idk how xD i was all time use bam but i see here is news
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> idk i was download ddnet source xD and i need compile .exe but idk how xD i was all time use bam but i see here is news
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you don't even have mingw yet
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> so what i have ?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to know it's not my computer 😄
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> xd
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> so can u  say how compile ddnet.exe ?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe you were using MSVC with bam?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> huh sec
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The easiest way would be to follow heinrich's tutorial on the forum, it uses visual studio and it's dead simple
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> can u send links pls
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=5765
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In console it depends on your compiler, with msys2 you want to make sure you get the mingw version of cmake, with the original msys it all just works, with msvs you can generate a visual studio project with `-G "Visual Studio <whateverversionyouhave>`, or an nmake file with `-G "NMake Makefiles"`.
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A cmake build looks like `mkdir build` `cd build` `cmake -G "Whatever Generator you choose" ..` `cmake --build`
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> ```C:\Users\patry\Desktop\~Wszystko~\1. Teeworlds-Mod\10. DDnet-Master``` xd
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> wa
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> aw
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> ```'cmake' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> operable program or batch file.```
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you even have cmake?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> https://prnt.sc/sx63l3
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's our cmake folder, containing our cmake scripts
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not cmake itself
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> yes is ddnet  cmake
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cmake.org/download/
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> i need download it
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> ?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, get the latest release 3.17 I think
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> @Learath2  yes and what now
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> https://prnt.sc/sx6gg5
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why did you download the source of cmake??
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is an installer right there

14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> kk
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> @Learath2  is possible change cmake to baam?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> huh
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> what now if i download this
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still don't know what compiler you are using
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides, why are you compiling this from scratch anyway?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gtg, have things to do, figure out what compiler you have, use cmake gui to generate the correct format and hit build
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao does synchronized work differently since the warmup timer change?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/720254792391458856/unknown.png
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> what can i do so i can enter on my server
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> run ddnet client and check lan tab
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or just enter localhost as the ip and connect
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> i get an error
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> at final
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> [2020-06-10 15:52:25][filescore]: opening 'records/Kobra 4_record.dtb' for reading failed
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> this is the error i get
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is just relevant for ranks
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you checked the LAN tab?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> da
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> yes
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> what do i need to do?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> what do i need to do now?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try connecting to "localhost"
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> wdym? to write at search localhost?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> im new at starting a server and these thing
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> into the "Host address" field
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then press enter
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> is only saying connecting to localhost
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you changed the `sv_port`?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> ummm
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> where i can change it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if not, that's good
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you have the black window with the server open but still can't connect to `localhost` in ddnet?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/720272983113072650/unknown.png
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> all the things i see
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and while this black window is still open, can you connect to localhost?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> wdym? to write localhost in the ip box
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> nope
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> i  cant connect
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still keep the server window open?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> yes
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> wait...... ur the owner of ddnet?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand what happens
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that a remote terminal?
16:28 <+corneum> @deen would you give fixing the bullet tunes another try? i found another thing that makes it impossible to map with 
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 it changed yes
17:18 <@deen> corneum: nope :/
17:18 <+corneum> bruh
17:20 <+corneum> how about only that other thing i found? it crashes the server so you dont have to fiddle with physics or anything
17:30 <+corneum> and what does the tune "laser_damage" do in ddrace?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pipou I guess the change is expected then
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/tree/dd_pr_07
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This turned out ugly beyond my dreams, but it's sorta working
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕀𝕠𝕟𝕦𝕥> @heinrich5991 nvm @GoJE GrEEN !  helped me
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whats it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That branch? A bridge server like the one @timakro and @fokkonaut are running
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it needs a lot more work to finish up but I'm all out of work
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is it better than fokos?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are 3 things remaining, whispers, map conversion to 0.7 and the ugliest of them all support for the new serverinfo
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao eeeeeeh, very debatable, I don't use any magic constants atleast, the entire 0.7 protocol is there for you to use
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> More likely to get feedback on a PR 😛
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go have a drink, it's been a very long day messing around with this cross protocol thing
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> looks good @Learath2
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Really cool work @Learath2. Easiest way to test would be to just run a few servers with it and see how it works
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> about the map conversion, maybe we just use my 0.7 map conversion executable and store both?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should ask @qshar how he did it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that just leaves the serverinfo remaining critical before testing this
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that's not very trivial as the 0.7 serverinfo is already broken 😄
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (can't fit 64 people in it)
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, didn't know they also have something like that
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen If you see any way to do `void *CGameContext::PreProcessMsg(int *MsgID, CUnpacker *pUnpacker, int ClientID)` in a cleaner way lmk, I feel it's very meh and this is like my 10th attempt at handling this
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 what map conversion do we need
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly, I have absolutely no idea, but I know both qshar and timakro are converting their maps
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems like it works even without a conversion for me but @deen would probably know a difference between the formats given he wrote the converter
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you could also use the skin converter
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its p nice
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already got the skin converter
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> works pretty well actually 😄
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isnt deens map converter just embedding all tilesets
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried to turn that array into an unordered_map and it was so ugly I did a `git reset --hard HEAD` went to sleep and started again today
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao ah I think that's it, the tilesets
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 clients don't have any of our tilesets and I bet they have updated versions of the old ones so we'd need to embed for them
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> optimally we shouldnt embed 0.7 tilesets i guess
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we probably shouldn't touch anything 0.7
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can check if every pixel is the same 😁
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just embed our tilesets and ship that map to 0.7 clients and ship the old one to 0.6 clients
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wondered whether we could do this dynamically so as to not double our storage use for maps
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shouldn't actually be too too hard
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how big is our map folder
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> big enough not to double? 😄
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll check
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 759M
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean not horrible but it is preeeeettty redundant 😄
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> thats not big
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but it'd be like an extra 800M that has no information
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually we might be tighter on CPU cycles then on storage so maybe we actually should pregenerate these
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> our 2 core servers are just 😦
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> smaller than my biggest map
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/720326758653624401/unknown.png
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what kinda exploit is that map attempting?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> map RCE?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> just uncompressed map :troll:
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> map was 60MB with default compression but it took a while to load
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> so i thought 0 compression would help it load faster
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u save ur porn folder inside the map
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> no
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Learath2 I used deen's map converter tool for it. 
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I made a simple bash script that executes it for every new map and on map update.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> and we have 2 directories: maps and maps07
19:40 <+ZillyHuhn> @Learath2 would be really awesome if you could add support for greensward skin <3 so if one uses greensward as body in 0.7 people see greensward skin in 0.6 like in fddr
19:41 <+ZillyHuhn> I stopped playing on kog and unique bridge servers because i couldnt handle 0.6 people trashtalking me about using another skin :/
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can extend the mapping but I would love to have an unordered map before
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the lookup doesnt get expensive
19:53 <+ZillyHuhn> @Learath2 https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/issues/6#issuecomment-634084143
19:53 <+ZillyHuhn> sorry for the push :/ but my life depends on that feature :D
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbh my intention with this is to keep ddnet relevant until I can come up with a nice ddnet7
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which all depends on gamecontroller getting cleaned up
20:26 <+ZillyHuhn> yes and that is what i am afraight of.
20:26 <+ZillyHuhn> Forcing 0.7 players to play on bridge servers with disatvantages like qshar did.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are few disadvantages, but atleast it keeps the community together
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 does it have teehistorian integration or do I need to add it?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it shouldwork(tm) but it'd be nice if you could evaluate it see if anything else needs to be saved
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I save the entire packed message before any translation so that should be fine
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we might want to store whether a client is sixup
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes we do
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think damage indicators are sadly gone
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> dune nuked them with his patch removing the ability to control direction from the server
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nor can we control the duration they show up for, I was thinking of manipulating the start position by sending very short ones to move the stars along
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we can still have them for freeze though
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but idk what we'll do with the gun
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh also effects self insert so that'll be extra fun
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> self insert?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought they were inserting themselves into the gameworld like entities, but apparently not so there is a place to translate them semi easily
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, this works over LAN but doesn't over internet
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know whether anything is different about the protocol when connecting over LAN?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what works over internet but not lan?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The connection
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The server doesn't seem to respond to the initial NETMSG_INFO
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well no even before that actually
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what was the name of that 520byte packet we send?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> did you remember to open port
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             udp dpt:8303`
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `NET_CTRLMSG_TOKEN`
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> guess there are no free lunches, I'll debug it
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't really know, sorry
21:57 <+Learath2> yeah I was just hoping
22:05 <+Learath2> amazing, I get a packet full of 0s
22:05 <+Learath2> god knows at which layer the data is lost
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mostly 0s is correct for the token packet
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has 5 bytes that are set IIRC
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how this packet ends up completely empty
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After I UnpackPacket I can print out it's contents and they are there
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> inside OnSixupCtrlMsg it's completely empty
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gdb?
22:16 <+Learath2> yeah setting up watchpoints
22:20 <+Learath2> magic
22:23 <+Learath2> oh, the buffer of the recvunpacker is empty
22:24 <+Learath2> uh, i wonder if it's the recvmmsg patch
22:25 <+Learath2> yep
22:25 <+Learath2> I was bamboozled, it wasn't a LAN vs internet thing, it was a macOS vs linux thing
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What is bamboozled
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> XDDDDD
22:28 <+Learath2> hoodwinked
22:28 <+Learath2> fooled
22:28 <+Learath2> deceived
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law you can give it a go now
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I will try :)
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chat is still broken but that's an issue for tomorrow's learath2
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> it works!
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Good job!
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> But it feels a bit laggy
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> or its my inet
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Idk
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have absolutely no way to know how it performs, my computer can't run teeworlds so I cant check
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Freeze stars are amazing!
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Nice one :D
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thy
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are soooooo hacked in there 😄
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Wait
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Your computer can't run tw?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> the fuck
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macbooks are very high quality
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Time to buy a good computer ;)
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can fry an egg on the keyboard while teeworlds is running
