00:00 <+ChillerDragon> btw jopstars command deletes your code o.O so be careful
00:17 < bridge> <Voxel> oh ok
00:17 < bridge> <Voxel> thanks
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> ```$ git push -u remote main
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> fatal: 'remote' does not appear to be a git repository
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> 
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> and the repository exists.```
00:21 < bridge> <Voxel> sorry im stupid
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> git remote add <name> <url>
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> git push -u <name> <branch>
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> so git remote add upstream https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> got push -u upstream main
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> so git remote add upstream <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet>
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> got push -u upstream main
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> or something
00:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea the default remote is usually called `origin` but idk wat u wanna do 
00:28 <+ChillerDragon> or how your remotes are setup
00:41 < bridge> <deen> Too late, just order 50 yourself 😄
00:54 < bridge> <Voxel> ohhh ok
00:56 < bridge> <Voxel> ```$ git remote add svg_emotes https://github.com/VoxelDoesCode/ddnet-data-svg  
00:56 < bridge> <Voxel> $ git push -u svg_emotes main
00:56 < bridge> <Voxel> Everything up-to-date
00:56 < bridge> <Voxel> branch 'main' set up to track 'svg_emotes/main'.```
00:58 < bridge> <Voxel> and nothing changee
00:58 < bridge> <Voxel> and nothing changed
01:26 < bridge> <Ewan> do you have local changes you are expecting to push
01:29 < bridge> <Voxel> i mean im going to squash a bunch of commits and make one change
01:29 < bridge> <Ewan> what did you expect to change if you have not yet added the commits
01:30 < bridge> <Voxel> what
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> you say nothing changed
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what u expect
01:30 < bridge> <Voxel> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/pull/33 
01:30 < bridge> <Voxel> for the branch of this to change
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think you can change the source branch without a new pull request
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> why not push to main
01:32 < bridge> <Voxel> that **IS** main
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah it is main
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> so why do you need a new remote. i am so very confused
01:32 < bridge> <Voxel> so i can squash all the useless commits
01:33 < bridge> <Voxel> i dont think i can do that on main
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> you can do like this
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> git remote add upstream https://github.com/voxeldoescode/ddnet-data-svg
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> git fetch upstream
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> git reset --soft e0bf8409f95276708d0422545b01cd9a5de78843
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> this keeps your changes but removes all commits since  Add files via upload
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> then you can make add & commit --amend and force push
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> then you can add & commit --amend and force push
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno if you even need the upstream stuff if that commit is already fetched
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> which it should be if your remote is correct
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> though i'd just keep the commits lol
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> and ask whoever merges to just select squash and commit
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel you want to edit your pending pr and bundle all commits in one?
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel then do not create a new branch edit your current branch which is `main` you missed the whole branch thing you can do it next time
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel i took the liberty to do it for you is this what you wanted? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/pull/33
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> you could have just done it at the time of merge but hey if it works it works
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1091278441065762927/image.png
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> yea but then he doesnt see the result :) also i added the changes jopstar requested
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd fakin jopstar no chills mergin it in before poor voxelino can react
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he can still react
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> today i woke up and i dreamt of pointers
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk why
11:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pointer arithmetic xd
11:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im down bad
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cool dreams
11:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Your brain yearns for the C. You are getting bored of safe rust
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean u have pointers in rust
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its probs more related to me implementing a enum in llvm
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest: unsafe tagged unions
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its ok ryo
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u team up with learath and make c great again
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :stop:
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i take your place and do the rust propaganda now
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xDD
11:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Programming wasn't meant to be this safe. Discard novelty, return to C
11:53 < bridge> <Ewan> 🫃
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> someone with rx 6xxx on windows?
12:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen could you consider naming the tags and urls with a _ instead of - for release candidates?
12:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my reason is that anything with a "-" after the version is used for package revisions
12:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so 16.9_rc2 is better than 16.9-rc2, because 16.9-xx is used by package build systems for the build script revisions
12:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> check out https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/file-format/index.html
12:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure pacman does the same
12:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well maybe it doesnt matter i can replace  _ with in my ebuild xd
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> The twnet python parser reached it first presentable state poggies! Thanks @Ryozuki for the huffman code and thanks @heinrich5991 for the protocol as json https://ascii.zillyhuhn.com/?a=twnet also fyi @Swarfey
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> `pip install twnet_parser` :rocket:
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/variables/index.html#version-and-name-formatting-issues
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm i found this
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does it even work
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the huffman
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> yes
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol nice
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt do very intensive testing but so far all packets sent by vanilla tw servers decompressed to the expected values
12:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my rust crate?
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> na TeeAI py code
12:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ok
12:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah that should work
13:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm it has problems cuz the unzipped file has the old name kek
13:16 < bridge> <Swarfey> ChillerDragon: Wowo U doing big progress, maybe i join in sometime when we start with the actual client then instead xd
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cannot believe it.
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I had low fps with vk with current driver... didn't find any solution.
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Went to secure mode for windows, uninstalled driver with DDU-tool.
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Installed the same latest driver again:
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fixed
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is stuff like this happening on windows
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> please someone explain
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i 100% chcked ingame and outside that the latest driver is used
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cannot believe it.
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I had low fps with vk with current driver... didn't find any solution.
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Went to safe mode for windows, uninstalled driver with DDU-tool.
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Installed the same latest driver again:
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fixed
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also used 100% same client config, so its not related to that
13:50 < bridge> <Learath2> Failed driver update?
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no surprise windows sucks
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100% checked if its latest driver
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the update did not fail, it defs used the said driver even ingame
13:53 < bridge> <Learath2> I meant as in you ended up with a combination of a new driver blob but say the settings failed to upgrade?
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have no idea, but what can go so wrong that the driver itself works, but it has less FPS?
13:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Idk, this kind of insane behaviour is rarely explanable 😄
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that makes no sense xDD
13:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe a backwards compatibility setting?
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i mean much less FPS, 2k FPS vs 100 FPS XD
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, but who would want this kind of compability, it was also on vulkan
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is the nature of closed source and non gpl software, it doesnt ensure ur right to investigate and fix the issue, and if u fixed the issue it would help others fix the issue
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but since u use non-gpl software thats what u get
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it must be some insanely bizzare setting, which i did not change manually
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yes today i woke up with stallman in bed
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
13:56 < bridge> <Learath2> It's just a wild guess for the wild issue
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cl_enable_bitcoin_miner 1
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i have a question
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> usually schools
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and unis
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tend to be shitty with this
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do they enforce  a license on programs you hand in
13:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Iii don't know
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Why do I need a university disclaimer?
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> If you are a student, universities can claim your work! Even if the work is not directly related to your studies, a university can make such a claim. Unfortunately, some universities are overly eager to capitalize on the work of their students, so we must be extra careful. The best way to avoid any problems and keep the GNU Project legally sound is to have your university sign a disclaimer, like we do with employers as explained above.
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.fsf.org/licensing/contributor-faq
13:58 < bridge> <Learath2> I remember a clause in the student handbook that allowed you to keep your thesis secret if you are getting a patent for it. So I guess atleast that you can keep the rjghts on

14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i love
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the first  comment
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it says
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> [chatgpt translation]
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fcking hell XD
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://nim-lang.org//blog/2023/03/31/version-20-rc2.html
14:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/ifduyue/musl/blob/master/src/math/__cos.c
14:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look at this
14:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > This is a faster implementation of cosine that utilises six static const double variables (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) to speed things up. These variables represent the coefficients of a polynomial approximation for the cosine function.
14:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, isn't it just a taylor series approximation?
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye xd
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35381968
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think
14:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh, so not taylor series, but chebyshev series. Way beyond my math level
14:30 < bridge> <Voxel> @ChillerDragon I was sleeping but thanks!
14:36 < bridge> <Teero> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC
14:36 < bridge> <Teero> this is also cool
14:36 < bridge> <Teero> this is also cool 😎
15:29 < bridge> <bencie> lmao
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> biggest troll
15:36 < bridge> <Faulty> what is his timezone? perhaps it's already April 1st?)
15:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmfao
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the best is he tries to say how to securely store a pass
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if ur pedantic, a hash is wrong
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it needs to be a slow hash
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> md5 is a hash too after all
16:05 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://tenor.com/view/among-us-gta-kick-gassed-up-shawty-gif-20088902
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> amazing did github go fully down now?
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> not even 500s? xd
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1680271629.png
16:09 < bridge> <Teero> Works for me 🤷‍♂️
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> yea it back i also only had 3 of those in a row still amazing this is the only website that keeps crashing on me and it never happend when ms didnt own it yet xd
16:20 < bridge> <Voxel> so im going to try and like, make an svg of another thing
16:21 < bridge> <Voxel> this time properly
16:23 < bridge> <mind> @Voxel your emoticons.svg still has the emoticions.png embedded (it's set as hidden).
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah chillerdragon has a check for that
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should get it in after emoticons are fixed
16:25 < bridge> <Voxel> i'll fix that when i get home
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ rebase what? the branch can be merged wout conflicts
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no bcs there is another svg with image embedded, ofc the check fails until that is resolved
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wrote it after mind fixed his svgs, while i didnt know then that there is another SVG with img
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> so u want a force push to trigger the CI or what?
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> `[-] ERROR: embedded image found ./emoticons.svg`
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> !
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i want the CI fixed.. after mind fixed his img, i thought: nice, now we can merge ur check
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so all future SVGs have this check
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but sadly emoticon is also broken
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i wrote the msg before i knew that
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> you are making half sense to me :D
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rebase answer
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mind fixed -> i wrote, chillerdragon pls rebase, so check is green -> emote broken -> rebase would not make check green
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so wait for emote
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u still dont get it please insert 50 cents to try again
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea that part i got
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont want to merge your pr until we sure all green, else all new PRs are red
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt get why you responded with "no" when i asked if you want the rebase to trigger the CI because thats exactly what you want xd
18:42 <+ChillerDragon> yeye that makes sense
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes but obviously i wanted it to be green
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i'd knew it gets red anyway... i wouldnt ask xD
18:42 <+ChillerDragon> i thought ud ask because you wanted my two commits squashed
18:42 <+ChillerDragon> so thats why i asked
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> q
18:43 < bridge> <Teero> is the HookFireSpeed just the amount of "pixels" the hook is traveling per tick?
18:43 < bridge> <Souly> lmao
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> soli
18:43 < bridge> <Souly> chillerdragay:

19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mind new acc, or renamed ur github? xd
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> guess renamed
20:11 < bridge> <Chairn> wtf, that's plain wrong at least in France
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> ?
20:11 < bridge> <Chairn> however, it is true for private companies...
20:12 < bridge> <k2d222> nop, true in france too
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> yo k2!
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> wats poppin?
20:12 < bridge> <Chairn> that's old 70's way compared to what Ryo posted
20:13 < bridge> <k2d222> hey yo! hanging around
20:13 < bridge> <Chairn> source/link?
20:13 < bridge> <Chairn> i believe, there is authorship granted automatically
20:14 < bridge> <k2d222> law course last year, though they said it was the school policy to not claim student work
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> u lawyer?
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> like jopster?
20:15 < bridge> <k2d222> no way im studiying computer science but i have soft skills course as well
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> law = soft skill
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> :troll:
20:15 < bridge> <Chairn> uh, github notification broken?

20:15 < bridge> <Chairn> 1-0 of 1 😄 ?
20:16 < bridge> <k2d222> no XD but it's introductory level, they basically taught us how not to be bullshited by companiees
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> nice
20:17 < bridge> <k2d222> pretty useful course yes 😁
20:33 < bridge> <k2d222> I can't find a solid source, but it looks like i was wrong
