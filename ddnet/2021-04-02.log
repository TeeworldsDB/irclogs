02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe add /afk where u can manuall set ur tee to afk in case u want to stay on a server but let other ppl pass mapvotes
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or use `afk` command in F1 like i do
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :troll:
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> souli-bot-ux
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! Foxi Tee> Ddnet is open source?
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Yes
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! Foxi Tee> :feelsamazingman:
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! Foxi Tee> :flag_unk:
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Souly should i add auto vote yes in afk mode? :D
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> would be cool
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> mostly because it wasn't all that important to me and you wanted it a lot
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that about sums up most of my arguments with people passionate about their languages
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> What do you guys think about replacing the current time displayed in scoreboard in demos with the time from the demo? Or display the current timestamp somewhere in the demo hud? I mean the demo it self has a timestamp but doing math is so hard :D
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Hi guys did anything change on Ger1 ?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i have lags every few seconds
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> can you explain to me why my game is running very smooth with desktop fullscreen mode
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> can you explain to me why my game is running very smooth with desktop full screen mode
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs its like fullscreen, just that it automatically selects the correct resolution and video mode for you
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fullscreen generally runs better, bcs then the window compisitor isnt active
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is especially a problem with windows, since it doesnt integrate opengl so well
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fullscreen generally runs better, bcs then the window compositor isnt active
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> however, we have to remove that option again, bcs there is some weirdness with windowed fullscreen under windows, which i cannot explain, bcs it seems to be dependend of debug and release mode
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> until this update came out, my game seemed to lag in comparison with this smoothness
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did you run fullscreen before?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> yes
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhhh strange
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> don`t remove pls
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> xDD
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> leave it for me
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i could just remove the windowed fullscreen
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe we could even set desktop fullscreen to default value
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh but SDL's documentation on that is too light to be sure what actually happens
