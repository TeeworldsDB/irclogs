13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> feeling like coding for ddnet today
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what to do
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i updated gentoo ddnet
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i missed it for some days sadly
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh no, firefox and nodejs update

14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @deen is there a way to download all ddnet skins via url
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a zip file is ok
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the browser uses js shenanigans
14:27 < bridge_> <deen> Looks like we are generating the zip in javascript nowadays, @jupeyy_keks changed that I think
14:27 < bridge_> <deen> So I think there is no good api to get them  all, why do you require them?
14:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://assets.ddstats.org/skins/
14:30 < bridge_> <deen> Does this work for you? https://ddnet.org/skins/skin/
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i downloaded it manually this time
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its hard to notice new skins and automate this i guess
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also the generated zip doesnt keep dates sadly
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> does anyone know if skins.tw provides a dump of all skins

17:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how can one make their TLD
17:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> .ddnet
17:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
17:20 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat is this a ddnet snap? DDNet extended the snap with non vanilla snap items. Type 0 and high ids usually indicates those.
17:24 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat in your screenshot https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1141641200105951283/image.png you can see the ids are high and the type is zero
17:24 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2e1157bf3f986d975ef1f49c8bf0dca972f1baf6/src/engine/shared/snapshot.cpp#L80
17:25 < ChillerDragon> that matches this if statement and ddnet handles it as a snapshot item extension
17:25 < ChillerDragon> while the vanilla client will just drop the unknown id so its vanilla 0.6 compatible
17:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ok, thanks :D
18:00 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the way i read the code every ddnet extension message including game/sys/snap/teehistorian is unique and is based on the offset ``OFFSET_UUID = 1 << 16,`` which is 65536 so no ddnet ext snap obj has a id lower than that. Right?
18:01 < ChillerDragon> But then the client assuems every item with the id ``OFFSET_UUID_TYPE`` or higher to be a ddnet extension snap item. But its set to ``0x4000`` which is only ``16384``
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i already told ya we have a json with all skin names
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/skins.json
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> parse that and u can download all
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye but that requires scripting
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway i made a wget ripgrep command to parse the index html
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im smort

18:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> on cccamp everyone can speak english
18:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> step 1, have 100,000â‚¬, I think
18:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :monkaStop:
18:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the IDs are internal only, they're never exposed to the network. and they can change without notice
18:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the IDs used in the snap are unrelated to the IDs used in the clinet
18:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they're generated on demand
18:37 < ChillerDragon> What does demand mean? The way i understood they are generated on compile time and put all together in a big enum using includes starting from offset 65536
18:38 < ChillerDragon> and then these ids are actually put in the snap as you can see in milkeeycat's screenshot
18:38 < ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1141641200105951283/image.png
18:39 < ChillerDragon> hm oh no they start with a 3 so i messed something up
18:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the IDs in the snapshot are unrelated to the source code constants, ChillerDragon
18:46 < ChillerDragon> i see
18:46 < ChillerDragon> thanks
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777> hey im testing some serverside weapon mods. for example i want to make the grenade launcher shoot 10 grenades instead of 1 in 10 diffrent directions.
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777> the physics seem to work correctly but the visuals are bugged.
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777> i simply modified the grenade section in CCharacter::FireWeapon to this
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>     case WEAPON_GRENADE:
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>     {
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>         int Lifetime;
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>         if(!m_TuneZone)
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>             Lifetime = (int)(Server()->TickSpeed() * GameServer()->Tuning()->m_GrenadeLifetime);
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>         else
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>             Lifetime = (int)(Server()->TickSpeed() * GameServer()->TuningList()[m_TuneZone].m_GrenadeLifetime);
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777> 
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>         ```for(int i = -5; i < 5; ++i)
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>         {
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>             new CProjectile(
18:47 < bridge_> <teero777>                 GameWorld(),
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>                 WEAPON_GRENADE, // Type

18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>                 rotate(Direction, i), // Dir
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>                 Lifetime, // Span
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>                 false, // Freeze
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>                 true, // Explosive

18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>             );
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>             GameServer()->CreateSound(m_Pos, SOUND_GRENADE_FIRE, TeamMask());
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>         }
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777>     }```
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777> is there anything else neccessary to make the visuals work correctly? 
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777> currently it just looks like all grenades are in the same spot but as said before the physics work correctly.
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777> hey im testing some serverside weapon mods. for example i want to make the grenade launcher shoot 10 grenades instead of 1 in 10 diffrent directions.
18:48 < bridge_> <teero777> the physics seem to work correctly but the visuals are bugged.

18:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it's more desired than the best game
18:52 < ChillerDragon> woah thats big F

18:53 < ChillerDragon> i dont see the bug
18:53 < bridge_> <teero777> the grenades are supposed to spread outwards xd
18:53 < ChillerDragon> a
18:54 < ChillerDragon> bro is working on new vasten100 tune zone features
18:55 < bridge_> <teero777> xD

18:56 < bridge_> <teero777> https://youtu.be/IiwDJH4UMPs

18:57 < ChillerDragon> truely funny

18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 2 SPF (Seconds per frame)
18:57 < bridge_> <teero777> xDD
18:57 < ChillerDragon> hardware issue
18:58 < bridge_> <teero777> so does anyone have an idea why the visuals are wrong?
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> are there even grenades besides the visual one?
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> like did u tell the client
18:59 < ChillerDragon> jopsti i patched my haxclient with flecs i can render millions of eneitites without fps drops https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> explosions are unrelated to projectiles
19:00 < ChillerDragon> you put flecs in ddnet and it scales right up
19:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
19:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ryo is biggest ECS fan
19:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> probably bcs he never implemented it xD
19:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> dunno. how do you do the spread? is the value you changed sent across the network?
19:05 < bridge_> <teero777> ```for(int i = -5; i < 5; ++i)
19:05 < bridge_> <teero777>         {

19:05 < bridge_> <teero777>         }``` i litteraly just spawn 10 projectiles with differing directions
19:06 < bridge_> <teero777> i dunno if i have to to do anything extra
19:06 < bridge_> <teero777> ```for(int i = -5; i < 5; ++i)

19:18 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:18 < ChillerDragon> teeori
19:18 < ChillerDragon> i fixed
19:19 < ChillerDragon> ``rotate(MouseTarget, i)`` @teero777
19:19 < ChillerDragon> true vasten dev
19:20 < ChillerDragon> i assume trml uses some state of the art blockchain predicition alorithms that are llm enhanced and run on semi permemable supreme conductors that use your cursor to render the grenade independent off your current ping zone
19:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> ddnet blockchain support :pepeW:
19:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> that sounds so wrong
19:21 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1692292948.png
19:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> and whats next?
19:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> nfTees?
19:22 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:22 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm okay wtf why would that fix it xDD
19:22 < bridge_> <teero777> magic
19:22 < ChillerDragon> dude trml is another level
19:23 < ChillerDragon> legends say trml is working on a carrier pidgeon based protocol that is lag free from china to europe
19:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> i keep reading trml as tommorow

19:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i am trying to hack your opentube
19:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but sadly PHP is simply too secure
19:34 < ChillerDragon> the securest
19:34 < ChillerDragon> you got the code?
19:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/OpenTube/OpenTube
19:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> here you go
19:34 < ChillerDragon> leak
19:35 < ChillerDragon> i did expose all my credentials in the .env file for a while there :D
19:36 < ChillerDragon> so if you want some low hanging pentest fruits chiler software is always good start as asprining wannabe hax0r
19:36 < bridge_> <teero777> ah okay i was on an old version thats why it didnt work
19:38 < bridge_> <teero777> and now we are gonna make em bounce and not explode ;)
19:38 < ChillerDragon> use slime tunes
19:38 < bridge_> <teero777> slime tunes?
19:38 < ChillerDragon> idk
19:38 < ChillerDragon> didnt assa go all tune
19:38 < bridge_> <teero777> idk
19:38 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3136
19:39 < ChillerDragon> prolly wont work i talk out of my a**
19:40 < ChillerDragon> idk i never made nades bounce but if i would do it i would look into laser.cpp and see what they do to bounce
19:40 < bridge_> <teero777> i am rn
19:41 < ChillerDragon> you probably gotta call some collision stuff like MoveBox 
19:54 < ChillerDragon> holy shit google will nuke all accs that are inactive for 2 years?!
19:54 < ChillerDragon> thanos moment
19:54 < ChillerDragon> i will lose like a thousand accounts over night sadge
19:55 < bridge_> <teero777> wait a minute...
19:55 < bridge_> <teero777> the shotgun bug is an intended feature and not a bug?!?!?
19:55 < ChillerDragon> it used to be a bug
19:56 < ChillerDragon> it wasnt added intentionally
19:56 < bridge_> <teero777> haha

19:56 < ChillerDragon> yea known bugs become features
19:58 < bridge_> <teero777> is it the same for the horizontal speed bug?
19:58 < ChillerDragon> ye
19:58 < bridge_> <teero777> :(
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: for youtube too?
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> would probably free half of the internet storage space ðŸ˜‚
21:17 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There is account keep criteria such as money balance or YouTube account attached and similar. So I donâ€™t see YouTube videos getting deleted. Itâ€™s more wiping terabytes of spam emails sent to accounts of people that are dead or moved on to a new email.
21:17 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@jupeyy_keks)
21:18 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But itâ€™s intense they also delete the actual account and block it from reregister
21:19 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Means my club penguin account I registered with my first uwu6969@gmail.com email from 10 years ago is gone forever since password reset will never work
21:20 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> DEVELOPERS
21:20 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT ALL WRONG
21:20 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Output is supposed to by python files and input is supposed be txt files

21:21 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There has to be a job position called tech trol in hollywood
21:22 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And yes I made a photo with my phone of my TV â€¦ cancel me
21:24 < bridge_> <teero777> looool
21:24 < bridge_> <teero777> i just found a cool bug
21:26 < bridge_> <teero777> if you are on a server that crashes with a specific map then restarts with a diffrent map and you then connect your dummy you will be on the restarted server on a diffrent map but your entities are wrong then
21:31 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1141816531785891901/2023-08-17_21-29-54.mp4
21:37 < bridge_> <teero777> if you are on a server that crashes with a map then restarts with a diffrent map and you then connect your dummy you will be on the restarted server on a diffrent map but your entities are wrong then
21:38 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: or is this a feature?!
21:59 < bridge_> <zwelf2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1141823641294733353/IMG_20230817_215806.jpg
22:00 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> holy crap
22:00 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> tee's phone number leaked
22:01 < bridge_> <zwelf2> you can actually call me with that number on the camp. 8303 was already taken
22:03 < bridge_> <zwelf2> made by Patiga
22:03 < bridge_> <-StormAx> wait for interwiev from me
22:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i cant see text "this thing is not endorsed by rust foundation"
22:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i cant see "this thing is not endorsed by rust foundation"
22:30 < bridge_> <zwelf2> :justatest:
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> >rust inside
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> >ddnet is 1.5% rust out of 100
22:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1141831583964352612/image0.png
22:31 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Rust is just more efficient
22:32 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Takes up less space than c++
22:32 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So you don't have to waste your disk space
22:33 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Honestly we should rewrite whole ddnet in rust
22:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> rewrite in js :santatrollet:
22:35 < bridge_> <patiga> I think that makes some people more curious about the project :)
22:36 < bridge_> <patiga> one thing I think I should add to the poster is something descriptive for ddnet
22:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> i guess if you're trying to advertize it it might work
22:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> what has ryo done to yoy
22:37 < bridge_> <Voxel> what has ryo done to you
22:38 < bridge_> <swarfey> i'll help with that, the network stuff for the client is already done
22:38 < bridge_> <swarfey> :troll:
22:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nice, that seems to be a consistent method to reproduce #2804
22:47 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2804
22:51 < bridge_> <teero777> somehow the ddnet logo reminds me of that one meme template where there is a women sitting on a couch with 5 guys behind the couch ðŸ˜‚
23:13 < bridge_> <pilonpl> These tees look like they want something from you
23:18 < bridge_> <deen> oooh, cool
23:18 < bridge_> <deen> This might be saying more about you than about the DDNet logo ðŸ˜„
23:30 < bridge_> <teero777> ig my brain is damaged.
23:30 < bridge_> <teero777> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
