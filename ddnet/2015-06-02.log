13:10 <@deen> hi Savander 
13:12 < Savander> what's up?
13:15 <@deen> I see that you have submitted a map!
13:15 < Savander> yes
13:15 < Savander> and definitly is a map!
13:15 < Savander> or smth, i don't really sure
13:15 < Savander> o.O
13:16 <@deen> haha
13:16 <@deen> now you have to get saavik to test it :P
13:19 < Savander> i tested it with saavik before :C. but then she gone for a second, and when she went back, she said.. "I don't wants test your map now..., come play another maps :C"
13:19 < Savander> So its not possible at this moment! no way!
13:19 < Savander> xD
13:20 <@deen> haha
13:23 < Savander> You should look at this, and then tell me, if you like this map! I need your opinion o.O
13:24 < Savander> I don't accept denials.
13:31 <@deen> meh, i don't test maps :P
13:35 <@deen> and I'm afk now anyway
13:36 <@deen> but if you work with Soreu and Saavik, I'm sure it will be great =)
13:37 < Savander> i don't want from you, to test a map :D
13:37 < Savander> only opinion about look, haha
13:49 <@deen> graphics look really nice
13:49 <@deen> clear colors and still looks good
13:49 <@deen> maybe you forgot to dilate the logo
13:51 < Savander> probably
13:51 < Savander> i didn't do anything more 
13:51 < Savander> than photoshop
13:53 <@deen> run the dilate.exe over it as well
13:53 <@deen> that's necessary for all TW graphics
13:53 < Savander> i did it now
13:53 < Savander> btw, what dilate does?
17:40 < Savander> deen, http://www.savander.pl/img/46gRo94a8750
17:40 < Savander> wtf
17:42 < Savander> LOL
17:42 < Savander> all maps
17:42 < Savander> looks like this
17:46 < Savander> probably its bug in load some mapres?
17:46 < Savander> quads works but not tilesets
17:47 < Savander> (after restart all back to works)
18:02 < guenstig_werben> our sources are on github? are the infectionBlock sources also there?
18:17 <@deen> guenstig_werben: ddnet sources yes: https://github.com/def-/ddnet
18:17 <@deen> guenstig_werben: infectionBlock is not public. coffee just sends the source code to me because he doesn't want other people to run it =/
18:18 <@deen> Savander: very weird
18:19 <@deen> Savander: probably this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_%28morphology%29
18:19 <@deen> Savander: the source code of the dilate tool should be small, you can try reading it
18:20 <@deen> without dilate the borders of transparency look weird
18:34 < o_be_one> sup
