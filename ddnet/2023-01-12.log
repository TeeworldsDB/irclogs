02:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> is there a difference in the up between a veto vote and a yes/no vote?
02:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> is there a difference in the ui look between a veto vote and a yes/no vote?
02:17 <+bridge> <bencie> if a veto voter hasn't voted, the green bar flows over the middle section to the right where normally it would've already passed the vote
02:20 <+bridge> <bencie> but i guess that only tells you that atleast 1 veto voter hasnt voted, i believe no indication otherwise (veto no = instant vote fail, veto yes = same as others)
02:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> no i mean-
02:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> if its a veto vote why is there still a little tick in the middle

04:17 <+bridge> <noby> go for it
04:17 <+bridge> <noby> disclaimer: i had to make it in 20min when i was really high and they needed it for a bw tournament
04:18 <+bridge> <noby> but ill send you the executable if you want @Ryozuki
10:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Sure
11:05 <+bridge> <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks Do you know if some Vulkan changes caused IME problems in fullscreen? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/eventcomments/3757724418287109034/?tscn=1673492497
11:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On windows it never worked in Fullscreen
11:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He should just use windowed Fullscreen or tell Microsoft to finally fix this ridiculous limitation xd
11:10 <+bridge> <uwu> In the past you had to advise to set vulkan to 1-2 guys a day, now you advising to set opengl to 4-5 guys a day, was it rly worth it? :monkalaugh:
11:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tbh I feel like it went pretty well actually
11:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We had like 10 total reports?
11:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I expected more
11:13 <+bridge> <uwu> Btw is it possible to set default renderer depending on os? I feel like opengl runs better on windows and vulkan on linux
11:13 <+bridge> <uwu> :monkalaugh:
11:13 <+bridge> <cankick> :justatest:
11:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How so? Opengl has 1trillion problems on windows
11:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or do u mean performance wise
11:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But even there many ppl said they have far better frame times under windows
11:14 <+bridge> <uwu> I used opengl for 3 years and didnt have any issues except white textures on 2k skins lol
11:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What problem did u encounter with VK except Ur broken setup
11:17 <+bridge> <uwu> Let's look at others' problems as well, vulkan dont work with IME and fullscreen, it doesnt have that lazy loading thing that causes vram crashes
11:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ime also doesn't work with opengl
11:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If vram is out vram is out. Just because the driver has a workaround didn't change the fact that it's used incorrectly
11:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If we want to unload unused textures we need to change the higher level components. If u allocate 64gb ram and then wonder that the kernel struggles to swap the memory that also sounds like a workaround rather than a wanted feature
11:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least for games
11:23 <+bridge> <uwu> Many people would prefer 'incorrect' use of memory and working game instead of unoptimised but correct memory use
11:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I disagree strongly as developer tho. Nothing is more anoying than ppl complain about lags because of hidden features like this
11:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Almost impossible to test
11:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I agree that a crash sucks. But I'd prefer we actual fix these problems
11:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Instead of hiding them
11:26 <+bridge> <uwu> You are forcing people to use 'proper' vram management without fixing actual problems
11:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And u want to hide actual problems instead of fixing actual problems:)
11:28 <+bridge> <uwu> I appreciate fixing problems, but you prefer showing them first?
11:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To me it's not clear that the open gl drivers to under the hood
11:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So yes
11:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not even clear if all drivers do that
11:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And loading 100mb into vram can always create lags on hardware that is not designed for it
11:33 <+bridge> <uwu> That's user issue, if you didn't fix excessive vram usage and forcing user to vulkan that definitely cant smooth this issue with memory, that's weird
11:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And then he complains in #bugs
11:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway this is a endless spiral
11:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are pros and cons
11:35 <+bridge> <uwu> Yeah
11:36 <+bridge> <uwu> So when vram fixes are planned to release :troll:
11:42 <+bridge> <uwu> For example fokko's multi layer entities, you added feature that doubles the vram usage to make one feature in one mod work, fokko have fclient, clients that make more comfortable experience for one single mod is usual thing
11:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes I dislike that too
11:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But if u don't use high resolution textures it should: tm: not be a problem
12:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's technically not only for fokkonaut's mod but it is also the correct way to do it
12:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> The only way you could avoid it would be to explicitly say that changing entities ingame isn't allowed
12:16 <+bridge> <Learath2> I wouldn't really expect much change to the behaviour on running out of vram. We have byt one gfxguy. Unless you convince him that it'd be worth dropping some performance for it it's not happening
12:17 <+bridge> <Learath2> s\/byt/but/
12:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just like if stuff is predictable
12:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or do you suddenly like Ur browser using 2000tb ram without u understanding why
12:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I offer you to replace me with an ai that is better at testing and finding out random problems, then I can do holidays
12:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ?
12:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 1. what is multi layer entities?
12:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 2. F-Client is not made for F-DDrace. It's just a normal 0.7 client with (for me) the most important DDNet client functions.
12:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He means the ability to swap out entities on fly
12:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah, but that works for all mods
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it's not really nice
12:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> On fly you mean while being ingame?
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A mod should simply have a static size of supported tiles
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> While on server yes
12:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I didnt follow the conversation, what is the issue? :D
12:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Overlapping entities?
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We can either rebuild the tile map or the entities texture and that costs performance or vram
12:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
13:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> Let's just rebuild it? It's an edge case, performance being worse in an edge case isn't really that bad?
13:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes I was in favor of that. But can't remember Heinrichs argument against it
13:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or if fokko required hot swap
13:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, can't we rebuild it on the run?
13:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> It will lag but I don't think that's an issue with how fokkonaut uses it
13:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then it's fine. I still can't remember what are the arguments against this tho. But yeah depending on map size it might take a bit
13:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But even better would be to not needing a hack like this
13:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think the only sane reason to change entities whime ingame would be those minigame mods with many mods in one
13:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Isn't there a better solution
13:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't they use different layers
13:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> In that case changing the entities happens on a minigame change, so it shouldn't matter that there is a little loading lag
13:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway I have no time
13:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've been wanting to do this for decades. The game layer would be the vanilla layer and mods would have their own layers for their tiles, with uuids identifying them
13:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> for a decade*
13:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
13:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> One day
13:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But damn we build per layer rn anyway
13:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sucks hard
13:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> game@layers.ddnet.tw,  front@layers.ddnet.tw,  tele@layers.ddnet.tw, switch@layers.ddnet.tw
13:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tune layer with it one tile xdddd
13:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Worth it
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> email me at game@layers.ddnet.tw
14:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont even use ingame entities change on my server?
14:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @Jupeyy_Keks who said that
14:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I provide one set of entities which will be used in F-DDrace
14:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> That's the reason I remember we did the layers
14:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> What layers exactly... Lol
14:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ?
14:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't remember exactly what it was we did, but we had to render the entities overlay twice for some reason
14:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Never heard of that, and shouldnt be my cause :D
14:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Wait until j* gets back he can tell you what it was
14:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont do anything with entities nor do I swap them ingame
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U wanted entity masking
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS Ur mod required to show unsupported tiles
14:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah, well yea I mean thats a thing that will be required for any mod
14:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats based on ddnet
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And BCS our network code is slow and stupid we only know Ur mod onfly
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Iirc
14:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well I don't want to play any kind of blame game. But we need a better solution
14:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Oke xd
14:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It sucks that we always carry around stupid vanilla problems around with us xd
14:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> how is this vanilla problem
14:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It doesn't send a mod I'd first time u connect
14:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> Unsupported tiles?
14:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We use Gameinfo or smth
14:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ?
14:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are after the map is loaded
14:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ddnet client invalidates tiles that are not being used, these that cant be placed from editor with UNUSED button off
14:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> And therefore it didnt show any custom entities, iirc
14:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. if u join fng it shows ddrace tiles for short Moment
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> oh, yes, thats cuz the gameinfo tells the client which entities to use, yes
14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This was only solved by delaying the rendering
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Just wait a few snapshots and them start rendering
14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes and this info should be available at map load
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no
14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Everything else simply sucks
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i think it was made for dynamic changes
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> if some gamemode needa that
14:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> needs*
14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why would u want this instead of an own layer dedicated to what u need
14:50 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> idk, i dont use it anyways
14:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To me this is a bs solution but it's noones direct fault. Except that we desperately want to not improve net code
14:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> Can you tell me exactly what is happening?
14:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Connect
14:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Load map
14:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Get game into
14:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (Load map or change entities)
14:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Info
14:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> And the issue is that we don't know the gamemode before gameinfo. The entities overlay is built at map load. I follow you so far
14:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> Why do we double our vram usage due to this?
14:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> ("Double" i know it's not actually double. You know what I mean)
15:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good question. We have unmasked and mask entities
15:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I thought it's BCS of foxxos mos
15:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mod
15:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But apparently not
15:03 <+bridge> <Learath2> So wait, we don't delay the building of entities until the gameinfo arrives?
15:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In theory we do now
15:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it can be changed on fly
15:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway let's just remove it
15:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ok, then why do we need both masked and unmasked ones? If we get a new gameinfo with new entities, won't we just rebuild?
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't think so. But anyway this won't solve the problem anyway
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We don't double
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We multi by eight
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Before we changed the few affecting tiles that don't fit ddnet.png
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now we build one texture per layer
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But since Heinrich didn't want to rely on server browser info, like we did before
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It now sucks
15:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> Can't we just "merge" the texture as we go?
15:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> Or keep rendering onto one texture?
15:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We can merge almost all probably
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And we should do that xd
15:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> That would help a bit with the vram shortage, right?
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If someone uses high res entities yes
15:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> I haven't checked how large these textures we build are, but I can imagine them getting massive with the huge maps
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Question is ofc still. Why even use them xd
15:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> Or lower vram with a big map. Eitherway, is there any value to keeping all the layers as separate textures?
15:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How do u want to lower it?
15:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dynamic upload?
15:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> I meant as in low vram with big map
15:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> If someone doesnt have 4k entities but they have low vram and try to load a massive map, they might also run out, no?
15:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dunno create issue ask Heinrich
15:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's his idea, I only implemented it
15:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And back then I defs want thinking about this
15:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wasn't
15:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> Eh. I think I understand the issue mostly. I guess I'll just dig thru the logs when I get to italy to see what the original discussion was
15:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess idiomatic wise it's a nice solution
15:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 layer has 1 texture
15:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Overhead is simply too insane
15:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tune layer has literally 1 tile xddd
15:18 <+bridge> <RafaelFF> I'm would like to add an entry for `map_create_pixelart` tool in "Extra tools" page in DDNet Wiki, but I'm having hard to describe what it tries to accomplish due to my little knowledge of C++. Can someone explain it, add examples? All explanation I have is the PR that adds it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5766
15:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> What I don't understand is the benefit of keeping the textures separate. I don't remember what heinrich wanted exactly so I'll just have to dig
15:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least 1 tile has to be seperated
15:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS original entities have a collusin
15:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tile switch open I think
15:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> Collision? Wym, a tile on some other layer being at the same position as another on the game layer?
15:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> Or as in collision in the entities texture?
15:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ddnet.png
15:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So both Ur questions are true
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we don't know the server info in all cases, it's unreliable
15:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS net code sucks
15:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't think I quite understand, sorry. I thought the idea of layertypes was just an illusion. Isn't ddnet.png just one image? With every tile having a distinct index?
15:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Except that there is a collision between two layers
15:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oh, ok. So two layers different tile indexes for same position. We have to decide which one to render? Is that the issue?
15:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It was put to a different position
15:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In first impl I remapped the tile index. Now we simply use multi texture and put the tile from ddnet.png to the right position
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since layer IMG were split
15:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> A different position?
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The correct one
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The one ddnet.png normally has collision in
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But changing in the buffer data has the advantage of not using any extra memory ofc
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Entity image approach will always cost another texture
15:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Still better than what we have now xdd
15:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ok maybe I just need to dig around myself. I don't think I fully understand. Why does this specific tile need to be remapped? What does it even collide with?
15:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess BCS grey fox was like. Let's fuck all future devs
15:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Was the tile moved from one place to another at some version?
15:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno
15:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is it about collision tiles?
15:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if so, that dates back to vanilla
15:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Switch open tile is the one
15:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
15:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nvm me then
15:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Learath open editor
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Siwtch and game layer
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And u will see
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 tile same position
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ddnet.png repositioned
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u still don't understand buy new brain
15:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> How on earth did this even happen :pepeW:
15:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> Time switch open is on top of solo
15:49 <+bridge> <louis> i thought the point of the different layers was so that you could reuse indices
15:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it certainly didn't look like that to me ^^
15:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> everything looked like it was compatible with the other layers
15:50 <+bridge> <Learath2> That part was just an illusion. Other layer types was a way to shove the extra data needed for switches and tiles iirc
15:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For most layers it's also not really worth it
15:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Binary wise they are different tho
15:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> So why on earth was that one switch tile just randomly moved down?
15:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> So it looks better??
15:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> Pf, that does make it more annoying indeed 😦
15:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's an easy fix
15:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just stop compatibility to old clients
15:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maps can easy updated
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> entity tile code is a mess
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> adding a collision tile
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if u dont know u need to add it to a index list of unused stuff
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it gets deleted in the editor etc
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lots to keep about
16:02 <+bridge> <uwu> and 07 pls :troll:
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As said to old clients:lol:
16:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> well, the PR is rather clear without looking at the code. It allows you to insert an image.png into a map file at the position you want
16:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think gitignore should be limited to what we "support"
16:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its fine to gitignore a dir called build
16:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the glob build* is also fine
16:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its just common sense
16:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm trying to gitignore its contents instead
16:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> Mh, shouldn’t people add their build dirs to their own local exclude?
16:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why?
16:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gitignore should be to make devs life easier
16:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so that it doesn't depend on the name
16:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> of your chosen build directory
16:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (in fact that's how it worked for the longest time)
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i do that
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but gitignore is a good convenience
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and new ppl dont know about .git/info/exclude
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, that's why I try to gitignore its contents
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so that it doesn't depend on the chosen name of the build directory
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not a magic name `build`, but rather all build directories
16:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I've so much stuff there
16:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Easy to block the dir
17:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust rly should make the sparse index asap
17:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the index updates get out of hand

20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just thought something
20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in the earth some numbers are ilegal to share or even know
20:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number
20:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thus
20:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if you have an index of all possible combinations
20:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel
20:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the library of babel is ilegal then
20:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is a distribution of numbers that incluse such number ilegal too?
20:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is a distribution of numbers that include such number ilegal too?
20:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> math is ilegal
20:07 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
20:08 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 01100111 01101111 01110100 01100011 01101000 01100001 what source code could this be?
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this discord server has ilegal numbers too
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> since bot client names are strings
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they can be represented as a number
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and such number is thus then ilegal in this dc
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> due to heinrich
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so heinrich is effectively banning the use of 1 or more numbers
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> such is life
20:09 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sadge
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont post the numbers

20:11 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> there was kinda a movie, idr what the plot was tho, with a number that was "illegal" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_(film)
20:20 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> This reminds of a random, non serious, thought I had. Programming is about fixing typos. You deem space a type and then you fix it with the "correct" letter (character).
