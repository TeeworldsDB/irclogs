01:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> can we add a build option to disable rust
01:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> atm it doesn't do anything and it would help build times

01:12 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @ryozuki
01:12 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> this screams you
01:12 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> escept maybe it not being vim
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> what is escept
01:12 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> except*
03:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> @robyt3 linking `NtosKrnl.lib` may fix the windows undefined reference issues
03:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> @robyt3 explicitly linking `NtosKrnl.lib` may fix the windows undefined reference issues
07:02 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Yo amigos, anyone know a good way to get your dummies' coords even if its outside of render distance? Currently im trying this with the dummy's ID and it returns 0 once my main gets far away from it.

07:12 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> Just a guess, but maybe the chat command `/showall 1` might help?
07:12 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> 
07:12 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> "Whether to show players at any distance (off by default)"
07:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> ooh
07:15 <+bridge> <BillionRay> thanks, that did the trick!
07:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> another botter helped
07:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah hold on
07:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what are you trying to do? :o
08:04 <+bridge> <BillionRay> To detect if the dummy is where i left it
08:21 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Spotted the cynic
08:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> :greenthing:
08:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> This is NOT greenthing
08:30 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If something like this gets released to the public that might cause some trouble https://youtu.be/AJF7iMXodbE
08:30 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That fully convinced me it’s not a human
08:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 99% of the randoma ask for help for bots, indirectly
08:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i still believe u are here for that
08:34 <+bridge> <BillionRay> I will ask directly next time I suppose
08:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> So you are botting
08:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yes pls, so we know not to help
08:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> :bluekitty:
08:35 <+bridge> <BillionRay> 🦔
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> need bot?
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> chillerbot.github.io
11:13 <+bridge> <BillionRay> @ryozuki I Just had a look at chillberbot-ux, found this camp feature. This is pretty much what im doing rn. You consider this botting?
11:13 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120280082339070024/Screenshot_20230619-111139-634.png
11:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeye dont talk to me
11:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i aint talkin to botters
11:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😴
11:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ChillerDragon: ryo refuses to talk to you further :troll:
11:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> Chiller always the exception
11:53 <+bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon that camp feature is against the rules btw
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> whose rules
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> I’ve only ever seen chillerbots on block servers
11:56 <+bridge> <learath2> We do not allow any client feature that does inputs for you, unless it's also in the official client
11:57 <+bridge> <BillionRay> I was going to say that to him, but he instructed me to not talk to him
11:57 <+bridge> <BillionRay> I was going to say that to ryo, but he instructed me to not talk to him
11:57 <+bridge> <BillionRay> What do you mean by 'do not allow'? What is the penalty?
11:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> ‘Your’ rules are irrelevant if he’s not playing on your servers. Lol
11:59 <+bridge> <learath2> You are so cool when you are being pedantic. Ofc we can't do anything about servers other than ours.
12:00 <+bridge> <learath2> The penalty for using it on a ddnet server is a ban like all other bots
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> Sorry. I didn’t mean to be a pain in the ass
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> I just figured he knew it was against ddnet rules and is redundant to point out
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> I just figured he knew it was against ddnet rules when he made it and so it’s redundant to point out
12:00 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Who, me or chiller?
12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> Chiller
12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> I think you’re breaking the rules lol
12:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> I guess so, but i dont really play ddnet
12:03 <+bridge> <learath2> Just giving you a heads up is all. Not like we can stop you from coding whatever you like.
12:04 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Yeah np, for what its worth i have no interest in making something to cheat in ddnet servers
12:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since 3 days we talk about bots 🥱
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> An anti afk bot might not hurt the racing competition but it still does smth a human can't do
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So other ppl see it and want it too
12:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah I'm not a huge fan of people making these bots and even less a fan of them being available for the public
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For any automated input the anti bot has to assume u are a cheater anyway
12:07 <+bridge> <BillionRay> The anti bot?
12:07 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Is there even anything like that on the ddnet servers? I have never seen anyone get auto banned for botting
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> The big ban
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mhh interesting
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> seems like my mobile discord ain't working anymor
12:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The big ban
12:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The big ban
12:09 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Huh?
12:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The anti bot exists yes
12:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno how good it is, BCS i never challenged it xd
12:11 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Gotcha
12:14 <+bridge> <gerdoe> bruh another bot client is coming
12:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> Antibot for kog and fng is more obvious
12:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> Because they’re easier to write bots for
12:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> :greenthing:
12:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> write another implementation of antibot pls
12:19 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Yeah i figured. I see people get flagged on fng and fokkonauts server all the time. I wonder how much of that is because people use bots more there and how much because the antibot is more sensitive
12:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Are bullet lines against the rules? That isnt technically automated input
12:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but automated vision
12:21 <+bridge> <learath2> What is bullet lines? Like hooklines but trajectories for projectiles?
12:23 <+bridge> <learath2> The rule is no automated input. The rest are a bit of a grey area, I'm of the opinion that it's fine mostly because impossible to detect anyway
12:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say they are a cheat anyway. If in CSGO the cursor would tell you where to aim for a better spray or how far off your aim is to hit the head of an opponent, it's an unfair advantage
12:26 <+bridge> <learath2> No killing in ddnet so it's a little better, but I do get your point
12:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> CS2 Follow recoil
12:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar> uff, didnt know CS2 added such a feature
12:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but if the game adds it as defaults its ofc no cheat... if this is a good addition is ofc a different question
13:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, bullet lines are also against the rules
13:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they give you a gameplay advantage over the original client
13:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Where do we even have this written down? I'm sure I would have objected to the addition of this clearly unenforceable rule if we ever discussed it
13:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we probably haven't written it down anywhere
13:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in that sense, a proper aimbot would also be undetectable
13:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so I don't think this is a good line
13:32 <+bridge> <learath2> An aimbot has a chance to be detected. A rendered line on the screen has no chance to be detected unless you want to go closed source and add clientside anticheat
13:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, not if you do it properly
13:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, this has nothign to do with being closed source
13:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, this has nothign to do with being open source
13:33 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Afaik any reasonable aimbot can be deduced by looking at recorded footage of the player in question. For the bullet lines, if someone is perfectly hitting bounces first try, that too can become suspicious
13:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Or atleast only allow binary releases. Whatever, point is we can't detect it while allowing any client we haven't directly built
13:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i compile my own from git with my ebuild
13:35 <+bridge> <learath2> If it doesn't do inputs for you it's not a cheat in the context of ddnet, atleast if it were my servers  that's how I would do it.
13:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's not consensus
13:36 <+bridge> <learath2> Which is why I said it's how I would run my own servers, and why I said it's a bit of a gray area when asked in the official context
13:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
13:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we can have that discussion, if you want to
13:36 <+bridge> <learath2> It's a grey area because it's not written down and at the very least you and I seem to disagree
13:37 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Who is the final authority/ owner in ddnet anyway?
13:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich
13:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> even if he denies it
13:37 <+bridge> <learath2> Very technically deen, but he doesn't play that card ever
13:37 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Ooh @heinrich5991 nice to meet you
13:38 <+bridge> <learath2> So in practice anyone with a light green name + heinrich gets a say in every decision
13:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which is really sad
13:39 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Ah ok makes sense
13:39 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Whys that sad? How would you want it?
13:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like openness
13:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> open discussion
13:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> open decisions
13:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> heinrich is good
13:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but im still waiting for options :feelsbadman:
13:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @gerdoe no, heinrich hardly moves out of what he thinks is good
13:40 <+bridge> <learath2> Very rarely there is anything to be decided in secret anyway. I guess the picking of new mods is about all that happens in private
13:40 <+bridge> <deen> I'd say anything that makes gameplay easier than "DDNet client without extra tools" is considered a cheat
13:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> whatever but his decisions are good mostly
13:40 <+bridge> <deen> Oh, heinrich said so before too
13:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats ur opinion
13:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i know many people disliked the single handledly enforcement of the new hammer
13:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which is a BEFORE and AFTER era for ddnet
13:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it rly changed ddnet drastically
13:41 <+bridge> <learath2> That wasn't his decision alone
13:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway, i have  no say in this or many things
13:42 <+bridge> <learath2> Not like he went rogue and pushed to master
13:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, he has rly good conversational skills, in that it makes others look stupid, and obviously he didnt push to master, but used his influence heavily
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway we cant change the past
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but thats how ddnet is now
13:43 <+bridge> <BillionRay> What kind of criticism is that
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for me, heinrich is like the BFDL of ddnet
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> bdfl*
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u wont understand cuz ur new
13:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he speaks like a politician
13:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats what  i mean
13:44 <+bridge> <deen> I don't think BDFLs usually get overruled 😄
13:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah he is still here xD
13:45 <+bridge> <deen> @ryozuki wait, aren't you in unique?
13:45 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Learned a new term, thanks
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i am, but i dont rly partake much in the activities xD
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why
13:46 <+bridge> <deen> Seems weird that heinrich argues in your favor and you against him
13:46 <+bridge> <learath2> How is the ability to convince other people a bad thing? Not like we agreed to it without thinking about it because he is well spoken 😄
13:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> were did he argue in my favour?
13:46 <+bridge> <deen> In our private #admin chat about race maps
13:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its not a bad thing per se, just frustrating on my part xd
13:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just know timakro told me is hosting some servers in taiwan or smth
13:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but just because he says well stuff doesnt mean i would say he is the best right
13:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just like im hosting the wiki i dont expect anything
13:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway im not even badmouthing
13:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its my opinion on him, he does lot of controversial decisions thats it
13:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ryozuki just code smth everyone wants, but only you can maintain. then u are the hostage taker <:lol:460429405328506900>
13:48 <+bridge> <learath2> There is some sense to this, but what would projectile lines even help with? I imagine it would be mostly used for planning rocket shots which you can just do by spamming a couple
13:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks xd like what? everything is done
13:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i lack time
13:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, Jupstar is the BDFL of the gfx code. Become like him if you want influence
13:49 <+bridge> <BillionRay> That and quickly seeing if someone is reachable by rifle/sg
13:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just wanted to say that dev chat can be a echo chamber for decisions, nothing wrong with asking others about opinions, like i did with the friend list that robyt made and posted on #general
13:50 <+bridge> <learath2> Erlang masters. None of us could maintain anything about it
13:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 or be like robyt and do everything, he has the right to be bdfl
13:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that would be dope, but i would use https://gleam.run/
13:51 <+bridge> <learath2> But the things he does is generic, you need to become an irreplaceable cog if you want true bdfl powers
13:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which runs on the erlang BEAM
13:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> btw its june
13:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> c++20
13:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> letse go
13:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://ubuntu.com//blog/18-04-end-of-standard-support
13:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> since 31 may already
13:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> there is something else we can update besides c++20 right
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im sure there are new shiny things
13:55 <+bridge> <murpi> Sorry, but that sounds super wrong to me. BDFL is more of a descriptive term for a specific leadership role within an open-source project, rather than a defined right.
13:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ryozuki rust?
13:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or do we drop opengl 1.x 😂 
13:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i know, i was kinda joking
13:56 <+bridge> <gerdoe> :justatest:
13:56 <+bridge> <murpi> uh ok 👀
13:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust deps
13:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we can update rust to newer version
13:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> why even do this with rust at all?
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in steam it says we only support opengl 2.1+
13:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> just enforce rustup
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz heinrich
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he wants to support old debian rust
13:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> thats really weird
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :PES2_Shrug:
13:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> isnt it nice that rust doesnt do it so shitty over system package manager
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i never use the rust from system package manager
13:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rustup is so powerful
13:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I like using it from the arch repos
13:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah
13:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it gives me automated updates
13:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> put rustup update in .bashrc
13:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah
13:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich wants it
13:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no need to argue
13:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or convince rustup to make a plugin for the system package managers
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can install rustup via arch's package manager as well
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > or convince rustup to make a plugin for the system package managers
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds stupid ^^ it does away with the entire reason of system package managers
13:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot at which version of rust we are
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. you could just use rustup itself instead
13:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in ddnet
13:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah but apparently u like package manager auto update more
14:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i also dislike heinrich rust style
14:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so if the package manager simply triggers rustuo
14:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> rustup
14:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xDD
14:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
14:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
14:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ryozuki the includes?
14:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
14:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i wonder if vscode would simply refactor them when i click save xD
14:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and idk libtw i hate it, but probs cuz its rly old code
14:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, rustfmt nightly can do it
14:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you maybe be less negative about stuff I create, @ryozuki?
14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i actually dont care, aslong as i dont need to do it manually :D
14:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't go around saying other people's creatiosn are crap
14:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u said that urself now
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just said i hate the style its written with
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont put words in my mouth
14:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > and idk libtw i hate it, but probs cuz its rly old code
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hate is not saying its crap
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but i was talking in the context of code style
14:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also don't go around saying I hate other people's creations
14:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see, still not nice
14:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :bluestripe:
14:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but better
14:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im out
14:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks
14:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this was not nice
14:03 <+bridge> <louis.place> :justatest:
14:03 <+bridge> <louis.place> good morning developers of ddnet
14:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> good morning 🙂
14:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> whom do i insult if i say ddnet is crap? xd
14:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably a collective, so less bad
14:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> especially since you're in it
14:04 <+bridge> <murpi> Every person that likes ddnet feels, obviously
14:04 <+bridge> <murpi> Every person that likes ddnet, obviously
14:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just need to make a mental note
14:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont comment on anything relating to heinrich
14:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well even joking is not something u can do
14:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @learath2 pm me ssh key for discord bot server 
14:06 <+bridge> <murpi> That'd be ddnet.org :justatest:
14:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Perfect
14:06 <+bridge> <murpi> :greenthing:
14:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or give me skin database pw and invite my DC bot
14:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can also host it
14:07 <+bridge> <learath2> What bot?
14:07 <+bridge> <learath2> We need one more discord bot?
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Skin uploading
14:07 <+bridge> <murpi> I don't think we'll allow that ever to happen again. jao self-hosting the @DDNet was kind of a pain in the butt
14:07 <+bridge> <learath2> YAYADDB
14:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i was making ryochan
14:07 <+bridge> <murpi> I don't think we'll allow that ever to happen again. jao self-hosting the @DDNet bot was kind of a pain in the butt
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What happened
14:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you can try run 2 runtimes a time
14:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to replace @DDNet  in rust
14:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> will this work tho
14:08 <+bridge> <learath2> It's ok we can run another bot, just confused why you didn't just add onto one or the other
14:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder about that too xd
14:09 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69796271/simultaneously-running-separate-programs-using-the-same-token
14:09 <+bridge> <gerdoe> seems it works
14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
14:09 <+bridge> <gerdoe> pyson moment or smth
14:09 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess I'll merge it into either @DDNet or @DDNet or @DDNet
14:09 <+bridge> <learath2> One day
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah we have 3 bots
14:10 <+bridge> <louis.place> you should name the other DDNet bot [D] DDNet
14:10 <+bridge> <murpi> He was the only person who was able to do anything with the bot. If it ever broke, we'd have to wait for him to fix it
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nice
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah I see xd
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To DDosNet
14:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> DNNet
14:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Twinbop
14:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> twinbopp
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 did u know
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> string concat in erlang doesnt allocate another string iirc
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> since they are linked lists xd
14:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wtf
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but they slow
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well erlang is not made for that
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also erlang has first class bit syntax
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```erlang
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> -define(IP_VERSION, 4).
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> -define(IP_MIN_HDR_LEN, 5).
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> DgramSize = byte_size(Dgram),
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> case Dgram of 
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     <<?IP_VERSION:4, HLen:4, SrvcType:8, TotLen:16,

14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>       DestIP:32, RestDgram/binary>> when HLen>=5, 4*HLen=<DgramSize ->
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>         OptsLen = 4*(HLen - ?IP_MIN_HDR_LEN),
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>         <<Opts:OptsLen/binary,Data/binary>> = RestDgram,
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     ...
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> end.
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Here, the segment corresponding to the Opts variable has a type modifier, specifying that Opts is to bind to a binary. All other variables have the default type equal to unsigned integer.
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > An IP datagram header is of variable length. This length is measured in the number of 32-bit words and is given in the segment corresponding to HLen. The minimum value of HLen is 5. It is the segment corresponding to Opts that is variable, so if HLen is equal to 5, Opts becomes an empty binary.
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> interesting xd
14:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wow my attention span for reading long qoutes goes against 0
14:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and yes erlang syntax sucks
14:16 <+bridge> <learath2> Linked list of strings or linked list of characters? If strings, it's not exactly an awful idea
14:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> elixir improves a bit xd
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> strings iirc
14:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Even better idea is tree of strings, truly revolutionary
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hm
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now that i think
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think strings are lists in erlang
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > A string in Erlang is implemented as a linked list of integers. This leads to a large memory
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > overhead on modern hardware (64 bits) causing each character to take 16 bytes, especially
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > compared to the natural representation where each character takes 1 byt
14:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/b0b0e82e-95a1-493c-a3ee-435e17e8a43e/content
14:23 <+bridge> <learath2> Bizarre design choice. I wonder what compelled them to it
14:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Is appending so common in telecommunication that the ability to do O(1) worth it? But why not ropes or atleast a linked list of char arrays?
14:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 or @Jupeyy_Keks do u know how to make clangd treat .inc files as c++
14:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm tablegen generates c++ headers with .inc
14:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mh i dunno, the vscode cmake generator associates files without ending e.g. from standard
14:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but i guess only for vscode and not clangd
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk how to get clangd autocomp
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have a clangd file with includes
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt find the .inc file
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but its there
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> oh thats weird tho
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> an include is simply a text replace
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it should even work on txt files
15:09 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> good one
15:31 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> Lol, so how'd you write this bot. This is honestly crazy
15:31 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hda2h7ph8-c
15:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no bot dev discussion
15:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:16 <+bridge> <botondus> im not a bot
16:16 <+bridge> <botondus> i wonder when ddnet anarchy server drops
16:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bombay
16:46 <+bridge> <slats__> do you have questions? happy to answer 🙂
17:06 <+bridge> <murpi> Does anyone else experience some weird emote delays?
17:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Do any of you use an IME on linux? Which one is good nowadays?
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> > this is just making image management messier than it already is
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> 
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> @_voxeldoesart  what do you think would be better than my changes? Not moving arrow, strong weak indicator and new shields into the extra.png? 
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> Do you think multiple single images are better for image management? Adding all these images to our ingame modding / texture selector would maybe make it complex for normal users, do you think that would be nice / better?
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> 
17:08 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> From modding point of view, I guess a problem is, that I merged particles, HUD elements, OPD elements and Game Tetures into one image, do you think that is bad? Could you explain more what you do not like, and make a suggestion that you would like more.
17:09 <+bridge> <murpi> @Jupeyy_Keks Are you around?
17:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In around  10min
17:14 <+bridge> <murpi> Ah, the issue doesn't seem to be reproducible
17:15 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> @ravie_ravie Have you had time to test <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6724> in the meantime?
17:15 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> You have changed the texture of the weapon armor and of the key presses indicator arrow (they are little smaller because of the extra margin).  Were these changes made intentionally or did you simply not have access to the original images? The weapon armor do now no longer match the shields in entities. I guess, if you wanted this change and all agree on it, the entities should also be changed.
17:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I do. it's probably not good or anything
17:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I use ibus with anthy
17:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Note: Anthy has been effectively dead since 2009.[2]
17:18 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> I use fcitx5, its best if you also want to write Japanese
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, interesting
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but wait, that's only one part
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's the IMF apparently
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what's your IME?
17:20 <+bridge> <learath2> Moving things around makes old resources unusable, I guess that's one concern?
17:24 <+bridge> <learath2> I was eyeing fcitx5 with mozc
17:24 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> currently none; I stopped learning Chinese.  I guess you could use fcitx5-anthy for Japanese, But I used Mozc.
17:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if we move stuff around, I'd like to consider(!) moving to zip files instead of sprites
17:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this would make future changes easier at the cost of having no preview by default
17:27 <+bridge> <learath2> zip files might be a good idea, @Jupeyy_Keks is that feasible? If the gfx backend can't build the atlas at runtime I guess we could just build it on the cpu before uploading
17:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> zip files have very nice properties for future-compatibility: you can very easily detect which sprites are present and which are not
17:29 <+bridge> <learath2> No preview is a little annoying and sharing them is harder
17:29 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> What would be the benefit of having a zip with multiple images, instead of just the multiple single images?
17:29 <+bridge> <learath2> No more moving around
17:29 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> ah
17:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also forward compatibility
17:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because you now see that this game.png doesn't contain a snowflake
17:30 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm, I remember some artists saying they'd  rather die than let users mismatch assets
17:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because you now see that this game.zip doesn't contain a snowflake.png
17:30 <+bridge> <learath2> Aha, a wild Ravie shows up
17:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this isn't about mixing
17:30 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> So no sprites at all? Just every single icon each solo in a single image, that gets ziped together with all images?
17:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's the option I wanted us to consider, yes
17:31 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> I changed the shields and arrow to have everything in vector and also because the old shields are really ugly
17:31 <+bridge> <learath2> Doesn't have to be all images, we can split it into multiple contextful zips I guess. So you can have a hud.zip e.g.
17:31 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> I can change the ones in entities as well
17:32 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> For me its fine, I have not tested yet how they look ingame... I will make a screenshot. If everyone is fine with it, I guess we can change them
17:32 <+bridge> <learath2> Actually I think the easier sharing and the nice way to preview assets is more important to me than the compatibility, as long as we just extend the image from the bottom right corner it's future proof anyway
17:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Just never move stuff around, there isn't much reason to move it around anyway
17:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not currently, we're resizing the image to fit what we want
17:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we should maybe look at the aspect ratio or something
17:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Wait, really? That's horrible
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> AFAIK
17:34 <+bridge> <learath2> I thought we just cropped
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> well, it can have any resolution
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so you'd have to be a bit clever about it
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and we aren't, I think
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what issues are we talking about
17:35 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> I mean extending images to right or bottom should be fine. We will not do that to often, and outdated textures will get forgotton.
17:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, we allow higher res resources too
17:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so we're only allowed to extend it to the bottom
17:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and we need to be a bit clever about the cropping
17:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and we need to provide a spot where artists can put their logo
17:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> seems feasible though
17:36 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> if you guys are talking about the new extras.png, there's plenty of space left for future stuff so no need to worry about extending it for a while if ever
17:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh no
17:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not this discussion again
17:37 <+bridge> <learath2> @c0d3d3v's new pr was moving some stuff around, that's why we are talking about it
17:37 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> yeah he implemented the combined image that I made a while ago
17:38 <+bridge> <learath2> your strong response suggests to me that you already have come to a conclusion in one of the past discussions, would you mind enlightening us on the best course of action in that case?
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont extend images
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont use zip files
17:39 <+bridge> <learath2> So don't change?
17:39 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> xD btw. I asked if we are allowed to / should move the images (that we moved) all into one image back then... there was no argument against it. But since the discussion is over 8 month ago, Its good that we discuss it again.
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> give me a tl;dr i only skimmed it
17:40 <+bridge> <learath2> Recent PR moves stuff around, which is a compatibility break (I think?), we were talking about whether that's okay, and should we maybe use zip files instead so we don't have this problem ever again
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem and zip files seem unrelated
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should move the shields, bcs that was always the plan.. i dunno who released a map with these shields
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stop doing weird hacks with extending and zips tho
17:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> zip files allow to update in the future without compatibility breaks
17:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's why it's related
17:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dont need zip files for this
17:42 <+bridge> <learath2> hud.png and the new extras.png aren't compatible, so it's a break indeed
17:42 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> they are not compatile anyway since we have new freezebar and new icon
17:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I was just trying to help understand why zip files are related
17:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why zip files allow to update?
17:43 <+bridge> <learath2> moving the shields is a break, moving anything is a break if you ever want to re-use that space
17:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because you can easily detect whether a sprite exists or not
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, i have nothing against splitting up all textures
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> texture atlasses suck for modding
17:43 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> the thing is, I merged arrow.png; strongweak.png and the weapon shields into extras.png with the single freeze particle
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but make it ez for the end users
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> move file loading to a thread
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont load useless stuff
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then we can still _additionally_ think about zip files or smth like that if we really need it
17:44 <+bridge> <learath2> Now that has nothing to do with compatibility 😄
17:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so that when you add snowflake.png, it can fallback to the default snowflake.png if it doesn't exist in the user's textre
17:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so that when you add snowflake.png, it can fallback to the default snowflake.png if it doesn't exist in the user's texture zip
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i know
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am mostly about usability
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> often ppl want to change the gun
17:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats it
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> explaining zip files to nobos is annoying
17:45 <+bridge> <learath2> I mean it doesn't have much to do with usability either, no? It'll just make loading faster and appear smoother
17:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi pm me if we wanted to talk about smth
17:45 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is my concern with it, no previews and having to zip/unzip stuff
17:45 <+bridge> <totar> isnt there already a multithreaed loading system in progress?
17:45 <+bridge> <totar> isnt there already a multithreaded loading system in progress?
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> zip files are good for performance, and zip files allow sharing the whole texture. it makes it slightly harder over individual files to edit individual textures
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> note that all OSs have native support for zip files
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so you can just copy an image into a zip file on windows
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g.
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah zips are better for read perf
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not for customization
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and we simply dont need the performance
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why not customization?
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro, have u ever talked to #questions or #bugs ppl?
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's easier to share a zip of a whole customization than 20 individual files
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes i am impressed if they can breath
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and stop insulting our users 😦
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and stop insulting our players 😦
17:47 <+bridge> <learath2> 😛
17:47 <+bridge> <murpi> Can we just all appreciate the fish in #📬submit-skins
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i dunno, most understand unzipping.. many dont even understand unzipping and start the clietn inside the zip
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now explain them to repack to a zip
17:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, it's easier than that stuff
17:48 <+bridge> <learath2> I have a compromise, we can allow zips and folders
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> truth is. client needs to have every single texture in the game as config
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else ppl are never happy
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they want the fancy weapon
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not the ugly hook
17:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Artists can share coherent sets of assets as zips, and people that want to just customize a couple things can drag just one asset in a folder
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zip files mean, loading a full set
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me this isnt more future ready than a directory
17:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi is it about the bot?
17:50 <+bridge> <learath2> (people seem to be fine with the amount of customization even available today, I don't see this desire to replace a single asset very often at all)
17:51 <+bridge> <learath2> but I do want to support it, so allow both directories and zips
17:51 <+bridge> <murpi> No, something else, but it seems to have fixed itself. There was some reaaaally weird emote delay on the server I'm currently on.
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least once per week i read. "when can i split skins, bla bla"
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
17:52 <+bridge> <syrinok> I had 1 second emote delay on china, but probably firewall?
17:52 <+bridge> <totar> could be solved by an external tool
17:52 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120380557667348501/image.png
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, maybe it works for your community
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and at least for 70% of our
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not for the rest
17:52 <+bridge> <totar> my community?
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also explaining tools is annoying too
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the t-client gang
17:53 <+bridge> <totar> ah
17:53 <+bridge> <murpi> I'm not on a chinese server
17:53 <+bridge> <totar> ideally it would just be a website
17:53 <+bridge> <totar> you drag skin images, click which ones you want to change
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi when do we test the bot, i want to see if its good enough for a start
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 1 week i forgot all of my ugly hacked code again xD
17:54 <+bridge> <murpi> You'll have to convince @learath2
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 send ssh
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i do it
17:54 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> so why not just only single textures in folder instead of a zip
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i never said anything about a zip file D
17:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> folders aren't different from zip files on windows
17:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can enter them with the explorer
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see i also dunno what the _best_ solution is
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but probably the one easiest for the most stupid person
17:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and you can move things out and in
17:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the only thing that doesn't work is starting executable from inside
17:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because they will look for dependent files, and they aren't extracted together by windows
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how windows handles it is how related to how ddnet handles it?
17:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because you're telling me that users won't be able to handle zip files but they will be able to handle folders
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zips and images
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that alone makes no sense in my head
17:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and I think they'll be able to handle zip files
17:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> minecraft does texture packs like that, I think
17:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess other games, too, but we can check
17:57 <+bridge> <totar> you also can't see image thumbnails in a zip
17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the unpack and do the rest in the client
17:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yep. I want to mention that this point was already brought up though

17:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u load from 2 zip files the perf will be worse tho
17:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> two zip files compared to what?
17:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> loading two zip files compared to what?
17:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> alone the fact that u unzip an image just to uncompress it
17:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a .tar would maybe make sense, but thats ofc not a deal
17:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> a zip file doesn't have to be compressed
17:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only see bad things about zips
17:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so its a dir in worse
17:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> same
17:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i read zip and i get bad vibes
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> better use tar.zstd
18:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so does windows automatically do that?
18:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, because you can share it as a whole
18:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u think windows handling is so good?
18:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know. we could investigate
18:00 <+bridge> <totar> aren't pngs already compressed? what is the benefit of the zip?
18:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u pack them anyway, its about the handling
18:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> merging them together into one file that can be shared, in case we have lots of little textures
18:01 <+bridge> <totar> I see
18:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "pack them anyway"? my proposal was having lots of little images, one for gun, etc.
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> probs pack them in the graphics engine
18:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to send the dir i mean
18:01 <+bridge> <learath2> Zip is the only compressed format supported natively by every OS. tar would probably be ideal
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh
18:01 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> not really relevant, but is loading a zip really faster than loading a bunch of images one after the other?
18:01 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> Also if we use zips, the modding -> selecting images you want in your texture set, would happen outside the client, you put all images you want into one zip. And in the client we would just select the zip. In minecraft you have a metafile with a title, author in that zip and cover image for a texture set. We could also add an author logo.
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think recent windows allows tar
18:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> Windows does not zip files uncompressed per default (and has no default method to do so)
18:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, it's faster
18:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what
18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not if u need to touch 2 different zip files
18:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because less file system access
18:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> loading a zip has to be inherently slower than loading a file directly
18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and most will be compressed
18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so unzipping takes time too
18:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> reading a zip with 100 files that you need is faster than reading 100 individual files
18:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is what I want to say
18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem is @heinrich5991 thinks we **want** to load the whole zip at once
18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which we dont
18:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on whether it's compressed or not
18:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think most games do this via custom ".bin" files
18:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like source engine
18:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but they are also just other formats
18:03 <+bridge> <learath2> Okay, unzip at first load, cache the output as a directory, so you can save the couple ms at first game load after the first launch
18:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> which are probably archives of some form, like zip files 😉
18:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how often do _you_ customize these bin files?
18:03 <+bridge> <learath2> ARMA has pbo files, lets use them to annoy everyone
18:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lets make our teeformat
18:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> .tee files
18:04 <+bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/libpbo
18:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why not a standard format though?
18:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz its cooler
18:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> standard formats are better for interoperability
18:04 <+bridge> <learath2> To be annoying, duh
18:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> see e.g. the https master
18:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i didnt know u were into arma
18:04 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> why not? I guess we would only one texture set, and use that for the whole game, till another set is selected. But missing images would need to be replaces with defaults, or just do not allow missing files.
18:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 ssh 😏
18:04 <+bridge> <learath2> We can make it a couple a second or 3 faster since it'll be uncompressed
18:04 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> why not? I guess we would only load one texture set, and use that for the whole game, till another set is selected. But missing images would need to be replaces with defaults, or just do not allow missing files.
18:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the most interoperable file format is the file itself 😉
18:05 <+bridge> <learath2> s\/a couple//
18:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like the idea of more and easier customization
18:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which zips wont give, if we load one set at once
18:05 <+bridge> <learath2> Can we agree that it's annoying to share 50 files at once to share a theme?
18:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what about troll users sharing "assets" as zips and them being a zip bomb
18:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or "virus"
18:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also many ppl fear zip files
18:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good point btw
18:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> a zip bomb isn't a thing, only if you try to recursively unpack them
18:05 <+bridge> <totar> minecraft doesnt have that issue
18:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and that ^
18:06 <+bridge> <robyt3> it should work like the storage system. if you have multiple zip files it needs to read the files from the highest priority storage first and then check the lower priority storages, I think this is what @Jupeyy_Keks means in that we don't read the entire zip at once
18:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> when rust lib
18:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Never, I'm no longer interested in arma
18:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just continue ddnet-pg now, full dictatorship
18:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh it was ur based perior, it uses AUTOCONF
18:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> period
18:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I made some scripts for dealing with blizzard's mpq formats back in the day
18:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt mean it, but good point 😂
18:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also a nice annoying format
18:07 <+bridge> <learath2> I think I used fstds magic script that helped create autoconf projects 😄
18:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what about when arma 4 releases
18:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 i give u 5€ for ssh access to ddnet.org
18:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> troll
18:07 <+bridge> <learath2> There is no way you are getting access to ddnet.org
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> drop the key here
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets see how long it survives
18:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> drops!
18:08 <+bridge> <learath2> I can see you losing your mind because we merged a patch you don't like and doing `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDDD
18:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah i am full creation person
18:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only destroy if i make it better in return
18:09 <+bridge> <learath2> So you'd instead `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda1 bs=8M`?
18:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i would use shred (im joking)
18:09 <+bridge> <learath2> For what is more full of information than pure entropy?
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> srm
18:09 <+bridge> <learath2> The pinnacle of creation
18:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rm is not safe
18:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its just weird that zip is the solution to this
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clever as u are u didnt choose sda1
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and tricked me
18:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> feels like using the wrong tool to fix the issue
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean zips solve a problem and make a new one
18:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not that I like zip files ^^
18:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> which problem do they create? the user don't know how to deal with them?
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me they are not ideal for what i'd see customization
18:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me they are not ideal for what i'd see as customization
18:12 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> Before we discuss more about Texturepacks... Can you all have a look at this image? Do you like the new shields; Do you need a comparison picture with the old one? Can we also change the entities to this?
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont ask devs about image quality when we have the resident
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @ravie_ravie
18:12 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> here
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
18:12 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> Ravie made it and likes it
18:12 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> I like it too
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> then im fine
18:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just move them out of game.png 😂
18:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then im fine
18:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they should never have landed there
18:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> previous shield for comparison: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/e22e0c9777f1814e84fbe76cfdf3644676c6dc7f/data/game.png
18:13 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> I moved them xD thats also part of the texturepack discussion xDD because I moved them to extras.png
18:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 stop wasting time with useless discussions, give ssh 😂
18:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or wait
18:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have a better idea
18:14 <+bridge> <learath2> I do indeed have better things to do

18:25 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> If @ravie_ravie and other Artists would like such a texturepack system; I guess I could try to implement it. 😅  Would be a lot of changes to the texture system; but should be worth it. Btw. Since I read it again in the issue that you have linked Learath2; I was asked a lot If I can add assets tabs for menu cursor.png and all kind of other pngs since I added the latest two asset tabs... So I guess there are more people that we thing that want to 
18:25 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> 
18:25 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> I like the idea of having texture sets as Zip (and maybe additionally allow Dictionaries idk), But I would not make it more complex. Just allow to select one set ingame, and the missing rest will be default. Or does minecraft also allow to select multiple zips, I do not think so?
18:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they can also draw it in an atlas and convert it later
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they allow multiple files, and have smth like a fallback system
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think they do it for the normal maps etc to work at the same time as "normal" textures

18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah random guy in the internet argues
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > MIT is free as in free tech support, the sooner people accept that the better off we'll all be.
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i need to write this
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> on a tshirt
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and come to ddnetcon with it
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see @ryozuki as said
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are angles

18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 do u have ssh to ddnet.org?
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath betrayed me
18:34 <+bridge> <c0d3d3v> Just one more thought about the texture packs. If we also make each icon in game.png its own image, the texturepacks are not compatible with 0.7 clients. Which should not really bother us though....
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would be an improvement
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
18:34 <+bridge> <murpi> @Jupeyy_Keks Please have a bit of patience, as of right now a 3rd bot is simply not a good approach.
18:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we already said we can use 2 instances on one bot
18:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks they dont want more AI in ddnet discord
18:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :emiliaSMH:
18:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> When using AI prompts to generate skins?
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd love to have a auto FAQ bot xD
18:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust facts bot
18:39 <+bridge> <robyt3> Would be useful to have a bot that detects screenshots with missing text in the menu and links the wiki page :kek:
18:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
18:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> happens way to often
18:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aswell as fucking game does not start xD
18:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i'd be elon musk, i'd give everyone in our community a 4090
18:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> problem solved
19:07 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> I'm honestly against the texture pack idea, an atlas is easier to make, share and manage
19:08 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> why would someone want to swap single assets anyway? either you use all from the same pack or have an unmatched mess
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats what ppl want
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> AK gun in 2D child game
19:15 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> I might have a unique perspective but it doesn't seem worth it to implement this whole other system for Billy to have fun mixing guns, while for someone competent who wants to commit to making the whole pack it's actually more work than atlas.
19:16 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> Also it's true that you can batch export the assets but it's still extra work. At least in Inkscape, you have to set up each asset with a bounding box and a file name and if you wanna edit it you have to ungroup it and set it up again after changes.
19:20 <+bridge> <robyt3> Splitting gives us compatibility, so we can add and remove images as we want, which wouldn't be as easy with atlases. It allows old tilesets to be used with new clients without any changes, because the client can simply load defaults for the missing parts. I don't think being able to mix different sets was the main motivation for splitting the images.
19:21 <+bridge> <robyt3> And we don't rally intend to support mixing different sets any more than before
19:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean that's something we could solve in a better way
19:21 <+bridge> <robyt3> And we don't really intend to support mixing different sets any more than before
19:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but its also annoying that apparantly so many users are on an outdated **beta** amd driver
19:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how did they end up with that? XD
19:22 <+bridge> <robyt3> We need a launcher to detect if the client failed to launch with the current settings, I don't see other options on Windows
19:23 <+bridge> <robyt3> We need a separate launcher to detect if the client failed to launch with the current settings, I don't see other options on Windows
19:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the launcher could be invisible though, right?
19:23 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> +1
19:25 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> Do we ever have to remove assets tho? Loading defaults if an asset is missing will still look mismatched so it's not really a solution, either way you should make sure that your assets are up to date.
19:25 <+bridge> <robyt3> Yes, it could default to being invisible and simply launching the client. If it detects a launch failure (or a specific steam launch option is used) then the launcher shows a GUI to adjust the relevant graphics settings that could prevent the client from launching.
19:26 <+bridge> <robyt3> We would never have to invalidate old tilesets again by moving anything though
19:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I gladly break the rules to be able to go 1min pee in a 10h run without getting dragged into next part and then getting kicked for being afk in a part. If you want to press charges talk to my lawyer jupsti
19:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@learath2)
19:26 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> hi im awake whatd i miss
19:26 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> Tilesets? You mean entities?
19:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> I mean the assets, sorry
19:27 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> ah
19:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> Which are currently atlases
19:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> I misused the "tileset" term
19:28 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> Still if a new asset gets added then the maker of a texture pack should update it. Downloading the new asset alone vs whole updated atlas is not really a difference.
19:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> It wouldn't immediately break for users though
19:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> They would realise they need to update because they are seeing the default image
19:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> Instead of seeing nothing
19:30 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2\: banning all automated inputs is just lazy lawyers. Rules should be fixed to say. Automated inputs should not give you an advantage to finish runs or harm others.My anti getting dragged into part while afk bot reduces harm for others
19:30 <+bridge> <learath2> falling back to default is better than displaying nothing imho
19:30 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> You can always display some missing texture thing, at least someone won't think the default one looks acceptable and not bother updating his assets
19:30 <+bridge> <learath2> You can make your own ddnet with your own rules
19:31 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Disconnected ranks suck
19:31 <+bridge> <learath2> Small price to pay for anarchy allowed
19:32 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not anarchy ddnet servers
19:32 <+bridge> <learath2> We seem to have consensus on not enjoying racism and cheating
19:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I am fine with racism
19:33 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> > I guess a problem is, that I merged particles, HUD elements, OPD elements and Game Tetures into one image
19:33 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 
19:33 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> That's exactly my argument. It's going to be much more of a hassle in the future, trying to sort everything properly. game.png is already a mess, and now extras.png is also going to be spaghetti.
19:33 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I guess one counterarguement is that it makes old gameskins workable again, which is fine. But if we were to change anything, I'd want it in such a way where we don't have to constantly shuffle around everything, or rely on a "we dont know where this goes" image
19:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And disagree with manual human made cheating mitigations
19:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Perfect, you should find other people such as yourself and have an anarchy server where you can act however you like
19:34 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I would love to see a ddnet databased server that has no votes or human admins. Just automated cheat detection and teehistorian
19:34 <+bridge> <learath2> The database is public, knock yourself out
19:34 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Read only
19:34 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I made a concept image long ago that sorts everything where it SHOULD be, but at the cost of throwing away every gameskin ever.
19:34 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I don't think this will see the light of day, but if we were to still rely on big images in the future instead of splitting up everything (which i think is a better idea) then i'd want it this way
19:34 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120406377500782632/image.png
19:35 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If racism is such a deal breaker and you need a chat moderation fine
19:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Why would you need to write to our database? Everyone likes anarchy, they would migrate to your much more popular servers in no time
19:36 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t want to be racist I just want the safety to not get banned for edgy chat messages
19:36 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Or chat usage at all for that matter
19:36 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Chat is not interrupting other people’s gameplay I don’t see why it should be moderated
19:37 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If I connect 4 dummy’s mods show up and quote the rules
19:38 <+bridge> <learath2> We don't seem to agree, in fact no one except the edgy people seem to agree with your conclusion. So you and the edgy people can host your own server with cheats and unmoderated chat
19:38 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Random kick votes and map changes kill runs on a daily basis
19:38 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Can it persist ranks in the ddnet database ?
19:38 <+bridge> <learath2> No
19:39 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Then it’s not interesting
19:39 <+bridge> <learath2> As I said this much superior service is sure to overtake the one we provide in no time, you shouldn't worry about that
19:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Now you are just being rude .\_.
19:40 <+bridge> <BillionRay> @ChillerDragon.* 👴 as a racist, thank you for standing up for our kind
19:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What about a ddnet server that has no user votes?
19:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg
19:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t support racism
19:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I dislike Administration
19:41 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah hes a rebel not a racist
19:41 <+bridge> <learath2> I thought you'd be all for user votes, community selfmoderating
19:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> First one bans racist people and next one bans people that insult staff
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No votes are bad
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@learath2)
19:42 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah it's a slippery slope, racists -> people who insult staff
19:42 <+bridge> <learath2> basically the same thing
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t like drawing a line between what is allowed and what isn’t
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Just allow everything
19:42 <+bridge> <learath2> No thanks
19:43 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> we're talking about the skin system?
19:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But heck if that’s a deal breaker
19:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Just open one ddnet server that has no votes
19:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s the problem with that?
19:43 <+bridge> <learath2> No map votes either?
19:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And allow block \:)
19:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No
19:44 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i cant to almost finish a map and then have the map change with no veto system whatsoever
19:44 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> *i cant wait
19:45 <+bridge> <learath2> what is the point if map votes are allowed, they can still ruin your run with them
19:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No votes
19:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No map votes
19:45 <+bridge> <learath2> and no votes at all and you'll be stuck on one map forever, it doesn't work
19:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Better than votes
19:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> There are solutions with code for good map votes but I don’t wanna propose those so you say it’s not worth it
19:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you're in a dead end here
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think anyone who would be able to set these servers up for you wants to do that
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Just pick one map and start a server without votes it’s no effort
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why tho?
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Learath2 gave the reasoning above
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Because it’s pointless?
19:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Don't we already host block servers, just play on those?
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If it’s a good map it’s nice
19:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Stuck on one map ✅ 
19:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Almost no moderation ✅
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because we don't like hosting unmoderated servers
19:47 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> They are not connected to ddnet database
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I want to play Stronghold 2 etc
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Then moderate it
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But at least turn off the votes
19:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> thats just called multeasymap
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But it’s easy map
19:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes we have multeasymap servers, I think those are forced to one map to, go play that one
19:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Go with t0 hammerhit maps
19:49 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> They don’t survive 24h
19:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wrong
19:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Though we do moderate hatespeech on those, it might not be to your taste
19:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> people eat t0 hammerhits like fucking candy
19:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> teestroyer is extra mid but its still high demand
19:49 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but still with votes
19:49 <+bridge> <learath2> I honestly just don't see the point, why on earth would we host a Stronghold server with no votes at all? Like what is the purpose?
19:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Being able to play
19:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Without getting kicked
19:50 <+bridge> <learath2> Is this something that increased in frequency since I've been away for the last 4 months or so?
19:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No
19:50 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't remember people just randomly kicking people whenever you join a server
19:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Always has been a possibility
19:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Always was annoying for me
19:51 <+bridge> <learath2> Just because something is possible doesn't mean it's an issue
19:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I lost my 19h run yesterday
19:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Due to kick vote
19:51 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> alright so, another ddnet server starts and the default map is sunny side up
19:51 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> how do we change it to something else?
19:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Happens to me a lot
19:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Admin sets it to something else than sunny side
19:52 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but what if no admin
19:52 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what if you and your friend wanted to speedrun a good map
19:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Who started the server then
19:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It happens on Server start
19:52 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> deen
19:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Deen set map
19:52 <+bridge> <learath2> You just do these bizarre things and expect it to be supported.
19:52 <+bridge> <learath2> 19 hours... just save your game?
19:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> T0 save?
19:52 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> deen is way too busy to support you constantly while you go to finish every moderate/brutal map
19:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I was making coffe
19:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Set once on server start
19:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@_voxeldoesart)
19:53 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok so what if you finish a map and want to go to another?
19:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Pick a good map
19:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And play it again
19:53 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok so how do we get to a good map?
19:54 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its going to be the same one we just finished
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> There are plenty
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean just host a ddnet server on your own at this poin
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why does it have to be connected to the db?
19:54 <+bridge> <learath2> If you want to fix voting go ahead. I hate how it is rn aswell. But removing all votes sounds like a horrible solution with many more downsides than upsides
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Just give it a try \:)
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Can I get write acces ?
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s not interesting to play if the rank is not a ddnet stat imo
19:55 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> theoretically every server that starts would default to sunny side up. without constant support from the mods there would be no way for the official server listing to ever change from those
19:55 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yes you could host your own but... why? would you?
19:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Then don’t offer it to all but only to those that join that server
19:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@learath2)
19:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What do you think is broken about votes?
19:56 <+bridge> <learath2> We don't want to offer it, since we don't see any benefit to it. It's not that complicated. You need to convince atleast one person that it's a good idea
19:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> The good idea is that it’s not much effort and I ask for this since years
19:56 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think the only broken thing about votes rn are how veto votes still have the thing in the middle
19:57 <+bridge> <learath2> I think on ddnet scale kickvotes can be disabled. Just call mods if someone is disruptive we have enough mods
19:57 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> You want to disable all kick votes on all servers?
19:57 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah
19:57 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean I’m up for it
19:58 <+bridge> <murpi> Was it? If my memory serves me right, there was a particular server setting that specified a minimum requirement of people on a server before people can start votekicks.
19:58 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But won’t help much since there are still map votes but it’s a good start
19:58 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes, they never go through when needed, and only go through when edgy kids want to ban people for disgusting reasons
19:58 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Agree
19:58 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is chiller trolling us right now? he cant POSSIBLY think removing kick votes are a good idea
19:58 <+bridge> <learath2> Map votes are imo fine. Veto might need tuning a bit
19:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo map votes should require 100% vote yes
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they can go through on servers with fewer players
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> good and bad way
19:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Then they would be good
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think map votes should redirect everyone who voted yes to a different server IMO
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think map votes should redirect everyone who voted yes to a different server
19:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If there isn’t 100% yes just pick another server
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if the vote goes through
19:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Interesting
20:00 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I like that idea Heinrich
20:00 <+bridge> <learath2> People that are on servers for a long time should get a larger vote. New people can just move to another server
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good
20:00 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> So you can take others with you
20:00 <+bridge> <learath2> This also works
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. map votes are essentially trying to solve a coordination problem
20:00 <+bridge> <learath2> I actually even like it
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because "just find a new server" doesn't work
20:00 <+bridge> <learath2> Would merge
20:00 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not
20:00 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Find a new server works for me
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because it's a coordination problem
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you're not gonna reach everyone who would be up for it
20:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> You are alone on new server ?
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they're gonna split into different servers
20:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
20:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes very nice idea
20:01 <+bridge> <deen> Just call it something else then. It's no longer a server vote, it's a "match finder"
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> years-old idea of mine :p
20:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> First time I hear it
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I never wrote t down ^^
20:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But sound complicated technically
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
20:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> For now you can test leratos suggestion to replace kick votes with mods
20:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Just hire more mods there are enough applications
20:02 <+bridge> <murpi> year-old idea for me: https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/988018627376726096
20:02 <+bridge> <chairn> that's already too much imo
20:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Discord link
20:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Amazing
20:03 <+bridge> <murpi> get unbanned chillerdragon
20:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Send phone
20:03 <+bridge> <murpi> sending
20:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Receiving
20:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Thank unbanned
20:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes nice idea
20:03 <+bridge> <murpi> :greenthing:
20:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I already told you I can unlock your discord account if you want
20:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (but that's not what you want)
20:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I mean claming the name would be nice
20:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But I would prefer not to use discord in general
20:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I also have an openAI account that I refuse to use
20:05 <+bridge> <chairn> damn, that was a quick "im out" and then back 😛
20:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
20:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Would you really do that? Would be nice.
20:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
20:06 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if you actually try and replace the ddnet bot and name it ryochan im going to find a way to make it crash your entire system like chiller's bash commands
20:07 <+bridge> <murpi> chillerdragon: you have said you have been banned on an empty server by some random dude, is that correct?
20:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yesterday morning
20:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 19h run narcisstic
20:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 2 Russians
20:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Wanting to play novice maps instead
20:07 <+bridge> <murpi> Are you 100% certain the server was empty, and just you in it?
20:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Kicked me and voted other map
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No it was me and my dummy’s
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s why they had to kick me first to get the vote passed
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I used 2 ips
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Sue me
20:08 <+bridge> <murpi> ah, so you had MULTIPLE clients connected at the time, more than 5?
20:08 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> so this entire thing is basically chiller mad that he got kicked from a server once?
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Possibly I don’t remember
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Not once
20:09 <+bridge> <murpi> ok, you've lost your license to complain
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u cant cuz its made in rust
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I say this since years
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I need the clients to protect against such attacks
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@murpi)
20:09 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont care
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I got instant voted mutliple times
20:09 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if you name it ryochan im going to find a way to make it not named ryochan
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> With single ip
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @_voxeldoesart ryochan will love you
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Over the years
20:09 <+bridge> <murpi> No, you f'ed yourself by connecting more clients
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont hate ryo chan
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And the times before?
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@murpi)
20:10 <+bridge> <murpi> We use `sv_vote_kick_min 5` on our server so this wouldn't have happened
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But it’s 2 Russians
20:10 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> no she wont ryochan will force me to throw away my entire computer and join some sick cult or else shes going to hit it with a baseball bat when im sleeping
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And my max 4 tees
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Is 6 already
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Wouldn’t have helped
20:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But good to know murpi
20:11 <+bridge> <murpi> Yes, like I said, you screwed yourself over by connecting so many tees at once and being afk
20:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> That didn’t use to be the case
20:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Or never noticed due to instant map vote instead of kick
20:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, I'd do that
20:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Amazing
20:11 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if anything keep the bot's branding tee-ish because if it isnt then people will just think this server's just some generic discord server, and trolling would increase by 30%
20:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> U so hot
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> now heinrich?
20:13 <+bridge> <chairn> ahaha, my 1st year students also did this 😄
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> yea but @Learath2 and @heinrich5991 your suggestions for kick and map votes combined are way better than one server w out votes that would literally be heaven for me
20:14 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: IRC DMs
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> he slid ma dms
20:15 <+bridge> <chairn> probably because zip files has more guarentee of disk continuity rather than single files
20:15 <+bridge> <chairn> + also less system call
20:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Did somebody say locality principle?
20:18 <+bridge> <chairn> it also exists in non recursive zip
20:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not really
20:19 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/
20:19 <+bridge> <chairn> i wonder if /dev/zero isn't faster
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> yes /dev/zero is web scale
20:20 <+bridge> <chairn> is there a command to encrypt the disk with dd 😛 ?
20:20 <+bridge> <learath2> /dev/zero would be 0 entropy, not creating 😛
20:20 <+bridge> <chairn> but we just care about losing data here no?
20:21 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> great thinking robyt3! now i might be on the fbi watchlist after clicking that link!
20:21 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :L
20:21 <+bridge> <learath2> It was in reply to jupstar saying he is a creation person
20:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> epic
20:21 <+bridge> <chairn> watch out, he probably made the bot send him credentials 😄
20:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks we found the anti zip proof
20:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, interesting. but doesn't really matter because we don't "extract all"
20:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the bot is perfect now
20:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> jk
20:23 <+bridge> <chairn> well, auto input to disable afk stuff gives you an advantage as it allows you to finish 10+ hour runs more easily
20:24 <+bridge> <chairn> btw, this is not really a good way to spend energy both for you, ddnet server and the network...
20:24 <+bridge> <chairn> you can go in team and use /save feature for that 😉
20:25 <+bridge> <learath2> The user might
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1120418666920558593
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am creation guy
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now quick merge deploy, destroy everything
20:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I suppose. since I have not heard about it being a problem in minecraft, I'd guess it's a non-issue
20:26 <+bridge> <chairn> more towers clip in #showroom obviously
20:26 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't know how exactly it's constructed, is it possible to rig one file to extract like that?
20:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no. a single file has a maximum compression ratio
20:27 <+bridge> <chairn> 5 people required
20:27 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i cant tell if this is because you wrote it in rust or if its because of the actual content of the update
20:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but if you overlay a lot of files (zip file format!) you can get a quadratic size
20:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proofs dont matter in this chat
20:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the content
20:27 <+bridge> <learath2> It is a non issue, discord even stops you from sharing these zips
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah rust is better than JS and python, so its better than all other bots here
20:28 <+bridge> <chairn> well, 5 people for kick voting, 1 people for map changes. So in @ChillerDragon.* case, doesn't change a thing
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> right @ryozuki
20:28 <+bridge> <murpi> Keep reading ^^
20:28 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> i like discord
20:28 <+bridge> <learath2> YADDB is also in rust
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
20:28 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> WTF DISXCORD CHILLER REAL
20:28 <+bridge> <chairn> I don't think the client has that information from the server
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did heinrich write it?
20:28 <+bridge> <learath2> I wrote it
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 omg you so epci
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> It's powered by twilight-rs
20:29 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> omg this channel is full of replys
20:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dang
20:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> indeed
20:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 but u dont need to merge the bots, i think someone posted that u can run 2 instances on same bot
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Their discord is mlp themed so it's a bit creepy
20:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so lets not make it harder than it is
20:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks but to be perfect it requires the AGPL license
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> You can but we need to be careful that both don't every try to handle the same thing. It's also less than ideal, when I have time I'd rather have only one binary running tbh
20:30 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> there we go
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mine only uses slash commands
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nothing else
20:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is it fine for voxel to hate on a entire community?

20:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or he gets a pass
20:31 <+bridge> <learath2> Perfect, I cba to upgrade mine to slash commands yet. I guess we can try running them in parallel for a while
20:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :greenthing:
20:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ur late
20:31 <+bridge> <learath2> You are about 10 mins too late 😄
20:31 <+bridge> <murpi> Against Discord ToS
20:31 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, then guess I'll have to merge it
20:31 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> cant even stand up for himself over a single nickname
20:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just dont tell them
20:31 <+bridge> <chairn> almost there 😛
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> someone in fact sneaked an MPL dep in again xD
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120420773736218724/image.png
20:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @_voxeldoesart what? xd im just making the bias he has apparent
20:32 <+bridge> <chairn> actually no, i had the link ready, i don't know why i didn't send it
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear these maintainers xD
20:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
20:32 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> ok but what did heinrich have to do with this
20:32 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> 🚬
20:32 <+bridge> <chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120420919064678450/image.png
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 can u simply make an bot not list in the user list?
20:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he would bane me if i put (anything)hater here as my name
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for example CHater9000
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it doesnt matter how many bots right?
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ban*
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or give him offline status
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and the point is that he wont do that to you
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and he shouldnt
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but he is biased towards me
20:33 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> tsfreddie got away with it
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> more proof
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> of bias
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> merging is way too hard xD
20:33 <+bridge> <RustHater9001> ehhh fine
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use a different framework
20:34 <+bridge> <learath2> Did you end up using serenity?
20:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u should have  used the other
20:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> serenity is old news
20:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ryo chan is made with twilight
20:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> CHater9000 isn't exactly productive but would probably not earn attention from you
20:35 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess we just create one more bot YAYADDB, for now, then I can port yours one dat
20:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Day*
20:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you seem to think that I'm targeting you way harder than I am
20:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u have a bias its pretty obvious
20:35 <+bridge> <learath2> But serenity has 100% less my little pony theming, so idk
20:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wat
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i used what google gave me as first result 😂
20:36 <+bridge> <learath2> Join the twilight dc
20:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:36 <+bridge> <learath2> It's full of these twilight
20:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> OMG
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
20:36 <+bridge> <chairn> damn, #developer is really wild today
20:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i stay far
20:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs 10 ppl talk about different topics simultaniously
20:37 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> what
20:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 proof of good devs kek
20:37 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> @ChillerDragon new pfp dropped
20:37 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> get it rn
20:38 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is that the rust logo
20:38 <+bridge> <learath2> Exactly, the more alt your tastes the more likely you are to write good code and adhere to good software design principles, like the unix philosophy, look how beautifully modularized twilight is
20:39 <+bridge> <learath2> If you ever gave a lecture or written a paper you are 80% more likely to develop weird software
20:40 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ew lectures
20:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk if i can talk in front of many ppl
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> I probably could, but it's have to be a topic I'm extremely confident about. I wouldn't be able to go out there if I have any doubts at all
20:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hm. I can give talks
20:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats a sign
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> s\/it's/it'd/
20:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont use zips
20:44 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> valid pronouns
20:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> makes sense u can give talks, u speak well, alteast in text
20:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> honestly maybe i wouldnt mind giving a talk in spanish
20:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but i dont think im fluent enough to be confident in a english conference
20:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:44 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> noobnouns

20:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i love it
20:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also its a penguin
20:45 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> it looks ai generated
20:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so linux
20:46 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> nuh uh
20:46 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> nah it was made by someone who makes   kinda gross content
20:46 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> for me its https://time.is/New_York
20:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> new yorker?
20:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> yuck
20:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://time.is/Denver
20:47 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> around that place
20:47 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont live in new york, but its same timezone
20:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im a barceloner
20:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that sounds awful
20:48 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> cataloner
20:51 <+bridge> <gerdoe> what a day huh
20:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> my neighbor keeps bouncing off the walls
20:51 <+bridge> <gerdoe> sun makes you guys go crazy xd
20:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> i can literally hear her running back and forth down the hall and slamming into something
20:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> over and over
20:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maybe you should help them or
20:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> anything
20:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> it’s a little kid
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hey
20:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyone recommends a good headset
20:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for music and gaming
20:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 100€+ only
20:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no cheap stuff
20:56 <+bridge> <vertezzo> 💀
20:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gotta use that software engineer salary
20:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i recommend to not use a bt headset
20:57 <+bridge> <learath2> I've been using Sennheiser HD598 for a while now, it's imho the perfect headphones that work for music AND gaming
20:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> beyerdynamic mmx 300
20:58 <+bridge> <learath2> Openbacks are a must, atleast imo, the wide soundstage just feels so much better for me
20:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 599?
20:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.amazon.es/Sennheiser-HD-599-Auriculares-abiertos/dp/B07Q7S7247
20:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 200€, quite steep
20:58 <+bridge> <learath2> It's the same headphone but they just keep adding and subtracting 1 for some reason and changing the color, bizarre marketing behaviour
20:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.amazon.es/Beyerdynamic-MMX-300-Auriculares-Generaci%C3%B3n/dp/B06WGVJ9GY
20:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ?
20:59 <+bridge> <learath2> Maybe a new version is out? I got mine for 150~ euros
20:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> made in germany
20:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> I figure he wants a mic right
20:59 <+bridge> <learath2> Or inflation hit again
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> since it’s headset
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> not headphone
20:59 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, I use a modmic
21:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😃
21:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xD
21:00 <+bridge> <learath2> It's really hard to find both the sound profile you want and for it to have a mic
21:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if sound quality is better without mic i dont mind
21:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i can buy a mic
21:00 <+bridge> <learath2> So I picked them separately
21:00 <+bridge> <pipou_tw> I always go for bose headset
21:00 <+bridge> <learath2> modmic I might not recommend, I think next time I'll just get a standalone mic with a stand
21:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i got a 100€ bose speakers xd but i want also headset for details
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki i have this
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.amazon.de/Cloud-Pro-Gaming-Headset-HyperX-HX-HSCA-RD-EM-Rot/dp/B076GT6XJ9/
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i got it for like 40€ in sale
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have it since 4-5 years
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fake leather dies after like 2-3 years
21:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> ath m50x maybe worth
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else good headset
21:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good enough
21:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> too cheap
21:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i already have a 70€ one
21:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:02 <+bridge> <syrinok> I went from ath m50x to hd598 to HD6XX
21:02 <+ChillerDragon> 3yr discord dm backlog is gold
21:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1687201348.png
21:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> better invest into OLED screens, so its cheaper for me soon
21:03 <+bridge> <learath2> Don't go too overboard with your headphones btw, it will be insanely hard to drive
21:03 <+bridge> <syrinok> Would recommend HD6XX / HD650 (same thing, XX is just from drop)
21:03 <+bridge> <pipou_tw> My bose headset is about 300 or 400€, it does the job, the quality is great (no mic)
21:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> drive?
21:04 <+bridge> <syrinok> Would recommend HD6XX / HD650 (same thing, XX is just from drop)
21:04 <+bridge> <syrinok> Also slightly lower quality materials used, but the price save is worth it from drop
21:04 <+bridge> <learath2> High end headphones have high impedance, so you'll need an amplifier to get any sound out of them
21:04 <+bridge> <syrinok> Ya
21:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk
21:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my backplate has this gold thing
21:04 <+bridge> <learath2> Your motherboards soundcard can't deliver enough power to get sound out of a 300 ohm headphone
21:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> all headphones i had are so loud
21:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> if you care about sound quality you technically shouldn’t be using mobo audio at all
21:05 <+bridge> <learath2> Well maybe it can nowadays, idk how modern motherboards are built
21:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i got a 200€ mobo iirc
21:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> doesn’t matter
21:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> desktop dac and amp is the move if u want the cleanest sound
21:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> price ≠ quality btw
21:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> or another digital solution
21:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sometimes it correlates
21:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which u recommend
21:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i hope not too costly then xd
21:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> they’re expensive but also not entirely necessary. if i was to get a headset I’d prob focus on comfort and have audio quality as second most important
21:07 <+bridge> <learath2> sound is also very very objective, my hd600 sounds very meh to my friend who is a bass enjoyer
21:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> and most can’t hear the difference between motherboard analog audio and discrete stack
21:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do i rly need a dac with learath headphones
21:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or whathever
21:08 <+bridge> <syrinok> no
21:08 <+bridge> <learath2> The one I initially recommended is very very easy to drive, it's 60 ohms
21:08 <+bridge> <learath2> still you get a cleaner sound out of a dac/amp but not that crucial
21:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> you can also get an audio interface that does most of the same stuff
21:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> but iirc drivers for my scarlett were weird on linux
21:11 <+bridge> <murpi> modern ones should be able drive headphones up to 300 ohm
21:11 <+bridge> <syrinok> I used the 598s without an amp/dac and they were solid, the earpads detach on the inside and the foam touches your ears directly after a few years from my experience
21:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> As long as it’s not velcro
21:11 <+bridge> <learath2> But it's common enough that you can get earpads, I replaced mine twice
21:11 <+bridge> <syrinok> Ya
21:12 <+bridge> <syrinok> HD6XX have way better audio :brownbear:
21:13 <+bridge> <learath2> I haven't used my 600 in a while, idk why I think I feel lazy to change headphones 😄
21:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B550-A-PRO
21:14 <+bridge> <learath2> The way they list specs it's not very useful, so idk. @murpi says it's ok nowadays, so maybe you'll be ok. Just wanted to remind you to be careful with the impedance
21:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> u could have a $500 mobo and it would probably be as bad noise-wise
21:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can it break the headphone
21:14 <+bridge> <syrinok> no
21:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> how do u have speakers set up rn
21:15 <+bridge> <learath2> It'll just be very quiet and you'll lose sound accuracy since the headphones are usually the most accurate within a range
21:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i connect them to the back plate the headphones port xd
21:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think maybe i can first buy the dac
21:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> so it's not usb or spdif in or anything
21:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:16 <+bridge> <learath2> Noisewise onboard audio is indeed not very salvageable, you'll get similar characteristics almost everywhere. It's just too close to the other components to be properly isolated 😄
21:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nah its jack
21:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Here is what I'd do. I'd first get headphones, something up to 300 ohms, whatever you feel like
21:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u have a dac
21:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> whats the usual price range
21:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> you can get them as cheap as $50 but they are usually at least $100
21:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> also need amp tho
21:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> same deal ish
21:18 <+bridge> <learath2> I have a dac/amp combo a fiio e10k
21:18 <+bridge> <learath2> iit's not the best but it does the job
21:18 <+bridge> <syrinok> Ah, I just upgraded from the e10k lol
21:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what u got
21:19 <+bridge> <syrinok> magni/modi stack
21:19 <+bridge> <murpi> Topping DX3 Pro best change my mind
21:19 <+bridge> <learath2> the new k3 looks cool, but I think my next upgrade will be a split dac and amp, not because it's better but because I love tinkering with stuff like this
21:19 <+bridge> <learath2> yeah I'm aiming for a magni/modi too 😄
21:20 <+bridge> <learath2> I might actually get a vali instead of magni just so I can mess around with vacuum tubes
21:20 <+bridge> <learath2> always wondered if they make any difference
21:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😃
21:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk what u guys talking about
21:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and im scared
21:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> tube amps
21:20 <+bridge> <syrinok> Literally just got em, so can't make a proper opinion yet, they can definitely go way louder lmao
21:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> he is officially off the deep end
21:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is there open source  ones
21:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> not afaik
21:20 <+bridge> <learath2> magni and modi are split dac and amp
21:21 <+bridge> <syrinok> the E10K is a combo
21:21 <+bridge> <learath2> It's actually not very advanced electronics, you could make your own 😄
21:21 <+bridge> <syrinok> it did well, but I had to max it out with my HD6XX to get the volume I wanted
21:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> magni and modi are 210 together right
21:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> they all use the same TI chips under the hood anyway
21:22 <+bridge> <syrinok> something like that, ya
21:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-plus
21:22 <+bridge> <syrinok> You need RCA cables with it as well
21:22 <+bridge> <learath2> There is that one chip everyone and their mother uses to go from digital to analog, up until the price gets to above 200$
21:22 <+bridge> <syrinok> Doesn't come with
21:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> here is the question
21:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do u rly notice the audio quality
21:24 <+bridge> <learath2> Eeeh, any dac/amp is better than none for me because my motherboard has very noisy onboard audio
21:24 <+bridge> <learath2> ymmv though
21:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> trying to self justify 200€ here
21:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> you don't have to spend $200
21:25 <+bridge> <learath2> As I said, I would start smaller 😄
21:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> go big or go home
21:25 <+bridge> <syrinok> Going from E10K to magni/modi I think a little bit, ya. I feel like I can hear finer details, the headphones make the biggest difference in the end I think
21:25 <+bridge> <learath2> but you do make an sw engineer salary
21:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i rarely indulge myself so
21:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I would spend the money on better headphones and grab a e10k or k3
21:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> good opportunity
21:25 <+bridge> <murpi> buy abyss diana v2's
21:25 <+bridge> <murpi> they make people actually cry
21:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> xdd
21:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok
21:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats too big
21:26 <+bridge> <syrinok> You will definitely notice not being able to reach the volume you want if you don't have a dac/amp though
21:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> go big or go home
21:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i saw 3700€ pricetag
21:26 <+bridge> <syrinok> With higher end headphones
21:26 <+bridge> <murpi> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT3SInHr9ck
21:26 <+bridge> <murpi> they even made linus cry
21:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think ill start with E10K  then
21:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just need that right
21:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> combo
21:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, especially if the impedance is high. 60 ohms I can hit very annoying volume levels np
21:28 <+bridge> <learath2> 300 ohms it's getting a little annoying, 600 ohms isn't even close to where I want it to be
21:28 <+bridge> <syrinok> E10K has a weird issue with lower volumes where the volume isn't the same on both sides, at least for me and some other dude I read online
21:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:28 <+bridge> <learath2> You can try the new fiio K3, it reviewed decently, though I don't have one
21:29 <+bridge> <chairn> i bought this one in 2021, kinda happy with it
21:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> usb-c
21:29 <+bridge> <syrinok> So I wouldn't personally rec the e10k, even tho it's decent
21:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm i think my mobo has a usb-c port
21:29 <+bridge> <chairn> price is not 100% correlated to quality
21:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> no but a certain price range can be a red flag
21:30 <+bridge> <learath2> yeah, those headphones are actually some of the best I've heard on that price point
21:30 <+bridge> <learath2> my upstairs neighbour has them 😄
21:31 <+bridge> <murpi> every major has them too
21:31 <+bridge> <murpi> :greenthing:
21:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u mean this right https://www.amazon.es/FiiO-6953175710202-K3s-Negro/dp/B09B35TCC7/
21:31 <+bridge> <learath2> but it's no high end headphone, has a rather flat and boring sound curve and the closed backs are a dealbreaker for me
21:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the one u recommended? xd
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> what a weird little guy
21:32 <+bridge> <learath2> yep, again I did not use one and my e10k didn't have the unbalanced sound issue
21:32 <+bridge> <learath2> nah the one hyperx headphone jupstar sent
21:32 <+bridge> <chairn> yeah, L3 or M1 electronics cursus gives you the necessary background
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i never got the high/low end controls on the dac itself
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'd much sooner use software eq
21:33 <+bridge> <learath2> https://www.ti.com/product/DAC8812 here buy some of these
21:33 <+bridge> <learath2> make your own
21:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do i need any special cable
21:33 <+bridge> <chairn> note however that breadboard analog circuitry is really bad, quality wise
21:34 <+bridge> <learath2> Nah, I use amazon basics cables
21:34 <+bridge> <chairn> printed card is better but you can still get artefacts
21:34 <+bridge> <chairn> that's why i hate analog electronics,  you never know what's wrong with it
21:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 so my pc jack goes to one of these? xd
21:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120436632659705926/61b7lUCKEIL._AC_SL1500_.jpg
21:35 <+bridge> <learath2> yeah I guess there are some quirks to analog electronics that make it really annoying to work with
21:35 <+bridge> <chairn> if you make your own, don't forget to over filter the power supply
21:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i feel so stupid
21:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> no, digital into the dac
21:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> analog out (headphone)
21:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah ok
21:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so usb-c
21:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> digital to analog converter
21:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
21:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Your pc goes to usbc
21:35 <+bridge> <learath2> in front you get your headphone outputs
21:36 <+bridge> <learath2> the others on the back are for weirdos that like to mess around
21:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> usb 3.2 rear: 1(Gen 2, Type C), 1(Gen 2, Type A), 2(Gen 1, Type A
21:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if u can drive a sub with that coax out
21:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think i got a usb c port
21:36 <+bridge> <murpi> audiophile *cough*
21:36 <+bridge> <learath2> *insert LA Noire doubt meme*
21:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
21:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so the coax
21:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what does it do
21:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im here to learn
21:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im getting the Sennheiser HD 599 and the k3
21:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ez 300€
21:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 oh
21:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does this work on linux
21:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the dac
21:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> it should
21:38 <+bridge> <learath2> With the ones on the back you can drive speakers
21:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> most digital audio devicer are treated as one
21:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> most digital audio devicer are treated the same
21:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh!
21:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have speakers!
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it has a AUX IN
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> omaigad
21:39 <+bridge> <learath2> usb-c audio is a standard, I think linux should be fine
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what kind of cable is for aux
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my bose speakers
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> 1/4" or 3.5mm almost definitely
21:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont speak american units
21:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt look rly big
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'm pretty sure it's known as 1/4" everywhere
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> but
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's probably 3.5mm then
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> pic
21:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.amazon.es/Syncwire-Cable-Audio-Auxiliar-Chapado/dp/B01I0SI1SG/
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> avoid braided nylon stuff
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> good old rubber is usually better
21:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> doesn't fray on you
21:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u prepared to see dust
21:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120438235638800464/IMG_20230619_214104.jpg
21:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> front headphones looks like 1/4" to me
21:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> that is 3.5mm
21:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> front headphones looks like 1/4" to me on the k3
21:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i should clean this lmao
21:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh it says it's 3.5mm on the k3 too
21:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn this thing is even smaller than i thought
21:43 <+bridge> <learath2> it's bitesized
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> will the speakers sound better?
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they are already p loud
21:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> if you are using analog out from computer i assume they have their own amp
21:44 <+bridge> <learath2> The speakers probably have their own amp, are they connected to power?
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye to powa
21:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea then it will be good
21:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> if u can get it all hooked up
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so i can have speakers and headphones
21:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> excellent
21:45 <+bridge> <learath2> I actually don't know what happens if you connect both 😄
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rly?
21:45 <+bridge> <learath2> I haven't had speakers in years
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> it should output to both
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> i see no switching on the k3
21:46 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing it works and you need to just turn off the speakers if you don't want them outputting
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i can adjust volume on the speaker itself
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
21:46 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, perfect
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is what i do
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok i just spent 310 €
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wish me luck
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it gets tomorrow thanks to amazon
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have chinesium amp and i use bookshelf speakers from a 2000s hifi set
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> there is no return from audio porn
21:47 <+bridge> <learath2> this is how daddy bezos justifies his monopoly
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thanks daddy
21:47 <+bridge> <learath2> if it's your first upgrade from standard consumer hardware it'll be quite a bump, atleast it was for me
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120439837393178664/image.png
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
21:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> u got the braided
21:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> smh
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye all were braided kinda
21:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> should we start removing unused assets
21:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> wait,  i dont think u need that
21:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> if headset has a cable
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> one more aux doesnt kill
21:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> also does the hd 599 come 1/4" in or 3.5mm l,earath?
21:48 <+bridge> <learath2> After the first leap sadly you'll never get that level of upgrade again 😄
21:49 <+bridge> <learath2> 3.5mm and an adapter for 1/4"
21:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> sweet
21:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what unused assets?
21:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the unused stars?
21:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Auriculares HD 599 Cable de 3 m / jack recto de 6,3 mm Cable de 1,2 m / jack recto de 3,5 mm Adaptador de 6,3 mm a 3,5 mm
21:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didn't read that
21:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz
21:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in euro units its 6,3mm
21:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and the unused sounds too
21:49 <+bridge> <learath2> (No one calls it that) 😄
21:50 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> people are saying that "people can use those in mods" when no one does
21:50 <+bridge> <learath2> ((or maybe the audio people do call it that, idk, I'm not in the eu audio scene))
21:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> i've only ever heard 1/4"
21:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can people use them in mods?
21:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. serverside
21:50 <+bridge> <learath2> anyway, let's stop hogging the developer channel with audio talk
21:50 <+bridge> <louis.place> i remember my first purchase like this lol
21:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> what u got louis
21:51 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> maybe but i doubt anyone will
21:51 <+bridge> <louis.place> well its my last purchase as well
21:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:51 <+bridge> <louis.place> since it was recent
21:51 <+bridge> <louis.place> dt 990 open backs
21:51 <+bridge> <learath2> dt 990 are great headphones too
21:51 <+bridge> <louis.place> magni schit or whatever
21:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> excellent
21:52 <+bridge> <louis.place> few months after that i got condenser mic pair and a behringer interface to record my piano
21:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> finally i can watch anime with good audio
21:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kekw
21:52 <+bridge> <louis.place> but its very costly
21:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gotta hear that fine grained japanese
21:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just realized
21:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> we probably should have pinged tela 20 mins ago
21:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> he has a degree in this shit
21:53 <+bridge> <louis.place> oh yea lmfao
21:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for me a good audio test is any of melodysheep videos
21:53 <+bridge> <louis.place> u can now hear the intro song in higher hd i guess
21:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA
21:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> epic
21:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im queueing this for tomorrow
21:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think now i go to the store
21:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> and get caffeine
21:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:54 <+bridge> <learath2> which version did you get btw? there is a 32, 250 and 600 ohm version of it
21:54 <+bridge> <louis.place> 250
21:54 <+bridge> <louis.place> hmm didnt know there was a 600 ohm version lol
21:55 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bro we are not colonizing mars by 2040 💀
21:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i read the fio works on linux but better disable autosuspend
21:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> guys chiller logged into discord
21:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> he accepted my friend request 11 mins ago
21:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> watch the vid its epic
22:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> epic narration
22:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the start u hear david attenborough voice
22:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if ur a space stuff fan must watch
22:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @_voxeldoesart https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OczrdOqAs-k
22:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rogue ai video
22:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> a single youtuber does better movies than studios
22:18 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah because the youtuber doesnt have some executive rushing them to death
22:19 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i feel extremely bad for the VFX people in modern cinema
22:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can feel bad about many ppl
22:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> programmers also face crunches
22:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> feel bad for them too pls
22:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
22:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah!!!
22:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> pin the blame on the millionares who set ungodly deadlines
22:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i did
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> back from store
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got stuff
22:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u got me a dac?
22:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> im not ur amazon driver
22:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :tw_sad:
22:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> sry
22:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got juice
22:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> and monster
22:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> white monster?
22:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i only buy the white one
22:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no cals
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> that one is good but only sometimes
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> i buy all of them sometimes except for some of the 'ultra' ones
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> i avoid the gold, green, purple ones
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> orange
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> etc
22:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i dont like the classic one
22:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so i only tasted the white
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
22:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont rly want the ones that are not zero
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> the original one is good but it's too sweet sometimes
22:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i rarely drink em anyway, just in summer cuz too hot for coffee
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> when i make home coffee it's never good
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have a italian thing
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u put on the stove
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well mine is induction
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> works too
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have a french press
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> and forgot about it
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/coffee-good-morning-cup-gif-16067685
22:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> i might try that
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> ik what u mean
22:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have a working async implementation for my thing but it crashes on msvc
22:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> and i don't have the qt creator cdb plugin
22:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'm about to pull my hair out with windbg i think
22:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wouldnt tinker with async cc++
22:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust atleast provides me the safety
22:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> u just need to understand multithreading and u are safe in most situations
22:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh trust me i know
22:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 😬😬
22:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 😬😬😬
22:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> there is a saying
22:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Understand multi threading
22:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
22:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> multithreading is one of the hardest things to grasp
22:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not even pro C old devs do it perfect
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not even _only_ the memory safety. Deadlock etc can happen so easily and sometimes hard to debug
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Multi threading defs one of the hardest in large scale
22:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> u need to find ways to store and use ur data at appropriate times
22:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> deadlocks can also happen in rust though
22:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
22:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you need some locking discipline to avoid that
22:31 <+bridge> <learath2> moka pot
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes i confuse the terms
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> data race
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> race condition
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think u can have data races in rust
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not race conditions
22:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the other way around
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah ok
22:31 <+bridge> <learath2> iirc deadlocks can't be impossible (insert halting problem here)
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> async is also sometimes really hard
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u often think linear, and msgs can come out of order
22:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and hardware is racey
22:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> as long as you ask the programmer to prove their way out of the deadlocks, the program will be deadlock free
22:32 <+bridge> <learath2> Maybe in a non turing complete language you can have no deadlocks
22:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this ^
22:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> actually
22:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what if u have a suficiently locked down language
22:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like the borrow checker does
22:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you could make deadlock detection work at runtime ^^
22:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is an option
22:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also use RefCell
22:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that'd work. as long as you have an escape hatch, it'll still be turing complete
22:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its only cool if the compiler can do it
22:34 <+bridge> <learath2> A supervisor (hypervisor?) could issue all locks and at runtime force a context switch to itself to check if anything is deadlocked every once in a while
22:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or just use an actor system
22:35 <+bridge> <learath2> I imagine the performance characteristics would be great *insert non-existant sarcasm indicator*
22:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think erlang u cant have deadlocks
22:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz its message passing
22:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
22:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> i dont think hypervisor is the right term but i  see what u mean
22:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on the way you define deadlock I guess
22:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> the moste extensive implementation i've ever seen for runtime deadlock detection is just damage control
22:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh no it froze!
22:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> 'oh no it froze!'
22:36 <+bridge> <chairn> the program will not exist then
22:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what program?
22:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u mean formal proof?
22:36 <+bridge> <chairn> the program written by a programmer who proved there's no deadlock
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats why we need AI
22:37 <+bridge> <chairn> AI is not a proof
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has more time and is never lazy
22:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure I understand
22:37 <+bridge> <chairn> isn't this purely impossible?
22:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can prove that a program has no deadlocks
22:37 <+bridge> <chairn> hmm
22:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> the best way to prove it is with the program
22:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. by always taking locks in the same order
22:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use "AI" as a way to try to generate your proofs
22:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if it generates one, you're done
22:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if not, it didn't help
22:38 <+bridge> <chairn> ah ye true
22:38 <+bridge> <chairn> but that only works in simple case iirc
22:38 <+bridge> <chairn> like if you need A,B and thread 2 needs B,C, you're kinda screwed
22:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> deadlock freedom is just another property of programs
22:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no
22:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you always take the locks alphabetically
22:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you're fine
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just code purely single threaded, then u deadlock free
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proof
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> thread 1 takes A, thread 2 takes B, then deadlock
22:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where's the deadlock?
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> ah
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> need thread 3
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> oh
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> oj
22:39 <+bridge> <chairn> ok
22:40 <+bridge> <chairn> ok, got it 😛
22:40 <+bridge> <learath2> Is there a name to this btw? It's very intuitive to me, but I had lots of trouble trying to explain this to someone just learning these things
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thread 1 takes A, then B, then A, then B
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> same order
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> deadlock
22:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what you mean
22:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in my model you can't take the same lock twice at the same time
22:40 <+bridge> <chairn> makes all threads ask locks to a single master thread, problem solved too ?
22:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls port this to ddnet :^)
22:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you mean "only have one lock"?
22:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that also works as a strategy 😉
22:41 <+bridge> <chairn> now harder problem, can you prevent livelock ?
22:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, proofs
22:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> anyone here aware of shared memory or memory mapped files/memory mappings in use in ddnet (on windows)? i'm getting sigill on MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache from ntoskrnl
22:41 <+bridge> <learath2> thread 1 takes A, B, C, thread 2 needs A, C. If they go in alphabetical order, thread 2 won't reach for C before having A, which makes a deadlock impossible
22:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can prove that your system will always continue to produce output, e.g.
22:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> o shit that's the library I am linking to fix the same undefined references from the CI a little while ago.
22:42 <+bridge> <learath2> s\/takes/needs/
22:42 <+bridge> <chairn> sigill from system library is really the cherry on top
22:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf? maybe it's trying to call a pure virtual fn on a child class that has no implementation? i have seen this with dlls
22:42 <+bridge> <chairn> like the system literally saying "go fuck yourself" 😄
22:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think this is a weird manifestation of linkage issues
22:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it might always be you holding it wrong
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> because ntoskrnl.lib is what i had to link to remove the undefined references
22:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> couldn't really find a name for it quickly
22:44 <+bridge> <chairn> well, im not holding anything right now
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> i could also see which ntoskrnl.lib it's bringing into things. i'm on mingw atm, could be a calling convention mismatch
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> if using a system32 lib
22:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> stupid stuff
22:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably learned it in some uni course
22:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> make a case study of ddnet locks
22:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :greenthing:
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> locks arent even only hard part
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u most probably also want signaling
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there u have "randomness" like spurious wakeups
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u could end up in a state where you aren't deadlocked, but simply never wake up, bcs u missed a signal etc.
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> list is long
22:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and also cosmic rays
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all my fails in ddnet were cosmic rays yet
22:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yep
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> locks arent even only hard part
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u most probably also want signaling
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there u have "randomness" like spurious wakeups
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u could end up in a state where you aren't deadlocked, but simply never wake up, bcs u missed a signal etc. (ok this is kind of a deadlock)
22:51 <+bridge> <learath2> it's definitely hard to make a correct multithreaded program
22:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> correct  and safe
22:51 <+bridge> <learath2> the http module we have in ddnet is completely insane, while trying to do it properly tm I had to think about so many things and I'm still not sure it's completely correct
22:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is obnoxious
22:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> our current one is not that insane, right?
22:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> just starting a thread for every http request
22:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, just a job
22:54 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah but the way it interfaces with the updater is not very sane
22:54 <+bridge> <learath2> updater assumes the old http module which was doing requests one by one
22:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
23:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> also it seems that this crash is only happening once it tries to populate the server browser with the data form the masters/
23:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> but im not sure
23:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> also it seems that this crash is only happening once it tries to populate the server browser with the data from the masters/
23:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> backtrace is completely unhelpful
23:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do we have a bug?
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk
23:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or is that your pr
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> mine but not related to my code afaict
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk yet
23:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What issue does it throw
23:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> :flag_unk:
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh i don't know that function, but I'm sure it's a bug in our code then
23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't make the code to complicated😂
23:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> huh
23:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean did it happen in master branch
23:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> wow seems mingw ftell will as 0 if too big but msvc will do -1
23:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> just had to fix a stupid crash for that
23:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Better don't use c api
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> i am using io_tell
23:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah better don't use that xd
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think we've gone over this
23:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> i already wrote it anyway and it's gone thru review
23:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> better to just not touch it for now if it works
23:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Msvc c implementation makes c more random than it already is xd
23:26 <+bridge> <chairn> c api as true random crash generator
23:26 <+bridge> <chairn> c api as a true random crash generator
23:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> wow seems mingw ftell will tell as 0 if too big but msvc will do -1
