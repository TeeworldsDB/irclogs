10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How old is your operating system?
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or which one is it in first place
10:46 < bridge> <satofan> Ubuntu 16.04
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why such an outdated OS?
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's from 2016
10:46 < bridge> <satofan> Will it work on the new version?
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't think we support that sry.  You can try to self compile, but maybe even that won't work
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sure
11:00 < bridge> <badoumed> Hello, i would like to know what's the hitbox of the tee, iff someone have a screenshot of it or know how i can see it thank to helpin me üôÇ
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #questions
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has multiple hitboxes tho, maybe there is a wiki about it
11:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> currently as a learning material about the protocol, map format and etc
11:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> might use it to build a little ddnet client
11:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> i also use your resources https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/
11:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> thank u
15:11 < zhn> did anyone answer to pathos? he can use https://uniqueclan.net/submit or unique discord server to submit the maps
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ddper servers are no longer visible in the ddnet client
17:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> Because they force people onto a client ?
17:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you can't connect to them via the ddnet client. I've worked with them so that they can still use the ddnet mastersrv
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> I see thanks for clarifying
18:08 < bridge> <Ewan> There‚Äôs always a way
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> True, just update
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> I think nix would also address lots of packaging/versioning/libc issues that come with an old is like that

18:10 < bridge> <Ewan> nix is huge tbh
18:10 < bridge> <Ewan> the only way I can develop on my Mac sanely
19:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> *insert Nixon and nixoff joke*
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nix backwards is xin. a gores player
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> np for useless information
19:13 < bridge> <robyt3> It might make loading a bit slower but that worth the cost and we could eventually load assets threaded to avoid this. It shouldn't have a significant impact on performance while playing.

19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> typically yes but if the whole zip is in memory then that overhead doesn‚Äôt really exist
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> plus now you can decode the pngs in parallel

21:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 yo, do you remember when I was asking you about symbol tables? After trying to find the answer in other people's code but I'll just ask you xd. Is it ok to store a symbol table in a struct which is created in a parser? It's just initialized to a default value during parsing and filled later.

Is it ok to store a symbol table in a struct which is created in a parser? It's just initialized to a default value during parsing and filled later. An example of da struct:
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> struct Block {
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat>   stmts: Vec<Stmt>, // used by parser
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat>   table: SymbolTable // initialized using SymbolTable::default()
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }

22:31 < bridge> <dizyyy123> how do I write my client?
23:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> just fork the ddnet repo and edit the source for the client
23:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> u can find how to build for your specific system in the readme
