00:07 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: antiping is more than normal tw would do, usually it mostly only predicts your own character
00:29 <+nemo2> huh...
00:30 <+nemo2> I guess deterministic lockstep isn't practical in a realtime shooter
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no way ðŸ˜„
00:30 <+nemo2> Spring uses that, but I 'spose batching operations when playing general isn't a big deal
00:31 <+nemo2> ... and Hedgewars ofc, but since it is turnbased is no problem at all
00:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Deadpool> Is it better to play with it all the time or only when laggy?
00:33 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: seen the backtrace I posted in #hedgewars?
00:39 <+nemo2> nooope
00:39 <+nemo2> lookng
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Deadpool antiping causes shaky movement. Generaly everything is shaky, if prediction fails in predict :PP Because it need to correct state
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> of every object on your screen
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Savander you can find the community version of qt here: https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> seems they try their best to hide it
09:32 <+MagicLau> qwq, how to deal with mouse delay in ddnet after version 10? I used to enjoy 9.0.2 but there is something wrong with my laptop. When I use my new laptop to play DDNet 9.0.2, the mouse pointer will always move in one direction in game window. Sadly. ;(
09:37 <+MagicLau> Problem in 9.0.2: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t6PoGkHrK_gr56rxgjHZJ0Gk5rcETV1G
09:59 <+MagicLau> Just changed some graphic setting..Little better...
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> weird
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> try to play with inp_mouseold
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 0 or 1
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and mouse delay is caused by v-sync
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> hey something is from with my client
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> wrong*
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> what is wrong ?
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> if i connect to a server then close teeworlds
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> start it again and join the same server then my old tee is still there
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> oh ? sorry i can help you askÂ @Dev
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> and additional i have hard lags
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> @Dev someone can help me ?
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> which client do you use, and how do you close your client?
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> just normal on the exit button
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> and i use the 10.8.6 client
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hm
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> let's join a server together and you show me
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> k
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Stangjo> my name is "Brezzel"
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> follow me, I'm heinrich5991
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> @HMH can you check why it is so laggy for everyone. we have a good ping but the laggs are so hard
23:52 <+ReiTW38> hi
23:54 <+ReiTW38> well, if i strongly wanted to remove the score option on server side (so edit 00:00 to 000 as vanilla score)
23:54 <+ReiTW38> how could i do, my idea was to rename the gamemode
23:55 <@heinrich5991> yea, I think you'd need to do that
23:55 <+ReiTW38> but
23:55 <+ReiTW38> by doing that, there's some bugs on the server
23:55 <+ReiTW38> like bullets which aren't snapping and more
23:56 <@heinrich5991> regarding your "ha?"
23:56 <@heinrich5991> ReiTW38: 
23:56 <@heinrich5991> this should make the tab flash or something
23:56 <@heinrich5991> like that you can call people without PMing them
23:56 <@heinrich5991> just say
23:56 <@heinrich5991> heinrich5991: your message
23:56 <+ReiTW38> haa
23:56 <+ReiTW38> heinrich5991, ez
23:56 <@heinrich5991> yep, like that
23:57 <@heinrich5991> mh... dunno about the bullets tbh
23:57 <+ReiTW38> heinrich5991, well, idk why it does that, but it is annoying :/
