02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @jupeyy_keks Btw, about this
02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 
02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> As you for some reason like to think on 4:3 screen players, I gotchu
02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 
02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> My idea is, if the screen is 4:3, making the ranking be a menu that can be opened from below
02:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431075144981282908/image.png?ex=68fc1816&is=68fac696&hm=27f681fd2b002050ba363a73ce1b4173556838eaf36f203e7fa44db1dcbb1de8&
02:26 < bridge> <Ewan> good luck
02:27 < bridge> <Ewan> all it will do is make you take other classes to become a more well rounded person (not dev) and get you more interviews
02:27 < bridge> <Ewan> worth it if you're not paying out of pocket for it
02:27 < bridge> <Ewan> us citizenship is very hard to get
02:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it's going straight to their pockets bro
02:29 < bridge> <Ewan> everything in these industries has had the price artificially jacked so the acceptable margin for salaries gets higher
02:30 < bridge> <Ewan> so you can have jobs that pay $100, $200, fucking $700k a year when the average in the country is ~$68k
02:31 < bridge> <Ewan> I see that is a German job posting so it's probably somewhat different but their prices and funding goals are just gonna mirror what's acceptable elsewhere that it's happening
02:39 < bridge> <louis> 700k salary for industry job seems pretty difficult unless you're very senior or high up
02:39 < bridge> <louis> or if u have an insane cv etc
02:40 < bridge> <louis> they have an absolute nothingburger website
02:57 < bridge> <Teero> what?

07:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i fixed it
07:02 < bridge> <Teero> yes good
07:02 < bridge> <Teero> could still be a little further imo, its hard to see the gap

13:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Simply put, he still wants to be in control of what features get into DDNet, since some implementation requests might contradict with his current works
13:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The game's at the point, where it should grow both player and contribution side, but grows too fast on the player side compared to contribution side
13:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The secrecy in some works heinrich puts also don't help with the "voting system", if not even the community manager could be informed about potential contradictions of his work
13:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> All I understand too well, when it comes to receiving requests from random people across the community and have to decide whether to put the effort into implementing it without any backlashes from other works.... but the way it's currently handled, I would say it's more backlash towards ignorance, than whatever I just wrote based on experience
13:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, if anyone, maybe Stepfunn, Aoe or any other influential Youtuber / Streamer could like make a personal poll on
13:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> whether the idea should be implemented
13:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and how it should be implemented
13:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (we already had a room in #town-hall, https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1412075332944531568)
13:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But town hall is not bridged to irc so it has no relevancy what so ever
13:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bruj
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 can we merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10964?
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> probably not yet? I still see unresolved conversations about important stuff in there
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> I also did not follow along since I proposed a design for it, I think you ended up implementing something different at the end of the day
15:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is unresolved?
15:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a bit different but close
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> heinrichs review comments, if you think they are resolved mark them resolved
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> I would need to review it myself too, I have an exam today, maybe tomorrow I can take a look
16:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well I think his opinion is worse than mine and he just went in saying he does not like it and not how to fix it. And he ignores my response. So he has no right to stale my pr like that. Just go review and merge

16:10 < bridge> <vahemaaa> ‚ÄúOnly maintainers (not translators) need to convert between them.‚Äù
16:10 < bridge> <vahemaaa> i didnt understand this, do volunteers translate on weblate then maintainers convert and update ddnet/languages ?
16:21 < bridge> <aegisub> > Well I think his opinion is worse than mine
16:21 < bridge> <aegisub> Weird, I usually think other people's opinions are better than mine
16:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You've reached optimum when you can't tell whose opinions are better

18:09 < bridge> <denkr666> What to do if the servers are not working in DDNET
18:10 < bridge> <vahemaaa> you mean, it does not appear on server list?
18:13 < bridge> <vahemaaa> heinrik am i doing the right thing by making a suggest, or should i save and continue
18:13 < bridge> <vahemaaa> https://hosted.weblate.org/translate/ddnet/ddnet/tr/?&offset=68#suggestions
18:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, translators should only work on WebLate now. The ddnet/languages folder and ddnet-languages repository are only supposed to be modified by maintainers now.

19:36 < bridge> <Assa> which kind of rust?

19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:46 < bridge> <sqwinix> guys, how do I build ddnet on Linux under Windows?
19:50 < bridge> <melon> i assume you meant for linux?
19:50 < bridge> <Assa> either with mingw or wsl2
19:50 < bridge> <melon> easiest would be to use `wsl`, otherwise you'd need a linux compatible toolchain (i.e `x86_64-linux-gnu-g++`)
19:50 < bridge> <melon> mingw is targetting windows tho
19:51 < bridge> <melon> AFAIR mingw cannot natively produce an ELF
19:52 < bridge> <Assa> alternatively you install virtual box and Linux on it
19:52 < bridge> <Teero> wsl is pretty easy to set up
19:52 < bridge> <Assa> wsl 1 was not.
19:52 < bridge> <Assa> but whatever
20:11 < bridge> <sqwinix> Well, I have Linux and I need to make a build for Windows. What flags or packages do I need? (I'm on Arch)
20:11 < bridge> <melon> oh okay, so other way around
20:12 < bridge> <melon> install the mingw toolchain and use the toolchain we provide under /cmake
20:12 < bridge> <melon> `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`
20:12 < bridge> <melon> and then use mingw64.toolchain
20:13 < bridge> <melon> i think we describe that in the readme too: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
20:15 < bridge> <sqwinix> Thanks, I didn't notice when browsing GitHub.
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> Is it ready or does it need critique?

20:59 < bridge> <learath2> I spread the word of rust today
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> The job for me
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice, what did u  do
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> Told people how nice it is to not have to worry about memory management and how fearless the concurrency is
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
21:02 < bridge> <louis> I still have yet to figure out a prediction bug, but everything else is ready / needs critique. it's my first non-small pr so i just want to make sure i dont need a big refactor before i create a map etc. for the new tile process
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> And someone was curious how data was written at all from multiple threads if the compiler doesn't allow multiple mut refs ever. So I explained to them how the wrappers ensure only one mut ref ever exists at runtime
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice, the key info is interior mutability
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> and unsafecell
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what powers those
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah gave them the keyword interior mutability if they want to learn more
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where is that from
21:43 < bridge> <totar> It would be pretty silly to do this instead of wsl these days. It literally takes like 10 seconds and then you wait 3 minutes for it to finish. I bet you could build ddnet under wsl with like 8 commands from a fresh windows install.
