09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> maybe it's random
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (200iq) how the heck would it be random... also there is some problem with the releasing? im worried a bit
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> http://prntscr.com/l5kjrc
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> why is that there anyways
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> because bam still exists
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> i downloaded it and uploaded it to mediafire
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> here's the link

10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> it's all discord fault
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> :)
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if its virus, i would pin gladly to jao for banning ya xd
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> HMMMM :thonkery: :feelsamazingman:
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does any1 know how to savley use cookies to keep people logged in on a webpage
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess simply saving the username and pass in cookies would be pretty insecure
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what technologies do you use to display the website?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> php? python? which libraries?
11:55 <+breton> ChillerDragon: invent a token
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but probably whatever tech stack he uses already has such a token
11:59 <+breton> ChillerDragon: store uuid4 value as a token in cookies and store user <--> token association in the database
12:01 <+breton> ChillerDragon: another idea: store username and password in cookies, but encrypted with a key stored on the server
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> does somebody have small amount of servers?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and big amount of players
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 chillerdragon.ddnss.de
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 http://chillerdragon.ddnss.de/DDNetPP-web/
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> dyndns o:
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
12:37 <+breton> Arseniy Zarche: yes, i do
13:48 <+breton> who is axblk on github?
13:48 <+breton> how does https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/commit/63a2f779112b377ad2ec666aa0db3bb8d92cd1ac help against ddos?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i use php no libraries.
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> breton: i also had the idea with encrypting with key on the server.. but
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 1. i dont know how to do that
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2. secret keys suck because i love to store everything on github and i dont want to hide all the secret stuff becuase i will forget it if i switch server or something
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 3. i wasnt sure if its save an a good way to do.. but since you say its ok i guess its ok
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Also the token thing was an idea i had but i didn't find any good ressource that explained it how to do it safely. And i have no idea what uuid4 is. I guess just create a random (hopefully unique) string on login and store it in the database with the account and also as cookie clientside.
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But when somebody gets that cookie he can login to the account? Isnt that unsave?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, when someon gets the token, they can use the account
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's the best you can get
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how hard is it to get cookies as an attacker?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess they are stored in plaintext somewhere on the computer
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds unsafe
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how would you improve on that? ^^
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the attacker has access to the computer, they can obviously copy all authentication data to their own computer and do it from there
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm ye
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do big companys the same?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so if i am at a friends computer i can simply grab the token from the browser and sign in to his gmail account?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah i guess they also have country and ip checks and so on
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe i should implement that aswell
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so cookies are highly sensitive data i guess.
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @ChillerDragon >> base64 :v)
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what should i use bas64 for?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @ChillerDragon run on your linux srv: $(echo "aWQK" | base64 -d)
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i know what base64 is
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i think i know what it is
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ye but I was too lazy so I learned some commands in base64
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> aWQK is the id command üòÑ
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but why would i need it for
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ye but I was too bored so I learned some commands in base64
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for me it looks like you just base64 the string "aWQK"
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> base64 -d
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> --decode
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> then you exec it: $()
14:50 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/fxBF3
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually go for storing a token in an encrypted cookie with an expiry date
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I'm implementing OAuth I go for a refresh token
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What is OAuth? @Learath2
17:58 <+breton> we have a server with infclass. When we launch it, it appears in master servers for some time, then disappears, and to make it appear again (for a few minutes) we have to change the port. Any idea why it could be happening?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> üëç
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> please solve it, we have some work to do and we cant do that until it will be solved
18:03 <+breton> so we are not the only ones having the issue?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> only on infclass server (Oi2 exlusive)
18:06 <+breton> oh ok :3
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oauth is a standard/framework for authorization
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon big companies don't do IP address checks, otherwise mobile or roaming between wifi networks would be horrible
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they might do country checks
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye country/city checks would be better
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but vpns and vacation you know...
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess retyping the password would be ok when using a vpn or vacation i dunno
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh wait i just realized you could use an vpn to bypass the country check ^^
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 when?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.6.5 now!
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 you could fix mem_alloc and free for vanilla too üòÑ
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes‚Ä¶ laters
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 when ddnet 0.6.5, 11.4.5
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt ddnet already have the security fixes
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please stand by, PRs will follow
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oke
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet has some different kind of security fixes
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 would you also have a look at my pr while creating yours? üòÉ
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can do that, I guess
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be cool^^
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we really want to upgrade ddnet to 0.7? I mean who cares about tw at this point?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this was about 0.6.5
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh you did a 0.6.5?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> y
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nobo
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fake 0.7 hype
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> btw, could it be that the siz2 packet from the master server is currently unreliable?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://i.imgur.com/wGWqmhZ.png
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> it's returning me 0 as num_servers while I still get all servers
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> it's returning me 0 as server amount while I still get all servers
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so we wont have 0.7 for now :feelsbadman:
22:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'm sure you answered a lot of times already, but: have we tried hetzner before?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> btw in case someone else has this problem:
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> previously the master servers returned the game servers already on the SERVERBROWSE_GETLIST packet, now they only return it on the SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO packet
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> does visual studio c++ 2018 will be problem for default method of compilation teeworlds by mvc++ 2010? (or 2008, cant remember)
22:42 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: I ran GER2 on hetzner for a month and a half
22:43 <+Learath2> It worked pretty well imho
22:45 <@heinrich5991> did you see that hetzner has truly unlimited traffic for dedis now?
22:46 <@heinrich5991> also, interesting. ty
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> hetzner is at least not rated very good
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> ```Worst service provider I've been working with. A lot of network outages. More, they shutted down a server without even an email alert in advance. When we fixed things, access to Cloud services still not available for our account.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> Luckily it was not blocking for our production workload, but what if it was?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> Unprofessional.```
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> multiple of the reviews are complaining about network outages or them shutting down servers without any kind of notice
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> null  routing ‚ù§
22:51 <+Learath2> Yep, unlimited traffic and a gbit line
22:53 <+Learath2> When did that happen? I've had pretty decent interaction with their support
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> I've read ~30-40 of the reviews and every 4th/5th is complaining about it
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you read reviews of other hosting providers as well?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe that's normal
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> hm, well just read some reviews, got no experience with it myself
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> O: best host ever
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/500777580341755904/Sans_titre.png
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> juniper?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yup, some good stuff üòÑ
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's basically how ddos protection is done nearly anywhere
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> not at ovh
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> they do not use juniper stuff
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Juniper is just a manufacturer
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure like cisco, like extreme networks...
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but you can have some shitty products & some good
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> as I saw, juniper is providing some good products
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OVH used to use Arbor  + their own VACs
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ik
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> home made VAC + arbor
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nowadays they use a custom solution in place of Arbor aswell
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> at my university we got a lot of Juniper routers, SRX & QFX models
