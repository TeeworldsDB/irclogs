09:27 < black-roland> /notice Nimda I am not a bot
11:56 <@heinrich5991> mithrandir just blocked a couple of people
11:57 <@heinrich5991> isn't that a known player?
12:11 <@EastByte> yep, a skilled player who is also known to be blocking
12:12 <@deen> I added packets: https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
12:12 <@EastByte> yay
12:13 <@deen> ah, also need to add them in detailed view on /status/
12:13 <@deen> (when you click on a server entry)
12:28 <+Learath2> heinrich5991, mithrandir was always an asshat
12:31 <@deen> looking at GER, we get about 1 packet per tick per player in each direction
12:32 <@deen> we can still get rid of all the trolls, blockers and bots, just introduce mandatory accounts and charge a few € for each :P
12:36 <@EastByte> would work for ingame bots/trolls but would probably increase the number of ddos attackers
12:37 <@EastByte> and even with a few € per account we couldn't effort a proper ddos protection
12:37 <@deen> nah, what would actually happen is that someone takes the ddnet database, builds a version without accounts and everyone plays there for free :P
12:38 <@deen> at least that's what I would do
12:42 <@deen> I didn't see a nice way to combine traffic and packets btw, rrd is a bit weird
17:23 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I can't connect to 95.172.92.151:8309
17:23 <@heinrich5991> ok, I probably can't connect to any ddnet ger server
19:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: i hate talking to support. I asked them about ingress filtering and they responsed with "we just blocked a few ip addresses, that should take care of the problem" ...
