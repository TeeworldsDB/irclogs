01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> didn't really get much further. got stuck on the
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> not sure how to approach this, haven't used a python debugger yet to figure out which file its trying to laod (while loading the cache with pickle)
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> distracted myself by getting help for smth different on the ffmpeg irc ^^
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga is it a python2 pickle?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might need to google about that
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm calling it with python3, not sure if the code was originally called with python2
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the error message sounds like such a problem, but it's just a guess
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/a/40496459
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but `"latin-1"` isn't the correct answer. it might "fix" the exception, but it'll probably break the data)
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try "utf-8", maybe
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah that seems interesting, problematic could be that its not me calling pickle but diskcache. we'll need to see if I can pass it there too
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `from diskcache import Cache` with `with Cache('players-cache') as cache:`. the error is raised on an access on cache
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm i should probably not edit `/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/diskcache/core.py`?
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah can I maybe copy that file into my directory and it will be preferred
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, diskcache is an official module
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> til
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's not
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'st third-party
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm apparently not that easily
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try import .diskcache
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try `import .diskcache`
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> as a line above the `from diskcache import Cache` or `from .diskcache import Cache`?
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> both of my guesses don't seem to work for me ^^
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from .diskcache import Cache
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to import it from the local directory
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I think)
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'll go to sleep for today though, gonna try tomorrow
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> gn :)
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lurking github makes me crazy
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/Byebyesky/teeworlds-switch
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is where I was stuck too
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Angeldust> any progress on that?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> Developers fix this, We have problem in servers it is laggy I'm not getting png as before not my net problem since new update I'm getting 200 ping turkey but getting 140 ping in France lol but turkey is more nearer to where I live but this thing is weird strange that I'm getting less ping in fra instead of turkey, since new updated my ping boosted to 200 in turkey I'm Asian player but getting ping in turkey server...... Pls fix this
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> Also I'm not the only one who is getting high ping
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's unlikely to be caused by an update, maybe your routing changed?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does Teeworlds only support .png image files?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> That applies to mapres aswell right
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you mean to load it in editor yes
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yes, okay thanks
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also doesnt support indexed rgb PNGs rn, bcs pnglite limitation
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> Nope
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> Nope
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did you check even? üòÑ Anyway, take a look at traceroute (preferably mtr) and see what hop is adding latency
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> I didn't get what u mean
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Patiga\: what mouse brand yo use?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> chillerdragon: I have a logitech mouse but my research beforehand wasn't super extensive
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why the question? :)
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I was inactive for a week and i want to blame arch linux for my bad aim in tw not my actual skill \:D
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> seems like my openrazer driver is messed up
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i was missing linux-headers so lemme reboot and see what happens
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think there can be problems with mouse drivers on linux üòÆ
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "Happy DDNet birthday to heinrich5991 for finishing their first map 1 year ago!"
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks Zwelf for making local score files work the same as on DDNet servers üôÇ
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that was on my local test server)
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bl4st3r> What do u mean bro explain me
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wew imagine having 1 yr old ranks on local test server
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga can I get a tool that gives me the x,y coordinates of every start and finish tile on a map? ü•∫
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh, sure :)
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is source code enough?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> currently not sure if this is enough reason for a binary in twmap yet, maybe if I manage to generalize that nicely ^^
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> find all positions of the given tile
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üôÇ
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> would be nice if that could integrate the other physics layers somehow
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and at that point the input would get weird
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you have a format in mind?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, json?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can finish tiles be in the front layer?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hi there. How would you typically ask the maintainer of a AUR package to make a change to the PKGBUILD? Do I just leave a comment or is there some intended way I can submit a patch?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I figured somebody here might know
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> leave a comment
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also add a patch to the comment
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> k, thanks
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yes, finish and start tiles can be in the front layer
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm back, (y, x) or (x, y) ^^
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {"x":1,"y":2}?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867464246879059969/start_finish_tiles.rs
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @heinrich5991 that should do the job :)
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah ignore the .about ^^
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks üôÇ
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me quickly ewww about the `usize`
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :p
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does that do front layer and game layer?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think there are no start/finish tiles in the front layer
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> timakro above thought otherwise, I can quickly look into the code
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Tiles#/media/File:DDNet_editor_entities.png
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can theoretically be in the front layer
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the wiki :poggers:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> eh, gimme a sec
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `        if(((m_TileIndex == TILE_START) || (m_TileFIndex == TILE_START) || FTile1 == TILE_START || FTile2 == TILE_START || FTile3 == TILE_START || FTile4 == TILE_START || Tile1 == TILE_START || Tile2 == TILE_START || Tile3 == TILE_START || Tile4 == TILE_START) && (PlayerDDRaceState == DDRACE_NONE || PlayerDDRaceState == DDRACE_FINISHED || (PlayerDDRaceState == DDRACE_STARTED && !GetPlayerTeam(ClientID) && g_Config.m_SvTeam != 3)))`
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> take a look at this abomination
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think stoppers were worse
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki fix
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @heinrich5991 brand new! with front layer and 0% usize
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867467511150149672/start_finish_tiles.rs
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ‚ù§Ô∏è
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I copy this into the src/bin directory of twmap and it runs?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> should work
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/Patiga?tab=repositories
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where though?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> utf-8 doesn
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> t seem to work, can I somehow figure out which encoding is correct?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it might just be broken encoding
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you try `"bytes"`?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah that works
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but fails later on a `TypeError: keys must be str, int, float, bool or None, not bytes` ^^
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/07/21/Rust-2021-public-testing.html
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> which way can i take for get player pos
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> i mean not my pos but someone else
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you have to spec them, not free view
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> otherwise it doesnt show positino
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> otherwise it doesnt show position
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> hum? i mean i want to make an effect from teeworlds code üòÑ
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> server-side or client-side
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> srv
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cchracter->m_pos
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh whops
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> so i need to include character.h
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh whoops
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <belug~~~a> np xd my bad, i should explain more
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you should get necessary player
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> from gameserver
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and make sure does this player/his character even here
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> by clientdid
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> by clientid
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and make sure is this player/his character even here
