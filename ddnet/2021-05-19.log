00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> With heinrich5991's upcoming HTTP master server (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772, https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json) we now also archive the player statistics: https://ddnet.tw/stats/master/ Maybe someone has a good use for that data already.
00:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is not the best way to read C declarations btw, there is only one rule and it's "declaration follows use"
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. try to imagine that the declaration tells you how to use it
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (*abc)[10] pointer to array
00:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *abc[10] == *(abc[10]) array of pointers
00:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if I asked you what you'd prefer to write the HTTP masterserver API for servers in, you'd probably say go out of python, go, rust? @Learath2
00:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go has the disadvantage (for me) that I don't know it well
01:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I don't know go well enough to suggest it for anything tbf
01:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know this would be a decent usecase for it tho
01:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think rust is our best bet here
08:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh oh i want to do it
09:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok maybe scraping todays data, which is not zipped all into 1 file is a bad idea
09:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> takes forever
09:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust

10:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie whats the state of #3826
10:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3826
10:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did nuborn still say something?
10:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> concurrent players yesterday from the http master data

10:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> concurrent players yesterday from the http master data, fixed xd
10:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is the data which can be used for gnuplot
10:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/844496189650108416/data.dat

11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Nouaa did -fsigned-char solve ur issue btw?
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also remember now where why i knew about it,
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone used to use raspberry for fng source:
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/pull/1
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then i told him to use fsigned-char and it solved his issue
11:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Works fine as-is. Can be better with a custom message or netobj, but I didn't got the time to do it.
11:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok so nuborn was fine with it?
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Ye, the only thing he pointed out is the evolve thing which I took out already. And the lack of better way of sending tunezone tunings which is the "could be better" part
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> If you haven't find anything weird with it, then it is probably fine
12:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki cool
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Depends on the tool  you use. HTTP2 is absolutely required if you want to scrape thousands of small files (2.6 GB uncompressed here):
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Downloaded: 9140 files, 269.61M bytes, 0 redirects, 0 errors
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wget2 -m -p -np https://ddnet.tw/stats/master/2021-05-19/  26.11s user 17.92s system 153% cpu 28.619 total
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with pretick weak hook & bounce works without breaking ddrace apparently:
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/55f5da8655f552f47e46c9d35c808e071ecb7937
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and should fix both hook and bounce, if im not mistaken
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with somebody needs it for local server or smth
13:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tbh I don't really know anything about writing HTTP APIs in rust
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does the api need to do?
13:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes thanks
13:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> game servers will register themselves via this API. they'll send their server info, the masterserver will have to verify that port forwarding is done correctly, and then add it to the list of servers
13:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the masterserver doesn't hear from a server in say 90 seconds, it gets dropped from the list
14:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if you have to, we can do python, but please for the love of god atleast not django
14:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see what you mean with python (deployment problems), I guess it'll not be python
14:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it were python, it'd probably be flask or so
14:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Flask is fairly lean so Iâ€™d be okay with that
14:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Js does fairly well with this kind of real time work btw, if you want to take a look there
14:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With typescript itâ€™s much less cancerous than it used to be. Though you are still running on node which is very meh
15:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so, the port forwarding verification, does this use a protocol that already exists i guess, the old way of getting server info via udp?
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to try to create it in rust, using https://docs.rs/warp/0.3.1/warp/ as the http server, its rly simple and clean
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if anyone else prefers to do it themselves or in another lang just tell so i dont do this for no reason
15:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is a quick setup to see how it looks https://gist.github.com/edg-l/efcc9b399a32f65c6676a747b0971459#file-ddnet-http-master-warp-rs
15:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and making a post with json works ez
15:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/844568804574363688/unknown.png

15:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gotta find the ping protocol
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm also interested in doing it ^^
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought the register info might look something like this:
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```json
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     "info": {
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "clients": [
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>             {
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                 "name": "heinrich5991",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                 "clan": "",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                 "country": null,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                 "score": 123,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                 "team": -1
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>             }
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         ],
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "max_players": 64,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "max_clients": 64,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "passworded": false,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "game_type": "DDRaceNetwork",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "name": "DDNet RUS - Moderate [DDraceNetwork]",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "map": {
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>             "name": "Sunreal",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>             "sha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>             "size": 12345
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         },
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         "version": "0.6.4, 11.2.1"
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     },
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     "port": 1234,
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     "secret": "abcdef"
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where "info" is some free-form JSON object that is then hosted by us
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "port" is required because we don't know which port the server is hosted on
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "secret" would be used so the game server can recognize that it's the master server trying to probe the server
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, the game server would probably try to register via ipv4 and ipv6 alternatingly, so the master server can learn both IP addresses
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just send it as an example, since i dont know anything about how the request looks, nor the response nor the ping protocol
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sent*
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was more an example to show if u like the library used for the http
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah ðŸ™‚
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks similar to flask I guess ðŸ™‚
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will probs not use closures tho, since rust doesnt allow async closures yet, we can convert it to a function like this
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/844574337683423242/unknown.png
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes i find it super simple library
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and serde magick makes this so ez
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> free form as in the server sends whathever it wants?
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if it doesnt make sense to tw?
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea would be that it's the client imposing constraints on the JSON
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's the same as before, game servers get to send whatever they want. I'd like to have it this way so mods can experiment with new fields etc.
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i find it good too
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well we need to limit the size of the body ofc
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to some kilobytes, probaby
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so, should we create a repo?
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this way we dont lose track of this
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and if we dont we probs will never get started
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think a repo helps with that
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it helps collaborate
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or you want to do it alone?
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont mind
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I think I'd prefer to do the start myself. @Ryozuki let's create a ddnet issue so we can discuss the details?
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> okay
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently we should move the ddnet freenode channel to libera.chat or so
16:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 btw can we take the chance and add skins to the master server api?
16:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so servers that support it allow showing skins in server details xd
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with the free-form JSON, this will be just a PR by you away
16:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cool, would probs look cool ^^
16:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there some freenode drama?
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.kline.sh/
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "freenode now belongs to Andrew Lee, and I'm leaving for a new network."
16:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freenode staff is leaving, they dont like this hostile takeover
16:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see why we should keep that channel
16:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even ##C is talking about this
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "freenode IRC network purchased by VPN company PIA"
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe im the first in #ddnet on libera.chat
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it even matter for publicly hosted chats?
17:01 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> I am using it from matrix right now. I won't mind discarding the channel if we set up a native matrix bridge (https://t2bot.io/discord/)
17:03 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> I would be happy about a native matrix bridge in general ^^
17:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does it look from either side?
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently, we get [bot] [freenode] Zwelf[m] as your username
17:07 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> Currently I am logged in with my matrix account @zwelf:matrix.org and joined the room #freenode_#ddnet:matrix.org since matrix.org bridges all freenode channels
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean the t2bot.io, how does it look from both sides
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would the messages get bridged further to IRC by matterbridge?
17:09 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> I think only if messages from the bridge bot get relayed (they are marked as bot messages)
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im spreading the word of rust in liberachat
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should indeed get out of freenode, we never really used it much anyway
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/844592774708068382/unknown.png
17:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I checked the list of staffers that jumped ship and they are all people I mostly trust, if they jumped ship itâ€™s too late for freenode ltd.
17:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes one of them is the oldest staff member from freenode
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> md, chris, edk are all people Iâ€™ve interacted with, very sensible people whose views I mostly tend to agree with
17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should probably get a replacement for the matrix users
17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I can set up matterbridge to also bridge to matrix
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people are spamming for cloak, and there is a madlad named cloak, the pings he must be receiving
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao angry bots spamming the freenode server

17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> watching a irc network be created is fun :monkalaugh:
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Lol
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Attacking freenode cuz nobody answered your question in #ffmpeg
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```ddnet2 echo '\"'

18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please send help
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do I escape a string to be used within double quotes?
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ```
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> echo -e '\\"'
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> \"
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I output one escaped string, now I need to "unescape" it so that I can use it in a script
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> echo -e \"hello\"
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "hello"
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this wat u want
18:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `'ban ip.ip.ip.ip -1 "bad'\''[guy\"\\. Until May 20 16:05 UTC" # Learath2#2281: Learath2'` this evaluates to the single string `ban ip.ip.ip.ip -1 "bad'[guy\"\. Until May 20 16:05 UTC" # Learath2#2281: Learath2`. Now I need to escape this again before I can pass it along with `ssh $i.ddnet.tw "echo '$1' > servers/servers/*.fifo"`
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord makes this hard to understand xd
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used backticks so those are literally what I have at hand
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> discord shouldn't be stealing any \
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u rly need to escape it?
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> echo without -e doesnt interpret anything
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> echo $1
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently I'm getting an unmatched quote
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, let me try to replace it with a echo -e, maybe the echo is indeed eating some of it
18:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah, I honestly have no idea what is happening
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `ssh ger2.ddnet.tw 'echo -e '\''ban ip.ip.ip.ip -1 "bad'\''[guy\"\\. Until May 20 16:05 UTC" # Learath2#2281: Learath2'\'' > servers/servers/*.fifo'` this is what gets called and apparently has an unmatched quote
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> dquote*
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `echo -e 'ban 78.46.174.82 -1 "bad'[guy\"\. Until May 20 16:05 UTC" # Learath2#2281: Learath2` this is what's left after the local shell escapes once
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u left he ip
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip the user
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> whatever it's my server
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the single quote in there is breaking it
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pff, `echo ${1:q}` worked instead of `echo '$1'` mostly because I couldn't find how tf one is supposed to escape a string that's about to go between single quotes
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't believe anyone actually enjoys using this mess
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 does '$1' even expand the argument?
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think '$1' doesnt interpret $1 as a thing
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need "$!"
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "$1"
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im no bash expert
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> double quotes used inside single quotes disable their special meaning and vice versa
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/844617703951302686/unknown.png
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes im right
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's much more sophisticated than that, single quotes disable everything, dquotes only disable some things
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You would be if not for the fact that this entire thing was within dqotes
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `timeout 30 ssh $i.ddnet.tw "echo '$1' > servers/servers/*.fifo"` was the entire line here quotes have no meaning so $1 would get expanded, but since this will get executed on a remote shell that will expand the entire thing again
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The quotes there were meant to prevent expansion, but when $1 contains a quote you end up with a mess
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 OH
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe put everything in ''
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when u send the command
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it expands in ssh
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only there
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah nvm
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I either needed a way to escape $1 to be suitable within quotes (didn't find any), so I got rid of the quotes and instead used `${1:q}` directly because that's the only escaping capability I found documented
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u probs need to expand it locally
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> cat mess.txt | ssh $i.ddnet.tw 'cat > servers/servers/*.fifo'
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does that rly work
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it should ðŸ˜„
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, that was going to be my solution in about 15 minutes
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
20:10 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> heinrich5991: now I understand your question :). This is how it looks like https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/blob/develop/screenshot.png (from the readme of the project, on the discord side bridged users talk with `matrixuser [bot]` and on the matrix side `discorduser (Discord)` is talking.
20:12 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> okay, misread the screenshot... on the matrix side `discorduser` is talking (without the "(Discord)")

21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I added 0.7 servers to the https masters
21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for more statistics
21:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, if some 0.7 client wants to use it, they can have a fast serverlist now

21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if they do hardware upgrades
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> let's hope cryptocurrencies die soon
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i dont mind the crypto itself but the computing cost they have is nonsensical kinda
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe only the environmentally unfriendly ones
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://coincarboncap.com/
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 101kg of CO2 per transaction on bitcoin
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> insane
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> isn't Chia supposed to be eco-friendly?
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it wears the ssd and bandwidth i guess
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes sense for them to not want clients who make use of full resources all times
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found it here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27212239
21:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd be losing probably the longest chain of trust ever generated along with the death of bitcoin, so we should probably be careful what we wish for ðŸ˜›

22:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> why is it that if I hold the hammer in frieze and hit my partner, he will fly further than if I did not clamp the hummer in frieze?
22:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> why is it that if I hold the hammer in frieze and hit my partner, he will fly further than if I did not hold hammer in frieze?
22:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> why is it that if I hold the hammer in freeze and hit my partner, he will fly further than if I did not hold hammer in freeze?
22:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u hammer him
22:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> I mean if I just hit it it won't fly far
22:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean the frozen tee holding hammers u
22:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there was a change to make this always happen
22:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> He doesn't hit me
22:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what u mean then
