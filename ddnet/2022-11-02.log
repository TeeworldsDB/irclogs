01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in that function you get one message. the type says which message it is
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't cast the `void *` to messages other than the one that was specified by the type
03:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How even ARE the OnInit / OnRender / OnMessage things treated?
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So would I need to add another if state for `if(MsgType == NETMSGTYPE_SV_KILLMSGTEAMS)` under the other one?
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, hat would work
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDrippn> what does this mean lol
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDrippn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1037223790691745882/unknown.png
05:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDrippn> what does this mean when compiling lol

08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are missing some libs prob
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apt install libgles-dev
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually just do `sudo apt install build-essential cmake git glslang-tools google-mock libavcodec-extra libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libvulkan-dev libwavpack-dev libx264-dev python spirv-tools`
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/merge_requests/8
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want my ddnet-map-gen to not need to depend on the image files but instead include_bytes! it, this would help me :boo:
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm not at home rn, I assume you tested it? :happy:
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i ran cargo test
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which i assume has tests loading stuff
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah right it is tested by the madir format I think, but its not in the normal map parsing otherwise
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *MapDir
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodDrippn> okay thanks
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updated my ddnet-map-gent tool
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with binaries for windows users, in the future i may make a gui, and render it using twgpu
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-gen/releases/tag/v0.2.1
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can make fly and maze maps for now
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho the fly map is pretty simple
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> did u just sent smth written in go
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :justatest:
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/f-bi-raid-swat-gif-11500735
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fake ryo
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rendered pic using twgpu for the maze and fly map examples

11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wow how big is that? 😄
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly spent more time making it a good cli app than improving the map gen algorithm
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1000x1000
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah insane 😄
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the render is a big weird tho xd
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i may not need to make the gui myself
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/klask
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Automatically create GUI applications from clap3 apps
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use clap 4 tho
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also you can give it a seed
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So u can recreate maps for seeds u find interesting
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now make it for gores
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Like minecraft :BASED:
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah that shouldnt be too hard
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And i also wanna try ddnet parts
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wonder how far i can get
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Then ill make a ddnet server, where everyday a new map is added
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Infinite content
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make it so if you finish the map you get teleported to the next map
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh lol
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But what if other ppl are playing
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> multi server support
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> when
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's impossible with the way we structure the code rn, but you can host multiple CGameWorlds in one server by selectively snapping. Or maybe add a new redirect message so the client gets redirected to the new server
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I interviewed at a uni club to become a php coder. I feel nasty
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ooof
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U get a job at a club?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only applied because I want new friends
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah lol
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Too bad they are php peasants
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Special sort of club, you spend time, you get credits in exchange
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I see
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why is there no c club?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or c++
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They get to give you credits in turn because they make stuff for the uni. They repair computers, make software
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also isnt there a linux club
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No social clubs here. Very utilitarian form of clubs in polytechnics
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Meh
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But im sure a linux club would make interesting stuff
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well idk never been to one
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They could make a personalized distro for the uni
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Interesting project
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This club I applied to also helps with the sysadmin work. They are I guess the closest thing to a linux club
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would legit found a rust club
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a circuit theory lecture in an hour. I'm extremely tired and starving. Do I head home and watch it remotely or do I suffer?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And cultivate some followerw
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And make the anti C convention :BASED:
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was a go club for a brief while with a lot of girls for some reason
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Women love Go
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Delete unsafe C from the 🌍!"
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uhh
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why go :fuckyousnail:
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the few classes i took at a uni
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There was just 3 girls
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Out of 150
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like only 10% girls here. Polytechnics are just male dominated
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I also went to a polytechnic yeah
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.fib.upc.edu/en
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the Go club was closer to 50% for whatever reason
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In my experience, its hard to find dedicated devs like in this chat irl
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe i havent had luck yet
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ppl simply dont do open source too lol
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And windows..
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pretty rare indeed. Most people I met around here were more so lightly interested in programming and just did whatever their lectures cover
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/cpu-cache/associativity/
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting read
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the whole website itself has rly interesting stuff
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1037327228528234516/unknown.png
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought 1st one would be faster. But as soon as he said 2nd is faster I understood where I went wrong
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's that the cache tag doesn't change with an increment of this size. So you keep getting cache misses 😄
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://db.in.tum.de/~finis/x86%20intrinsics%20cheat%20sheet%20v1.0.pdf
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what a cheat sheet
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Popcnt is my fav instruction
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is also nice https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/popcnt
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can u do this without intrinsics?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess the compiler can optimize to this
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can, but it doesnt really very reliably notice the pattern
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://giannitedesco.github.io/2019/06/15/abusing-add.html
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it does if u know this quick simple trick
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```c
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unsigned int count_set_bits(unsigned int x)
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     unsigned int ret;
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     for(ret = 0; x; x &= (x - 1))
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         ret++;
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     return ret;
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was just reading it. That's very cute
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :LANAYAYA:
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `__builtin_popcnt(x)`
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what do you call circuit theory?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Study of ideal circuits analytically and numerically
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Thevenin equivalent?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stuff like nodal analysis, KVL/KCL, thevenin/norton
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html#method.count_ones
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's kvl/kcl?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesn't say if it optimizes to intrinsic if available...
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kirchhoff's voltage and current law
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh, nobody ever use acronym for those in France 😄
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it will
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also the statement doesn't really make sense. you mean "if it optimizes to the assembly instruction if available"

13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly almost all of the class teeechnically boils down to applying KCL and KVL. The hard part is seeing the simplifications, you'll have to do like a dozen variable linear equation otherwise  😄
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, you usually just solve a linear system

13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't want to invest in crypto
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I invest in rust

13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu nice pfp
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 🧌
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> troll emoji
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I wrote one rust program, now i can legally set ferris on my pfp
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Spread the knowledge

14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol nice one
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #6000 btw 😮
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6000
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Poggers
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> There should be a big party with live music, expensive food and casino when we hit #10000
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im reading that website more and more
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You rly can go down a rabbit hole to optimize stuff
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Software prefetching looks cool but hard to know when to use
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/cpu-cache/prefetching/
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so we can optimize ddnet even further?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.agner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=41
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Voxel it can always be done
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thing is, optimizing code is one of the hardest things a programmer can do
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ah
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another interesting web https://www.agner.org/optimize/
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is still lot of potential if we'd use vulkan better 😄
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could eliminate most useless memcpys that happen in the frontend
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> itd be funny when we finally rls a optimization update and now the game runs like 5x faster
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or smth
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan did 2.5x perf on desktop GPUs
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt that a big step already xd
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> not for me xd
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> desktop gpus
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u a special case anyway xD
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when do u finally try x11
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> come to the dark side
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don 't wanna betray wayland
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i'm using wayland only for 2.5 yrs
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> soon™️
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/65
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll switch to wayland too
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but since i already tested it and had even more FPS i'm not in your weird situation 😄
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there was a huge RADV perf improvement lately for cheap draw calls. maybe its the perfect usecase for integrated cards
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```cpp
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> int gcd(int a, int b) {
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     while (b) b ^= a ^= b ^= a %= b;
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     return a;
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Btw, why you have `.gitlab` folder in github repo and there is no gitlab repo of it
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet 10 cents it was chillerdragon
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> It was
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess for his own repos
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I did some profiling recently and the result was that `recvfrom` was the main culprit (#1996), optimising anything else would probably not bring great returns
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1996
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> clonning ddnet repo for mods are kinda issue, you can just download and upload it again, its kinda disturbing. You can make only one fork of repo, its not a solution, so maybe making ddnet a template repo a good idea, or maybe other repo with only stable vesions. I created repo like this on my own and its incredibly handy to use
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://github.com/AnimeIdiots/ddnet-template/
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Clone ddnet and create branches
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Each branch is a mod
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for 64p server it would probs be worth to make the gamecore not doing O(n²) all the time
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also we use distance, instead of distance_squared (which COULD cause physic changes), but purely mathematically, isnt different
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Solved
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/929470419696758785/969254910006808586/0DD38299-AC6D-4511-9BD2-F4AEE8CD3177.gif
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu  someone already made a ddnet mod template
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Search teefrake
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Teeframe*
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> On github
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://github.com/teeframe/ddnet-skeleton
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> this one i suppose?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/teeframe/ddnet-skeleton-readme
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and rly good documented
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes that
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the readme tells u more info
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when do we start with ddnet 2.0
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with nim? :greenthing:
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with bash
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i read few years ago in deen's blog about ddrace 2.0 on nim, couldnt find it anymore (maybe it wasnt deen's blog)
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think rust would be more realistic
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe in 20 years when we start there are better languages anyway
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> carbon
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :troll:
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe simply GPU side only 😉
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Carbon this
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 200 years any word you say is a programming language
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> c the rusty carbon over there?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Tee lang :poggers2:
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds emotes are a language too
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> teeworlds chat is best ide
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> btw i saw Headshot's server, he recompiled it and applied changes right in game, you just lagged for few seconds
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> jet-live e.g. for linux
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can do that
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddovod/jet-live
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for e.g. classes u need to write your own reload logic.. since it obviously cannot tell what the new class layout will change runtime wise
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for simply UI, physic changes u can use it 😄
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> basically everything that changes per frame
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ stl smh
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1037380500697915412/unknown.png
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did he also test with lto + ofast + static c++
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else its a lie
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> give me url
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/algorithms/argmin/
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this guy knows a lot
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh godbolt + lto is struggle
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cannot read it
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but without LTO, the asm is defs bit longer for std::min_element
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://godbolt.org/z/fW5Woha8Y
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cannot say what happens perf wise tho
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Hi, I'm planning to attend FOSDEM 2023 on the first Februar weekend (https://fosdem.org/2023/). Is anyone interested in meeting there? I'm also considering to submit a DDNet stand request (https://fosdem.org/2023/news/2022-09-26-stands-cfp/).
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohh
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its too early for me to know cuz i may change jobs soon but it would be cool to go
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool link. don't have time to read it right now, I'll open a tab ^^
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that even defined behavior?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C++17 onwards yes
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Iirc
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Nice, I'd be happy to meet you there 😁 Let's see how it goes.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > You can even write the body of the loop as this confusing one-liner — and it will even compile without causing undefined behavior warnings since C++17
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```cpp
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> int gcd(int a, int b) {
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     if (a == 0) return b;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     if (b == 0) return a;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     int az = __builtin_ctz(a);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     int bz = __builtin_ctz(b);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     int shift = std::min(az, bz);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     b >>= bz;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     while (a != 0) {
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         a >>= az;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         int diff = b - a;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         az = __builtin_ctz(diff);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         b = std::min(a, b);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         a = std::abs(diff);
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     }
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     return b << shift;
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is one of the fastest gcds
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Brussels is close enough that looks cheap to travel xS
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Brussels is close enough that looks cheap to travel xD
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds similar to https://github.com/teeframe/ddnet-skeleton
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yep
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen hasnt scrolled :monkalaugh:
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, too late 😄
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> well, i didnt know of this, but still need to manually create repo, template will do everything for you 🥹
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would be interesting if a few people are interested in going. I'm not sure yet if I'll go
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Great to hear, lets see if more want to go 🙂
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm considering it
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1037395626666770502/test.png
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `cargo install teemasterparser`
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you exclude the ddnet, kog servers?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Notbyet
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yet
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yknow I wonder, What if we created an Enum or something to list all the font icon sy.bols we use, so it's more readable in the code
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yknow I wonder, What if we created an Enum or something to list all the font icon symbols we use, so it's more readable in the code
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i wrote in the OBS discord for now, if they consider it a bug i'll also create an issue there

19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve engineers
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> top notch kekw
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> nah, hackers are top notch
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's an off
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oof*
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yo yopstar I wanna see you on fosdem
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf even is that
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://fosdem.org/2023/
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt sound very cool xD
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 8000hackers. and i dont use rust
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> read the book quick
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cant read
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😦
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont be sad, i just wait for godot 4
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah me too
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> before you learn to read?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have an project in mind?
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont need to read, i feel it
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> kinda like 3d teeworlds I kinda started it in 3 but code is too messy so I am gonna continue it in 4
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I rqed at the networking stage xD but I had made a console start ui (not much tbh)
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it hard?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i actually was thinking about a multiplayer game, but it would defs require to be tick based. I dunno how hard it is with that engine
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Feel it in your bones
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Only way how you can fix bug in valve games as a community member:
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Step 1: Study programming
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Step 2: Get a job in Valve
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Step 3: Make update you wanted
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Step 4: Quit
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ez
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If that would work. Why didn't somebody do that to port csgo to source engine 2 yet xd
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You need to cooperate and communicate with other double agents but you lose those abilities on step 1
