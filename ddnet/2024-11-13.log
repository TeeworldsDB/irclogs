00:00 < bridge> <avolicious> But I guess you have to send it all the time in snaps, no?
00:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> no clue how it works
00:09 < bridge> <kebscs> in what way does it persist colors
00:09 < bridge> <kebscs> @sollybunny
00:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> normally when the chat is "remade", all the colors for client messages (that are made by echo) are reset to cl chat client message color
00:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> this stores, for client messages, the color of each message
00:11 < bridge> <kebscs> "remade"?
00:11 < bridge> <kebscs> i do `cl_message_client_color green` and then every echo is green even after reconnect
00:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> can u vc 1
00:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> is there even a vc 1
00:11 < bridge> <kebscs> not rly
00:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> its hard to show otherwise
00:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> many plp have keybinds which toggle cl_message_client_color between red and green eg
00:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> for enabling and disabling dummy copy
00:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> when you open scoreboard or chat all the client messages are reset to the most recent value of cl_message_client_color
00:13 < bridge> <kebscs> ah yea this
00:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306034211878338571/image.png?ex=673532a5&is=6733e125&hm=c2b2bb6dd92c93b6348149ad8eb1900edf75b2caaf496736844ac1403b6ad4e5&
00:13 < bridge> <kebscs> ok now makes sense
00:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> when i have multiple configuration options it confuses me alot
00:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> which costs mistakes and time xd
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> eg if i accidently toggle my kill protection
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> and i then toggle something else
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> i look at the chat and it says "sewerslide ..." and its green
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> so my kill protection must be on!
00:14 < bridge> <robyt3> See #8381
00:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8381
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah i saw that
00:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> htis is just a fix for one of those
00:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> htis is just a fix for one of those bulletpts
00:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> probably shuld link it
00:15 < bridge> <robyt3> If it fixes the issue, add the text "Closes #8381" to the PR description
00:15 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8381
00:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> but it doesnt close it
00:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> but thats useful to know
00:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> if i pressed resolved on both why does it still show as this
00:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306040254989598831/image.png?ex=67353845&is=6733e6c5&hm=421764ede08dd127364bbf6de1fbac31ed67e8f3e5eddf56aa928a060bba1ec9&
00:44 < bridge> <kebscs> the comment
00:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> if i reply to the comment? does that work
00:45 < bridge> <kebscs> best to reply if someone else looks at this pr in the future and doesnt know about the discord convo
00:46 < bridge> <kebscs> but i dont think it resolves the review thing
00:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> yep
00:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> but does that make the changes requested go away
00:46 < bridge> <kebscs> .
00:46 < bridge> <kebscs> idk
00:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> well i need to test something first
00:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> then

01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> im on linux, and although ive setup cpp on windows b4 i cant help very much with errors
01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you havent done anything to set it up, the readme is a very good place to start
01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet>
01:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> scroll down to "Building on Windows with the Visual Studio IDE"
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> @liberiumrat come to #off-topic and type to me in russian
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it will be fast bcs i have a translator thing
02:20 < bridge> <zhn> it exploits envelopes and game tick sent to client to display these
02:21 < bridge> <zhn> also these quads are being added in runtime :brownbear:
02:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> ew !! :D
03:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless done
06:10 < bridge> <woidless> What are the commands in the config , and thank you
06:16 < bridge> <Ewan> where’s the confessional
06:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i have sinned
07:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @woidless: no config it is active by default
07:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you didn't choose the lang :santatrollet:
07:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I didn’t get your comment
07:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean the python code is already there. Do you want to use teeworlds styled network.py or libtw2 json?
07:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> There's python version but I won't yoink it
07:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lately I have become manual over generation enjoyer. What even do you want to generate? Message structs? Could also just copy paste generated code from ddnet code base xd
07:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why no yoink?
07:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's not hard to write myself
07:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok pro
07:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
07:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have no preferences when it comes to js, pyson and ruby they are all the same imo
07:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Biggest L of ruby is its typo annotation ecosystem is a bit trashed
07:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> js without typescript? :feelsbadman:
07:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Then Ill add them as options on a wheel and spin it
07:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> There's jsdoc
07:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes pretty much the same
07:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don‘t you have a preference?
07:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have never written pyson xd
07:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao I doubt that
07:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And js?
07:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not go with what you know
07:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody knows ruby
07:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or do it in C for the memes
07:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I know it the most
07:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Js^
07:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok then I recommend js and C in that order
07:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you don’t like js go with C not any other script lang
07:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> If it was rust we could just cook some cool declarative or proc macro for this
07:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If it was rust we could use libtw2 and call it done
07:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fair :/
07:54 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible to implement speed with tune commands

08:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat that works without malloc? o.O
09:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Works what?
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the new thing
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i guess its returning by value crazy
09:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would have never dared to return a local struct
09:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> returning structs by value works
09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it passes a pointer to a memory from where you call it
09:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok mr language developer
09:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hard feelings on ``unpacker_read_int`` vs ``unpacker_get_int`` xd?
09:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nah
09:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and can i keep this around ``uint8_t *unpack_int(uint8_t *buf, const uint8_t *buf_end, int32_t *value, Error *err);`` and call it from the other one?
09:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why do you need it?
09:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like have a stateless one around to pop one int
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sure i scratch it then you always create a stateful one
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1731485246.png
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this was my plan
09:31 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> can you tell me how to make a delay for example for 7 seconds in your client.cpp console command
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @lsdglsgdflk your request is sus
09:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> What's the use case
09:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> hax
09:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> :nouis:
09:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: what packet does the server respond with after NETMSG_INFO in 0.6.4?
09:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> does it respond at all
09:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> i was trying to setup a small client with libtw2 but got no response
09:59 < bridge> <zhn> launch libtw2 server and enable trace, or log incoming and outcoming packets
10:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> ty
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato in 0.7 you are supposed to get a map change im pretty sure its the same in 0.6 too https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/system_messages.html#NETMSG_INFO
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yup same in 0.6

11:47 < bridge> <imanrezai1380> What query can I use to retrieve this information?
12:09 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
12:09 < bridge> <woidless> How do I change the tick speed server?
12:10 < bridge> <woidless> and if I reduce the server tick speed, will a game mode be created where everything is slow
12:11 < furo> No, you can't change tick speed.
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> It just won't be compatible with default clients :c
12:14 < bridge> <woidless> But I want to make a game mode like everything happens in slow motion, but the hook, weapons, etc. shoot and do their actions as usual with their own speed
12:14 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible?
12:16 < furo> Yes, you change the tunes. https://ddnet.org/settingscommands/#tunings
12:17 < bridge> <woidless> I can't figure out which one
12:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Almost all of them
12:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Actually would be trivial to make a tool that generates the list of tunes to slow down or speed up the game by a given factor
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x ground_control_speed 5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x air_control_speed 2.5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x ground_control_accel 1
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x air_control_accel 0.75
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x gravity 0.25
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x air_friction 0.975
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x air_jump_impulse 8.5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x ground_jump_impulse 9.5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x hook_drag_accel 1.5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> tune_zone x hook_drag_speed 7.5
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
12:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> just half the default values like a sane person
12:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
12:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think being able to control tune_zones using % would be nice tho
12:26 < bridge> <woidless> What does x mean?
12:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Some values need to double and some divided by the square root of 2
12:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> e.g air_friction 300%
12:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> the tune zone number. https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=2418
12:27 < bridge> <woidless> And if I want to be completely on the server?
12:28 < bridge> <woidless> Should I use a regular tune?
12:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> some values like the air_control_speed has a default value of `250.0f / SERVER_TICK_SPEED`.. interesting
12:29 < bridge> <woidless> If I write all this down, what will be the deceleration factor? For example , the default is 1 , that is, the game does not slow down , but how much will it be after I enter
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> / 2
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> e.g the default value of ground_control_speed is 1^0
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> e.g the default value of ground_control_speed is 10
12:29 < bridge> <woidless> Is it like 2 times slower?
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> e.g the default value of ground_control_speed is 10 for example
12:30 < bridge> <woidless> And I understood
12:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The jump impulses are the values that need to be scaled by the square root of the factor
12:30 < bridge> <woidless> For example, ground_control_speed is 10 by default , and if I want to slow down by 4 times, will it be 2.5?
12:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ye
12:31 < bridge> <woidless> Ok I went to insert these commands
12:34 < bridge> <woidless> @blaiszephyr And now how to add a vote to the slowdown, I'm not sure that I can add so many commands to 1 vote
12:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Use an exec command in the vote, and put all the tune commands in a separate file
12:44 < bridge> <woidless> And the voting is looking for, for example, a txt file in which directory?
12:44 < bridge> <woidless> For example, my server is located at root/DDNetPP/build
12:44 < bridge> <woidless> This is a virtual machine
12:53 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> ty
12:54 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I want my skin to change color every 7 seconds, I know how to make it change but I don't know how to make a delay
12:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> delay commands are big illegal because you can cheat with them
12:56 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> cheat by changing skin color?
12:56 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I'll keep that in mind, thank you
12:56 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> 😎
12:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no, I mean, if you used such a command in some other way, maybe with time delays closer to a small fraction of a second...
12:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though then again if you're already modifying your client the only thing stopping you from cheating is your conscience
12:58 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> Sorry, I don't know what this will give, but as I understand it's something serious, then can you tell me how else I can make the color change every 7 seconds?
12:59 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> я просто хочу дополнять т клиент
12:59 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I just want to complement the client
12:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, just adding the command won't get you in trouble as long as you don't abuse it
12:59 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I just want to complement the tartar client
13:00 < bridge> <woidless> @inv41idu53rn4m3 And how to add a vote that does not make any team
13:00 < bridge> <woidless> @inv41idu53rn4m3 And how to add a vote that does not make any command
13:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Why would you want a vote that does nothing?
13:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you want a command to reset the speed to normal you still need a command for that
13:01 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I've already done quite a few things, including a command to connect to a random friend, and now I just wanted to make a command to change the color every 7 seconds
13:01 < bridge> <woidless> Well, it's kind of necessary, like a brand
13:01 < bridge> <woidless> You just need to have a vote, like, but it doesn't do anything.
13:02 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> I think if I wanted to harm the project I wouldn't have played almost 1000 hours on it and wouldn't have applied for a moderator
13:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I don't doubt you
13:03 < bridge> <woidless> Like how to skip between types of voting
13:03 < bridge> <woidless> Like first there is a map change , and then skipping and slowing down
13:05 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> can you tell me how to make a delay for example for 7 seconds in your client.cpp console command
13:21 < furo> @woidless Use "info" as the command for the vote to make it unvoteable
13:32 < bridge> <woidless> @blaiszephyr
13:34 < bridge> <woidless> For example, I want the player to be able to jump to the point that was at normal gravity 0.5 when slowed down by 4 times. For example, now the deceleration is 4 times, but a person from a normal jump can jump to a point that is at 0.5 gravity
13:34 < bridge> <woidless> I want, for example, when slowing down 4 times, the player could jump to the point that was at normal gravity 0.5. For example, now the deceleration is 4 times, but a person from a normal jump can jump to a point that is at 0.5 gravity
13:35 < bridge> <woidless> But when I specify tune gravity 0.5 in all slowdowns it doesn't look like slowdown anymore
13:42 < furo> @lsdglsgdflk The general idea is that you have one variable to track which tick the "delay" was last executed, and then check if that tick was more than 7 seconds ago. You can get the current tick from the client using the `CGameWorld::GameTick()` function. You can convert ticks to seconds by dividing the value by `SERVER_TICK_SPEED` (50).
13:55 < bridge> <woidless> This is what slowing down by 4 times should look like, that is, I jump to the default height when jumping. But only here I slowed down the video, and on my server it should be according to the conditions that all weapons, hooks, etc. do their actions as usual, but the player’s movement, jumping, etc. should be slowed down so that I can jump to the default height with a normal jump but supposedly with a slowdown
13:55 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306241091141636176/CHIll.mp4?ex=6735f350&is=6734a1d0&hm=69bc8d8d229650c7af953362e1a8689d798e40334cfe9a7e512a902ebeb71dc3&
13:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah maybe I'll make that little thing for you so you can get a bunch of different speed tunes, I kinda want it myself too...
13:57 < bridge> <woidless> But I am using DDNetPP on my server
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How does velocity ramp work? I assume I'll need to tweak the velramp tunes for a proper slomo...
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> the velocity ramp controls your horizontal velocity. if your velocity exceeds 75 and you try to go even faster you will slow down instead. those 3 tunes determine the function to calculate your horizontal velocity.
14:49 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306254574885011556/Screenshot_2024-11-13-18-49-09-642_com.discord.png?ex=6735ffdf&is=6734ae5f&hm=f8f57e6f755a04e4457f9da4b049ef55a00758f84f022ee6bd5cf0d1de114d02&
14:49 < bridge> <woidless> This
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I know, what I'm asking is what's the function
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I need to know the function so I know how to modify those tunes
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> These parameters describe the shape of the velramp curve. Your velocity gets multiplied by the velramp value to get the final velocity
14:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> then again reaching 75 speed is very rare in normal gameplay and I'm sure no speeder tile section is going to work out with a slomo tune anyways
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> It slows you down more and more as you go faster and faster, to the point where you just stop. That's why you get those very weird effects like the shotgun bug
14:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh wait no 75 is only the point at which it reverses with the normal velramp
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I'd like to know how that curve is calculated
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If I can't get an explanation then at least a pointer as to where in the code I'd have to look for that would be nice
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> It should be in gamecore.cpp
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> thamks <3
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Here is a graph of the velramp function
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Actually it's a graph of the final velocity. Not the ramp function
14:58 < bridge> <woidless> @inv41idu53rn4m3
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if(Value < Start)
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>         return 1.0f;
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>     return 1.0f / std::pow(Curvature, (Value - Start) / Range);
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yay
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```cpp
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if(Value < Start)
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>     return 1.0f;
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> return 1.0f / std::pow(Curvature, (Value - Start) / Range);
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
14:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yay
14:59 < bridge> <woidless> I will be able to fix it so that there is a normal jump.
14:59 < bridge> <woidless> There you need to build jump_impulse at the root
14:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I figured out how jump_impulse works
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> ```tune ground_control_speed 5
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune air_control_speed 2.5
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune ground_control_accel 1
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune air_control_accel 0.75
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune gravity 0.25
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune air_friction 0.975
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune air_jump_impulse 8.5
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune ground_jump_impulse 9.5
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune hook_drag_accel 1.5
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> tune hook_drag_speed 7.5```
15:04 < bridge> <woidless> These are 2x decelerations, and now I need to divide all values not related to jump impulse by 2 for further deceleration in 4x and put jump impulses at the root?
15:25 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
15:55 < bridge> <louis> i wonder who thought to ramp velocity instead of acceleration 😹
16:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just spent a proper minute trying to understand why the ramp function wasn't giving me what I expected
16:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and now I feel like an idiot because what I care about is `v * ramp(v * 50)`
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: I have found out my mistake, I was supposed to wrap the packet in the System enum before sending it, that is why I got no response:
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```rs
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> // after
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> let info_packet = System::Info(Info {
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato>     version: VERSION.as_bytes(),
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato>     password: Some(b"")
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> });
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> // before
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> let info_packet = Info {
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato>     version: VERSION.as_bytes(),
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato>     password: Some(b"")
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> };
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
16:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> I am getting the map change packet as expected, thank you!
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok I just realized we've all been stupid
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> somehow we assumed gravity / 2 was correct for half speed, but the real way to do it is gravity / 4
17:03 < bridge> <teero777> Hate to break it to you but *real*slowmo is not possible due to quantization.
17:03 < bridge> <teero777> Hate to break it to you but *real* slowmo is not possible due to quantization.
17:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah that much was obvious from the start but I'm doing my best
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm also seeing a rather noticeable problem with player on player collision, there are forces applied there and you can not tune the magnitude of those
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Maybe add tunes for that? Could be funny
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```cpp
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> m_Vel += Dir * a * (Velocity * 0.75f);
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> m_Vel *= 0.85f;
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> these two lines are meanies 😠 
17:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they're ruining my day 😡
17:13 < bridge> <teero777> If you don't care abt others you *can* recompile both client and server with SERVER_TICK_SPEED set to smth like 25tps to get a proper 2x slowdown

17:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> anyways here you go this is my best attempt right now

17:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not sure if I missed anything
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Usage: `python speedtune.py <speed factor> [prefix]`
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Example: `python speedtune.py 0.5 tune`
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This'll generate global tune commands to make things go at 0.5x speed
17:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the prefix is there so that you can generate tune_zone commands
17:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> actually let me make it default to regular tune
17:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there you go, a very simple 4 character edit :P

17:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> now, did you use AI or did you use multi cursors, or did cou ctrl+c & ctrl+v the shit out of the print statements :kekw:
17:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> now, did you use AI or did you use multi cursors, or did you ctrl+c & ctrl+v the shit out of the print statements :kekw:
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I used vim macros :)
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I did the edit for a single line, recorded that into a macro, then repeated that macro a bunch of times
17:31 < bridge> <woidless> Wow montikboom himself, the creator of slownet, writes
17:31 < bridge> <montikboom> Do server and client have tick speed? Can server changes make tickspeed desync? Please respond🙏🙏🙏
17:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dislike vim macros - i use multicursor and `iwr` :kekw:
17:33 < bridge> <montikboom> ??
17:34 < bridge> <montikboom> Can you respond please
17:35 < bridge> <montikboom> To this
17:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> mate i'm not teero, i dont know this stuff
17:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> iwr?
17:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> teero is the gigachad here
17:36 < bridge> <montikboom> teero please
17:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh i think i changed that keybind.. `in word replace` iirc the default is change inner word `ciw`
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> There is no such packet. Thats why I said recompile BOTH client AND server
17:37 < bridge> <montikboom> which packet? I'm not understanding much
17:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh yeah
17:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Main problems with tuning the game speed I can see are caused by player collision, which makes flying feel different at different speeds
17:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> when accelerated the player collision will feel weak, when slowed down the player collision will feel strong
17:45 < bridge> <montikboom> Why y'all need slowmo
17:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> funny
17:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just saw it as something interesting to try
17:53 < bridge> <woidless> I personally need to set up MY server
17:55 < bridge> <animepdf> ChillerDragon: As 07 cultist you should know, where can I find full 07 protocol documentation
17:55 < bridge> <animepdf> Exploring source code again sounds fun and stuff, but I fell like someone already described it
17:57 < bridge> <animepdf> oh, there is actually one done by you, it was first result in google, my bad, nvm
18:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I didn't try it before sending the code but apparently very slow speeds just totally break, like, the game just rounds things to zero
18:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> sad :(
18:04 < bridge> <montikboom> BROOOO, NAAAAH, THAT'S MINE IDEA, SEARCH UP FOR SlowNET in NONE TAB IN DDNET
18:04 < bridge> <montikboom> Tunes not mine, but server is
18:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> what are you working on?
18:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yes and yes, but i don’t know what you will do with any of this info. i think it’s a compile time constant so you’d need to change your server and client to get it to work
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> im also learning the protocol little by little
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> not sure why
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> its fun
18:09 < bridge> <woidless> I'm just using tune on my server. GS)
18:52 < bridge> <animepdf> *the thing*
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> exciting
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://gitlab.brokenpipe.de/stettberger/avremu
19:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Apparently hook_fire_speed higher than the default 80 is also weird and broken?
19:55 < bridge> <zhn> at his protocol documentation
19:55 < bridge> <zhn> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html
20:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> he later said that he found it
20:14 < bridge> <montikboom> пашол ты
20:15 < bridge> <zhn> another blockwar comes?
20:15 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
20:16 < bridge> <montikboom> wut
20:17 < bridge> <montikboom> my host blamed my developer because the host doesen't know that 💀
20:18 < bridge> <montikboom> i asked that to prove him he is not right
20:18 < bridge> <montikboom> ty
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> wait maybe i misunderstood
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> changes to the server tick rate will make the clients desync if they don’t have the same tick rate
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but a normal change to the server like adding a feature wouldn’t do that
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> im not sure exactly what would happen if you did connect to a server with a different tick rate but i expect it would just appear very buggy & drop many of your inputs
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> or crash. who knows
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s a reason it’s constant
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> now i wonder if you could achieve the same physics with 2x tick rate and a tune which halves every time-based parameter
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> just play on lan with your bros
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> super ddnet…
20:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Afair you can change the tick rate of your local server without client changes
20:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> There's at least a high bandwidth settings thingie
20:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> Or maybe I'm mixing things
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> that may be to communicate at 50tps but i’m not sure
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> the actual tick rate/game logic would remain
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> based on how i understand it
20:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> I never looked into it, Teero worked with it so he knows it
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> ive never touched protocol/server code in that sense
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> but based on how i understand it, the game and server both run isolated at 50tps, and each packet sent between has 2 ticks worth of info
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> and the high bandwidth stuff will make it communicate at twice the rate (e.g full speed)?
21:43 < bridge> <montikboom> if server will have tick rate speed bigger, and client lower, then server can't follow client speed and it starts to teleport client
21:43 < bridge> <montikboom> Which will made decync
21:43 < bridge> <montikboom> And you can play that because it will feel like ping or ddos
21:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> My client suddenly stopped showing any movement and became unresponsive after I increased the tick speed just by 1
21:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> That was quite funny honestly
21:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> :nouis:

22:23 < bridge> <sikmind> umm hey hope you guys doin well

22:31 < bridge> <01000111g> how will dummy work with new acc system? if ur finish is mapped to your account, then u sometimes get teamrabks with urself?
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if that would change
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i think names will just have accounts behind them as a prerequisite to being able to finish a map anyway
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> so that system won’t necessarily have to change
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i would imagine that the account identifier will be a fairly transparent thing and just used for keeping track of unique players independently from their name
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> and then maybe names can just be assigned to accounts, with an optional exclusivity parameter to say that other players can or cannot use this name
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds manual and complicated that way though
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
22:56 < bridge> <learath2> No hashing, just an O(n) lookup through the list of bans
23:03 < bridge> <sikmind> ohhh
23:03 < bridge> <sikmind> well
23:03 < bridge> <sikmind> can you please tell me in which file this ban is implemented so i can check it out?
