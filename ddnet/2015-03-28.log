05:00 < Edible> spectate_next ?
05:01 < Edible> oh wait
05:01 < Edible> that was before i left
05:01 < Edible> hope someone answered you seymour__
05:01 < Edible> hey shorefire
05:02 < Edible> you cant do anything about trolls though
05:32 < shorefire> Hi
05:47 < shorefire> Edible: you can do a lot about trolls, its just being bothered to do so
05:48 < Edible> depends on the kind of trolling
05:48 < Edible> which one was skeith doing?
05:48 < Edible> being obnoxious?
05:49 < shorefire> Skeith is known for trying hes hardest to piss people off
05:49 < shorefire> Either by blocking, subtle things, or just stalking and abusing language/personal insults
05:49 < shorefire> (Of which could be easily delt with had there been moderators around)
05:50 < shorefire> A simple mute goes a long way and stops the argument progressing
05:51 < shorefire> But hey, its almost 4am.  I'll leave this discussion for another day when I'm sobar and awake :p
05:53 < Edible> me2
05:53 < Edible> goodnight man
05:53 < shorefire> \o
09:19 <@EastByte> good morning
09:19 <@EastByte> deen: are you there? :D
09:34 <@EastByte> nvm, gotta go :)
13:30 < cris272> i just watched the new video on the home page, they are mutants
13:47 <@deen> cris272: haha, what?
13:47 <@deen> (I should have watched that)
13:49 < cris272> hook fly with 3 tee and hf with 4 is crazy 
13:50 <@deen> yeah, didn'T even know it works with 4. they make it look that easy
14:11 < Learath2> someone should tell spyker to reduce the blur
14:24 < Learath2> and deen i think you should cache the images in the skin database as it takes quite some time to load the page with the javascript
14:28 <@deen> I didn't write that, no idea how it all works
16:40 < ochristi> quacknet so unstable
19:04 < Nimda> Against the Current by Themix just released on Moderate at 2015-03-28 19:01
21:17 < ochristi> meh Ping peak at gtt this time not
21:18 < ochristi> not telekom
21:36 <@deen> Hm, someone just managed to fall out of the map
21:36 <@deen> didn't know that's possible
21:36 <@deen> and he kept falling and falling
21:36 <@deen> and everyone on server had 1fps
21:36 <@deen> 50 player server
21:36 <@deen> never seen that happen before
21:37 < laxa> deen: it happened before
21:37 < laxa> if I remember right...
21:38 <@deen> when?
21:38 <@deen> i know one time we had that bug
21:38 <@deen> but that should have been fixed 1 year ago
21:38 < laxa> wow, really long time ago ^^
21:42 <@deen> huh, where was the code to kill you when you leave the map?
21:42 <@deen> character.cpp:1231 looks like it
21:42 <@deen> but looks weirdish
21:44 <@deen> and especially character.cpp:735 is commented out, oh god
21:44 <@deen> how do players even die when they leave the map?!
21:44 <@deen> ok, character.cpp:1244 should be it
21:49 <@deen> Oh god...
21:50 <@deen> So if you're in a team, and you finished, but your partner didn't, you can fall outside of the map
21:53 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/jziJ

21:53 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 bb88034 def: Merge branch 'DDRace64' of github.com:def-/ddnet into DDRace64
22:25 < ochristi> ah had the thought about team, even though I did not look at the code :D
22:43 < laxa> You guys know any dev t-shirts that are cheap & good on Europe ? :)
22:48 < fstd> what's a dev t-shirt?
22:49 < fstd> h-have i been doing it wrong all the years wearing all normal t-shirts?
22:51 < laxa> Lol no
22:52 < laxa> But, I need to buy new t-shirts, and I want something different than plain color shirts :)
22:52 < laxa> like game/esport/dev t-shirts !
22:53 < fstd> sorry, totally not my cup of tea :)
22:54  * fstd likes plain color shirts
22:54 < fstd> or striped or something, but withot a "message" or something
22:54 < fstd> s/or something//
22:54 <@deen> laxa: get the ddnet t-shirts!
22:55 < laxa> deen: xD, what's the price ?
22:55 <@deen> http://ddnet.spreadshirt.de/
22:55 <@deen> 17.40 €
22:55 <@deen> of which I get exactly 0.00 €
22:55 < fstd> a real bargain
22:55 < laxa> nice, it's cheap enough for me :)
22:55 <@deen> I only know of 2 people who bought one
22:56 <@deen> laxa: do you play LoL?
22:57 < laxa> no
22:57 < laxa> I am playing dota 2 right now
22:57 <@deen> same
22:57 < laxa> I'll never play LoL, it's for casual players, too easy for me.
22:57 < laxa> Dota 2 is more elitist, more fun, more skill capped.
22:57 <@deen> I mean dota2 and LoL is the same, not that I play as well
22:57 < laxa> they are both Moba
22:58 < laxa> but they are completely different :)
22:58 <@deen> never heard of MOBA, there is a whole genre of DOTA games now?
22:58 <@deen> i played it back in wc3, but preferred race maps even then
22:59 <@deen> ahaha
22:59 <@deen> the german wikipedia lists ASSFAGGOTS as an alternative name for MOBA
22:59 < laxa> LoL / Dota / HoN / heroes of the storm / smite are all MOBA
23:00 < laxa> dota was the first one
23:00 < laxa> it created the game genre MOBA
23:00 <@deen> yeah, i guessed. didn't see any other games like that before
23:01 <@deen> I have no idea why these games got so popular though
23:16 <@deen> Learath2: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1200&p=12414#p12414
23:16 <@deen> I just got this as well once, but can't reproduce
23:17 < Learath2> well 2 ways either i need a screenshot of the console or a way to reproduce
23:18 < eeeee> i also mostly have plain color shirts, but i'd totally wear something with just a logo on it without any text
23:19 < eeeee> so people familiar with it would recognize it but others will just think it's some kind of tshirt art or sth
23:19 <@deen> Learath2: http://ddnet.tw/httplog.txt http://ddnet.tw/httpsegfault.txt
23:19 < Learath2> just stuck like that ?
23:19 <@deen> All I did was set cl_http_map_download 0 while ingame and changed server
23:20 <@deen> it segfaulted then, yes
23:20 < Learath2> well i didnt code cl_http_map_download letme check whats wrong
23:20 <@deen> I'd say pFile in fetcher.cpp is NULL
23:21 <@deen> ah
23:21 <@deen> can reproduce
23:21 <@deen> set it to 0, back to 1
23:21 <@deen> and join a server
23:22 <@deen> and yes, pFile is NULL
23:22 < Learath2> huh how could pFile be NULL
23:23 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/httpsegfault2.txt
23:24 < Learath2> do i need to download a file with cl_http_map_download 0 deen ?
23:25 <@deen> not that easy to reproduce after all
23:25 <@deen> maybe i just had luck^^
23:26 < Learath2> yeah couldnt quite reproduce like that
23:28 < Learath2> deen: well assuming its just us passing null to curl a simple check after io_open should be enough
23:29 < Learath2> but obv doesnt fix the root cause just prevents the sigsegv
23:29 <@deen> yes it is us
23:29 <@deen> i guess
23:29 <@deen> but why can't we open the file?
23:30 <@deen> and why does it even try to open the file
23:30 <@deen> when the fetcher is deactivated
23:30 < Learath2> oh when its deactivated ??
23:30 <@deen> i can't reproduce it
23:30 < eeeee> can't it be because you're reinitializing curl while it's still downloading something?
23:30 <@deen> but i downloaded a map with curl, then without curl, then with and bam, segfault
23:31 < Learath2> im only initializing curl at client init and even if you disable http dload it just stays initialized in the back
23:33 < Getsuga> when i go to my ddnet profile its 502 bad gateway any way to fix?
23:33 < Getsuga> http://ddnet.tw/players/Getsuga/
23:33 <@deen> that means something's wrong with the database, let me check
23:33 < Getsuga> tahnkyou
23:33 < Learath2> deen: im just spamming downloads with different settings and i cant seem to reproduce it could it be somehow linux related ?
23:34 <@deen> Learath2: the guy on the forum is on Windows
23:34 <@deen> Getsuga: did i move your name recently?
23:34 < Getsuga> not that i know of
23:35 < Getsuga> what do you mean by move my name ?
23:35 <@deen> renamed you
23:35 < Getsuga> nope
23:35 < Learath2> deen: dont think its the same issue with yours then
23:36 < Learath2> he says the download was done after leaving it unattended for some time
23:36 <@deen> Learath2: read more down please
23:36 <@deen> Learath2: i know what his first bug is about
23:36 <@deen> that's just his router's firmware being broken and his provider being an ass
23:37 <@deen> (not allowing him to update)
23:40 <@deen> Getsuga: hm, that happens when you havea teamrank but the regular rank is missing, weird
23:40 <@deen> don't like the database to get corrupt =/
23:40 < Learath2> yeah really cant reproduce the crash only thing i can advice is fetcher.cpp:L103 
23:40 < Getsuga> hmm, i have not seen anyone else with the problem so im sure its a one time thing
23:41 <@deen> nono, it occured a few times already, but usually it was my fault
23:41 <@deen> Learath2: ok, can you just catch the nullpointer there?
23:41 < Learath2> ill push it up
23:41 <@deen> Learath2: maybe show a message or restart, no idea
23:41 <@deen> (restart download)
23:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #178: Catch an IO error (DDRace64...pr_fetchernullptr) http://git.io/jgkE
23:43 < Learath2> deen: setting the state error flag should cause the client to fallback to gameserver download
23:43 <@deen> great
23:43 <@deen> Thanks Learath2 
23:44 < laxa> deen: t-shirt bought !
23:44 < Learath2> dont merge thaat 
23:44 < Learath2> one seeec
23:44 < Learath2> i need to call the callback somehow 
23:44 < laxa> Their mails are in german, so nice <_<
23:44 <@deen> laxa: nice!
23:45 < Learath2> you'd kill me if i introduce a goto wouldnt you :D
23:45 <@deen> laxa: i have to say i don't get spreadshirt. I wanted to make an english account so everything is in english, but then they send it from the US...
23:46 < laxa> Lol
23:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #179: Do call the callback even if it fails (DDRace64...pr_fetchernullptr) http://git.io/jgI0
23:48 <@deen> no goto, good :P
23:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/jgIa

23:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 7a4c999 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #179 from Learath2/pr_fetchernullptr...
23:49 <@deen> Getsuga: there you go: http://ddnet.tw/players/Getsuga/
23:49 < Getsuga> Thanks so much deen
23:49 < Getsuga> see you later man.
23:49 <@deen> have fun on ddnet, bye
23:49 < Learath2> really had to use lots of willpower to not use goto :D
23:50 < Learath2> deen: you said it happened when cl_http_download was 0 
23:50 <@deen> i don't know honestly^^
23:50 < Learath2> dont think this will quite fix it if thats the case
23:50 <@deen> i was just toggling it wildly between 0 and 1
23:51 < Learath2> yeah im doing the same but couldnt reproduce yet even tried aborts
23:51 <@deen> i only got it 2 times out of maybe 100 tries =/
23:52 < Learath2> i think it might be a curl internal issue tbh deen
23:52 <@deen> it's more probable that we just use curl in a wrong way
23:53 < Learath2> i dont see how we could fail to open a file 
23:53 <@deen> maybe if the file is already opened?
23:53 < Learath2> would that fail ? idk 
23:54 <@deen> no idea
23:54 <@deen> I'm also wondering how a rank can just be lost
23:54 <@deen> a rank from half a year ago even
23:54 < Learath2> yeah thats weird 
23:54 < Learath2> i'd check the logs :D
23:55 <@deen> maybe he just noticed now and it was always gone?
23:55 <@deen> it could have happened back then
23:55 <@deen> since he plays on South African server only, and that was connected to GER database back then
23:55 <@deen> so network problems could cause it
23:56 < Learath2> maybe he never got the rank
23:56 <@deen> there is a table for ranks and one for teamranks
23:56 <@deen> and he was in a team that got a rank
23:56 <@deen> so he should also have gotten a solo rank
23:58 < Learath2> well if you have logs from 6months ago i'd check those if not it will always be a mystery
