00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Gwendal more like 50 to 100
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> 100 is black
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> so it can't
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @jao
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 100% lightness = black? doesn't sound right :D
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> omg ye sorry xD
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reonarex> is there a way to enable /showall by default?
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> bind it to zoom-
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It was possible to write it behind the timeout code but since pls kill me it doesn't work and anyway gay new clients dont even have this thing where you can see timeout code
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a cmake competitor? https://bazel.build/
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is multi language :o
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti i also liked it, but it made it possible for other servers to steal your timeout code. now you have a different one on each server I think, so that's more secure. We could have a separate field for "commands to execute when connecting to server" if someone wants to program that. for the usecase of /showall the bind is good enough though
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bam > cmake @Ryozuki
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @everyone my timeout code is always 12345 :danAmazing:
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> so if i take this
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and ur name
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i can steal ur save when u timeout ?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> this is it ?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Someday i joined Back in Time 2 when two people tried to give dummy position to other player and used 12345 so when i joined i was teleported far into the map :danAmazing:
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u dont need to change ur name or anything
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> just type /timeout 12345 when i timeout
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> lol
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> insane shit
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> how do u set ur timeout code to 12345 tho ?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The same thing /timeout 12345
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I've got DDNet 9.4 client i can set standard timeout code in settings
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> :GWqlabsKek:
