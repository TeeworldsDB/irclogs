15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WA Hydra> DDNet project (not the solution) and select "Select as StartUp project". Now you should be able to compile DDNet by clicking the green, triangular "Run" button.

15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could also try this: https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=5765
23:13 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Update on FOSDEM: I applied for a DDNet stand, but unfortunately we didn't get one. I'm going there regardless and happy to meet anyone else also attending ðŸ™‚
23:13 <+bridge> <deen> Too bad, thanks for trying @Zwelf
23:14 <+bridge> <deen> I noticed that only major projects got accepted, so probably our chances were pretty low: https://fosdem.org/2023/news/2022-12-08-accepted-stands-fosdem-2023/
23:18 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Yeah, `0 A.D.` from previous years isn't present either (https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/stands/). I'll try to find out if they applied as well and maybe we can do a joined submission next year ðŸ˜…
23:20 <+bridge> <deen> Haha, good idea
23:27 <+bridge> <Patiga> I'll also be there (first-timer) :)
