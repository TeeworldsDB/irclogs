00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @DaRealFreak I think 5min should be enough pause
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you send all your udp packets at once?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe they get dropped because your uplink can't handle all of them?
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp \! -f -m u32 --u32 "26&0xffff=0x7865 && 32=0x7844ffff && 36=0xffff6769 && 38&0xffff=0x6533" -j REJECT`
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> ... i planned to send them in chunks but my sleep was in the wrong block apparently...
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> god I'm dumb

12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does any1 know what could cause this weird behaviour that the dude with the special letters gets an weird looking character instead of his actual block points printed?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> BlockPoints is an integer row and as u can see in the 2nd query there is nothing wrong with the ints. But combined with the LastLogoutIGN it gets messed up
12:56 <@deen>  that looks suspiciously like hebrew
12:56 <@deen> so probably switched to rtl
12:56 <@deen> the alef I mean: ◊ê
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rtl ?
12:57 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_mark
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmmm
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any ideas how to fix it?
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this looks dangerous
12:57 <@deen> filter out, escape
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how to do that but ill do some research
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess rtl is a good point to start
13:48 <@deen> replace(username, 'rtlmarkhere', '') or sth like that
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah Sounds easy haha
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Thanks
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ill have a Look later
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon note that this is not actually dangerous
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> @Learath2 what is dmca
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its a way corporations take down their copyrighted content from people that benefit from it, it didnt really apply in what i said but was just an example
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> ah  ok
