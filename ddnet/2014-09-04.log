00:10 < laxa> deen: why can't use dummy on backtobasics2 oO ?
00:11 < laxa> well dummy isn't working at all...
00:11 < laxa> I'll try new version
00:18 < laxa> fixed...
00:18 < laxa> No idea why it wasn't working anymore
00:36 <@deen> laxa: my bad, tried to fix something and broke dummy^^
00:36 <@deen> luckily i didn'T release yet!
00:59 < laxa> deen: are you still there ?
01:05 <@deen> ?
01:05 < laxa> ok
01:05 < laxa> A fucker name charly123 went on my server
01:05 < laxa> and changed map 
01:05 < laxa> then he followed me on another server just after
01:05 < laxa> to do the same
01:05 < laxa> I was wondering if you could check if he had another name with the same IP in the day
01:06 <@deen> i don't like doing that
01:06 <@deen> also it makes the server lag to scan all our log files^^
01:06 < laxa> lol
01:06 < laxa> grep makes the server lag xD ?
01:06 <@deen> yes
01:06 <@deen> every server i've ever seen
01:07 <@deen> the kernel doesn't like high disk usage on slow disks
01:07 < laxa> well
01:07 < laxa> I guess it's not a fake cause he has some ranks
01:07 <@deen> or maybe tw server flushes in the same thread?
01:07 < laxa> fucking retards...
01:07 < laxa> now I got a save bind
01:07 < laxa> I won't get fucked twice
01:08 <@deen> he seems to only play with that name
01:08 < laxa> EryX even tried to steal my save on solo-mietzcore xD
01:08 <@deen> but he sure plays a lot
01:08 < laxa> then it's a total fucker
01:08 <@deen> he was on every single GER server today
01:08 < laxa> playing a lot and having 6 finished on novice...
01:09 < laxa> anyway, I am not mad anymore, I finally finished mietzcore :p
01:09 < laxa> thanks for searching though <3
01:10 <@deen> you will start crying when you get to the 5 star solo maps
01:10 < laxa> Hehe :p
01:10 < laxa> Verification 9.0
01:10 < laxa> Bad mapped :(
01:10 < laxa> No unfreeze =x
01:11 < laxa> I won't finish 5 stars solo map
01:11 < laxa> It's the fly maps with 1 tile high ways
01:11 < laxa> No way xD
01:12 <@deen> 28 people have finished all novice maps!
01:12 < laxa> Oh
01:12 < laxa> One thing
01:12 < laxa> before finally going to sleep
01:13 < laxa> Don't you wanna increase number of points won last week + month displayed on the website ?
01:13 < laxa> the same number as finishes ?
01:13 < laxa> So it looks "normal"
01:13 <@deen> maybe
01:15 <@deen> will get autoupdated in 8 mins
01:15 <@deen> will see if it works^^
01:21 < laxa> Gute Nacht jeder.

20:23 < laxa> deen: houston I have a problem.
20:23 < laxa> NO empty servers !
21:59 < laxa> deen: first bug on autorecord + map record is that autorecord stops when you end a map.
22:51 <@deen> laxa: nice, all GER servers had players?
22:51 < laxa> Yeah xD
22:51 < laxa> deen: I am trying to fix the click bug when you /pause /spec
22:51 < laxa> any tips to help me ? :p
22:52 <@deen> every way you could fix that could break other mods
22:52 <@deen> you have to see in the client that you're in spectate mode
22:52 <@deen> and don't send any inputs then
22:53 <@deen> and don't update the hit counter
22:53 < laxa> seems hard for me :p
22:53 < laxa> ok, I am trying to find a linux command
22:53 < laxa> to count all lines in files recursively
22:54 < laxa> any idea deen ?
22:54 <@deen> if you have zsh
22:54 <@deen> cat **/* | wc -l
22:54 <@deen> but you probably you mean sloccount
22:54 < laxa> sloccount ?
22:55 <@deen> http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/
22:55 < laxa> 11307 lines of code in teeworlds :!
22:55 < laxa> that was what I wanted to know :p
22:56 <@deen> sounds wrong
22:56 <@deen> it should about 10 times that much
22:57 < laxa> ok
22:57 < laxa> I tested something
22:57 < laxa> and I removed my git clone of ddnet
22:58 < laxa> hos to recover it ? :p
22:58 < laxa> I don't know shit about git
22:58 <@deen> i don't know what you did
22:58 < laxa> find ${SEARCH} \( -name '*~' -or -name '.*~' \) -exec rm -frv {} \;
22:58 < laxa> inside /src
22:58 <@deen> then you deleted it
22:58 <@deen> git reset --hard maybe
22:59 < laxa> doesn't work
22:59 <@deen> no idea
22:59 < laxa> no command to retrieve a folder oO ?
22:59 < laxa> Ok, another question, why git clone ddnet retrieves 150 MB when downloading the ddnet repo in zip is only 30 MB ?
23:00 <@deen> because of history
23:00 <@deen> git pull downloads the entire history of the repo
23:00 < laxa> Hum ok
23:00 <@deen> so you can jump around without internet access
23:00 < laxa> Oh nice :p
23:00 < laxa> Ok now
23:00 < laxa> I only count /src for teeworlds lines right ?
23:00 <@deen> right
23:01 <@deen> well, and datasrc
23:01 < laxa> ok
23:01 < laxa> 100431 lines xD
23:01 < laxa> find . -exec cat {} \; | wc -l
23:01 < laxa> your cat **/* | wc -l doesn't work :x
23:02 < laxa> but maybe it's because I am on bash
23:02 <@deen> sure it does, if you have zsh and some glob patterns
23:03 < laxa> ok, now, trying to fix click in spec...
23:03 < laxa> I have found ConTogglePause and ConToggleSpec
23:03 < laxa> but that's server sided
23:03 < laxa> any idea where the /pause & /spec might be inside client ?
23:03 <@deen> nowhere
23:03 <@deen> the client doesn't know about pause and spec
23:03 < laxa> Beh ?
23:03 <@deen> because that doesn't exist in vanilla
23:04 <@deen> you just become a spectator suddenly
23:04 < laxa> So...
23:04 <@deen> so when your team is TEAM_SPECTATORS you're in pause or spec
23:04 < laxa> How to check from client if you are /spec or /pause ?
23:04 < laxa> ok
23:09 < laxa> any idea where the hit counted would be placed deen ? :p
23:09 < laxa> I think I found a good method to reset it !
23:09 < laxa> CSpectator::CSpectator()
23:15 < laxa> Ok nevermind, I won't do it now. Too hard :p.
23:18 <@deen> don't reset it
23:18 <@deen> just don't increase it
23:18 <@deen> the hit counter is m_Fire in controls.cpp
23:23 < laxa> ok, I'll try to see if I can do something
23:23 < laxa> and how to make a pull request ?
23:23 < laxa> Do I need to fork ddnet on github for that ?
23:23 <@deen> Ask google first before asking me: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request
23:23 < laxa> Beh xD !
23:32 < laxa> sorry to bother you again deen, but what is needed beside datasrc/src/scripts/bam.lua/configure.lua to compile client ?
23:46 < laxa> Hum...
23:46 < laxa> deen: I am doing that : if (Team != TEAM_SPECTATORS), I guess it should be good, but I don't know which file to clinde.
23:46 < laxa> Team is defined at so many places
23:46 < laxa> *include
23:49 <@deen> huh
23:50 <@deen> i guess information about what team you're in is not meant to flow to CControls
23:52 <@deen> m_pClient->m_Snap.m_SpecInfo
23:52 <@deen> m_pClient->m_Snap.m_SpecInfo.m_Active
23:56 <@deen> laxa: 
23:57 < laxa> Yeah ?
