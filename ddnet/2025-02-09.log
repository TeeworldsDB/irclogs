13:04 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 first numbers are in, I found 46 maps who potentially abuse this bug. Should I try to reduce this number further? From experience this only happened on vertical speedtiles _so far_ and on ones, which are next to a wall.

13:12 < bridge> <chairn> you using twmap ?
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> yes
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> I use map.speedup_layer().tiles[1]
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> according to documentation this should be correct
13:13 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  Tilemap layers:
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |          tiles - 3d numpy array with the dimension [height, width, n]. The last dimension varies on the layer kind:
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |              'Tiles', 'Game', 'Front': [id, flags]
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |              'Tele': [number, id]
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |              'Speedup': [force, map_speed, id, angle]
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |                  In 'Speedup', elements are i16 instead of u8, since angle can be anywhere between 0 and 360
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |              'Switch': [number, id, flags, delay]
13:13 < bridge> <Assa>  |              'Tune': [number, id]
13:13 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:13 < bridge> <chairn> what's id in speedup ?
13:14 < bridge> <chairn> map_speed, typo for max_speed ?
13:14 < bridge> <Assa> should be always the same, should be the tile id from the speeup layer
13:16 < bridge> <Assa> okay speedup_layer().tiles contains 142 things
13:16 < bridge> <Assa> something seems to be incorrect
13:19 < bridge> <Assa> numpy shape is reversed ... (142, 351, 4)
13:28 < bridge> <Assa> now I find 474 maps including the ones we already have
13:28 < bridge> <chairn> that's quite a lot of map
13:29 < bridge> <Assa> trying to add more restrictions, brb
13:38 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i do it then? `"sv_name \"test\\\""` is correct but ParseArgs breaks it
14:04 < bridge> <robyt3> What does "breaks it" mean? Can you give the expected and actual output?
14:06 < bridge> <kebscs> expected is that servername is `test\` but parseargs thinks closing slash isnt escaped and will consume the last `\"` which means it never finds closing quote and says argument is invalid
14:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Why is the command `"sv_name \"test\\\""` though? The `sv_name` shouldn't be inside quotes. `sv_name "\"test\\\""` works as expected and sets the server name to `"test\"`
14:13 < bridge> <robyt3> It's best to post the results on GitHub so others can also discuss
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> this is what im putting into shell_execute, it has to be in quotes because its a single argument, without it it treats sv_name and test as seperate args because of the spacebar
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1338137881847267450/image.png?ex=67a9fd84&is=67a8ac04&hm=6cf79bbe37bc04ea9ca956276e9f6aa55ac6fde016352399da38ad22dbcc621a&
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> this is what im putting into shell_execute, it has to be in quotes because its a single argument, without them it treats sv_name and test as seperate args because of the spacebar

14:23 < bridge> <robyt3> But then the outer quotes should be stripped by the command line argument parsing. The string that is passed to `ParseArgs` shouldn't be enclosed in quotes
14:28 < bridge> <kebscs> they are
14:28 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1338139449464193085/image.png?ex=67a9fefa&is=67a8ad7a&hm=4f73549cb7b2b4840afe90915d63df461c2ddcf4b6f733ddcfc0b3129d37989c&
14:28 < bridge> <kebscs> or you meant the outer quotes of test?
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> `DDNet-Server.exe "sv_name \"name\\\\\""` --> `server: server name is 'name\'`, the outer quotes are stripped
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ig the logic has to escape the name properly
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if that was auto complete
14:44 < bridge> <Assa> yes, but I was running into issue xD currently I am working on a version where a potential position is also returned

14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well i am not asking bcs i care about the game xd
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it has a auto mapper rule creator
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and i wondered if you ever tried that
14:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh yea its pretty handy
14:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> kinda hard to wrap my head around
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> does it scale for teeworlds maps too?
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like, easy to use rule creators often are good for simple tile sets, but as soon as you want smth more complex it also get's very hard to use (if possible at all)
15:11 < bridge> <kebscs> ok so passing slashes to the function will look like this, same as whisper command does it
15:11 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1338150361201905674/image.png?ex=67aa0923&is=67a8b7a3&hm=5d1e8e7f43abbe2cec5292f501ca9f544b39de95bb25fc0bbad017bff7404262&

21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im looking it up
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> do int commands need to be const? because i feel like thats whats the warning is saying
21:17 < bridge> <louis> opposite
21:17 < bridge> <animepdf> 'const' type qualifier on return type has no effect
21:17 < bridge> <animepdf> return type with const makes no sense
21:18 < bridge> <louis> since ur returning an int, having const or not having const wont make a difference
21:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i guess so
21:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> maybe i misread what robyt3 said
21:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> > Also mark functions as const when possible to make it clear that the function does not modify this.
21:22 < bridge> <louis> @hectavoxel i think those should be static? not const
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> `int CAutoMapper::CheckIndexFlag(int Flag, const char *pFlag, bool CheckNone) const;`
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> if it doesnt modify `this`
