00:19 <@deen> hmm, even more complaints about FRA lagging

03:36 < laxa> Jailbreak 1, Determination, FWYS key
09:14 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/priv/13_Sep-14-09_12.png
09:14 < EastBite> lol I was really clever
10:18 <@deen> haha
12:12 <@deen> maybe i need to restart GER after all
12:13 <@deen> noone comes on the FRA server, player numbers are down a lot
12:21 <@deen> laxa: yay, another unexpected bug caused by a feature you wanted
12:59 < EastBite> which feature/bug ? :)
13:00 <@deen> hm, the github bot didn't come here again
13:00 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/886044532b82b6b2e87f11ab53a1f0a66a1b0a0f
13:00 <@deen> there's this weird guy asking me whether i like ddos attacks
13:01 <@deen> and telling me he downed facebook with a ddos
13:02 < EastBite> heh
13:03 <@deen> i guess they're pissed that FRA didn't go down
13:04 < EastBite> ovh is such a spoilsport :/
13:04 <@deen> he's showing me pictures of a datacenter
13:04 <@deen> and says "all these servers will ddos you and ddnet"
13:04 <@deen> aaaah, this kid
13:05 < EastBite> oh well
13:05 < EastBite> I guess I would start trolling in such a situation

14:08 < laxa> Flying in the Sky
14:31 < EastBite> deen: https://eastbit.net/priv/13_Sep-14-14_29.png
14:31 < EastBite> works so far
14:32 <@deen> what works?
14:32 <@deen> aaah
14:32 < EastBite> loaded from ddnet-servers.txt
14:32 <@deen> cool
14:33 < EastBite> now some neat filter settings and it should be enough for the first try
14:33 < EastBite> and download
14:34 < EastBite> deen: also make a serverlist :D
14:35 <@deen> me?
14:35 < EastBite> yes, youu
14:36 < EastBite> you should have some in your server status config
14:36 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/status.py
14:36 < EastBite> okay thanks
15:23 < EastBite> http://eastbit.net/priv/13_Sep-14-15_21.png
16:02 <@deen> hmmm
16:03 <@deen> I thought we wanted subgroups, but i guess that's easier
16:03 < EastBite> yep, subgroups are too much work for now I think
16:07 < EastBite> the ddnet tab would have been a benefit when ger was down and we tested fra
16:07 <@deen> no, when ddnet GER is down it would stop working too^^
16:07 < EastBite> nah, the list is cached
16:07 <@deen> so new FRA servers i added wouldn't have registered
16:08 < EastBite> but you've added them before right? :D
16:08 < EastBite> nvm
16:08 <@deen> no
16:08 <@deen> i had about 5 before, then added more and more
16:08 < EastBite> okay
16:10 <@deen> so it turns out we can't just shut GER down
16:10 <@deen> and have FRA instead
16:11 < EastBite> sure we can
16:11 < EastBite> but we might not need fra if ger runs fine with protection
16:11 <@deen> well, i did that
16:11 <@deen> and FRA had a lot fewer players than GER would have had
16:12 <@deen> and meanwhile ddmax had 60 players
16:13 < EastBite> many players didn't even know about FRA?
16:13 <@deen> exactly
16:13 < EastBite> and some had laggs ofcourse
16:13 <@deen> they just look in their favorites
16:13 <@deen> and they have GER and ddmax there, nothing else
16:13 < EastBite> that's why I want to add the ddnet browsere
16:13 <@deen> yeah
16:13 < EastBite> can I highlight it somehow? :D
16:13 <@deen> still lots of players without ddnet client
16:13 < laxa> !en-swe How are you
16:13 < EastBite> ye :/
16:13 < laxa> !en-sw How are you
16:13 < Nimda> Translation: Jinsi ni wewe
16:13 <@deen> EastBite: highlight?
16:14 < EastBite> green font in tab for example
16:14 <@deen> i don't think we should do that
16:15 < EastBite> your choice
16:16 <@deen> better add more awesome features, then people will use it automatically!
16:16 < EastBite> you always try to be the good one
16:16 < EastBite> hmm features
16:22 < EastBite> deen: is this okay? VERSIONSRV_GETSRVLIST[] = {255, 255, 255, 255, 's', 'r', 'v', 'l'};
16:24 <@deen> you don't want to call it east?
16:24 <@deen> and hm, srvlist is a bit strange, since it's only our servers
16:24 <@deen> i guess it's fine though
16:25 < EastBite> east is a fine option too
16:25 < EastBite> or _GETDDNETSERVERS
16:25 < EastBite> or _GETDDNETLIST
16:26 < EastBite> meh
16:26 < EastBite> we can still rename it later
16:42 < EastBite> deen: https://github.com/east/ddnet/commit/e73200815727e354b96d297001add1644ae79841
16:43 < EastBite> you should test the versionsrv stuff =)
16:44 <@deen> thanks, i will
16:44 < EastBite> I didn't change versionsrv.cpp
16:47 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/priv/ddnet-servers.txt
16:47 < EastBite> and the txt
16:54 <@deen> Hm
16:54 <@deen> So we would need to release a new client to add new servers
16:55 < EastBite> the list is requested on client start>
16:55 < EastBite> ?
16:55 <@deen> i mean a new countr
16:55 <@deen> y
16:55 < EastBite> yes, shouldn't be a problem
16:56 < EastBite> or we do it more dynamicaly
17:03 < EastBite> [83/83] [1] link DDNet-Server
17:03 < EastBite> bam: done (9:55)
17:03 < laxa> 9 minutes ?!
17:03 < EastBite> raspberry power!
17:05 < laxa> deen: you there ?
17:05 <@deen> ?
17:05 < laxa> someone posted a demo
17:05 < laxa> that is top1
17:05 < laxa> but they "cheated"
17:05 < EastBite> how?
17:05 < laxa> the guy finishing
17:05 < laxa> finishs alone
17:05 < laxa> on a 2 players map
17:05 < laxa> he is dragged through the whole map
17:05 <@deen> then they didn't get top1 in teamranks
17:05 <@deen> and it doesn't count
17:05 < laxa> yeah that's true :p
17:17 < EastBite> hm 5% cpu load on raspi with one player
17:28  * EastBite is afk for 2 hours
17:47 < laxa> deen: there ?
17:47 < laxa> I am experiencing a weird bug
17:47 < laxa> on test server, I wanna do tele 0 0 to go on a specific position of a map
17:47 < laxa> but when I press F2 to open RCON, my cursor move to another position of the map !
17:48 <@deen> weird no idea
17:48 < laxa> wanna try ? :)
17:50 <@deen> no
18:13 < EastBite> oh there is a tournament this sunday?!
18:13 <@deen> yes
18:13 < EastBite> where is tha map from?
18:13 <@deen> it's a secret!
18:13 < EastBite> D:
20:06 <@deen> So because Europe is split on 2 servers now, Chile is bigger than GER^^
20:14 < EastBite> hmm
20:26 < laxa> Nice, youtube is bugged
20:26 < laxa> every video of ddnet is blocked at 301 views :p
20:29 < EastBite> dats normal
20:29 < EastBite> it continues in some days
20:49 < Savander> laxa, its not bugged
20:50 < Savander> siad
20:50 < Savander> said: more than 300 views i guess
20:50 < EastBite> some kind of clickbot protection I don't understand :D

21:51 <@deen> or a few more
21:51 <@deen> hmm

21:51 < Savander> works wrong
21:51 < Savander> xD
21:52 < Savander> and it just close connection to some peoples.
21:52 <@deen> yeah, you could actually do that
21:52 <@deen> you know the ips of players in teeworlds
21:52 <@deen> you could fake packets from them all and ddos with them
21:52 <@deen> and then they all get banned by the ddos protection
21:52 <@deen> but i got no ddos protection message
21:53 <@deen> so it's not that
21:56 < EastBite> oh there is a notification?
