00:00 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: so the firewall was on? (enabled)
00:00 <+o_be_one> yes just seen its activated by default, its not like the network firewall
00:01 < WolfAlex> ....... the gamefirewall works well with teeworlds if protocol 'other' is selected
00:02 <+o_be_one> sure WolfAlex ?
00:02 < WolfAlex> yes i'm using it
00:03 < WolfAlex> with all of my teeworlds servers
00:03 <+o_be_one> good to know
01:53 <@deen> o_be_one: hm, i don'T like the firewall, it destroy my ssh sessions
01:53 <+o_be_one> there's no firewall actually
01:54 <@deen> sure there is
01:54 <@deen> all my traffic gets vacuumed up
01:54 <@deen> and there's firewall and tilera in traceroute
01:56 <+o_be_one> yes thats normal cause perma mitigation is active, so all traffic is checked by VAC. Without that, ddosing is really really easy.
01:57 <+o_be_one> but firewall is full open
01:57 <@deen> yeah, but the VAC always hates me^^
01:57 <@deen> had it disabled on harmony-hosting, otherwise it blocks everyone who pressed ctrl-f5 on ddnet.tw
01:57 <@deen> because of too many requests
02:48 <+o_be_one> what is ctrl F5 ?
03:07 <@deen> o_be_one: force reload all elements of page in browser
03:08 <+o_be_one> oh ok
03:08 <+o_be_one> i was thinking about the ddnet game, not the website ^^
03:09 <+o_be_one> ok finished my script to start stop status & co for the new tw structure
07:36 <+o_be_one> fifo file is really good thing !
07:37 <+o_be_one> servers are ready, next work will be website
11:51 < WolfAlex> deen: why is ddnet sending always 0 ammo? in high-ping situations 1 ammo would be nice for prediction
12:32 < EastByte> WolfAlex: any client out there using ammo count for *no ammo* prediction?
12:34 < WolfAlex> ... vanilla?
12:35 < WolfAlex> EastByte: 
12:36 < EastByte> afaik there is no predcition for that, the server just sends the click-noise
12:39 < EastByte> in the vanilla client the only access to m_AmmoCount is when it is being rendered
12:41 < WolfAlex> wtf
12:42 < WolfAlex> EastByte: i want the rocketjumps to be better predicted .... ammo count can be used for that, why is it not? ._.
12:44 < EastByte> vanilla doesn't do such prediction at all and ddnet antiping does that without caring about ammocount afaik
12:49 < EastByte> yep, looks like that
12:58 < WolfAlex> ddnet antiping sucks just because of the fact, that the playernames are rendered behind the game
13:01 < WolfAlex> its impossible to play without the playernames ._.
13:01 < EastByte> I know why this is happening, fixing that requires a lot of restructuring of the code
13:01 < EastByte> feel free to fix it and submit a pr
13:02 < EastByte> afk
13:28 < nuborn> WolfAlex: the ddnet client currently uses ammocount for prediction, except if the server is ddnet, ddrace or race (these gametypes don't announce ammocount afaik)
13:30 < EastByte> I'm not sure about that
13:31 < EastByte> also what do you mean by "announce ammocount" ? the AmmoCount is an attribute of character object and always transmitted
13:34 < nuborn> on race/ddrace servers the ammo indicator is always empty, but you can still fire weapons, so I thought it wasnt
13:35 < EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1477
13:35 < EastByte> okay here it is
13:35 < EastByte> checks for race and ammocount, no idea why I didn't find it while grepping
13:42 < nuborn> yes. there are maybe other mods that does this too (some zcatch servers if I rememeber correctly) but not sure if it possible to filter them
13:43 < nuborn> (that doesnt show ammo)
13:44 < EastByte> right, there is
18:42 <@deen> o_be_one: GER2 does not seem usable. it kills all kinds of connections, my ssh one and the serverstatus for http://ddnet.tw/status/ for example
19:03 <+o_be_one> ok deen let me try some other settings
19:04 <+o_be_one> and on monday i'll check of the router has no problem with ip mac adress, could be an issue with this too
19:10 <@deen> !ddnetstatus
19:11 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:11 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 522
19:11 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
19:20 <+o_be_one> deen, how long it takes for you to setup a new server ? You just log in, start some scripts or you log in, install mysql and all needed stuff, git all you rep and start manually scripts ?
19:21 <+o_be_one> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-setup
19:21 <+o_be_one> ok got it
19:22 <+o_be_one> interesting
19:23 <@deen> a script would be nice, but we have different environments everywhere
19:23 <@deen> and small changes on all servers
23:50 <+o_be_one> oh ok, ive made last year a script to deploy my servers basics (vim config & co)
23:50 <+o_be_one> and for TW ive made a script yesterday to sync all environments
23:51 <+o_be_one> no mater on spec, just need to be on an Debian or Ubuntu using Bash
23:58 <@deen> well, we have varying versions of debian, ubuntu and centos
23:59 <+o_be_one> oh, nobody ask you witch os you want before giving you a host ?
