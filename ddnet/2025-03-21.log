01:38 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i found whats wrong with tune in demos
01:38 < bridge> <kebscs> basically same thing as what my cleanup server tune pr did
01:38 < bridge> <kebscs> will cook up pr
01:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> is there a non hacky way of aligning a broadcast to a specific position?
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> lets just say...
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ>         str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "%s: %d\n%s: %d                                                                                                                                                                               ", GameServer()->Server()->ClientName(m_Player1ID), m_Score1, GameServer()->Server()->ClientName(m_Player2ID), m_Score2);
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt really what i want to do for score broadcasts.
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh it.. sanitized my dots out
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> lets just say...
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```cpp
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ>         str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "%s: %d\n%s: %d                                                                                                                                                                               ", GameServer()->Server()->ClientName(m_Player1ID), m_Score1, GameServer()->Server()->ClientName(m_Player2ID), m_Score2);
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
01:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt really what i want to do for score broadcasts.

01:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> this isnt really how i'd like to do this :kek:
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> clang-format is the decider
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> o i misread
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
01:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> im happy that clang-format doesnt touch my string in that case. :kek:
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> isnt broadcast just printing the message text on client side, nothing else?
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> if so cant rly format it from server
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> if thats what youre asking
01:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> not at all, its just that i need to spam dots to align them to the left that way
01:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> which is.. horrible
01:56 < furo> There is nothing built in. You could try to calculate the amount of dots needed, but it's kinda problematic as it's not a monospace font.
01:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> :/
01:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> spamming space is the way to go then, unlucky
02:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> Obviously it should be changed to render html on needed
02:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> being able to send formatted broadcasts serverside sounds both cool and horrible :kek:
02:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> obviously :troll:
02:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> i should PR that.. 
02:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
02:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> imagine someone being naughty on your server and you just make their entire screen black
02:39 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i check position of recording player in demo?
02:40 < bridge> <kebscs> e.g here it sends tuning of the current player to the demo <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/bd1a93b2c6989147ed07ada1a165fb4c3d0c1224/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L2062>
02:40 < bridge> <kebscs> so i want to add check `Client()->State() == IClient::STATE_DEMOPLAYBACK` but how do i get the position of the player in demo?
02:42 < bridge> <totar> each snapshot should have a local tee integer which will tell you who the "recording player" is
02:42 < bridge> <kebscs> m_Snap.m_LocalClientId
02:42 < bridge> <kebscs> m_Snap.m_LocalClientId?
02:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good
02:44 < bridge> <kebscs> and how do i properly get position with that?
02:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You also have m\_aClients in the snap that you can index
02:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They you can get the position from there but you can also get the predicted position if you need that instead
02:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe look at the players.cpp how it decides where to render tees
02:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There you can get the position from there but you can also get the predicted position if you need that instead
02:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you can get the position from there but you can also get the predicted position if you need that instead
02:48 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if im using wrong postion and it updates tune tick too late or what
02:48 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs of the prev predicted etc
02:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye classic issue
02:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I used to draw a square last time to make sure it properly aligns with my tee :D
02:53 < bridge> <kebscs> ill just test every combination of prev pos, prevprev pos, pred pos until it works 💀
03:02 < bridge> <totar> if you're in a demo there is no pred pos
03:02 < bridge> <totar> prediction doesn't happen during demos
03:06 < bridge> <kebscs> well idk, ill just skip that
03:06 < bridge> <kebscs> seems to work without it
03:13 < bridge> <totar> you should use the render position that gets interpolated between snapshots
03:13 < bridge> <totar> you can see it in players.cpp
03:29 < bridge> <kebscs> Ty, will check tmr
04:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> looked into this again and found this thingyyy... https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/16137
05:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> using the findcurl provided by cmake is good tho, where they first did a find_package(curl QUIET NO_MODULE) before using pkg_check_modules
05:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> i don't know if we should change ours to that
07:39 < bridge> <teero777> hello all

08:22 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> What's the `const void *pId` in `CListboxItem DoNextItem()`? Should I just give it a int value that differs from other items?
09:46 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place I think this is actually neat :owo:

09:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh this is actually cool as hell
09:50 < bridge> <Assa> also my fps went up, because the doors don't need to render a different sprite every tick <.< because rendering a normal quad is so much cheaper
09:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> tbh id make the boxes just a tad bit smaller
09:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> but other than that i actually kinda like this
09:52 < bridge> <Assa> @hectavoxel like this? I think you are right, this is even better

09:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yes, perfect!
09:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How cooked is this engine
09:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> is say about meduim rare
09:53 < bridge> <teero777> beautiful. As long as you don't change any physics
09:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> *i'd
09:53 < bridge> <Assa> game is 15 years old, it was very well done for it's time
09:53 < bridge> <Assa> no ^.^ just optics
09:54 < bridge> <teero777> Since when are we doing optics in ddnet?? xdd
09:54 < bridge> <teero777> you mean visuals?
09:54 < bridge> <Assa> lasers refract, reflect, absorb, so this is optics :justatest:
09:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the tee is slightly wider than it is tall. this is for optical adjustment
09:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't think lasers absorb...
09:55 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it absorms impact
09:55 < bridge> <Assa> semantics, lasers get absorbed
09:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> speaking of impact, guys hop on brick impact
09:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh wait you don't know what that is ; - ;
09:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh wait you don't know what that is sorry
09:58 < bridge> <oxyzo.> hop on genshin impact
10:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 4 years in and I'm almost caught up! I've almost won the game!
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> The laser rendered in the settings i not a door ...
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> why
10:19 < bridge> <Assa> because the settings reimplemented laser rendering 🙂 beatiful, good that I refactored exactly this
10:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> only 120K more to go!

10:52 < bridge> <Assa> "refactor" `+35 −67` ...
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> only 99 PRs to go 🥳
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs I have a question regarding #9057, did you forget to add the lasers doors & stuff or is this open PR yourself thing?
12:40 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9057
13:04 < bridge> <kebscs> If you know how to render them you can do it
13:05 < bridge> <kebscs> But it's probably gonna not be that great with lasers bcs they can spin etc
13:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Unless can code it as well without problems
13:05 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know about spinning lasers, but doors should be easy
13:07 < bridge> <kebscs> You could add them i guess
13:14 < bridge> <bobux1234888> .
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> ive checked these and not working:
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> 
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> ```mix(vec2(m_Snap.m_pLocalPrevCharacter->m_X, m_Snap.m_pLocalPrevCharacter->m_Y), vec2(m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_X, m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_Y), Client()->IntraGameTick(Conn)); // 3 ticks behind
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> //m_aClients[m_Snap.m_LocalClientId].m_RenderPos; // 3 ticks behind
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> //vec2(m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_X, m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_Y); // 2 ticks behind```
15:04 < bridge> <teero777> yo, any idea where tune zones/server commands are loaded from the mapfile?
15:05 < bridge> <teero777> yo, any idea where server commands are loaded from the mapfile?

15:27 < bridge> <kebscs> ive checked these and not working:, but doesnt matter i guess, in demos it shouldnt rely on local player being present
15:27 < bridge> <kebscs> 
15:27 < bridge> <kebscs> ```mix(vec2(m_Snap.m_pLocalPrevCharacter->m_X, m_Snap.m_pLocalPrevCharacter->m_Y), vec2(m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_X, m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_Y), Client()->IntraGameTick(Conn)); // 3 ticks behind

15:34 < bridge> <teero777> i could combine any command with a semicolon right?
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352651466350923776/image.png?ex=67deca58&is=67dd78d8&hm=3ad8b4bfc7cf8fcea07837f7d900999be982dc93eb2b56036b7a528064a387df&
15:38 < bridge> <kebscs> probably not here, not sure
15:38 < bridge> <kebscs> i think these arent parsed but sent as whole command, so semicolon wont work here
15:46 < bridge> <danya06709> I had a ban for 1 hour, it passed but it still pops up that I am banned if someone knows how to solve the problem please help
15:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> will this change physics
15:49 < bridge> <danya06709> what?
15:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this is the developers channel
15:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if you're asking for a ban appeal go to #✉-create-a-ticket 
15:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if not then just go to #general
15:50 < bridge> <danya06709> oh, thanks
15:55 < bridge> <Assa> are physics constant in the first place? 🤔
15:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> idk but i wonder if anything will happen if we make them const
16:04 < bridge> <teero777> what?
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> stop talking about changing physics every day 😭
16:05 < bridge> <louis> send controllable jump height plz
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> what
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> `ground_jump_impulse 13.2`
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> `air_jump_impulse 12.0`
16:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> he means like, the longer you hold space bar the higher you go
16:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think
16:09 < bridge> <teero777> oh
16:09 < bridge> <teero777> that breaks like 50 maps xd
16:10 < bridge> <teero777> i don't like that feature xd
16:10 < bridge> <teero777> also in other games
16:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> To me it's a basic feature that should be in basically all platformers and it's weird if it's not there
16:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DDRace gets a pass because it's not originally a serious platformer
16:12 < bridge> <teero777> i really dislike it
16:12 < bridge> <Assa> I was talking about the physics of the universe, ofc I will change them!
16:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because it doesn't make physical sense?
16:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> feels weird?
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> okay thats fine idc if you change those
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> yes
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> i would need to press even more
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> and i dont like that
16:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> can you make e = mc³ to see what happens
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> No, this would cause immediate death to the universe
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> No, this would cause immediate death to the universe (as we know it)
16:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> lol I hold jump down for a while even in games where it does nothing
16:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because it's basic instinct for me
16:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> more like you can finally low hop
16:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> to me wasting jump height is uncomfortable, it feels bad falling down a long distance and having to wait to land
16:35 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> How does the ScrollRegions work? Will the .Begin() edit it so that can infinitely HSplit that and the scrollregion will calculate automatically?
16:35 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352666921689944206/Screenshot_2025-03-21-23-32-28-751_com.android.chrome.jpg?ex=67ded8bd&is=67dd873d&hm=11f39eff306858c78f5e642375f06a9acf073ee886c494a1fa5219b1f7b294a7&
16:42 < bridge> <learath2> It's quite simple actually, you keep hsplitting and the elements really truly do get out of the screen. The trick is that `Begin` enables graphics clipping, which means things outside the clipping rectangle don't get rendered
16:44 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Ok, thanks❤️
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> I'd think it's not called `hsplit` though, there is probably a function on cscrollregion that adds a new rect below
16:49 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Yeah it should be .AddRect
16:49 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Hsplit for cutting the CUIRect
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> You can comment out the clip enable and clip disable, if you want to see what it actually looks like

17:26 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs The missing outline issue ist not caused by my code, even in the screenshots from you you see the freeze door outline beeing broken, I didn't touch this
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> missing outlines?
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> It's just not so noticable due to the constant flickering
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> yes lasers sometimes miss outlines when zoomed out enough, because the outline is < 1 pixel
17:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats no too bad
17:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe set a limit above which it goes to 0 to avoid flickering, or always goto 1 pixel * zoom amount
17:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe set a limit above which it goes [to 0 to avoid flickering, or always goto 1 pixel * zoom amount]
17:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe set a limit above which it goes [to 0 to avoid flickering, or 1 pixel * zoom amount]

17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea ik
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> But its not noticeable when its not static
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> So maybe can find a fix if possible
17:35 < bridge> <Assa> do you know how to get the zoom scale in a Client component? 🤔
17:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> camera is in gameclient, client cant and shouldnt access gameclient
17:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Client _component_ is fine, that already happens for various things
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> But engine client shouldn't know about game stuff generally
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> in the end I could also access the config value
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> but might be unreliable
17:52 < bridge> <robyt3> `GameClient()->m_Camera.m_Zoom`?
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> thx :owo: might make a followup fix
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html

18:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thank you
18:26 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats souly

18:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is to say, it doesnt when there is
18:27 < bridge> <oxyzo.> very good!!!
18:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no muy mal
18:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
18:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(!IsScoreBoardOpen && !g_Config.m_ClChatOld)

18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres this weird thing which makes text align to the left with scoreboard open
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which means i guess you can see more chat when its open isntead of it being put onto 50 lines
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but that screws with translation aswell
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think it also beforehand renders the text to nowhere to get the size to do layout
18:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hell yeah
18:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1352696217775247422/image.png?ex=67def406&is=67dda286&hm=42da36571b9e914dc336ccf248c93673c4262c5d7ce8f0990b6c81f06a756f93&
18:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that looks so clean
18:33 < bridge> <oxyzo.> are we getting a translator in ddnet
18:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this only currently supports 1 job at a time, so autotranslate isnt a thing
18:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so without that or a way to like right click messages, this will only be tater
18:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so without that or a way to like right click messages, this will only be in tater
18:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im using some random endpoint i found but that will probably 403 too many requests
18:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if everyone starts using it
18:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we could pool together a billion servers to do the requests so it doesnt, (the "server" which is just a ptyhon module, is very cheap to run)
18:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> with autotranslate
18:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im using some random endpoint i found but that will probably 403 too many requests (to google, its a google wrapper)
18:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ i englished so hard there
18:38 < bridge> <oxyzo.> awesome:deen_star:
18:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i need a translator from my spaghetti code brain to passable parsable english
19:25 < ChillerDragon> solly
19:25 < ChillerDragon> i need translator my russian is so bad
19:25 < ChillerDragon> i use deepl all day on fng xd
19:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmm
19:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> use tclient B)
19:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or like cherry pick the commit
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> taters probably waiting for good next ddnet release
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to do anythign with tclient so even if i get translation to a good state
19:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if itll get merged
19:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> tclient has a translator??
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> will do in the near future hopefully
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im trying to fix a single bug, then its usable..
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it keeps translating the newest message no matter how hard i try
19:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh i didnt see this part
19:33 < bridge> <louis> cool, what are u using to translate it?
19:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> mb
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://ftapi.pythonanywhere.com/
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or libretranslate
19:41 < bridge> <vappy19> wow
19:41 < bridge> <vappy19> its not perfect but understandable :D
19:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmm what could be better
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> well if you don't play you won't be a very useful mod 😄
19:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Solly (bun bun) get it into ddnet!
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how it would work in ddnet
19:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how does it work in tclient
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it accepts a optional name
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to filter by
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz chats get spammy
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tclient has bindchat
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `bindchat !translate translate`
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !translate bun bun
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> translates the last msg by bun bun
19:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can apply for admin, they don't have to play ddnet
19:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think for admins and mods they have to play when they are accepted, but at that point
19:51 < bridge> <hectavoxel> so its not realtime?
19:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that would probably 403 too many requests
19:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/pull/36
19:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> mm. ill just stick to vanilla client and not mind chat
19:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet isnt vanilla [cat_troll](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1240405378601189496.webp?size=48&name=cat_troll)

20:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it sucks a lot but works a lot @louis xd
20:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah but its worse, harder to setup and slower than google translate
20:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fokko used it server side on block for a while
20:47 < bridge> <learath2> I think it was pretty much unanimous that we don't want this feature
20:48 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps a completely offline implementation of this has a chance of being merged
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> Otherwise we think this feature belongs in a custom client
20:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its extremley useful
20:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why are there so many admin mails
20:55 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it is, but super hard to impliment with our budget and goals of the game
20:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have it implemented for free :)
20:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mean yea but it isnt live translates and you need to input a stupid command to what i assume translate a portion of the chat
20:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> given that youre pirating google
20:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im not very comfortable with spamming a free api with russian slurs
20:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yeah fair enough
21:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you host your own google pirate server, then spam it all you want
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t think I was actually considering applying but that’s a fun result
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> admin tho… where do i sign :kek:

21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> so fucking true
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> that is my life motto
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> ditch the pills
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> I disagreed with the speed limit and now I need to bend over for Uncle Sam
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> my fault anyway
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> the lanes were wide tho…
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> they clocked me at 65 in a 40, i don’t pay attention to the speed limit there because it’s directly attached to a highway that I’ve driven on >2 times a week as long as i’ve been driving
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> where the speed limit is 65
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s completely my fault because i know the rules of the road & am bound to them as someone with a driver’s license. i just am particularly used to this road & the cop can’t know that or take me at my word for it
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it is what it is

21:35 < bridge> <learath2> A lot of replaybotters begging for amnesty
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but they got caught, and are not really anonymous asking for amnesty
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> We don't want anything to do with pirating google or hosting an translation ai model
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fair enuf
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> Well how else would they appeal their ban? Can't be anonymous
21:37 < bridge> <.c.f.m.> for me its because all my servers are on discord
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean normally like governmental bodies say we will give people who have commited x amnesty if they pay a small fine and promise to never ever wever do it again because we dont have the resources to catch you ourselves
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or like the christian booth things
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk what amnesty actually means
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, well that's not really the definition of amnesty. But it is indeed used in that context a lot
21:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it just means being pardoned or forgiven
21:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to be technical enough to replaybot then not being able to evade (not that they should) or just play on other servers (i thought bans were only per server, its been a while since ive been banned i dont remember), and then also ask to be forgiven for something which is very very wrong and you have to go out of your way to do
21:40 < bridge> <canarda_04> @soulyvevo idk where to type this but I've seen people type about skins here so
21:40 < bridge> <canarda_04> can you upload this as a new version please
