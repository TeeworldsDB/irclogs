05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf whos oblique
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol does everyone play 0.7 like that :kek:
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yup
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Drocsi D.> cripple client 0.7
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol how did that feet thing even happen?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I will try it
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yo the server i was on just crashed on a successful map vote
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (GER)
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> a few mins ago the entire GER seems to have crashed
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > yo the server i was on just crashed on a successful map vote
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe didnt crash, tho i and everyone else lost connection
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga my fault, now fixed
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i believe while the new skin system was introduced
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> feets are also tigther in their image space
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/711932331501289472/unknown.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> eyes are repositioned and bit bigger to, some eyes aren't fixable rn
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> fuck that skin
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah its a bad skin
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but shows the problem well ðŸ˜„
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> dont play 07
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ðŸ–¤SmetanolubðŸ’Ž> 06 better
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also worth mentioning is that the feet outline isnt colored anymore
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/711933716209074186/unknown.png
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the body skin this was fixable by using the body and marking seperately
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is there any chance DDNet might servers need "hot" reload (server restart with keeping its state like character position, teams, switches) ?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I just miss such feature while mapping
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is there any chance DDNet servers might  need "hot" reload (server restart with keeping its state like character position, teams, switches) ?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I just miss such feature while mapping
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is an issue for it, I started working on it then I dropped it because it's pretty ugly
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have the business opportunity of a lifetime for any interested developer
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently I broke something a couple months back. Normally I'd fix it myself but seeing such a stupid mistake put me in a mood, so bug bounty
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can make 10 entire â‚¬, which is about my entire wealth for the next few weeks
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, I knew that wasnt enough to buy anyones time :(
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what is it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forgot to consider the tokens size while caching serverinfo responses
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So when you add the token it can end up larger then the max size if there are a lot of players and the players names line up just right
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this ddnet? tw?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> masterserver?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you can tell me whether CVariableInt's packing size grows as the number grows
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's ddnet
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it grows
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pff, don't bother I'll just reserve like 10 bytes at the beginning
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then I'll just go cry myself to sleep
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AHA @heinrich5991 didn't use variable int packing for the extended serverinfo messages
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I just need log10 token max bytes
