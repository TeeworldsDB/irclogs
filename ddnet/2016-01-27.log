16:07 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: pong
16:10 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: could we get startssl for ddnet.tw to support xp users?
16:13 <@EastByte> hm, I would rather remove ssl for xp users (in case google will remove the https link at all)
16:13 <@EastByte> I don't want to deal with startssl anymore
16:23 <+o_be_one> +1
16:23 <+o_be_one> i dont like startssl :(

17:11 <@deen> http://www.zlib.net/
17:11 <@deen> not sure if they care
17:11 < Hamid_Jigool> ommm thanks
17:11 <@deen> maybe it's fixed already, you could try new zlib version

17:38 <@EastByte> just ignore you warnings, you don't need to care about them
17:38 <@EastByte> the warnings*
17:44 < Hamid_Jigool> EastByte: for this warning server cannot connect to database [SQL]
17:44 <@EastByte> zlib is not connected to mysql in any way
17:45 <@EastByte> the warning just appears because of compiler updated
17:45 <@EastByte> updates*
17:45 < Hamid_Jigool> EastByte: my friend... can you compile for me some edited DDnet?
17:46 < Hamid_Jigool> EastByte: can i give you user and pass of my server?

17:51 < Hamid_Jigool> so my server can not compile good.. maybee for bad compiler
