02:15 <+bridge> <gumbatw> when will the database problem of the discord bot be fixed üò¶
02:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> never ,,,
02:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hi
04:31 <+bridge> <louis> https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend
04:31 <+bridge> <louis> anyone see this?
04:31 <+bridge> <louis> has anyone seen this?
04:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> yes
04:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> although a language with for loop is a bit wild for me
04:39 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> although a language without for loop is a bit wild for me
05:04 <+bridge> <totar> I think high level gpu programming generally doesn't work
05:04 <+bridge> <totar> the GPU does not like to do complex things, it wants to be a SIMD machine
05:15 <+bridge> <totar> also using a 4090 to benchmark against is a little unfair, it's so overpowered, it should be able to get more OPS than a 32 thread cpu at like 10% utilization
05:15 <+bridge> <totar> most people do not have 15% of a 4090 in their pc xd

07:14 <+bridge> <melo∆û> Murpi said he is rewriting the entire bot right now, no ETA yet iirc tho
07:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> never...
08:34 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Do you save ur ssh keys somewhere or you create new when you change os?
08:50 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i always create new, its not like someone should swap os 2 times a day :D

10:04 <+bridge> <melo∆û> Morning i3wm enjoyers and others
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hope u enjoy ur bugs üò¨
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> prolly bcs it looks like pyson
10:55 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Morning nvim gangs
10:56 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Morning nvim gangs and others
11:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stream or did not happen
11:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nvim 0.10 pog
11:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stream or did not happen
11:11 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I can when i install debian üòè
11:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also stream on gentoo
11:11 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Nono
11:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> show me some epyc commands
11:11 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I plan on installing it today
11:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are you tired of self compiling or why
11:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or are u just in a try out phase
11:12 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> It's too complicated for my reptile brain
11:12 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> And i dont have hundreds of cores to compile all that shit
11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the problem is, you don't have to understand everything to do whatever you do.
11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Learning gentoo might give you some skills, but maybe u dont even want these skills
11:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i personally mostly dislike compiling so much. else i'd probably also use arch or smth
11:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it feels like 70% of all good packets are required to be compiled xd
11:13 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Do you also have to compile stuff  on arch?
11:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well lot of packets are only in the AUR
11:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there a binary version for this?
11:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it always compiled stuff
11:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rocm took like 1h to compile or smth xd
11:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was horrible
11:27 <+bridge> <learath2> It's very rare but I will sometimes use a flatpak
11:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> flatpak :(
11:28 <+bridge> <learath2> Especially for packages that use qt webview
11:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> are u on the gentoo
11:28 <+bridge> <learath2> Yep
11:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> that would explain
11:28 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh btw that is if there is no official binpkg for it
11:29 <+bridge> <learath2> If there is an official binpkg, I'll use that one
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 when do you stream
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :brownbear:
11:37 <+bridge> <learath2> What would you like me to stream?
11:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> coding smth in ur preferred language and setup
11:38 <+bridge> <learath2> It wouldn't be very exciting. I write code in bursts. Lots of idle time while I plan things out in my head
11:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can take an easy project. i think it's funny to see how other ppl solve problems
11:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i compile qt web and gtk web like a chad
11:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gtk web literally is more bloat than firefox
11:43 <+bridge> <learath2> You use a 64 core beast though üòÑ
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> webkit-gtk
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> is this true
11:44 <+bridge> <learath2> My processor is from 2013, it has 4 cores 8 threads üòÑ
11:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> haswell?
11:44 <+bridge> <learath2> No, it's 16c ai think
11:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 24 core*
11:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> at 5.5ghz iirc
11:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 64gb ram
11:44 <+bridge> <learath2> Yep
11:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> 24 core or 24 thread
11:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thread
11:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> good
11:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> same
11:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mimimi
11:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> similar config
11:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gotta say 16 cores are really cheap nowadays
11:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think u have my processor on steroids
11:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/AMD-Ryzen-9-5950X-16x-3-40GHz-So-AM4-WOF_1380729.html
11:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 318‚Ç¨
11:45 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm getting a new laptop soon(tm)
11:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u travel so much that u can only use laptop
11:45 <+bridge> <learath2> Need to pick a distro for it
11:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> i can't do serious work on laptops xd
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> arch linux.
11:46 <+bridge> <learath2> I'd like to work outside a bit
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> i see
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> distcc on ur home network
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo
11:46 <+bridge> <learath2> I also do travel quite a lot
11:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also cant do that, but i think it's mostly about how you sit and if u use laptop keyboard etc. üòÑ
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i cant use other distroa
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its unholy
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> not interested in draining half of my battery to install one package
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 repend for not using gentoo
11:46 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm gentoo with distcc would be a nice idea actually
11:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> repent*
11:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Though the cpu of my desktop is probably weaker than whatever laptop I get üòÑ
11:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> i tried it and see like no benefit over arch other than to just flex on the peons lol
11:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have a bare metal wiyh a ryzen 3600
11:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> it takes a million yrs to do anything
11:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and 128gb ram
11:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241326288690614323/image.png?ex=6649cab1&is=66487931&hm=2f7b5c31f448af202a5fd694d4dca9af2200bdec425db478d9daa8bedb11747f&
11:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or 64 i forgor
11:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Hard disagree. USE flags and not having to use systemd is easily enough of a difference
11:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> you can use other init systems on other distros
11:48 <+bridge> <learath2> I would never use arch btw. When I need an archlike I use artix
11:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like openrc
11:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> i like systemd because it makes sense
11:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> and it's what ppl are using
11:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sadly i think i use systemd udev or smth
11:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
11:49 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm an eudev user
11:50 <+bridge> <learath2> There are many sane init systems, all of them except systemd come to mind
11:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think systemd does service dependencies better than other init systems
11:53 <+bridge> <learath2> We need a poetteringlike marketing campaign for openrc. Maybe pay off redhat or fedora to use it
11:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe
11:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think for a laptop (if you use them like i do) gentoo is too much hassle
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just use mine when i leave the house
11:55 <+bridge> <learath2> I usually have artix on my laptops
11:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Or way back in the day I used to have devuan on them
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> biggest systemd hater
11:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Gentoo is fot elite power users
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> keep telling urself that
11:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
11:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> while u wait half an hour for firefox to compile
11:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like to tease you
11:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> i dont like being teased
11:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> actually just 10 monst
11:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mins
12:00 <+bridge> <learath2> My upstairs neighbour had the 90 version of that for a very long time
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> also recently acquired a third gen i5. yet to do anything with that computer
12:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> at the new apartment we have to pay our own power bill so i can't homelab like i used to
12:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:01 <+bridge> <learath2> Sell it off
12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'd get nothing for it tbh
12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> to most ppl these computers are e-waste
12:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> to me they are helpful for just being a computer that can be on without major power succ
12:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> to me they are helpful for just being a computer that can be on all the time without major power succ
12:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think if i move again the only one i'd keep is my 9th gen i5 system
12:02 <+bridge> <learath2> As soon as I figure out where I'll live, I'll get an upgrade on my desktop
12:03 <+bridge> <learath2> I desperately need a gpu upgrade too
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> what are u on
12:03 <+bridge> <learath2> 1080
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> ah
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just upgraded from 1070 TI
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> to 3060
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> same perf lol
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> but 4GB more vram + more efficient
12:03 <+bridge> <learath2> It is pretty strong. But it doesn't have any rt cores, it has little vram
12:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> how much is little these days?
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk what 1080 came with
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> less than 8?
12:04 <+bridge> <learath2> It's 8, it's not little for gaming
12:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> buy its not gddr6
12:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but
12:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have 3080
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> WHEN ZEN 5
12:05 <+bridge> <learath2> True, and AI stuff guzzles vram like it's nothing
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ah
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> i never do AI stuff
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> not rly that interesting to me
12:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> at least not in this medium
12:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in my personal, expert AI, opinion, VRAM is still very very far from what we'd need for proper AIs
12:06 <+bridge> <learath2> I will probably bump all the way up to a 4080 when I move
12:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1TByte VRAM is minimum
12:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk if current GPUs are even the best for AI applications
12:06 <+bridge> <learath2> LOL. Do you mean AGI by proper AI?
12:07 <+bridge> <learath2> In that case I do kinda agree yeah
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not even, but i always see these "ai learns to ..." videos
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and they simply are too stupid out of box
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they need some kind of understanding of the world.. basically a gpt-4
12:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that can explain wtf going on
12:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then based on that i needs to build its expertise
12:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and gpt-4 is still too bad actually
12:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Have you seen 4o? That looks interesting. I like multimodal stuff
12:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah looks interesting indeed, heinrich shared it here
12:09 <+bridge> <learath2> But yeah, there is imo a limit to what this sort of ai can achieve and there are papers slowly coming out suggesting I'm not wrong on that
12:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
12:10 <+bridge> <learath2> These don't actually "understand" anything per se. They are just very very good auto completers. Their "knowledge" doesn't quite match our understanding of knowledge
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> exactly
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> they can see the bigger picture but they can't put together proper code snippets
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz it's all just copy paste shit from elsewhere
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> inconsistent api or whatever
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> and it can't understand that that's bad lol
12:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> also can't learn on the fly even when told something directly which is huge imo
12:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> you can give it some conditions but if it doesn't already grasp the fundamentals of ur idea then good luck
12:11 <+bridge> <learath2> I'd never really seen copilot in action until I started working. And it produces some stellarly stupid snippets sometimes
12:12 <+bridge> <learath2> The demos are always like "isPrime" or "AStar", ofc it does these things good, just look how many people have implemented it in stackoverflow
12:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah lol
12:18 <+bridge> <learath2> I saw an interesting ai that had say like 8 models and a router model that coordinated the 8 other models. The aim was to have "expert" models and a "manager" model. It didn't happen but it was a curious experiment
12:19 <+bridge> <learath2> The AI ended up with expert models but the experts were not specialized at all. They were experts at things the authors couldn't even put into words very well. Like an expert at token placement in a programs first 40 lines
12:19 <+bridge> <smudgethecatte> 1080 isn't bad at all ngl it's on par with 3060
12:20 <+bridge> <smudgethecatte> 980 and 1080 is the best 2 gpus nvidia has ever released to the market ngl
12:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rtx 4090 is the best
12:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with a huge huge margin
12:20 <+bridge> <learath2> This entire computer is starting to show it's age and I'm having trouble even pinpointing where it's falling short now. It seems the games are just not well optimized for this architecture anymore
12:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also 3060 is probably much more efficient
12:21 <+bridge> <smudgethecatte> yeah undoubtedly but despite 1080's age it's still holding up like a chad to this day
12:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's good enough for 1080p gaming i guess
12:21 <+bridge> <smudgethecatte> probably DX12 because 1080 wasn't really made for DX12 titles
12:22 <+bridge> <learath2> The fact that I'm on a 1440p monitor isn't helping either
12:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet is also a vulkan title
12:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
12:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u ask me most low level GPUs are failures, simply bcs they do exactly what GPU should not do:
12:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> low core(shader core) count, clocked high
12:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a 4090 that isnt at like 80% is super efficient
12:24 <+bridge> <learath2> Like elden ring ran fine-ish. But I could only ever get consistent 50fps. That's not great

19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say libcrypto.so
19:08 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> what package then? :thonk:
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> openssh probably
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (at least openssh)
19:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i beat many packages depend on it idirectly

19:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the real openssl is used by many more
19:14 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ooohh...
19:14 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> lets see :justatest:
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbh
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "No rule to make target"
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this sounds like it wants to compile it
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not depend on it xd
19:17 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it compiler :kek:
19:17 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it compiled :kek:
19:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚≠ê
19:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üåü
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok.. we need better star emojis
19:18 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> time for nvidia drivers
19:18 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ah shit here we go again
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only reason i still buy amd GPUs over nvidia
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
19:30 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> welp, gg i guess
19:30 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ```Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

19:38 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it's installing üòé
19:38 <+bridge> <teero777> Just make your code more efficient:lol:
19:38 <+bridge> <teero777> Just make your code more efficient :lol:
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, when do we get AI driven optimizations. rekognize patterns and optimize them with known optimizations
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 100% faster software would ofc be cool too üòÑ
20:02 <+bridge> <teero777> that would be so cool
20:02 <+bridge> <teero777> you would literally help the whole world by making that xd
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problems of the future need more ram
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lot more ram
20:12 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> just download more ram
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for that we need faster internet, and for faster internet we need more ram
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> every 4 years the ram doubles
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> jupstar's law
20:16 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont have screen tearing, pog
20:19 <+bridge> <teero777> lmao i just trained my brain i don't even see it anymore xd
20:19 <+bridge> <teero777> and i'll do it again if it means i don't get input delay
20:19 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> before i had huge ahh line in the middle of my screen
20:19 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> now i dont see it
20:20 <+bridge> <teero777> if you don't have a >60hz monitor response time kills me
20:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> screen tearing is just like ram
20:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need more hertz
20:20 <+bridge> <teero777> xd
20:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 480hz and u probably cant see tearing anymore
20:20 <+bridge> <teero777> i need more ram for algo :(
20:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how much u have
20:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when zen 5 finally drops in 20 years i want at least 64
20:21 <+bridge> <teero777> only 16 + 4swap
20:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wrip
20:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
20:23 <+bridge> <teero777> hate this
20:24 <+bridge> <teero777> it doesn't on debug
20:24 <+bridge> <teero777> it crashes on release
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> get rich
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> turn on sanitizers
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is it out of ram xd
20:24 <+bridge> <teero777> no xdd
20:25 <+bridge> <teero777> how do i turn off timeouts....
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚ùì
20:25 <+bridge> <teero777> ddnet server timeout
20:25 <+bridge> <zhn> debugging server while playing the game :justatest:
20:26 <+bridge> <teero777> xddd
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> look into the ddnet commands overview
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is one that u can simply set to 400 or smth
20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u have 400 minutes
21:17 <+bridge> <melo∆û> whatever this is i like it

21:17 <+bridge> <melo∆û> also @teini94 why did you open 3 issues, just put everything in one :justatest:
22:24 <+bridge> <patiga> @RUSt-devs `twsnap` is now on crates.io üöÄ 
22:24 <+bridge> <patiga> crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/twsnap
22:24 <+bridge> <patiga> repo: https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twsnap
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> 
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> Its a collaboration between @zwelf2 and me, to have interoperability between his physics and my renderer :)
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> The main thing is the `Snap` (snapshot) struct, which is heavily typed and focused on usability. It is compatible with the ddnet snapshot and it also already includes a (ddnet) demo reader and writer.
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> Compatibility with ddnet snapshot is possible thanks to @heinrich5991's libtw2, which is now also available on crates.io!
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> `twsnap` is ofc still unstable, and it is still missing net messages
22:25 <+bridge> <patiga> docs: https://docs.rs/twsnap/0.1.0/twsnap/struct.Snap.html
22:26 <+bridge> <iwa> why rus ping?
22:26 <+bridge> <patiga> discord weirdness
22:26 <+bridge> <patiga> `@rust-devs`
22:28 <+bridge> <iwa> huh
22:28 <+bridge> <iwa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241487558370918450/image.png?ex=664a60e3&is=66490f63&hm=08a6b3e2649c0d9b9933a461d697c6ad8a0e224e9d1c78993c8793780eb88fa4&
22:28 <+bridge> <iwa> there is no rust-devs role
22:28 <+bridge> <patiga> it was a made-up ping ^^
22:29 <+bridge> <patiga> though imo it would be nice to have
22:29 <+bridge> <iwa> kk
22:33 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> i feel like commands that are straight up disabled shouldnt be shown in /cmdlist
22:33 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1241488823846965270/image.png?ex=664a6211&is=66491091&hm=82414e93c480fdbf7485a24fb35d50b1c3b0db431d07b5e439aa2ff4a3917085&
