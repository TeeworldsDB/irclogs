01:32 <+bridge_> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> That is good news. So what is the plan? Connect it directly to main database and spin up normal servers with all maps?
01:33 <+bridge_> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> oh and btw bors timed out :/ on #10
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can we? ^
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon we dont have Random map in ddnet7 yet
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon assuming the physics is fine, I guess connecting it to the official db makes sense
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> physics are fine
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen will it he traceable which version the ranks came from in case something went wrong?
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we should add a field
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> with a version number
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i guess some kind of short int would work?
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> probably with 6 as the default version
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or it saves the ddnet version
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i thought a string might take too much space
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but as long as it's an int ok
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm arenâ€™t ddnet versions ints
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> CLIENT_VERSIONNR is a string
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> int
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> rest is string
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon are you working on the version or should I?
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I guess the field will be required in race, teamrace, save tables
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and you also have to prevent loading from 0.7 when saved from 0.6 and vice versa
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (at least for now)
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please dont let 0.7 ranks into the db
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you really dont want to bother, atleast mark them somrhow so they are easy to delete when something goes wrong
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> If we don't add them to DB then the server is useless
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and yes, we'd definitely mark them
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pretty untested stuff, so yeah let's tread with caution
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon.* nice, mysql connection seems to work fine
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen Oh i thought you do the version thing I guess you have more knowledge about ddnet versions and what you want in the database. I just recommend going with ddnet versions if we already use a database field letâ€™s put as much information in there as possible.
15:42 <@deen> ok
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Nice to hear that the connection works ðŸ™‚
15:42 <@deen> then we still need the reset file support
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If itâ€™s 0.6 or 0.7 it can also be a bool
15:43 <@deen> yeah, probably
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Idk if there are Bools in MySQL
15:44 <@deen> yes, there are
15:44 <@deen> same as a tinyint(1)
16:17 <@deen> anyone know how the serverbrowse_info packets look in 0.7? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/issues/14
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord really needs seen command
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Given @HMH seems to have vanished again, I guess someone else will have to do the sql rewrite ðŸ˜›
16:40 <@deen> other than the issues I just opened on ddnet7 it looks good
16:40 <@deen> we're missing quite a few other options, but maybe let's only readd them once we need them again
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, i have just added the ones that were really required
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Marius is running a few ddnet7 servers for a while now and multimap has tons of players i think so far the basic ddrace features are stable
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am also running a server with ddnet7 but modified even more
