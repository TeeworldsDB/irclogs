00:08 < bridge> <deen> @Robyt3 You're missing the action in #general btw 😄
01:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: search for SIGPIPE in ddnet code to find out how to fix it
01:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> meanwhile chiller missing out on the fun :/
01:44 < bridge> <kio> How can I see the coords of a block ?
01:44 < bridge> <kio> In a map
07:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oof still no general bridge. What happend there? Any volunteer happy to sum up the action for me?
07:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea you mean catching sigpipe? I really should have that code but I’ll verify later since you made me think it got lost in a merge
07:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
07:37 < bridge> <Headshot> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295908390956433410/1077450412715671632/matricks_being_run_over_by_a_train.mp4
07:39 < bridge> <Headshot> matricks returned out of nowhere basically
07:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But did he have something to say?
08:36 < bridge> <Zwelf> chillerdragon: i'll try to export the chat and look into bridging general and others channels again, but don't have time for the latter today. You might already be able to @ him if you have a questions to him. teetow is also here.
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1676965748.png
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> amazing you famous now @Ryozuki o.O
08:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u missed the action
08:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its all because i called him fake cuz he randomly appeared
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> i figured
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> yo ryo i think you fake too!
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea @heinrich5991 as i thought i got the sigpipe thingy thats the one you meant right? https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/cd8991efa291dd8e74354ce3635426403721d77b/src/engine/shared/http.cpp#L101-L105
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt really have any reason of touching http stuff in the first place
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> so it should(tm) be all pure ddnet
09:43 < bridge> <Zwelf> ChillerDragon: https://strct.cc/archive/2023-02-20-matricks.html
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> ou thanks :) that looks neat how did you create it?
10:20 <+ChillerDragon> what happend in offtopic? :D
10:33 < bridge> <spur> i am so confused, how is this the first time i stumble across chilletdragon, and why does he only talk on this channel and why is he a bot?
11:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :justatest:
12:16 < bridge> <ReiTW> He is an AI, that's why he's marked as a bot
12:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ChillerGPT
12:58 <+ChillerDragon> helo hoomans
12:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/loading-i-am-not-a-robot-not-a-robot-gif-14807517
12:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Biggest enemy
13:00 < bridge> <bencie> don't scare chillerbotgpt :pepeH:
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> lmao @Ryozuki ur on the profile page of magnus due to the repo having 7 stars haha https://github.com/matricks
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> also @deen get ready for some ddnet prs https://github.com/matricks/ddnet
13:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsF7enQY8uI
13:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Zwelf you didn't export media, media will become dead at some point
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> zwelf building amazing export and bully heinrich only nagging. @Zwelf i am very thankful for your export and i could see all media when i needed it :) dont let this bully get to you!
13:48 < bridge> <Zwelf> no worries 😅 for me it only reads as a good intended hint that media export is possible. Thanks for letting me know I would prefer having media exported as well. Will look into it when I'm home.
13:48 < bridge> <Zwelf> And I'm happy that you found it useful 🙂
13:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> wait wtf happened yesterday?
13:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @ReiTW real matricks
13:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> why did he come back lmao, just to say hello or ?
13:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kinda yea
13:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> read the url from zwelf
13:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> if I can find it yes
13:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> found
13:57 < bridge> <ReiTW> damn this gigachad legend
13:58 < bridge> <bencie> :gigachad:
13:58 < bridge> <ReiTW> imagine he'd be like ok to work again on tw, making it greater & finally making it more "moddable"
13:58 < bridge> <ReiTW> then bought by bethesda :giga_chad:
14:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/02/15/
14:10 < bridge> <Izanagi> He said he won’t but the way he rhetorically mentioned teeworlds 2 makes me question if there’s an interest
14:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> Would sincerely be amazing
14:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> This would revive the community so much
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> Yo any tw network hacker please give some opinion on how to document different flavors of int fields in messages https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-protocol/issues/11#issuecomment-1438541560 
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> When adding a Int field it migh be a bool as in 0/1 or a client id as in 0-63 or a direction -1/0/1 etc. How should that be displayed in the tables?
15:32 < bridge> <murpi> @DefaultO As long people have discord open, the chat history stays visible. Only if people close discord, the history gets wiped. If I were a super degenerate piece of human being, all I'd need to do is keep discord open.
15:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> then you misunderstand
15:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can make it so that you only see your own messages
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> link to docs etc. that show this?
15:33 < bridge> <murpi> May I know how?
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could potentially do this via bots and DMs
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but not with a normal channel AFAICT
15:34 < bridge> <Izanagi> I think I know what he’s talking about
15:34 < bridge> <Izanagi> I saw it somewhere
15:34 < bridge> <Izanagi> But you will need to interact with a bot for it
15:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah
15:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> is it maybe by disallowing read permission?
15:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's a read history permission
15:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> that would do what murpi says
15:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can only see messages from the point where you first opened the channel
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this might appear to you to do what you say
15:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> allow them to keep seeing what gets sent after they opened the channel
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can actually see all messages from that point onward
15:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this doesn't solve the problem
15:36 < bridge> <Izanagi> That’s useless ye
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> people can still watch the channel by opening it once after starting discord
15:39 < bridge> <Izanagi> Lookup „discord ephemeral messages“ I don’t know to what an extend it works, but it might be useful in this case
15:39 < bridge> <Izanagi> It’s like I said, it works just with interacting with a bot
15:40 < bridge> <Izanagi> But you would have to deliberately explain to the people that they have to use a command like „$help“
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like it only helps bot → user communciation
15:40 < bridge> <murpi> That's something we can't use (yet.) I'm still working on removing all deprecated code from our current bot
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not user → bot communication
15:41 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, that's correct.
15:41 < bridge> <Izanagi> Hm that’s unfortunate then
15:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea my memories betrayed me. but that's not what I mean. I thought I had seen a read messages permission in the past. But from the user experiences, it hides the whole channel.
15:42 < bridge> <murpi> It's possible to make the entire report system anonymously by using slash commands though, but that's also something we can't use yet.
15:43 < bridge> <Izanagi> Like heinrich said, it just hides the chat history, and not new messages
15:43 < bridge> <0108ben> How does this work? I type a map name, for example Electric and nothing happens (even with % on either side), is it done using a file name? If so which folder is it using?
15:43 < bridge> <0108ben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077601474068094996/image.png
15:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> thats another option though
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 here a link https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/game_messages.html#NETMSGTYPE_SV_TEAM
15:44 < bridge> <bencie> add .map, also it takes maps from /maps folder (so you can put files into %appdata%\teeworlds\maps )
15:44 < bridge> <murpi> You have to include .map I think. It uses the map directory
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> i feel just saying Int is a bit too generic since its sometimes a subtype of int
15:44 < bridge> <Izanagi> Why not?
15:44 < bridge> <0108ben> o::: thank you!
15:45 < bridge> <murpi> Because the discord.py lib we currently use is super out of date and doesn't support slash commands.
15:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> That's another option though. I explicitly meant "Read Messages" very similar to the "Send Message". This was a thing. They might have cut it though. Not "Read Message History". But apparently, that option did hide the whole channel instead of doing what it says it does.
15:45 < bridge> <Izanagi> Oh. Any plans on updating that? Or is it too much work
15:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> switch to a new one
15:45 < bridge> <murpi> > I'm still working on removing all deprecated code from our current bot
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're probably welcome to help, but ask murpi to be sure
15:46 < bridge> <murpi> https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migrating.html
15:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> i think slash commands could be an issue though instead of the bot just listening to your prefix and command name
15:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> because slash commands have a timeout
15:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> because slash commands run into timeout if you don't properly tell discord that you are still working
15:47 < bridge> <Sphynx> haha, is that a irc bridge bot from ChillerDragon?
15:47 < bridge> <murpi> Read the channel header!
15:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> meaning if querying takes too long, and you don't have code to handle that "i am not running into timeout" logic, discord will cut the connection
15:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> meaning if querying takes too long, and you don't have code to handle that "i am not running into timeout" logic, discord will cut the connection which tells the user "this application is not responding"
15:48 < bridge> <Sphynx> thx
15:48 < bridge> <murpi> 😄
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/game_messages.html#NETMSGTYPE_SV_VOTEOPTIONLISTADD_vote_description
15:50 < bridge> <0108ben> is there a way to do this with a png?
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> because slash commands run into timeout if you don't properly tell discord that you are still working
15:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> they are definitely better though, but only if you properly use them. also you have to handle registering those slash commands for each server the bot is on. as well as unregistering whenever the command is not needed aka. removed.
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not true, it's always the same number of strings
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but sometimes some of them are empty
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm. at least in 0.6
15:51 < bridge> <bencie> no, add the png to the map's quads
15:51 < bridge> <0108ben> okie, ty :)
15:51 < bridge> <bencie> no, add the png to the map's quads in an ingame editor
15:51 < bridge> <bencie> no, add the png to a new map's quads in an ingame editor
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 did not look at the traffic just at the code snippet that is shown below 
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> looks to me that even if NumOptions would always have the same amount that technically it could change and would still work
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean that the there are always 15 strings in the message
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `NumOptions` just says how many of them are interpreted
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1134-L1150
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> bit hard too read for me but it looks like it could vary
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, then it's different in 0.7
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> yea 0.7 is the more efficent supirior gaming protocol
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> but thanks for error checking :)
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> so any idea on how or if to incorporate int subtypes/allowed ranges
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why are u still working on this btw?
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Most ppl are against adding 0.7 support
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it won't be added
16:34 < bridge> <ThomasAnderson> Thank me later https://t.me/+4TqDfR5nQ2Q3ODg0
16:45 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah, why cant we like, clean up the code a little.
16:46 < bridge> <Voxel> idk much about it but ive been reading that the backwards compatability is more of a weight to drag than a feature
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> agree
17:06 < bridge> <DᴀʀᴋFᴏʀᴄᴇ> @deen 
17:06 < bridge> <DᴀʀᴋFᴏʀᴄᴇ> Hello!
17:06 < bridge> <DᴀʀᴋFᴏʀᴄᴇ> Why when i build DDNet Client on linux its only working for me ?
17:06 < bridge> <DᴀʀᴋFᴏʀᴄᴇ> Others ppl couldn't use it and they got error , is there any static command for building client in linux?
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1073585320437755914
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Are you a bot or why does it sound exact same?
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> Try ``cmake -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON`` and then ``make package_default`` @DᴀʀᴋFᴏʀᴄᴇ
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That didn't need to help
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If glibc is too new
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> ?
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Doesn't* soz
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea make sure the system you are building on is at least as new as the system you are shipping too
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> at most*
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> the older your build libc the better
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> you can see how the offical ddnet client is built here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/release/build.sh
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> iirc deen used some old debian machine like debian 9 these days i think
18:45 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, we don't have GER Bomb tag server on ddnet
19:25 < bridge> <Patiga> there is a nice unique server for bomb
19:38 < bridge> <bencie> problem is, theres a bot that joins every server but usually doesnt connect all the way, and it can be selected as bomb and it softlocks everyone
19:39 < bridge> <bencie> so for the player it looks like noone is a bomb, (connecting) is bomb, and when the timer runs out, instead of giving a new player bomb, the explosions just spam in the bottom left of map till everyone leaves
19:40 < bridge> <bencie> we actually had to host a private passworded server to play bombtag with friends not long ago beacuse of this
19:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> sounds like someone who hates bomb tag
19:41 < bridge> <bencie> nah, it's a bot that connects to every single server, for a few weeks all ddnet servers had (connecting) or some random bot spamming a and d
19:42 < bridge> <bencie> nah, it's a bot that connects to every single server, for a few weeks all ddnet servers had (connecting) or some random bot spamming a and d on spawn
19:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> Do the bomb servers not have vanilla antispoof? Maybe someone can port it if we have the bomb source code.
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> just use ddnet++ bomb minigame axax
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/src/game/server/minigames/bomb.cpp
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> 10/10 prime code and prime mod
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> ah lol roby did u just go tru ma issues? :D
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> thanks for pinging me and letting  me know its a upstream bug :hearth:
23:14 < bridge> <deen> You need to build it on an old distribution
23:29 < bridge> <Chairn> cleaning code will change behavior, hence game physic, hence invalid ranks
23:31 < bridge> <Chairn> @deen #6352 is caused by #6347
23:31 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6352
23:31 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6347
23:35 < bridge> <deen> I see, my bisect agrees 😄
23:36 < bridge> <Chairn> is there a chat log of yesterday servers (and this morning)? including minigame mod (teewars?)
23:37 < bridge> <Chairn> wanted to spare you some time, looks like i failed 😛
23:37 < bridge> <deen> I don't have such logs
23:37 < bridge> <Chairn> 😢
23:38 < bridge> <Chairn> matricks game session definitely lost then
23:38 < bridge> <Devinci> a few persons streamed it. maybe it can be found on twitch? at least part of it
