00:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Up and down worked
00:00 < bridge> <Solly> i tried a few months ago and the hats werent working
00:00 < bridge> <robyt3> It was broken in a different way in a few previous versions
00:00 < bridge> <Solly> and the same joystick shenangans
00:00 < bridge> <Solly> ^ whichi cant figure out why is happening
00:00 < bridge> <Solly> my partner wants to get into ddnet but they prefer controller
00:00 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
00:01 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd even consider mobile easier than controller 😄
00:02 < bridge> <Solly> being able to use hats for wasd and relative movement on the right joystick
00:02 < bridge> <Solly> it feels the same to me as mouse and kb
00:02 < bridge> <Solly> it would take me a while to get used to it
00:02 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd definitely use absolute aiming though
00:04 < bridge> <Solly> i use really low mouse max distance
00:04 < bridge> <Solly> so to aim i move my mouse in the direction i want to aim
00:38 < bridge> <pioooooo> render and ui related code are brrr..

00:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> Spaghetti everywhere
00:41 < bridge> <Assa> I think it's just very redundant, maplayers especially. The engine part just follows usual vulkan backend api with shaders and rasterization and stuff. So at least the render related code is not _that_ aweful
00:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> Well I mean more specific code like how you actually render the tees
00:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> Me trying to get alpha thing work in demo
00:46 < bridge> <Assa> I am wondering, are there any rules against functions as parameters? If not I'll follow up with a refactoring ...
00:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> I love recalls
00:47 < bridge> <pioooooo> I love callbacks
01:02 < bridge> <toominty11> @everyone https://discord.gg/9N9N9abqVm
02:14 < bridge> <kebscs> ok tune lock tile is ready ill just wait until #9788 is merged 😄
02:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9788
02:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://tenor.com/view/mercy-overwatch-come-here-gif-14280244
02:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we're getting tune lock before silksong i cant believe it
02:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://tenor.com/view/gigachad-chad-gif-20773266
02:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it should also supercede #5732
02:27 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5732
02:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
02:36 < bridge> <kebscs> I didn't see this before
02:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> thats.. old <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
02:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I've often tried to push things *people* wanted but devs/admins didn't see/wanted to, so yeah might not be best implementation and not 100% finished, but on my server it works really well since that PR is out
02:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we live in a society
03:30 < bridge> <louis> wait what was the decided behavior for tune lock overrides?
03:30 < bridge> <louis> i think tune lock should always be applied on top of the current tune zone if there is one
03:31 < bridge> <louis> wow hecta dev role should've had it since a while ago xd
03:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no, tune zones should have higher priority, as discussed with @corneum before. It's way more usable
03:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i wanted to be role-less ngl
03:44 < bridge> <louis> how so?
03:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh yea i can kinda see why
03:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> so you be tuned but still have tune zones affect you
03:47 < bridge> <louis> how would you make a tunezone in which players without a tunelock have a 0 force grenade, but the guy with tunelock has a normal nade
03:47 < bridge> <louis> if tune zones have higher priority
03:56 < bridge> <louis> they should both be added on top of eachother, but i think tunelock tunes for a specific `specific_tune_setting` should take priority over a tune zone's `specific_tune_setting`
06:01 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i almost said server tunes but im assuming the server should have normal grenade physics to begin with
06:03 < bridge> <louis> server tunes should just be an abstraction for tunezone across the whole map
06:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this is a very tricky situation because:
06:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - if tune lock has priority, entering a tune zone for the same tune doesn't do anything
06:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - if tune zones have priority, both tees (one tuned and the other not) will have the same exact tunings
06:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> *both tees inside it
06:10 < bridge> <louis> i think tune lock prio makes sense
06:10 < bridge> <louis> @corneum what parts were u trying to make where its worse?
11:32 < bridge> <corneum> I dont remembee💀
11:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> bor for gor
11:42 < bridge> <nicoo0391> 50$ gift https://steamecommunuty.com/s/1052980419
11:54 < bridge> <alw5> this is cool i like this
11:54 < bridge> <kebscs> Should new tune lock override old one, or only apply when no override? So in the second case have to unlock with the corresponding unlock tile and then tune lock works
12:35 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i think ill rewrite to 2nd so this setup works just for one player
12:35 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345721139476955167/image.png?ex=67c593f9&is=67c44279&hm=4e2353d59025bbfb7d4b2f49bdb45f6d3999f324ee2ef39cc44c707e34fb7a6c&

13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> arrows pointing in the opposite dir still triggers tho 😬
13:22 < bridge> <alw5> will this break old clients?
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they wont have prediction for it
13:23 < bridge> <alw5> aa so itll break their antiping
13:23 < bridge> <alw5> will we need new entities?
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also the local character prediction will not look smooth
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> @hectavoxel 🙈
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> speedup arrows are not part of the entities
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> no this is part of the speedlayer
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> you enter the angle in the ui, so the slides have 360 degrees of freedom, force and max speed is not needed
13:26 < bridge> <alw5> oo thats cool
13:27 < bridge> <Assa> only downside so far, they are skippable and there is nothing I can do against this
13:27 < bridge> <Assa> only downside so far, they are skippable and there is nothing I can do against this, they are not slopes
13:28 < bridge> <Assa> I could implement true slopes, but the prediction isn't the only thing I'd break with true slopes :justatest:

13:40 < bridge> <Solly> `&vec[1] == &vec[2]`
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> if anyone needs a review, ask me. I am constantly asking for reviews and want to give something back
13:41 < bridge> <Solly> no its padded to 1 byte or more
13:41 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't a template vector have a type, shouldn't this be the size of the type?
13:41 < bridge> <Assa> if you're using a struct, it's usually padded up to 4 bytes if you don't use the right pragmas for it
13:42 < bridge> <Solly> `std::vector<CButtonContainer> vButtonsContainersNamePlateKeyPresses = {{}, {}, {}, {}};`

13:58 < bridge> <Solly> thanks git very co0ol
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> btw is there a reason we are not support VS 2022?
14:04 < bridge> <totar> waoh this is awesome
14:04 < bridge> <totar> best new tile I've ever seen
14:05 < bridge> <totar> we do?
14:05 < bridge> <totar> I use vs 2022 exclusively

14:06 < bridge> <Assa> VS 2022 is installed?
14:06 < bridge> <Assa> I get this error in VS-Code
14:06 < bridge> <totar> there is some way to pass an agurment to tell it to use vs 2022 but I don't use vscode so idk how
14:07 < bridge> <Assa> I see the variable, gonna search
14:07 < bridge> <Assa> ` -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"`
14:09 < bridge> <Assa> just a configuration issue, when I switch to 2022 I get an error ...
14:09 < bridge> <totar> what error

14:11 < bridge> <Solly> -\ windows moment
14:11 < bridge> <Solly> -# windows moment
14:11 < bridge> <totar> if you're not using the vs 2022 IDE why not just install vs 2019 for the toolchain
14:11 < bridge> <totar> then you won't have issues
14:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> or your cmake version is old
14:11 < bridge> <Assa> because windows doesn't like multiple vs versions
14:12 < bridge> <totar> it would have to be pretty old
14:12 < bridge> <totar> I have 4 VS versions...
14:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i usually just keep one
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> `>cmake --version
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> cmake version 3.31.0
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> `
14:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so cmake just auto select the right one
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> maybe it's too new
14:13 < bridge> <teero777> Just generate the cmake manually?
14:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe just cleanup and manually specify generator
14:13 < bridge> <teero777> There is a cmake gui
14:13 < bridge> <kebscs> i have 3.30.5 works fine
14:13 < bridge> <kebscs> in vs 2022 you just open cmake project and thats it
14:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although to be fair i just used the vscode cmake extension it just list all the compilers and let me click on one
14:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i haven't installed any actual visual studio for years. i only install vs build tools
14:14 < bridge> <Assa> I deleted the CmakeFiles directory, now I am just missing ffmpeg apprently
14:15 < bridge> <teero777> ....

14:15 < bridge> <totar> ffmpeg should be included in ddnetlibs
14:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> name leak!
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> oh that's on me
14:15 < bridge> <totar> is the folder empty
14:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> hi Marvin
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> yeye I already leaked my proffesional github account, deal with it
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> hi
14:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> love you
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> I love me too
14:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok continue the troubleshoot. i'm just here to say hi
14:16 < bridge> <Assa> just a missing `git submodule update`
14:20 < bridge> <Solly> wait ddnet is supposed to handle ime?
14:20 < bridge> <Solly> darn
14:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean ye..
14:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chinese player base was big
14:20 < bridge> <Solly> an application can be completley blind to ime and work pretty functionaly
14:20 < bridge> <Solly> its nice to have text editing
14:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> pretty sure it is toolkits job
14:21 < bridge> <Solly> but ddnet stores the candidates, so i pressume they are rendered in ddnet
14:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but we obviously aren't using a UI toolkit
14:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye
14:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> only on windows tho
14:21 < bridge> <Solly> not anymore B)
14:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> in SDL3?
14:21 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
14:21 < bridge> <Solly> now its cross platform
14:22 < bridge> <Solly> so bye bye windows restriction
14:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it's not really a restriction
14:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it's a exclusive fullscreen workaround
14:22 < bridge> <Solly> and you can should be able to choose between "native" (ibus) and ddnet
14:22 < bridge> <Solly> oh right that
14:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> macos always composite so using a in-engine candidate is actually worse than letting system handle IME
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> xorg and wayland no longer have the exclusive fullscreen restriction either
14:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not sure about linux. i think compositors always have a way to integrate with ibus or fcitx5
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> but i think you should be able to choose between ddnet and native
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> its not like ime candidates are that hard to render
14:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so ye, better just kept it windows exclusive in that case. cuz people can really hate the in-game candidate list
14:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you can already
14:24 < bridge> <Solly> you can always turn it off
14:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> there is a setting to bypass the in-game one.
14:24 < bridge> <Solly> yes
14:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but i do think default to the ime render player usually see is better
14:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i kinda want to make ddnet also automatically give up on render candidates with windows mode
14:24 < bridge> <Solly> except on windows
14:25 < bridge> <Assa> I managed to get it working, I needed to manually delete cmake cache and all older build directories
14:25 < bridge> <Solly> in exclusive fullscreen
14:25 < bridge> <Assa> because windows moment
14:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> windowed fullscreen on windows is weird
14:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the IME works on some machine but not others
14:25 < bridge> <Solly> its just a window without decoration at full res?
14:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe sometime driver might just decide that it should take over the whole screen anyway
14:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> to reduce latency for windowed fullscreen
14:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm guessing
14:26 < bridge> <Solly> well since "exclusive fullscreen" is no different for me anymore
14:26 < bridge> <Solly> i assume all issues with it are gone
14:26 < bridge> <Solly> not that i ever had any
14:26 < bridge> <Assa> debugging the server crashes immediatly ... ........
14:26 < bridge> <Solly> segfault?
14:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> accidental anti-debugger. ~~we should make that a feature and sell them to commercial project~~

15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> never hang in a 1tile gap? it even makes the joump sound even tho your feet are in air 😄

15:06 < bridge> <Solly> ac back is not android specifoc and *could* be generated by a funky controller or keyboard <https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_5.pdf>
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the feature is also only active on android xd
15:10 < bridge> <Solly> right now it is
15:11 < bridge> <Solly> but theres no reason not to handle it on other platforms
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah so you _want_ it to be used for controllers?
15:11 < bridge> <Solly> a *funky* controller could
15:11 < bridge> <Solly> i dont use controller
15:17 < bridge> <Solly> <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_HINT_IME_IMPLEMENTED_UI>
15:17 < bridge> <Solly> `candidates` doesnt seem to disable native rendering
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING_CANDIDATES` waiit no way, did sdl actually implement this?
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> I looked into this for several weeks seeing if I could implement it for SDL but there just was no way to get the candidate list out on macOS
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> Nor on linux
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how they managed to do it
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> all the ime methods probably have thier own ways, it just wasnt implemeneted
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> but now theres enough to do so
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> maybe macos is still borked
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> If they didn't implement it for anything except windows I'm very very disappointed 😄
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> that could be the case because its not hiding the candidate list
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> that could be the case because its not hiding the candidate ui
15:35 < bridge> <Solly> that could be the case because its not hiding the candidate ui for me with ibus
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> on macOS I managed to extract the candidates directly from memory by disabling many security measures and injecting myself into appkit, definitely not a proper solution
15:37 < bridge> <Solly> ：sob:
15:37 < bridge> <Solly> +😭
15:37 < bridge> <Solly> 😭
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> on Linux there is actually 0 documentation, none of the used IMEs have any of their own documentation, all of their irc channels are dead too
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> at that point I was like damn, I'm not wasting more time on this shit
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> There is some standard for it inside X iirc but it wasn't enough
15:43 < bridge> <Solly> welp
15:43 < bridge> <Solly> @learath2 do  you happen to have a windows machine which can compile ddnet available to you
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> sure, why?
15:44 < bridge> <Solly> can you try my sdl3 branch
15:44 < bridge> <Solly> and see if ime works
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> Tomorrow I can
15:44 < bridge> <Solly> <https://github.com/SollyBunny/ddnet/tree/sdl3>
15:44 < bridge> <Solly> sure
15:44 < bridge> <Solly> if it works on windows then its good enough
15:45 < bridge> <Solly> by ime works i mean "you can use it" and "ddnet renders ime candidates"
15:45 < bridge> <learath2> Looking at it it seems they actually went through the trouble of interacting with each and every possible IM Server on Linux
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> Props to whoever had the patience to navigate through that mess and figure out how to handle it for each server
15:46 < bridge> <Solly> can u see where they get candidate lists?
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>     SDL_DBusContext *dbus = SDL_DBus_GetContext();
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> 
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>     if (IBus_CheckConnection(dbus)) {
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         Uint32 caps = IBUS_CAP_FOCUS;
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> 
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         if (hint && SDL_strstr(hint, "composition")) {
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>             caps |= IBUS_CAP_PREEDIT_TEXT;
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         }
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         if (hint && SDL_strstr(hint, "candidates")) {
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>             // FIXME, turn off native candidate rendering
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         }
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> 
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>         SDL_DBus_CallVoidMethodOnConnection(ibus_conn, ibus_service, input_ctx_path, ibus_input_interface, "SetCapabilities",
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>                                             DBUS_TYPE_UINT32, &caps, DBUS_TYPE_INVALID);
15:47 < bridge> <Solly>     }
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> ```
15:47 < bridge> <Solly> thats probably why it doesnt work for me
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> could someone merge <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9788>?
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, it doesn't turn off native rendering 😄 I was just looking at that exact same location
15:48 < bridge> <Solly> it would be weird to have non native rendeing at the same time
15:48 < bridge> <Solly> so it probably turns that off but i havent found that yet
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> Doesn't seem like they do. Only the windows backend seems  to call `SDL_SendEditingTextCandidates`
15:52 < bridge> <Solly> thats too bad ):
15:52 < bridge> <Solly> well windows is the only platform that benefits from it
15:52 < bridge> <Solly> so
15:52 < bridge> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> Not surprised. Except for windows this stuff is so sparsely documented that the person implementing it probably got bored
15:53 < bridge> <Solly> https://ibus.github.io/docs/ibus-1.5/IBusInputContext.html
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> Uncommon windows W
15:54 < bridge> <Solly> `The "show-lookup-table" signal`
15:54 < bridge> <Solly> `The "cursor-down-lookup-table" signal`
15:54 < bridge> <Solly> `The "cursor-up-lookup-table" signal`
15:54 < bridge> <Solly> you can get the candidate list i think
15:54 < bridge> <Solly> i cant find out how to hide native ui
15:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> classic
15:55 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah there seems to be a way, `IBUS_CAP_LOOKUP_TABLE` there is this capability indicating you can render your own, maybe setting this is enough?
15:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> having extreme dajavu now i'm seeing lerato joined the convo
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> the wording is vague
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> `The panel component does nothing for an application that doesn't support focus.`
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> i wonder how big sdl3 is
15:56 < bridge> <Solly> to mess around with
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps you listen to `update-lookup-table` signals for it?
15:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw candidate list really isn't needed on non windows i think.
15:57 < bridge> <Solly> but its annoying that its not
15:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> why
15:57 < bridge> <Solly> but its annoying that its not possible to do
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> and perhaps you emit `hide-lookup-table signal` to hide it?
15:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> IME worked fine with a compositor
15:58 < bridge> <Solly> i agree that its not needed, i just think it could and should be supported regardless
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> It'd be great if it looked the same everywher
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> It'd be great if it looked the same everywhere
15:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> why?
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> and if you prefer it to be composited on top, you can get a config for it
15:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> people use IME with their own settings
15:58 < bridge> <Solly> theres already a config for it :D
15:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we don't even have a horizontal candidate list
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> because
15:59 < bridge> <Solly> that can be changed
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> idk I don't like having weird inconsistent experiences between people that we don't control
15:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 😬 but we can't just take away their normal IME
15:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> for no reason
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> What happens if you are playing in exclusive fullscreen and aren't running a compositor?
15:59 < bridge> <Solly> (xorg and wayland dont have that problem)
16:00 < bridge> <Solly> (nor does macos)
16:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> does linux even support typing with IME with no compositor
16:00 < bridge> <Solly> (nor does macos)
16:00 < bridge> <Solly> (its just windows)
16:00 < bridge> <learath2> Who knows? If we were rendering the candidate list on our own these wouldn't be discussions that need having
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> at least make it automatic or something
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i keep getting DMs about turning off the built-in candidate list
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is annoying
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> and the people that don't like the way we render it can just disable it and wrestle with their compositing and fullscreen/borderless/desktop fullscreen/whatever fullscreen settings themselves
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i wanted to just auto bypass the built-in one if it runs in windowed mode on windows
16:01 < bridge> <Solly> is it not a setting
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> haven't got around doing it tho
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is,but people don't check commands often or don't know how
16:02 < bridge> <Solly> is it not a gui setting
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think so
16:02 < bridge> <Solly> should be a gui setting
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> I like things working out of the box and being uniform across platforms. Then you can break it however you like
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that i can at least somewhat get behind
16:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> having a gui setting will just make the opposite happen where people not understanding what the config does and just ask why their IME won't work
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> Can't windows render on exclusive fullscreen using that one weird trick they do with flickering the screen?
16:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we patched SDL to make that happen
16:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> with built-in candidate list we removed that patch
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> Can you show me your IME candidate list btw? What sort of customization do people do to the candidate list that rendering it ourselves would be bad?

16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> mine is really standard. let me poll in CHN rq

16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> they use anime skins
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe a small anime girl to the left?
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah figured
16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and some cloud functions that auto replace the second candidate with AI stuff
16:06 < bridge> <Solly> @learath2 can u remove the guys spam ><
16:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sometimes that doesn't work with the built in one
16:06 < bridge> <Solly> @learath2 can u remove the guys spam >< (its in many channels)
16:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but mostly because the IME maker didn't bother to properly call windows API
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> but how does the text replacement work properly then? Perhaps sdl is missing an event or something?
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wdym.
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the candidate windows is controlled by IME they can render anything. and the input is just regular text event
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> when you commit
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the candidate window is controlled by IME they can render anything. and the input is just regular text event
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I'm misremembering how windows does its IME
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we made our built-in render works using microsoft pinyin as a reference
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but lots of chinese don't use that
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and we can't possibly adapt to the 20 different options on the market
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, pointless discussion. SDL3 didn't figure out how to get the candidates portably either so we can't have my dream come true
16:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 💀
16:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean we could figure it out but i still don't want built-in to be default
16:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i like it as a workaround
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Linux looks like it can be figured out. macOS is still impossible
16:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i also run my IME without numbering tbh
16:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but i haven't figured out how to do that with fcitx5 yet
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh also
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we can't read whether an IME is horizontal or vertical and sometimes IME's input direction is weird
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> some people select candidate using arrow keys
16:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and some only works with left right and some only works with up down
16:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> some are brackets but we don't talk about those
16:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> random ass skin thumbnail i found

16:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> honestly
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> probably will make people stop asking how to turn it off
16:14 < bridge> <pioooooo> upvote
16:14 < bridge> <Solly> (sdl3 reports it for windows)
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm pretty sure 3rd party ime makers don't usually interface with windows correctly
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure some IME vendors just don't report it correctly or something. This stuff is soooooooooo messy
16:15 < bridge> <Solly> and that
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> there is also XIM for X11 but I think fcitx and ibus completely ignore that
16:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> fcitx is like it's own thing
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> xim uses ibus no?
16:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it just does whatever it wants
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> ibus is an input method for xim?
16:16 < bridge> <Solly> ibus provides a xim server?
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> There should be one universal standard and any vendor that deviates from it should be executed
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> That would fix all these issues very quickly
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ime is crazy
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chinese ime is also weird, some people really likes to design their own
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so there is rime.
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and rime sometimes does weird thing with depends on whether it runs on fcitx or ibus

18:20 < bridge> <Solly> everything seems to work but this.. but i removed it and it compiles
18:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> clang forced me to use std::all_of do i just have to get used to it? or is there a way to do it less ugly like wtf?

18:21 < bridge> <louis> kewl
18:21 < bridge> <louis> i make some comments on github
18:21 < bridge> <Solly> its harder to do things when forced to use raw pointers, ddnet gets around it for the most part by using member func pointers
18:21 < bridge> <Solly> but uhh what if i dont want to create a member function and value for rememebering the old value of display settings
18:22 < bridge> <Solly> insta segfault ofc
18:22 < bridge> <Solly> insta segfault ofc
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> Well I'm sure the person who put that assert there knew what they were doing 😄
18:22 < bridge> <Solly> the segfault is caused by rust magic
18:23 < bridge> <learath2> Unless you want to remove all rust along with it, I'm guessing removing the assert is also wrong
18:23 < bridge> <Solly> i would love to remove all rust
18:23 < bridge> <Solly> but uhmm im not going to
18:23 < bridge> <Solly> seperate pr /j
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> So you want to be able to pass lambda functions in there?
18:24 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
18:24 < bridge> <Solly> if i dont get this to work im just going to .. do the messy way
18:25 < bridge> <Solly> i slightly need the ability for it to revert display changes after 5s because otherwise it destroys wipes my monitors of the face of my desk then uhh i cant do much
18:26 < bridge> <robyt3> You are making a simple problem very complicated by trying to refactor everything :justatest:
18:26 < bridge> <Solly> yep
18:26 < bridge> <Solly> this isnt going to happen im gonna do it the messy way
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps one could limit the requirement to just functions registered from rust
18:27 < bridge> <Solly> or rather just change the callback i need
18:27 < bridge> <robyt3> We already have a `CMenus::PopupConfirm`. Try to at most rewrite that to use a parameter object instead of a bunch of separate parameters and `std::function` callbacks instead of function pointers to member functions.
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> paramater object as in
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> pUser
18:28 < bridge> <robyt3> https://refactoring.guru/introduce-parameter-object
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> oh yeah
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> i dont want to add more paramters
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> just change the pfncallbacks to std::funcs
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> which there are 3
18:28 < bridge> <robyt3> But you want to add a timer
18:28 < bridge> <robyt3> That's another parameter
18:28 < bridge> <Solly> can you not cancel prompts
18:29 < bridge> <Solly> outside
18:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Not with the generic `CMenus::PopupConfirm`. At that point you'd have to duplicate the popup (which is currently done for a lot of popups anyway)
18:30 < bridge> <Solly> can i not just do m_Popup = 0
18:30 < bridge> <robyt3> You don't render `PopupConfirm` yourself, it's generic and only renders your message and buttons
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> That assert does seem a little overly restrictive, I'm guessing the relocability is needed so C++ can call rust callbacks properly. Thus it could probably be relaxed to only callbacks registered from rust needing to satisfy that requirement by splitting the type
18:31 < bridge> <Solly> i like your words magic man
18:31 < bridge> <Solly> #
18:31 < bridge> <Solly> i like your words magic man
18:32 < bridge> <Solly> which there are 2
18:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ohhhhh i think i made them backwards
18:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> thats an easy fix
18:48 < bridge> <Assa> I wouldn't use a triangle there
18:49 < bridge> <Assa> I agree with the line, but make something under it, idk ideas?
18:49 < bridge> <Assa> I agree with the line, but make something different under it, idk ideas?
18:50 < bridge> <Assa> hmm maybe instead of the line with the trinagle below, something of a table shape
18:51 < bridge> <louis> make it look like unhookable xd
18:51 < bridge> <Assa> ╥,  ╠ , ├
18:51 < bridge> <Assa> they are pass through from one side, I don't think this works
18:51 < bridge> <louis> ah wait nvm its not really acting like that sort of slide right
18:52 < bridge> <Assa> it acts as a slide, no input -> you slide, like in the kindergarden
18:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i can try that
18:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> smth like this?
18:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345817093265952881/image.png?ex=67c5ed57&is=67c49bd7&hm=ab22383a57e9fbbb1034bbe8b5f712880f02645de36515b86a083a28c2b0f171&
18:56 < bridge> <Assa> oh yes I think this would be better
18:57 < bridge> <Assa> its not so confusing with the pointy bit of a speedtile
18:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
19:16 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place what do you think?
19:16 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345822016548245608/screenshot_2025-03-02_19-15-13.png?ex=67c5f1ec&is=67c4a06c&hm=b1d871aff18300c1a72fd8cf63140d163d1c539579f283813abb008eef8d834b&
19:18 < bridge> <louis> anything would work fine in entities but idk how you would make this in design
19:19 < bridge> <Assa> maybe just slopes 😛
19:35 < bridge> <Solly> entities is the issue
19:35 < bridge> <Assa> What is the issue?
19:36 < bridge> <Solly> it looks bad in entities
19:36 < bridge> <Solly> compared to the slope
19:36 < bridge> <Solly> compared to a slope
19:37 < bridge> <totar> I thought the triangles were fine
19:37 < bridge> <Solly> the design of the entities themselves its fine
19:37 < bridge> <Solly> its just that it doesnt show where you would move going along it
19:37 < bridge> <totar> But that depends where you're already moving
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> the intended purpsoe is slopes
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> therse not an easy solution unless you look at the tiles around it to do entities
19:38 < bridge> <Assa> well it does, it's an angled line?
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> and even then theyre not hookable
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> 3 of them
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> its not an issue you have to worry about
19:39 < bridge> <Assa> hmm
19:39 < bridge> <Solly> 3 of them for a 3 long slope
19:41 < bridge> <Solly> it would be nice to have slopes of any angle and have it hookable, or hookthru or solid
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> wait thats ... actually
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> uhmm
19:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> that sounds so complicated
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> can you not have an angle on each tile
19:43 < bridge> <Solly> that way you can do any tile aligned slopes
19:43 < bridge> <Solly> and more if youre patient
19:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the rotated tiles would still be snapped to the tile grid, right?
19:43 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
19:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ok lemme visualize this
19:44 < bridge> <Solly> 0-90 cuts the top right corner
19:44 < bridge> <Solly> 90-180 cuts the bottom right corner
19:44 < bridge> <Solly> wait no
19:44 < bridge> <Solly> uhh
19:44 < bridge> <Solly> 0-1 cuts the top right corner
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> 0-90 cuts the top right corner
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> 180-270 cuts the bottom left corner
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> 270-360 cuts the top left corner
19:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> so smth like this?
19:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345829530287476900/unknown.jpeg?ex=67c5f8ec&is=67c4a76c&hm=688f7d372b0e7b71b5ea19613d3f93f3e7eaf1487344abf70ac79ce11966f665&
19:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this is what i see when you say "each tile has a rotation"
19:51 < bridge> <aegisub> this will allow you to more efficiently pack 17 tiles onto the screen
19:51 < bridge> <aegisub> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345830905817595974/deeply-unsettling-asymmetric-patterns-in-mathematics-v0-4kj8dzo5f1ia1-1387886570.jpg?ex=67c5fa34&is=67c4a8b4&hm=4cc054d3b1a3abe52bbdc40ee6029fb1f0e16bef199b701f43661600f49aa5ab&
19:59 < bridge> <Assa> anyone familiar with `content.py`? I literally copied the code of an other tile with the same size and can't render it properly
20:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> is the position right?
20:36 < bridge> <thatscantbetruth> how can i use router's ip for host server?
20:37 < bridge> <thatscantbetruth> how can i use router's ip to host server?

20:55 < bridge> <Solly> no...
20:55 < bridge> <kebscs> tune lock map idea, dummy map but dummy has gravity 0
20:55 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345846998154346586/tune_lock.mp4?ex=67c60930&is=67c4b7b0&hm=bcfa5b17c2f778d4045560bcfbb5c4c52bd532674b07681343e3a5b458ad9bcb&
20:56 < bridge> <kebscs> or better volleyball
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> @sollybunny Can you update the screenshots for #9601 again?
20:59 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9601
20:59 < bridge> <Solly> the bottommost one is accurate for the ui, the penultimate one is accurate for the game, and the ones before are just showing size
21:00 < bridge> <Solly> but okay
21:00 < bridge> <robyt3> ah, I see there's a new one
21:02 < bridge> <Solly> the bulletpt list is inacurate tho
21:02 < bridge> <Solly> the bulletpt list is inacurate tho-ish
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe remove the old ones though so the correct screenshot is picked for the release highlights
21:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 🔥
21:02 < bridge> <Solly> oke
21:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> wait so what do you mean then
21:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like the slide speeders but hookable?
21:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh i just thought about an idea for that!
21:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> since speeders have an array in-game, we can add snapping lines for important angles
21:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like 90°, 45°, 1x2 slopes, long 1x3 slopes
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> I don't really get your point, the angle in the editor already snappes to this angles
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> I don't really get your point, the angle in the editor already snaps to this angles
21:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> in-game
21:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like when you're playing
21:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> solly is saying its harder to tell the angle of where you're going in entities
21:37 < bridge> <Solly> https://jsfiddle.net/nwx12j6f/6/
21:37 < bridge> <Solly> is what i was thinking
21:37 < bridge> <Solly> but i realised you cant do much with that
21:38 < bridge> <Solly> no im saying it doesnt look like a slope
21:39 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345858019480703036/image.png?ex=67c61374&is=67c4c1f4&hm=9db805a15cabb23e22e0a797c387a14a4f984d3e933733a47b7eb1fbf29dc37a&
21:39 < bridge> <Solly> in entities
21:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> would there need to be corner blocks too to account for this?
21:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345858907750404116/unknown.jpeg?ex=67c61448&is=67c4c2c8&hm=44f538dc5bf4adf5a526015896512e5267003c2b7afd5979e165c8ad008254f6&
21:43 < bridge> <Solly> yeah which is why i realised my original idea was bad
21:43 < bridge> <Solly> after starting to make this
21:43 < bridge> <Solly> but i was like
21:43 < bridge> <Solly> i might aswell it will look really cool
21:43 < bridge> <Solly> being able to modify normal tiles i think is better than having a zone with slope like behaviour
21:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> true
21:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> subtle lines in the array
21:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345859296176508983/unknown.jpeg?ex=67c614a5&is=67c4c325&hm=5de508889ed30271ee210316014fab744cbe96c237ffdaa710d29fae3286e33b&
21:44 < bridge> <Solly> but its alot harder
21:44 < bridge> <Solly> would be hard to implement
21:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> not really
21:44 < bridge> <Solly> would have to scan tiles around it
21:45 < bridge> <Solly> so that it lines up like in the image
21:45 < bridge> <Solly> or actually not
21:45 < bridge> <Solly> if you dont care about it being at y=0 at the start
21:45 < bridge> <Solly> you can use mod on the x position
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> or just prebake the line connections
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345859731004198985/unknown.jpeg?ex=67c6150c&is=67c4c38c&hm=d61daaf31a792852e0a79664b7f522e51032bff5919b40ad2cffb585b7a5c89d&
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> in the image
21:46 < bridge> <Solly> only works for certain angles
21:46 < bridge> <Solly> does it
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
21:46 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yeahh
21:46 < bridge> <Solly> yeahhh
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dunno how else we would do it tho
21:46 < bridge> <Solly> .
21:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> mayb
21:47 < bridge> <Solly> but if the icon is at the right angle
21:47 < bridge> <Solly> its the best you can do i think
21:47 < bridge> <Solly> without giving up on the idea of having a tile for slopes like that

22:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @kebscs any idea whats going on? the pink tiles on the right indicate a tune lock thats supposed to set `shotgun_strength` to `-10` but it does nothing
22:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345872751755268239/tunelocktest.mp4?ex=67c6212d&is=67c4cfad&hm=f20b95091e30a0690ea58ed0ffc78a7e34b570ef3a12529931d0ca24b33b0136&
22:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> other tunes seem to work fine
22:38 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but changing shotgun strength to anything else doesnt result in any actual changes
22:39 < bridge> <soulyvevo> tho when both my dummy and main tee enter that tune lock it seems like client tries to predict negative strength shotgun
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> shotgun strength is projectile tune which doesnt work with override
22:44 < bridge> <kebscs> projectile tunes are based on spawn location tune so idk if i want to change that to work with override
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> but will look why prediction breaks
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> @matodor any reason why you implemented override just for player, and not for projectiles? I think it could be done by just checking on projectile spawn if owner is a player and has tune override
23:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we please store stuff in the projectile not in the player who shot the projectile so stuff doesnt break when the player disconnects
23:34 < bridge> <kebscs> sure
23:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa ye that memleak is annoying you can find some magic comments in the code that deactivate it
23:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `` // NOLINT(clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc)``
23:40 < bridge> <Assa> ye annoying memleak in int i = 0; i++;
23:41 < bridge> <Assa> Should I make a Draft PR? I am at a point where I just have a minor bug I can't find
23:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sure!
23:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you can always just squash commits
