03:29 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9284
03:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> can anyone answer while i'm making the changes. timezone and stuff
03:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311888739638972457/image.png?ex=674a7f19&is=67492d99&hm=d6c67f35283788c44e1217bd72e8acdd5c0856ee9571a2a4b41ad1a7d1b9dfb7&
03:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: am i encouraged to just use classes instead
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t understand why structs shouldn’t be used
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> idiomatically even if access specifiers are different by default there is definitely a contextual difference between structs and classes imo
03:59 < bridge> <Ewan> structs make me think it’s fairly portable data, maybe a POD type
03:59 < bridge> <Ewan> class makes me think generics, methods, private machinations
03:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't either, but i tend to follow reviewers. but i'm more confused about whether i need classes or he wants me to factor out the variables into the parent class directly
04:00 < bridge> <Ewan> well you would need to prefix it with S if you were to keep it a struct
04:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah
04:00 < bridge> <Ewan> idk the context that much
04:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: maybe i'll just wait for robyt3
04:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gotta figure out the cursor position thing.
04:01 < bridge> <Ewan> well only he knows what he means
04:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i definitely think you should group your data tho
04:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye. i'll just change it to class for now until he says other things
04:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do believe double is reasonable here
04:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311890013763403827/image.png?ex=674a8049&is=67492ec9&hm=b5fbd5208914e14879bd49860aa1e0a767820220148e35ae69d2334c19820bbb&
04:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do believe double is reasonable here tho
04:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311890013763403827/image.png?ex=674a8049&is=67492ec9&hm=b5fbd5208914e14879bd49860aa1e0a767820220148e35ae69d2334c19820bbb&
04:03 < bridge> <Ewan> weird coincidence but i guess i’m in the midst of transcribing you rn https://youtu.be/X2FWgkcTc4U?si=Hy94tq1b72q78BBn
04:03 < bridge> <Ewan> or maybe it isn’t weird and i’m just a nerd
04:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i think as long as there is any reason not to use float then yeah
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> use the double
04:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'd rather to be freddy the fazbear
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> the guy on the cover isn’t fred fwiw
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> if you’re being typical chinese rn
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
04:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: well that's the only thing that is visible unless you want me to check lyrics or something
04:05 < bridge> <Ewan> no lyrics
04:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so just the vibe
04:05 < bridge> <Ewan> the song is just called fred
04:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
04:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fair enough
04:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~oh you don't want to hear me ranting about how china is overdoing their welcome to africa countries for allying~~
04:07 < bridge> <Ewan> even if i did want to
04:07 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not here
04:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, still figuring out the cursor drifting
04:08 < bridge> <Ewan> even still no reason to hate on an american-born black guy who has nothing to do with any of that
04:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't
04:08 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> what even is the pr
04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> cursor drifting
04:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311891936709185556/image.png?ex=674a8213&is=67493093&hm=e4c0a6b1bc701fa473a2cb4797ac1880fa11d59916d76a10e994d41eb21faa33&
04:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is this shadowing?
04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> is there another TargetPos?
04:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just these two
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i didnt see
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> no
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> if the outer scoped one was defined before that branch then yes
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> if the outer scoped one was declared before that branch then yes
04:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh cool
04:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> C# doesn't like that i think i'm just rusty on C++
04:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> C# doesn't like that, i think i'm just rusty on C++
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> lol yeah
04:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was like this but robyt3 want it scoped
04:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311892482627469342/image.png?ex=674a8295&is=67493115&hm=c6507a6cc7f94164845877168998b145934dbcd24ae44499699879670b885585&
04:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i think you’d get a warning there anyway
04:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well MSVC doesn't really give a lot of warning and i failed too many linux builds bcs of MSVC
04:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :cammo:
04:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the only compiler i have rn tho
04:13 < bridge> <Ewan> dont use msvc then
04:13 < bridge> <Ewan> the first is better bcs you make one less object
04:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just habit of setting up msvc i guess
04:13 < bridge> <Ewan> install msys2 -> pacman -S -> win
04:14 < bridge> <Ewan> it really is very good
04:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk why i really didn't like msys2
04:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but that was like 15 years ao
04:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but that was like 15 years ago
04:15 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if the project is that old
04:15 < bridge> <Ewan> what were ur qualms
04:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i forgot. hence the idk why part
04:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
04:17 < bridge> <Ewan> well it’s noticeably better now than it was when i started using it in like 2019
04:17 < bridge> <Ewan> pacboy makes environments/packages easier
04:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it started that late huh
04:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 2019 is like after my college already. weird.
04:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh wait, read that wrong
04:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> disregard that
04:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it was from 2017
04:23 < bridge> <Ewan> https://web.archive.org/web/20170207113504/https://www.msys2.org/
04:23 < bridge> <Ewan> nostalgic
04:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh right, it's just showing cursor during spectating
04:24 < bridge> <Ewan> you want it to show?
04:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wanted it a few years back, i've implemented this three times already, never got to the place where it was useable. ye
04:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly the original thought is to catch cheaters more obviously
04:25 < bridge> <Ewan> and it’s drifting?
04:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, when zooming it mismatch the local cursor
04:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, when zooming + dyncam it mismatch the local cursor
04:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> haven't dive deeper but i'm afraid that we are sending the wrong world position in the first place.
04:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm just hoping i did something wrong when displaying the cursor
04:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like this was talked about a few months ago
04:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but idr
04:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
04:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if i know how to interpolate, this would be a much easier pr a few years ago when it was first suggested
04:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> with all the new exprotocol and zooming stuff
04:28 < bridge> <Ewan> is cursor relative to player or absolute world units? i genuinely dont know
04:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> a bit tougher
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> to interpolate you’d need a second set of coords
04:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cursor is screenspace locally but it was scaled somewhere to worldspace and sent to the server
04:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the interpolation is done already.
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> why should it be worldspace
04:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no idea. but it is what it is. not my fault
04:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
04:30 < bridge> <Ewan> that just seems like a great way to break physics as you move further away from the origin lol
04:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even when i started working on it i always assumed it was screenspace, then i was corrected.
04:31 < bridge> <Ewan> not like that doesn’t already happen
04:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the sheer thought of we are having different grid precesions in different zoom levels scares me
04:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
04:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
04:32 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
04:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> need to make a map that only works if you zoom right
04:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah damn. i think i run into the same issue as souly
04:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do i just friend it after it was changed to class?
04:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311898627236696218/image.png?ex=674a884e&is=674936ce&hm=6d3b1ee1ec2c1f8296499a437475dff16508e03db07ee911945a3d27268330ac&
04:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess the world space cursor makes sense for telecursor
04:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unless the camera position is also sent when you're in spec or pause?
04:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wDyM tElEcUrSoR
04:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm so outdated on ddnet features
04:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's a practice mode thing
04:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thank god
04:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz i just found out we are not sending cursor positions accurately unless you click or move. if we have gameplay features relying only on cursor positions i'm gonna scream
04:50 < bridge> <kebscs> Why friend when it's already in the class
04:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> CGameClient doesn't have access to private members of nested class
04:51 < bridge> <Solly> im great at this
04:51 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311902356866338856/image.png?ex=674a8bc7&is=67493a47&hm=fa0b1f56b5efdc0576bd8e1ac93e9b1bba72711c40aeac4b7e414296e0f0bea3&
04:52 < bridge> <kebscs> Could just make them public if that's necessary i guess
04:53 < bridge> <kebscs> You still need to use m_cursorinfo.variable to access them
04:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is there a verdict on that?
04:53 < bridge> <Solly> no ones said they dont want this
04:53 < bridge> <Solly> apart from myr
04:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311902836036075520/image.png?ex=674a8c3a&is=67493aba&hm=42b3b498742a1559e229bf5cc13c22351495fede65204552c95a28fcd663e804&
04:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm doing this currently
04:53 < bridge> <Solly> its just that i fail to make good code
04:53 < bridge> <Solly> whats this
04:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: is it ugly or you are just asking what pr i'm working on
04:54 < bridge> <Solly> doesnt look ugly?
04:54 < bridge> <Solly> i cant say i dont know
04:54 < bridge> <Solly> what is it are u working on
04:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just making sure
04:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> #9292
04:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9292
04:54 < bridge> <kebscs> I would just make the variables public rather than getters
04:55 < bridge> <Solly> also you arent meant to use "Get" for getters
04:55 < bridge> <Solly> should just be Weapon()
04:55 < bridge> <Solly> etc etc
04:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> was wondering about that thx
04:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i will as soon as robyt3 say just make it class
04:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> rn i'm trying to implement a dirty server side cursor position lol
04:56 < bridge> <kebscs> I mean public inside this class om screenshot
04:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just to see what is happening with that drifting
04:57 < bridge> <Solly> o thats cool
04:57 < bridge> <Solly> why do you need a seperate class?
04:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i know. i can do that later and remove the getters
04:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> robyt3 says not to use struct
04:57 < bridge> <Solly> why do you need a seperate struct
04:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and it is too many things to just dump into cgameclient i feel like
04:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is nested
04:58 < bridge> <Solly> oke ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
04:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i was just following other codes tbh
04:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311904102086869013/image.png?ex=674a8d67&is=67493be7&hm=abcec2c7a0c468e585ee3812635b1b5f5c01490cdf0108a77d02fe4fff977840&

05:02 < bridge> <Solly> 😢
05:03 < bridge> <Solly> oh dear i have to rename like 20 symbols
05:03 < bridge> <Solly> poor vscode is gonna struggle
05:03 < bridge> <Solly> who was the guy who said this was a crutch
05:03 < bridge> <Solly> yeah im not doing this manually x-x
05:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @kebscs bad news
05:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311905636258283530/image.png?ex=674a8ed5&is=67493d55&hm=f3f0228c11175af030e667a283e59179fdc77950b82f3bc50cccaffe0cd2e198&

05:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> spec cursor is correct, the position sent to server is wrong :justatest:
05:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> spec cursor is correctly displaying server cursor position, the position sent to server is wrong :justatest:
05:06 < bridge> <Solly> im curious how this interacts with `tc_improve_mouse_precision`
05:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tf is that
05:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> tc... tater client?
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> it normalizes your mouse cursor to 1000 distance
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> specificially for me because i play on low sense
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> specificially for me because i play on low max distance
05:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> damn it
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> i think it will work fine
05:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well i guess it'll just get clamped
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> mite look a bit weird
05:07 < bridge> <Solly> where does it read the data for local clients from?
05:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> local cursor
05:08 < bridge> <Solly> do you read from input?
05:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
05:08 < bridge> <Solly> oke
05:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> local cursor is not touched
05:08 < bridge> <Solly> then thatll show wrong
05:08 < bridge> <Solly> ;--;
05:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> from mouse input
05:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also tater client will deal with it. this is purely client side anyway
05:08 < bridge> <Solly> `m_aMousePos[g_Config.m_ClDummy]`
05:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just spectating a tater client will be weird
05:09 < bridge> <Solly> or `m_aInputData[g_Config.m_ClDummy]`
05:09 < bridge> <Solly> im not worried about how other people see taters
05:09 < bridge> <Solly> its just yourself
05:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> then tater will deal with it
05:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like the tater client will implement it their way if they were to implement it
05:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> this is ddnet client
05:10 < bridge> <Solly> (it should be this one)
05:10 < bridge> <teero777> Also are targetxy still scaled by zoom? Someone fix that
05:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fine i'll check what ddnet is doing
05:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes and it is scaled wrong
05:10 < bridge> <Solly> (it should be this one)
05:10 < bridge> <Solly> (or just read it from mpclients[clientid].mousepos then that works eveywhere)
05:10 < bridge> <Solly> o yeah how u gonna deal with that
05:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't
05:10 < bridge> <Solly> nice
05:11 < bridge> <teero777> yes, make a new net msg for mouse position pls that has the mouse position and the zoom
05:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let's just say out of scope for this pr
05:11 < bridge> <Solly> i feel like the zoom thing should be fixed first x-x
05:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if that was fixed the spec cursor will just show whatever is sent by the server
05:11 < bridge> <teero777> Gn now tho
05:11 < bridge> <Solly> night night
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we can make it screenspace (which i was doing until i found out we are using world space cursor)
05:12 < bridge> <Solly> you could find the max distance and normalize that to normal zoom
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> server doesn't have max distance yet
05:12 < bridge> <Solly> server does?
05:12 < bridge> <Solly> clients dont get them
05:12 < bridge> <Solly> but u can work it out
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it does?
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like mouse distance or view distance
05:13 < bridge> <Solly> someone in an fng server commented about my insanley low max mouse distance
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they just saw your cursor
05:13 < bridge> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> as in they did work it out
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
05:13 < bridge> <Solly> i guess so
05:14 < bridge> <Solly> i like how vscode asks me if it hasnt accidently tried to replace more things than it has
05:14 < bridge> <Solly> but i dont even check and just press yes cuz its always right x-x
05:15 < bridge> <Ewan> @tsfreddie would cl_show_hook_coll_other 2 not do what u want
05:15 < bridge> <Ewan> actually
05:15 < bridge> <Ewan> for cheat detection at least
05:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cheat detection wasn't really possible anyway, so i shifted to make it at least look good for normal players
05:18 < bridge> <kebscs> I guess dyncam extra range isn't scaled by zoom
05:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it really shouldn't be scaled imho
05:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it really shouldn't be scaled in the first place imho
05:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :brownbear: i hate timezone
05:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> now i need to wait a day for comments on pr and stuff
06:03 < bridge> <Solly> mood
06:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> european morning
06:04 < bridge> <Solly> @tsfreddie `tc_improve_mouse_precision` scales mouse position such that the max mouse distance looks like 1000 if it is not already greater
06:04 < bridge> <Solly> i used to use a fixed factor but when coming to put it into tc we came up with a better... way
06:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's probably a interpretation thing
06:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> by fixed scale i mean scaling it not just normalize it
06:05 < bridge> <Solly> well it does normalize it
06:05 < bridge> <Solly> before then multiplying it by a facotr based on your max mouse distance
06:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah
06:05 < bridge> <Solly> before then multiplying it by a factor based on your max mouse distance
06:06 < bridge> <Solly> before then multiplying it by a factor based on your max mouse distance (such that it goes from 0 to 1000)
06:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> either way it doesn't really matter how tater does it tho
06:06 < bridge> <Solly> before then multiplying it by a factor based on your max mouse distance (such that it goes from 0 to 1000) (TODO: make it work with min mouse distance)
06:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet need to decide on the route to go for
06:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz if we normalize it, we then need another way to send cursor position for spec cursor to work properly
06:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or we can decide spec cursor is not worth the precision trade off and normalize it and scape the spec cursor pr
06:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> any way is okay but we (as in everyone here) gotta settle on one idea
06:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
06:08 < bridge> <Solly> i was earlier concerned about if you spectate yourself and then move your mouse
06:08 < bridge> <Solly> you would see your normalized mouse
06:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which means this probably will go unfixed for quite a while
06:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> again, i didn't change anything about local cursor and tater client does not affect ddnet client
06:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the spec cursor pr is purely client-side
06:09 < bridge> <Solly> no but you may pull data for local clients from a place where its already been normalized
06:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or you think i stored local cursor positions in demo or something
06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i did not touch local cursor
06:10 < bridge> <Solly> 🤦‍♂️
06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what ddnet used to look like after that pr it will still look like that
06:10 < bridge> <Solly> ill just look at what u did
06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there is no "spectate yourself" you know
06:11 < bridge> <Solly> press spectate then click
06:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> spectate yourself is just spectating the server tee of you
06:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is not local
06:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is yourself but it is not local
06:11 < bridge> <Solly> atleast for the angle is uses local
06:11 < bridge> <Solly> atleast for the mouse position is uses local
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ug syfrkg lrf akdif
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
06:11 < bridge> <Solly> atleast for the mouse position it uses local
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> that means it doesn't use angle in qwertymak
06:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
06:12 < bridge> <Solly> (angle is just a property of a mouse position, its never stored anywhere)
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the angle u see on urself when spectating is random shit
06:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> once in specview the data fully comes from server
06:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so in spec cursor there is no spectating yourself i guess
06:13 < bridge> <Solly> you cant spectate yourself?
06:13 < bridge> <Solly> thats weird
06:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can
06:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it is not local
06:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it just renders the server cursor position
06:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> when you are in spectate mode
06:13 < bridge> <Solly> (you cant click onto yourself when spectating)
06:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just pause and use right shift
06:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
06:14 < bridge> <Solly> o that works?
06:14 < bridge> <Solly> it does :D
06:14 < bridge> <Solly> it does use local mouse position tho
06:14 < bridge> <Solly> im on a server with 300 ping
06:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fine let me check
06:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've been sitting in freeze for two hours
06:15 < bridge> <Solly> have u tried space heater
06:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and fikmesån joined
06:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> did not expect that
06:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> stop worry about weird stuff
06:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311923565993398302/2024-11-29_13-15-21.mp4?ex=674a9f88&is=67494e08&hm=1f7695bebc308e6f7ef119dfd142cd438337aeb37e8ccbd6c5fdd22684579a2a&
06:15 < bridge> <Solly> wait why are you doing inerpolation yourself
06:16 < bridge> <Solly> doesnt prediction do that already?
06:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for testimg
06:16 < bridge> <Solly> ?
06:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> extrapolation on cursor? no thanks
06:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even linear interpolation looks bad
06:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also sample points doesn't tell you whether the cursor moves. server can say cursor position x is  2 2 5 5 9 9, and linear interp will just jitter each step.
06:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and it does say that because we don't send cursor position every tick at 50hz
06:18 < bridge> <Solly> we get jittery mouse by default
06:18 < bridge> <Solly> wait mouse isnt interpolated at all
06:19 < bridge> <Solly> would it be possible to shove what you have into prediction
06:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> of course it isn't... mouse cursor position isn't even a teeworlds thing
06:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we added it in ex protocol
06:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
06:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> extrapolation on mouse cursor will just make it fly out of screen most of the time
06:20 < bridge> <Solly> is it not?
06:20 < bridge> <Solly> i thought angle was never sent
06:20 < bridge> <Solly> it was always mouse position
06:20 < bridge> <Solly> the infclass selection wheel works in 0.7
06:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the other way around i think
06:20 < bridge> <Solly> ?
06:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311924898767310859/image.png?ex=674aa0c6&is=67494f46&hm=cfaa675db33960f4e8c5b464ae4f9ad333cdeab0ca153ca4707f4947ea292506&
06:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html#obj_character_core
06:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Freddie was faster but yes
06:21 < bridge> <Solly> ghasp!
06:21 < bridge> <Solly> wait why
06:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i man
06:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean
06:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even in 0.7
06:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is still angle
06:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why not? cursor position is not used for anything on client-side
06:22 < bridge> <Solly> ive never seen anywhere angle used its always a mouse position turned into an angle where needed
06:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> literally nothing in vanilla teeworlds calls for a target position client side
06:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it sends a single low precision angle just to show the angle player is pointing at
06:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> saves a varint i guess
06:23 < bridge> <Solly> but 0.7 infclass wheel works
06:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's server side?
06:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Based on the angle I guess
06:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So even if your cursor is not far enough distance wise it should still select
06:24 < bridge> <Solly> but you cant select it unless your ein dyn
06:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes the wheel is server side
06:24 < bridge> <Solly> but you cant select it unless your mouse is far enough
06:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk how client side map reads angle
06:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Weird
06:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> server does have player mouse position
06:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> client only sees other players angle
06:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk what's bothering you lol
06:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html#obj_character
06:25 < bridge> <Solly> i thought it was angles all the way down
06:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is HookX
06:25 < bridge> <Solly> i thought it was mouse positions all the way down
06:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But that’s only on hook I guess
06:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's kinda needed for pred
06:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think
06:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and animation probably
06:25 < bridge> <Solly> pick an angle or mouse position dont use both D:
06:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would do the same to save bandwidth tbh
06:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait I got lost
06:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> vanilla teeworlds seems to care a lot about each byte. until 0.7
06:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The client sends its mouse pos as coordinates
06:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the server does not
06:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So the server knows the client taget x and y https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html#obj_player_input
06:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how did chiller got lost
06:26 < bridge> <Solly> then how does mr tsfreddies thing work
06:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the client does not know the other players target x and y
06:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bruh
06:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311926321374560297/image.png?ex=674aa219&is=67495099&hm=429043c66d4468efcaa3024b25f42b4e4998a2a534c23b7f5c0f6706a4328100&
06:26 < bridge> <Solly> 😢
06:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's a ddnet thing
06:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i kinda hate this tbh. too many bandwidth used for not a lot
06:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i kinda hate this tbh. too much bandwidth used for not a lot for regular player
06:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess hook collision for other player is better?
06:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my first attempt at spec cursor is to just send target position per player. not per player^2. then this was added when i tried it the second time.
06:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> this is my third time implementing spec cursor. now we have a weird cursor drifting bug
06:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
06:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> #3262 this feature started in 2020 bruh

06:34 < bridge> <Solly> bullshit
06:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> doubting compiler is a sign of maturing programmer
06:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~and a sign of self reflection probably~~
06:35 < bridge> <Solly> i cant get theese errors in my compiler
06:36 < bridge> <Solly> which is more annoying cuz github ci takes 5 years
06:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> are you on windows?
06:36 < bridge> <Solly> no B)
06:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: then you can probably match the ci
06:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> enable all warnings and stuff
06:36 < bridge> <Solly> yes but i just want to cmake .. build and be done
06:36 < bridge> <Solly> ```
06:36 < bridge> <Solly> cmake -E env CXXFLAGS=-Werror cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Werror=dev -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=ON -DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELEASE=. ..

06:37 < bridge> <Solly> oh wait
06:37 < bridge> <Solly> i am smort
06:37 < bridge> <Solly> god its cold and im naked
06:37 < bridge> <Solly> and im not gonna fix that

06:38 < bridge> <Solly> yay i get anothjer bullshit error
06:38 < bridge> <Solly> seems if dbg_assert(false) isnt assumed to always fail
06:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why do you do that to yourself
06:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 👀 also isn't tater lurking a few moments ago
06:42 < bridge> <Solly> im too lazy to put on clothes
06:42 < bridge> <totar> Hi, you need something? :owo:
06:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just wondering about your thought on the cubic interp of mouse position
06:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there's a video in that pr
06:43 < bridge> <totar> Oh
06:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> #9292
06:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9292
06:44 < bridge> <totar> It looks good
06:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you told me to use some fancy interp and i did :kekw:
06:44 < bridge> <totar> Was it worth?
06:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> kinda, but we found new bugs that kinda ruins everything
06:44 < bridge> <totar> That first video looks literally perfect
06:44 < bridge> <totar> The ground truth one makes more obvious
06:45 < bridge> <totar> Maybe that's just latency
06:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i didn't offset the latency and i couldn't be bothered with video editing
06:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly the key point is to not trust every sample the server send you cuz i found out client doesn't even send cursors regularly
06:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i have to throw away non-changing sample points for the cubic interp to work
06:46 < bridge> <totar> interesting
06:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so the entire thing is just guessworks now
06:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also #9294 might trigger you
06:47 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9294
06:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
06:47 < bridge> <totar> I had another idea a while ago but it's probably worse. You could just steal the interpolation from the angle of the tee and then use the mouse coordinates to determine the 1D magnitude of the distance and use some simpler interpolation than the cubic stuff
06:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i actually thought about that after implementing the interp, not sure what it would look like
06:48 < bridge> <totar> .e neither
06:48 < bridge> <totar> Me neither
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also the hook collision line is using normal interpolation it seems so it does jitter due to the non-changing samples
06:49 < bridge> <totar> I am deeply unhappy by the current state of the mouse protocol from client->server
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and they mismatch the cursor which is kinda bothering me
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we should change that
06:49 < bridge> <totar> I am deeply unhappy about the current state of the mouse protocol from client->server
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we should change that
06:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 😴
06:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we kinda need to change that before spec cursor
06:50 < bridge> <totar> Idk what the best way to fix it is
06:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz it implicate the camera mapping as well
06:50 < bridge> <totar> Send zoom somehow i guess
06:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think the safest way is the worst way precision wise. just pretend zoom doesn't exists and we match teeworlds
06:51 < bridge> <totar> Sending the mouse as ints is actually also bad
06:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not the best way tho, but it is safe
06:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well everything is int in teeworlds for packing isn't it
06:52 < bridge> <totar> The server needs to know zoom for teleport commands, that's the whole reasons we're in this mess
06:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh sweet teleport
06:53 < bridge> <totar> The server needs to know zoom for teleport commands, that's the whole reason we're in this mess
06:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean we could just revert to teeworlds or use some improved method for controls and send target position some other way
06:53 < bridge> <totar> wdym revert to teeworlds
06:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> pretend zoom doesn't exists thing
06:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so the cursor kinda acts like screenspace cursor.
06:54 < bridge> <totar> Yeah but that's a regression for teleport commands
06:54 < bridge> <totar> I have that in tclient already
06:55 < bridge> <totar> It was doing that until semi recently
06:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if target position is used occasionally maybe we could just use a ex protocol for that
06:55 < bridge> <totar> what's wrong with sending zoom level
06:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> then you need to send dyncam settings as well
06:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and do dyncam offset in server i think?
06:55 < bridge> <totar> Yeah this is why I haven't touched it
06:56 < bridge> <totar> I don't understand anything about dyncam because I don't use it
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how often do we use target position exactly in ddnet?
06:56 < bridge> <totar> teleport only
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> then i don't see why we can't just make it special
06:56 < bridge> <totar> The client sends screen position for other stuff I think
06:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the client only start sending that after that ddnetcharacter change. someone said it is for hook collision
06:57 < bridge> <montikboom> When tater client update:please:
06:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i forgot if it is you or someone else
06:57 < bridge> <totar> Why so you need dyncam settings to calculate position
06:57 < bridge> <totar> For what?
06:58 < bridge> <montikboom> For mor fitures
06:58 < bridge> <totar> :justatest:
06:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not exactly sure but dyncam seems to shift cursor positions
06:58 < bridge> <montikboom> Rotat hamer brokin
06:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean it's just #9294
06:58 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9294
06:58 < bridge> <totar> Does it work with /tp at all?
06:58 < bridge> <totar> Talk to solly
06:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it will tp you to a wrong position
06:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> a bit off to your cursor
06:59 < bridge> <totar> ok so we can just ignore it because it's not a regression 😄
06:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311934555241975828/image.png?ex=674aa9c4&is=67495844&hm=9ec6a10a9d863b1ba526bbc0fb280aacbbb76ac00ef19cebef11eeffc9460aa5&
06:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well spec cursor can merge just with these bugs untouched
07:00 < bridge> <totar> I'm joking
07:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if we decide to do anything about it then spec cursor will need to be nuked and redo
07:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which i'm okay with but that feels a bit unproductive
07:00 < bridge> <totar> I don't see how that could happen
07:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if we decide to do anything about the target position then spec cursor will need to be nuked and redo
07:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> to be fair if we only fix the dyncam bug, spec cursor doesn't need to be changed as-is
07:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if so many people are unhappy with the current target position, we could just rework it
07:02 < bridge> <totar> The easiedt solution is you simply stop multiplying by zoom, send netex float for zoom, then the server does pos*zoom when it needs to tp you.
07:02 < bridge> <totar> The easiest solution is you simply stop multiplying by zoom, send netex float for zoom, then the server does pos*zoom when it needs to tp you.

07:03 < bridge> <totar> Different bug
07:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh you mean we just change how dyncam works?
07:03 < bridge> <montikboom> @tsfreddie
07:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i assume we don't want to actually change where dyncam is pointing
07:03 < bridge> <totar> I don't mean anything about dyncam
07:03 < bridge> <totar> Someone has to figure out the bug first
07:03 < bridge> <montikboom> Read it
07:03 < bridge> <totar> Did chatgpt write that
07:03 < bridge> <montikboom> This is fix for prablem
07:03 < bridge> <montikboom> No
07:03 < bridge> <montikboom> Copilot
07:04 < bridge> <totar> I saw you type copilot
07:04 < bridge> <montikboom> Aw
07:04 < bridge> <montikboom> I mean
07:04 < bridge> <montikboom> Co-Pilot
07:04 < bridge> <totar> Which btw uses chatgpt on the backend
07:05 < bridge> <montikboom> Chat gps 1.5 ultra upgraded pro 1883 omega cool 585 ver. beta release alplha pro
07:07 < bridge> <montikboom> Any errors in my code?
07:07 < bridge> <totar> No it just doesn't make any sense for this purpose
07:07 < bridge> <totar> It has no relation to TW code
07:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk if this is clear

07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait. wrong
07:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah nvm, couldn't be bothered to redraw this
07:18 < bridge> <totar> Oh I get it
07:19 < bridge> <totar> The camera is offset but the mouse is not offset backwards
07:19 < bridge> <totar> Seems easy to fix?
07:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean ye
07:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: ahhhh, i'll just fix this and move on. i just think only fixing this without touching how target is send is kinda useless
07:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> unless we are definitely not going to rework the target position at all this year. but i do want a confirmation i guess.

07:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @soulyvevo just wondering do you still play ddnet like actively
07:51 < bridge> <Solly> is that meant to be @sollybunny ?
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh riht
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh right
07:52 < bridge> <Solly> yis
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oops
07:52 < bridge> <Solly> i want this cuz im skill issue
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: cool.
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't get to play ddnet a lot so i'm kinda like blindly doing coding
07:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> although i guess that tag still stands cuz i haven't seem him for a while too
07:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well i guess i lied :kekw:
07:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311948404653428787/image.png?ex=674ab6aa&is=6749652a&hm=26334eb6c8cc78c83ab233ab4fd80a5fd0c585e1c8e5603f53d4749a6533fe8a&
07:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @totar https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9296/files this is why i think it is trickier to just send zoom to calculate target, cuz you really need camera settings to know where the cursor is actually pointing at.
07:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i still think a aiming target of somekind and a one-shot message for teleport with the exact position might be good.
08:00 < bridge> <totar> can you solve backwards on the client?
08:00 < bridge> <totar> the sever doesn't even need to know about any of this complexity
08:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that pr is client-side btw
08:00 < bridge> <totar> I know
08:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean we could change how dyncam works
08:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah world pos cursor position over the network makes sense in that sense too, no need to send camera settings to the server
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> by showing the cursor position that matches the ones currently sent to server
08:01 < bridge> <totar> I'm just saying that it doesn't matter what values you send to the server so long as Pos*Zoom is equal to the mouse position on your screen. it's like a math equation
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i think long time dyncam user will notice it
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i get it now
08:01 < bridge> <totar> you can always find values that make Pos*Zoom be correct on the server
08:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though sending camera settings to the server would be cool for spec
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but what's bad about a one shot message for position tho
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm sorry but i have to consider CHN bandwidth for everything i do kinda
08:02 < bridge> <totar> it's messy
08:03 < bridge> <totar> how do you know when the client is doing a chat command
08:03 < bridge> <Solly> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9295
08:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just deprecate the chat command and add a position command:kekw:
08:03 < bridge> <Solly> uhh it just got merged
08:03 < bridge> <totar> you need to parse the chat messages to figure out when to send the special net message
08:03 < bridge> <Solly> i wasnt expecting that
08:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> congrats
08:04 < bridge> <Solly> it only freezes you every second instead of permanently like normal freeze tiles
08:04 < bridge> <Solly> it works perfectly its just visually weird
08:04 < bridge> <totar> sending zoom just makes sense because that's the value the server is missing
08:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't normal freeze tiles also freeze you once a second?
08:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's just that the freeze bar is hidden by default
08:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is there a way without an additional value
08:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
08:05 < bridge> <totar> its not that big of a value
08:05 < bridge> <Solly> oh it wasnt merged it was just approved
08:05 < bridge> <Solly> oh really?
08:05 < bridge> <Solly> i didnt know that
08:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> isn't input data duplicated for handling packet loss?
08:05 < bridge> <totar> no
08:05 < bridge> <totar> that's a future issue
08:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh right the bit data is
08:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> byte data isn't
08:06 < bridge> <totar> Idk what you mean
08:06 < bridge> <totar> there is no duplicated data
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> Quick question. is smth like 
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> ```c
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> const char* pMsg = #include "some.txt";
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> ```
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> achievable?
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> Quick question. is smth like 
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> ```C
08:06 < bridge> <teero777> const char* pMsg = #include "some.txt";

08:06 < bridge> <teero777> achievable?
08:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Settings -> Appearance -> HUD -> Opacity of freeze bars inside freeze
08:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
08:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though it seems to freeze more often than once per second
08:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nvm it's just one second and my brain thought that seconds were longer
08:07 < bridge> <totar> if you're trying to minimize bandwidth there's about a dozen things you can do that significantly reduce it but we're not doing
08:08 < bridge> <totar> improving the compression would be like 2x-4x less bandwidth
08:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's not like players change their zoom all the time (unless this would be a part of some bigger packet that gets sent every network tick, idk how the game works)
08:08 < bridge> <totar> that's also true
08:08 < bridge> <totar> it will only be send on zoom change
08:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it will need to update every tick if we calculate it with dyncam adjusted tho
08:09 < bridge> <totar> not really
08:09 < bridge> <totar> you can adjust the mouse instead
08:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> just send dyncam settings too and then you can have your camera settings automatically copy those of the player you're specing :)
08:09 < bridge> <totar> the zoom is just a scalar
08:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> didn't you say you want to work backwards from dyncam and zoom? dyncam offset is changing per frame
08:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> didn't you say you want to work backwards from dyncam to zoom value? dyncam offset is changing per frame
08:10 < bridge> <totar> yes but there's infinite solutions
08:10 < bridge> <totar> we can pick any of them
08:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, change how dyncam works
08:10 < bridge> <totar> no?
08:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm suggesting the dyncam settings constants, not the calculated dyncam position
08:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "constants"
08:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's true, but working that out server side is also messy
08:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean config variables
08:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
08:11 < bridge> <totar> I mean for the ``Zoom*Pos = world_space_pos`` you can make Zoom and Pos fixed and there will still be a valid solution
08:11 < bridge> <totar> I mean for the ``Zoom*Pos = world_space_pos`` you can make Zoom or Pos fixed and there will still be a valid solution
08:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
08:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i get it now (again)
08:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fake data gang
08:12 < bridge> <Solly> WHAT NO WAY
08:12 < bridge> <totar> ?
08:12 < bridge> <Solly> if u pull someone out of freeze its 2 to 3 seconds to unfreeze
08:12 < bridge> <Solly> not 3 seconds
08:12 < bridge> <Solly> thats wack
08:13 < bridge> <totar> yeah
08:13 < bridge> <Solly> who made this game
08:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but wait, that breaks spec cursor again, cuz targetx and targety are shifted again
08:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
08:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Are there maps that require you to use this fact somehow?
08:13 < bridge> <totar> it should just be scaled differently not broken
08:14 < bridge> <totar> you'll just see their cursor distance slightly offset
08:14 < bridge> <Solly> yes since if theres a section where you fall out of a freeze section the difference between 2s to unfreeze and 3s to unfreeze could be death
08:14 < bridge> <totar> but like who cares if it's dyncam
08:14 < bridge> <Solly> so it cant be changed
08:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I want to make a 1* Novice that's impossible to finish because all the tricks are so obscure 😈
08:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i think that's broken
08:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
08:14 < bridge> <Solly> there are novices which might use this aswell
08:14 < bridge> <Solly> but where the trick is automated
08:14 < bridge> <totar> it won't look weird tho
08:14 < bridge> <Solly> but where the trick is automated (eg hold left)
08:14 < bridge> <totar> you'll just see them as a slightly smaller max distance
08:15 < bridge> <teero777> In tassing it's important :v
08:15 < bridge> <totar> there are some maps that use it I think
08:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it'll change pretty rapidly
08:15 < bridge> <teero777> On gores there is a solo part on aled to the legend that does use this
08:15 < bridge> <teero777> Stupid random shit
08:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: also i mean there is @gerdoe was concerned about even interpolation for the sake of cursor accuracy and we are taking it to the other extreme of not care about spectating cursor accuracy at all

08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but mouse is moving
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> player shift in and out of dyncam pretty regularly
08:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> simply set dyncam deadzone to 0
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even if it is stable i don't think showing a skewed position is good
08:18 < bridge> <teero777> Can't see

08:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> mwehehe
08:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'd be more happy if we just nuke dyncam but we can't :poggers2:
08:19 < bridge> <totar> the curve is continuous so it doens't matter what happens with their mouse, you still observe it being fine
08:19 < bridge> <Solly> why on earth does the server decide whether the freeze bar is shown or not
08:19 < bridge> <Solly> x--x
08:19 < bridge> <totar> you can make it always on
08:19 < bridge> <totar> I think
08:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i get that. and i understand that it looks perfectly fine
08:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait what??
08:20 < bridge> <Solly> wait no nvm
08:20 < bridge> <Solly> ```
08:20 < bridge> <Solly>         if(m_pClient->m_aClients[i].m_FreezeEnd != 0)
08:20 < bridge> <Solly>             aRenderInfo[i].m_TeeRenderFlags |= TEE_EFFECT_FROZEN | TEE_NO_WEAPON;
08:20 < bridge> <Solly>         if(m_pClient->m_aClients[i].m_LiveFrozen)
08:20 < bridge> <Solly>             aRenderInfo[i].m_TeeRenderFlags |= TEE_EFFECT_FROZEN;

08:20 < bridge> <Solly>             aRenderInfo[i].m_TeeRenderFlags |= TEE_EFFECT_SPARKLE;
08:20 < bridge> <Solly> ```
08:20 < bridge> <Solly> m_LiveFrozen is set only by server
08:20 < bridge> <Solly> but this doesnt drawn frozen bar
08:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i just don't think showing a skewed position at all is good on a principle level lol. i mean i worked so hard to make sure the interpolation garantees to pass through each sample point
08:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
08:21 < bridge> <montikboom> :think_bot:
08:21 < bridge> <totar> it's not skewed that's just the relationship
08:22 < bridge> <totar> I mean
08:22 < bridge> <totar> you don't have to do it this way, you could just send the dyncam settings
08:22 < bridge> <montikboom> Is there ddnet+
08:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :brownbear:
08:22 < bridge> <montikboom> ?
08:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i could do it a lot of ways and none is appealling to me rn
08:23 < bridge> <montikboom> Everyone
08:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> isn't there a way to account for all 5?  1. no send fake input 2. show correct spec cursor position 3. account for dyncam 4. not increase bandwidth 5. don't do messy math on server-side.
08:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is there ddnet+++
08:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw: (i mean i know there probably isn't)
08:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is the math really that messy? Isn't it just a couple simple equations?
08:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> true
08:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm starting to like the send camera setting option
08:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok i think i know what we can do now
08:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i've been stuck on this for so long i haven't eat for the past 48hours
08:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i need food
08:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i've been stuck on this for so long i haven't eat for the past 18 hours
08:26 < bridge> <montikboom> no
08:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
08:27 < bridge> <montikboom> Is there ddnet+
08:27 < bridge> <teero777> ```c
08:27 < bridge> <teero777> #include <stdio.h>

08:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> On one hand I adore filthy preprocessor macros, on the other hand they're like really not the best idea
08:31 < bridge> <teero777> I think this is a pretty ok solution for my problem at least. The other solution would be to use cmake instead of this exact macro.
08:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even more beautiful when you write a script to convert binary files to a list of numbers, then include that in your C code
08:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the most reasonable way to include your assets in the executable, I'm sure
08:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least it's very portable as long as you don't run into executable size limitations :)

10:35 < bridge> <woidless> How do I compile F-DDRace correctly for a test server, on Ubuntu 22.04
10:35 < bridge> <woidless> I had a Core dump
10:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> no idea, but fokko currently has a build-failure on master - so maybe that's why?
10:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
10:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dont use f-ddrace personally
10:38 < bridge> <woidless> Okay
10:55 < bridge> <zhn> yeah like why not
10:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cool
10:56 < bridge> <zhn> i di
10:56 < bridge> <zhn> didoo doo
10:57 < bridge> <zhn> @blaiszephyr wdym
10:57 < bridge> <zhn> oh oops melon ping :justatest:
10:57 < bridge> <zhn> hallo :D
10:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we love him so much that it just pings
10:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> on one hand tater has a improved accuracy settings. but fokk's preferred zoom is already zoomed out which should have a higher angle density than default teeworlds ones but it is making edge hooks harder for him
10:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> on one hand tater has a improved accuracy settings. but on the other fokk's preferred zoom is already zoomed out which should have a higher angle density than default teeworlds ones but it is making edge hooks harder for him
10:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or is edge hook gonna be easier with like 1000 mouse dist
10:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can't tell cuz i don't even know how to edge hook
10:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
11:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> to be clear i know what edge hook is, i just never played with it extensively myself.
11:01 < bridge> <zhn> can't tell anything about mouse dist but before mouse pos was multiplied by zoom we had consistent hooks/angles on any zoom level
11:01 < bridge> <zhn> so fokkos default settings literally outplayed him after update
11:01 < bridge> <zhn> cuz he needs to hook differently
11:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so i'm assuming we want to revert back to how teeworlds works (pretending zoom doesn't exists at least for characters)
11:02 < bridge> <zhn> no, zoom level should be known for server and initial input should not be changed on client side since it kills any consistency among players setups
11:03 < bridge> <zhn> so zoom exists, we just apply it on server side instead
11:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so sending unzoomed target position?
11:03 < bridge> <zhn> yeah
11:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i consider that revert back to teeworlds
11:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> zoom on client side, server sees the same unzoomed ones
11:04 < bridge> <zhn> i mean, targetxy should be unzoomed, but server should know zoom value to know how to handle input
11:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> input for character?
11:05 < bridge> <zhn> telecursor etc etc base on zoomed values
11:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i will send zoom to server just to get absolute mouse position for teleport.
11:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but not for charactercores
11:05 < bridge> <zhn> seemed like it was the only reason to send changed value
11:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think we are on the same page
11:06 < bridge> <zhn> seems like yup
11:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> alrighty
11:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @gerdoe any idea for #9067 tho
11:18 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9067
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm assuming fixing that probably also nukes the 45 degree binds and stuff
11:24 < bridge> <zhn> i just dont get it personally
11:24 < bridge> <zhn> 30 dist is kinda unplayable
11:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, but do we actually want to address it?
11:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i have a feeling that adding yet another config for that is probably not what we want
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> i don't get the issue personally
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> first known 30 dist player to me xd
11:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well that too i guess
11:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, i'll ignore that one for now
11:29 < bridge> <Solly> uhm actually that was me :D
11:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean tater client i guess, i saw your pr for that
11:29 < bridge> <Solly> it depends how you edge hook
11:30 < bridge> <Solly> because you can actually just aim for the ground beside the edge and it works 99% of the time
11:30 < bridge> <Solly> which is actually helped by low mouse precision
11:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it happens every time i want to code something for ddnet. some past quirks that just becomes a feauter
11:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it happens every time i want to code something for ddnet. some past quirks that just becomes a feature
11:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :brownbear:
11:33 < bridge> <zhn> how did you come up with 30 mouse dist
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> thats what i use
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> i dont know why i use it
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> but i cant play without it
11:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how big is your screen
11:34 < bridge> <teero777> wtf
11:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> 1920x1080?
11:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like physically
11:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 24 inch, 27, 32 etc
11:34 < bridge> <Solly> idk
11:34 < bridge> <teero777> he plays on the building next door
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> its 2 cucumbers long
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> no like
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> you played with default 400
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> and ???
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> boom you started to play with 30
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> oh no i remember why
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> i used to play with 1000 or so senstaivity
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> or higher
11:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do kinda want to address that, but i'm too afraid of player's edge hook habit and the old 45bind
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> but it was so unstable
11:35 < bridge> <Solly> that i had to go to lower mouse distance
11:36 < bridge> <zhn> it works vice versa tho
11:36 < bridge> <zhn> it stables with higher dist
11:36 < bridge> <Solly> i was probably playing with defualt max distance
11:36 < bridge> <Solly> i wanted to keep my sensativity
11:36 < bridge> <zhn> why
11:36 < bridge> <Solly> i probbaly tried alot before settling on low max distance
11:37 < bridge> <Solly> because i want to not move my mouse alot to rotate 180 deg?
11:37 < bridge> <Solly> i just wana move my mouse right and have my tee also face right
11:37 < bridge> <zhn> i dont move my mouse at all with 130 dist and 150 sens lulz
11:37 < bridge> <teero777> i have it on 200 with low sens it feels nice
11:37 < bridge> <teero777> i just want to see my cursor
11:37 < bridge> <zhn> even when playing dm or gctf
11:38 < bridge> <Solly> i move about 0.2cm for it to rotate x-x
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> same there
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> i still don't get it, 30 dist is something too non standard
11:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~but do you want to see other player's cursor too~~
11:38 < bridge> <Solly> its just what i use and trying anything else doesnt work
11:39 < bridge> <zhn> u have to try once more ig :justatest:
11:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly if i find my config doesn't work as well i would change my config instead of changing the game normally.
11:40 < bridge> <zhn> yeah :justatest:
11:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is it possible that being opensource :greenthing: made us accept too many personal preferences
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> that what heinrich was talking about i think
11:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that dummy update years back by eki is still on my mind
11:41 < bridge> <Solly> i have it so its the same to go 180
11:41 < bridge> <Solly> but it doesnt feel the same playing
11:41 < bridge> <Solly> and now that the major issue of low sens is gone
11:41 < bridge> <Solly> i dont see any reason to change
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> there was no issue of low sens afair
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @gerdoe do you know when did we update the zoomed target?
11:42 < bridge> <zhn> oh not really
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz we are still kinda breaking habit of players that only played the newer versions i think
11:42 < bridge> <zhn> but it was referenced a plenty
11:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> but why
11:42 < bridge> <Solly> max distance*
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if we just change back to teeworlds
11:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why want to address it or why i'm afraid
11:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> first
11:42 < bridge> <Solly> @tsfreddie if you are changing how mouse works you can just reduce precision at < 5 max disatnce (what tclient does)
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz it just seems like a bug. i won't really touch it tho
11:43 < bridge> <Solly> the bind only works at 2
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think i do want to at least match teeworlds
11:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> how is it a bug
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is how most experienced players use their mouse
11:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it doesn't really matter what it feels like to me if i don't touch it
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> isnt it normal to have low precision with 30 distance because you dont even have many pixels to put your mouse in
11:44 < bridge> <Solly> is there a way i can hide the cursor x-x
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> just get a gameskin
11:44 < bridge> <Solly> o yeah fair
11:44 < bridge> <Solly> but that will break @tsfreddie thingy
11:45 < bridge> <Solly> or rather i want to see cursors for othe rplp
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> imagine solving a bug by sending fake targetxy tho
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> say that to a person with an 8k screen zoomed all the way in
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 30 distance is 30 distance even if you zoom in
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it is not 30 pixels
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> no
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> not for server
11:45 < bridge> <oxyzo.> they see their tee really close
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i see what you mean
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> that sounds very specific lmao
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also that really doesn't matters, i won't change it, i have other things to solve for now lol
11:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i dont think anyone will use 8k monitor and zoom in with specifically 30 distance
11:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i dont think anyone will use 8k monitor and zoom in with specifically 30 distance or lower
11:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> at that point its your fault
11:49 < bridge> <zhn> have you tried to play with mouse min values
11:51 < bridge> <Solly> yes, its bad
11:51 < bridge> <Solly> cuz u cant go thru the center
11:55 < bridge> <zhn> why do u need to
11:55 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> because... what if you want to turn
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> from the left
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> to the right
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> move my mouse right? *error noise*
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> you cant the min mouse distance stops you
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> you have to go in an arc motion
12:20 < bridge> <Solly> which is alot harder
12:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think i did it

12:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait hang on
12:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why does smooth dyncam feel different than the teeworlds ones
12:46 < bridge> <zhn> ah?
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i swear smooth dyncam wasn't supposed to shift cursor positions when i made it:justatest:
12:49 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:

12:52 < bridge> <zhn> lulz
12:52 < bridge> <zhn> is it zoom 10?
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> zoom 10 it is normal
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's why i haven't noticed it
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i play pvp and we can't zoom on that
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there might be something that is fundamentally wrong with dyncam and zoom
13:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok not really. cursor just happens when you zoom with your character not in the center. so i just need to fix smooth dyn thm
13:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok not really. cursor just happens when you zoom with your character not in the center. so i just need to fix smooth dyn then
