04:09 <+bridge> <0xdeen> GER is close enough to France, Bahrain close enough to UAE

07:37 <+bridge> <teero777> another day of not particularly being useful to society
08:14 <+bridge> <teero777> Has anyone tried alpine before?
08:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
08:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> alpine is cool
08:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> but musl is hard to use seriously without a c++ library lol
08:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> alpine for what?
08:50 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Containers?
08:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ddnet compiles smoothly on alpine btw https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-docker/blob/e44c32ae0784762fe6692d333299e0d3b210c7ae/ddnet-simple/Dockerfile
08:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not one uses alpine personally right?
08:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no one uses alpine personally right?
08:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> As a daily driver desktop?
08:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 2025 will be the year of the alpine desktop
09:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> imagine 2025
09:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> morning
09:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> Gm
09:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> how you bean
10:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> alright
10:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> hbu
10:22 <+bridge> <godly13> But no UAE servers rn
10:23 <+bridge> <godly13> Then why i have ping 300 on Bahrain if i near +-
10:24 <+bridge> <godly13> 2200km
10:25 <+bridge> <meloƞ> mornin #developer enjoyers and others
10:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> alr too
11:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> My server won't boot if libwinpthread-1.dll is missing, can I somehow bundle it, so it's automatically "there"?
11:18 <+bridge> <learath2> You are supposed to be bundling it, our cmakelists does it by default on windows, did you change anything there?
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Not sure, as my base cmakelists.txt is from vanilla
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it probably does not include everything from ddnet, this part for example
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i couldn't find anything in cmakelists.txt
11:30 <+bridge> <learath2> It's probably being added to the copy files list by something in `cmake/`
11:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Could you show me where?
11:41 <+bridge> <learath2> I can't rn, but later sure. Why don't you just grep for libwinpthread?
11:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dunno how/where
11:52 <+bridge> <learath2> I told you the folder `cmake/`
11:52 <+bridge> <learath2> `grep -R libwinpthread cmake/`?
12:08 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Horrible routing in the area? I remember that in South America neighboring countries would have such a ping because they have no connections between countries, all are just connected to the USA
12:12 <+bridge> <godly13> Aa
12:37 <+bridge> <teero777> As a daily driver :justatest:
12:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> you're using mingw
12:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> gotta bundle that and libgcc-seh
12:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> and runtimes
12:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i made a script to copy all deps for deploy assuming ur licenses allow for it <https://gist.github.com/ewancg/de0b47f55b9894b9dc5a7b8609150186>
12:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> if using msys2
12:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> if not get with the times man

16:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robsti u changed something that affected the connection code right? what was it again? the thing that broke fokkos design
16:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like the merge broke connections of my headless client but sadly i can not reproduce it locally so its a bit of a pain to debug
16:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> .
16:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> .
16:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> wait, r u on irc or can u see replies

17:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im not home and wanted to ssh into my own vps
17:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but i cant because the laptop i have i didnt save any ssh key
17:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im doomed by my own security
17:10 <+bridge> <0xdeen> That's probably why the xz co-maintainer added the vulnerability
17:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kek

18:14 <+bridge> <learath2> `/home/learath2/C/ddnet/cmake/FindOpusfile.cmake:      "${EXTRA_OPUSFILE_LIBDIR}/libwinpthread-1.dll"` this seems to be it
18:15 <+bridge> <learath2> (which is slightly insane on our part, but these copy files happen unconditionally, so it works out)
18:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont really understand how I can fix this now
18:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the more i use cmake the more it confuses me
18:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Only @heinrich5991 probably understands the whole cmakelists, I only understand a bit of it 😛
18:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i always thought i am the only one who doesnt understand it
18:18 <+bridge> <learath2> The teeworlds one you use I know nothing about, heinrich wrote it aswell iirc
18:18 <+bridge> <learath2> but I would be surprised if anyone tested it with mingw, only 10 people play 0.7 afterall
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xDDD
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well it works, if you have mingw on your computer and the path to the dll is in your PATH
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> like mingw/bin}
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> like mingw/bin\
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> like mingw/bin/
18:19 <+bridge> <learath2> Just add it to `COPY_FILES` and it should work
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but people who dont, might fail to start the app
18:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i'll try, thanks a lot
18:19 <+bridge> <learath2> in our case we are lucky that we get it with opusfile
18:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
18:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hm
18:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont have FindOpus
18:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> is that a problem?
18:20 <+bridge> <learath2> Makes sense, vanilla teeworlds doesn't use opus or opusfile, they are for map sounds
18:22 <+bridge> <learath2> Or you can try calling Ewan's script after compilation to copy over the correct things, it should work
18:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is borrow.dev a good domain
18:24 <+bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 perhaps we should check for mingw and add these to copy_files on our own, currently we seem to just rely on opusfile
18:24 <+bridge> <learath2> For a website that gives out loans to developers, yes
18:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Or maybe for a borrow checker related project
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i want a domain for my blog
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> using my name feels outdated
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> edgarluque.com
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u using porkbun for mail host too?
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can u use it from apps via smtp?
18:26 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm not using mail at all on my domain, I would have to think about what I'd do nowadays, I hear google is being less terroristic if you implement all the 50 security features
18:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> porkbun looks cheao
18:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 24€ per year
18:26 <+bridge> <learath2> but porkbun does have mail services, idk if you can just use their smtp
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> All Our Email Hosting Plans Come With
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     10 GB of Storage
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Secure IMAP and POP
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Send and Receive Email
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Webmail
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Email Forwarding
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Mind Blowing Customer Support
18:27 <+bridge> <learath2> it was easily the cheapest of all and I enjoy the nice clean interface immensely, I haven't used them very long though
18:27 <+bridge> <learath2> You can get `edg.xyz` for only 30k$
18:27 <+bridge> <learath2> It's a bargain
18:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i want a .dev domain
18:28 <+bridge> <learath2> `edgl.dev` is cheap
18:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> btw .dev requires HSTS
18:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ohhh
18:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its mine now
18:30 <+bridge> <learath2> :Celebrate:
18:31 <+bridge> <learath2> `fe2o3.dev` could be cute too if I ever get an idea for a rust project
18:32 <+bridge> <learath2> `cr2o3.dev` if I ever make a language that is polar opposite of rust
18:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why 2o3
18:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Fe2O3 is Iron Oxide, which is basically Rust
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hard to type and remember tho
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> edgl.dev ez
18:34 <+bridge> <learath2> Cr2O3 is Chromium Oxide, it's a rust resistant pigment 😛
18:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Also imagine saying you code in Cr2O3, It would be the most annoying thing ever
18:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah edgl.dev is pretty good, no need to think even
18:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now i just need to setup a redirect
18:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that keeps the uri
18:44 <+bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki if you want to host your own mail but just need an outgoing relay you can just use something like amazon SES btw
18:45 <+bridge> <learath2> Usually much much cheaper than a full mail provider
18:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is it rly cheaper than 24€ per year?
18:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> from porkbun
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a relay
18:47 <+bridge> <learath2> It should be like 10 cents a month if you aren't sending out thousands and thousands of mail 😄
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> makes sense
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ill consider it xd
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also i can have full storage for incoming
18:47 <+bridge> <learath2> I meant as in if you want to host your own mail, usually really not worth the effort in my experience
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true
18:48 <+bridge> <learath2> I will some day give it a go again with dmarc and dkim set up properly and see if google still condemns me to spam box
18:59 <+bridge> <learath2> I seem to have good ip reputation despite being on hetzner, maybe I'll be allowed 😄
19:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> What's the reason for handling tiles for CurrentIndex, when there is this GetMapIndices
19:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i mean, if the indices are empty, why process the tile anyways?
19:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4b08c8cffbc360272308350793ea0bdf30e71d20/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L2155-L2176
19:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the else gets executed when a tee is on TILE_AIR basically, so when no other game tile is placed
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 im also on hetzner
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the problem is i cant host it on my server because mail leaks ips
20:55 <+bridge> <learath2> hetzners deal is just too good
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mx records arent hid by cloudflare
20:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can get a 4€ vps to.host it, but thats already costlier than pork
20:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well if i host it for more domains maybe its a better deal
20:57 <+bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't bother if leaking the ip is a concern
20:58 <+bridge> <learath2> iirc porkbun charges per inbox, so perhaps you can even have multiple domains route to one
21:21 <+bridge> <zhn> llvm ir looks better when you know what it all means xd
21:23 <+bridge> <zsmf> Hey guys im curious, how do i make a bomb tag mode? I want to try it out with my friends
21:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only thing i can find relating to bomb is:
21:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3965
21:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if there are up to date mods for this
21:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is bomb tag different to bomb?
21:25 <+bridge> <zsmf> No not really
21:25 <+bridge> <zsmf> i just call it bomb tag
21:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it's your own mod?
21:25 <+bridge> <zsmf> But thanks for the file dude!
21:25 <+bridge> <zsmf> Nope
21:26 <+bridge> <zsmf> i call it bomb tag cause it reminds me of tag
21:26 <+bridge> <zsmf> but i aint chaning the mod name
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah there are bomb tag mods in ddnet
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then someone probably has the source code for it
21:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/unique-clan/bomb
21:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i assume this is the one ddnet uses
21:32 <+bridge> <learath2> I quickly took a peak at this chat and saw, "Hey guys im curious, how do I make a bomb..."
