01:42 < bridge> <blazulite> ChillerDragon: that would be a great idea
01:42 < bridge> <blazulite> Gonna see if I can
01:42 < bridge> <blazulite> Thx :D
02:13 < bridge> <Ewan> agh i can't play like this
02:13 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a way to tell if it's anything on my end using other tooling
02:13 < bridge> <Ewan> non-ddnet
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how a connection goes unstable like this overnight
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> isp reroutes something or other
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> or maybe it's weather? but it's consistently a lag every so often coupled with a much bigger spike every few minutes
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> or maybe it's weather? but it's consistently a tiny lag every so often coupled with a much bigger spike every few minutes
02:15 < bridge> <Ewan> the only thing i've ever seen lag like this is gc and that's in another world entirely
02:27 < bridge> <Ewan> could be a bandwidth thing
02:27 < bridge> <Ewan> but my mom has only been home and watching tv & brother playing games for a few hours and it's been lagging all day
03:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you guys make shader code look easy
07:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Terminal is what makes it awesome
07:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wot lerato finished Uni?

09:23 < bridge> <deen> Congratulations! That's huge
10:02 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Is it possible to change the colours of the enteties ingame like a gameskin? 
10:02 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> i mean it would be nice
10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not really
10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U could change the shaders xd
10:06 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> But i wanne change entities xD and i dont wanne change the file 10 times xD
10:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> careful, dont let heinrich see that you posted an image :p
10:19 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> How did you get bachelors for 7 years, im currently studying engineering and will get bachelors in 4 years and masters in 6
10:19 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :okSanya:
10:20 < bridge> <learath2> I did it very slowly, it's not that hard 😄
10:21 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> I see, you like to take things slowly, thats fine :owo:
10:21 < bridge> <learath2> Covid was 2 years of nothing for me. Like a timeskip 😄
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hello guyz
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Who has experience with some tool that automatically rotates an image?
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I need the speedup arrow rotated 256 times
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 360/256°
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And then as tile layer img
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i ask chatgpt xdd
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and in rust, bcs today is FFR
10:30 < bridge> <learath2> Why not just gm?
10:30 < bridge> <learath2> And some bash as glue
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i'll do smth like that. but maybe someone here is pro
10:45 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Patiga
10:48 < bridge> <patiga> bad news, speedup tiles have 360 different rotations
10:48 < bridge> <patiga> or does the current renderer only consider 256?
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well that sucks xd
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no it actually rotates the tile
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i simply assumed it u8 like anything
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but indeed looks like it uses short
10:49 < bridge> <patiga> speedup it the only tile with a i16
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> such trolls xd
10:49 < bridge> <patiga> and ofc it introduces a padding byte :ouch:
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i guess i'll just do the speedup extend with the very old logic (opengl 1.x)
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd love to know how many maps have speedups on the border 😄
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga where r ur tools for that xdd
10:51 < bridge> <patiga> I mean you must already have rotation logic for the edges, no?
10:51 < bridge> <patiga> you could use that to reduce the amount of angles for speedup
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 90°
10:51 < bridge> <patiga> well and mirroring
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah lol. very interesting
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that could work
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clever
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 300 iq play xd
10:52 < bridge> <patiga> :owo:
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw can speedup tiles be rotated anyway?
10:52 < bridge> <patiga> no ^^
10:52 < bridge> <patiga> doesnt have tileflags iirc
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also not mirrored etc?
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>  ok
11:00 < ChillerDragon> can i wipe all access levels? Since the package manager installs a ddnet autoexec_server.cfg system wide I would like to reset it from my cfg to make it portable
11:00 < ChillerDragon> it gives moderators access to a bunch of commands is there a clear_votes equivalent for access_level
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can simply overwrite it in your config dir
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> friday rust
11:41 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ its not simply i would have to unset like all of the 20 lines ddnets config currently sets. And it is not future proof if the package manager ships a new config with more access levels
11:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im worried about long covid now
11:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i started coughing like crazy since the end of september. feeling a lot better mid october, but the week i feel like can only work until 2pm and feel really exhausted :justatest:
11:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i started coughing like crazy since the end of september. feeling a lot better mid october, but this week i feel like can only work until 2pm and feel really exhausted :justatest:
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or maybe im just lazy :owo:
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a friend and my father had it too... they still have it xDD
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since like summer
11:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do they have trouble standing up
11:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive never feel tired to the point of having shaky legs
11:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i feel it is starting to get difficult recently just to get my ass out of my chair
11:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the friend defs struggled in the first month.. but not in the third month like you
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you should check your vitamine level etc
12:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its only been a month
12:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> end of sep until now its like a month plus a few days
12:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think company have health check up in a few weeks
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for him it also got better and better
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for you it sounds like it's going downwards again
12:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im not paying for health exam myself if its coming up for free
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> problems that don't exist in germany xdd
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fair enough
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly my public health insurance probably covers that
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just never tried to use it
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive only been tired for like a week tho
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me the bigger problem is getting to a meeting with a doc in first place
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i was feeling fine even though i was coughing last month
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the biggest problem for me is to convince myself to book an appointment
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just suplement some vitamine and see if it helps xddd
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cheapest strategy
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> gymgym
12:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im having some fish soup at a restaurant
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u eat changes a lot ur mood
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> discovered that after starting a conscious diet for gym
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just looked up and there was an albino dude sitting right across
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> doesn't sound very healthy 😂
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its fish in some soup
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what should be good about it? omega3?
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but it's not like fish magically replaces vegetables etc.
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk, whats bad about fish and soup
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> soup is usually 90% salted water
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> esp. in a restaurant where it has to taste good
12:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are vegetables in the soup?
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need to eat 600gramms of vegetables per day
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not 5 gramm in some soup xdd
12:08 < bridge> <teero777> Noodles and egg 🥚

12:09 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks U know hühnersuppe?
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
12:09 < bridge> <teero777> THE BEST
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i havent eaten it since 15 years. so dunno 😄
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i dont think i want to stand up rn. im already tired finishing this meal lmao
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
12:10 < bridge> <teero777> come visit me in nrw I'll make you some delicious Hühnersuppe
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too be fair i did skip lunch
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's no use, i'd not eat it anyway ^^
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i do live in NRW
12:11 < bridge> <teero777> u
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i haven't eaten meat in 13 years. why should i start now xd
12:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you just chump down a salad everyday tho
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> -rep
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i usually eat vegetable made in a pan
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :Sadge:
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> you must be starving
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i try to make around 600gramm which is exactly one frozen pack
12:13 < bridge> <teero777> poor child
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think ill be fine
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> believe me, even if b12, b6, proteins and omega3 etc are important.. meat is generally not very healthy
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i supplement such stuff and call it a day
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok im leaving the restaurant, wish me luck
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't fall asleep
12:14 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok im calling a taxi
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> almost tripped
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chicken is okish i think. but especially pig is very bad
12:15 < bridge> <teero777> yea pig doesn't taste good anyways
12:15 < bridge> <teero777> I heard human tastes like pig so that's not an alternative either ig
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also except cows, no animal produces B12 itself.. so the meat you eat usually has b12 additionally added anyway
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> dude im walking weird
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (no animal u usually eat)
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe u should call an ambulance
12:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that was dark 😂
12:16 < bridge> <teero777> Dinosaurs are the main dish every day wdym
12:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im sitting on a bench now
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro are you dieing rn. sadly i can't just call chinese ambulance for u

12:24 < bridge> <teero777> what else did I leak xdd
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks like u wear a headset

12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao xDD
12:24 < bridge> <screeeny> its suprisingly big already!
12:25 < bridge> <teero777> I was almost parralel to the window so no leak
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i get vegan. but whats that suppose to do with ddnet
12:25 < bridge> <teero777> meat-client coming soon™️
12:25 < bridge> <screeeny> Not much, we are just a subcommunity that gets along well
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i have 0% activists blood in me. so i guess i'm the wrong person for this stuff
12:25 < bridge> <screeeny> Last month we had a cooking contest
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd prefer if machines cook for me xd
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im not serious btw, but the thought of vegan ppl only play online video games with vegans is kinda funny
12:26 < bridge> <teero777> Drinking blood wasn't on the table anyways  🤷‍♂️
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> So you have a wife?
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that was evil
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> jk please don't cancel me zd
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xddd
12:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wait if the vegan ddnet community is big already. did i miss the lgbtq ddnet discord cuz why am i not invited
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah right u gay right?
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or did i have that in wrong memory xdd
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
12:31 < bridge> <screeeny> we are just 10 vegans+ a few others, not sure if that counts as big^^ :ddnet_lgbt: discord sounds great too
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @screeeny are you lgbt + vegan?
12:32 < bridge> <screeeny> Yea but i wouldnt want to moderate a server for either
12:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> me neither
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @screeeny biggest hipster, even more than me :saddo:

12:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> kinda ye lmao
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly its just old southern chinese allyways, a lot of early immigrants are from the southern regions
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169963557622911076/IMG_20231103_193716.jpg?ex=65575079&is=6544db79&hm=10f0d75ed3b074a3185d8098646fe32759e8a8b861c83130f27f020a11ecbf36&
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> got the gates and everything
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r all these motorized bikes, eletric?
12:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> china is so cool xd
12:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean nobody can afford a car probably
12:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i cant
12:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but here they drive the same thing, but with unfiltered fuel-motors
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and they smell so hard
12:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean we have motor bikers
12:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too
12:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or do people just roam daily in motorbikes
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no no i meant these scooters
12:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also electric bikes are cool and all
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no "real" motor bikes
12:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but they do explode a lot when you have this many available
12:41 < bridge> <teero777> yeet
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf, but must be bad production
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e-bikes as in bicycle with motors are extremly common here too
12:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> these are banned in all elevators and bike storages
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i never heard of them exploding xD
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so people just park them by the street now
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh they do
12:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> quite often too
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but like wtf.. what are they doing to the battery
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not like batteries just explode for fun
12:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its probably too easily puncturned idk
12:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or maybe some one really like to have the exploded ones be covered in media
12:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think its just the shear amount of them. fault rate is probably not that high
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> how do u get protein
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> or are u a stick
12:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> beans
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i also often underestimate how many ppl live in china
12:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169966068064845945/IMG_20231103_194713.jpg?ex=655752cf&is=6544ddcf&hm=9f038f73daf4688850b8a9526ccc2db4da6dead56408c41a33b2a12bcd4989f6&
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> this gives off china vibes totally
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are many ways to get proteins. beans usually have high protein rate for example
12:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> check morn photos above
12:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> more*
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> proteins have different aminoacids tho iirc
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Foods that contain all nine essential amino acids are called complete proteins. These foods include beef, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, quinoa and buckwheat. Foods that contain some but not all the essential amino acids are called incomplete proteins. These foods include nuts, seeds, beans and some grains.
12:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sounds like a rust lover and meat enjoyer
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know the truth, if uwant lots of protein u need meat
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well what do you want them for?
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if u go to gym for example
12:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gym
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> muscle growth
12:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this guy
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also eat plant based protein bars
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are also vegan body builders so what
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> besides that i am not interested into building muscles i don't need
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly all of my gym friends eat meat like crazy tho
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure all that is more expensive anyway
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more important are proteins for your brain
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> a fit body helps having a stable mind
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but all of them hated coming back to chiha
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah wow. bcs the EU subs meat like crazy
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but all of them hated coming back to china
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the real price of meat is always higher
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> meat wastes so much land, u cannot even imagine it
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> eu, china, usa all are pro meat
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> idc many things waste land
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im gonna enjoy my meat
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> that sounds bad xd
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, try not to pick this fight
12:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we just dont have cheap and quality beef here in china
12:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i dont think anyone are stopping you
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly you don't want to hear the truth anyway
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i think i already know the truth, i have vegan friends with their videos
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just dont care
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but a common meat eater needs 2km² land. a vegan needs around 400m²
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now walk this distance and you get a feeling
12:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "their videos"
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u mean killing animals
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, we got enough space
12:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean he did say he doesn't care
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes that's something you'd not do too
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u are just happy someone else does it for u
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes i am
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
12:53 < bridge> <teero777> usually I use a optimal packing of cows/chickens so I only use like 20m3
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> with rust u can optimize it more
12:54 < bridge> <teero777> true maybe I should upgrade my farm to rust
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u legit have a farm
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw we got more than enough space on earth, itsj ust that we flock and concentrate on urban zones
12:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a third of my living are farmers
12:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a third of my living families are farmers
12:54 < bridge> <teero777> Base was written in C few years ago but sometimes it's a little messy
12:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese high profile farmers do be rich tho.
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's biggest bullshit i've ever heard
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> no it isnt
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> Sadly not but it would be cool ig
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we destroy the brazil forest for soja beans bro
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u think humans eat these?
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> how is this related to my sentence
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> remember that most ppl are still eating almost no meat
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw soja beans are not meat
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's only european, us and slowly chinese ppl
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> In Sweden you find a single house every 30km in non urban areas
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bra.. it's food for animals
12:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @jupeyy_keks i think hes just trolling.
12:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not xD
12:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean you guys are kids tho
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's also about how good the earth is for agriculture
12:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im glad im a 23y old kid
12:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i learnt that caring about stuff u cant control is only bad for ur mental health
12:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i only care about stuff that affects me directly
12:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i know how old you are, you keep telling me your age
12:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
12:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
12:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw i managed to get home
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if i agree with that. you gotta accept that you don't need meat to survive
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or be healthy
12:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i think i need to have a lie down
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> Ohhh are we doing the veganism thing? Who is on what side? I missed the start
12:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> sure, i agree with that, but enjoying stuff is part of living, and it helps with ur joy
12:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think he does. specifically him tho
12:58 < bridge> <teero777> xd don't sleep on the sidewalk
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, that's why we use rust bro
12:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i got home
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i think my legs are not working
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie is ur neighbourhood dangerous
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> im making rice in a rice cooker
12:59 < bridge> <teero777> rewrite in rust
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me food is generally not too important. and i think vegan stuff nowadays taste insanely well in a sense of diversity.. when i started being hipster. all these vegan shit didnt even exist xDD
12:59 < bridge> <teero777> rust provides safety for your legs
12:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i did climb 9 sets of stairs
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk, when i went to tokyo i tasted some meat that was soooooooooo good
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> and other stuff
13:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but usually im not this exhausted for 9th floor
13:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
13:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe im over thinking it
13:00 < bridge> <teero777> what was the step height? Xd
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's probably not the meat, but what is around it
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also ate puffer fish :justatest:
13:00 < bridge> <teero777> Height per step
13:00 < bridge> <teero777> yummy
13:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im here
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just dont like how i just recovered from serious coughings to constant exaustions now
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the world is burning
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is it a high end restaurant if the servers use a kimono?
13:01 < bridge> <teero777> it's true that seasoning does most of the stuff but the Konsistenz of the meat is the good thing about it
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> There is very tasty vegan food, there is very tasty meat. Tf you mean? Most things aren't tasty on their own what's around it and how it's prepared is important
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well it was small plates
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Learath be like how many conversations are going on in here rn
13:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its actually kinda cold where i am now
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> Not a definitive thing, but it's more likely from what I've observed
13:02 < bridge> <teero777> how cold
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> the meati s what gives most taste
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i specially like meat where the inside is red and with a bit of blood going out
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmmm
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also never said meat doesn't taste well. all i said is, that you are not missing out nowadays.. in the past i could have accepted this argument more than today
13:02 < bridge> <teero777> Not the seasoning? Have you ever eaten meat without any seasoning?
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's the animal fat. It's so insanely flavourful, that's the biggest challange with cooking vegan and vegetarian food. Atleast for me
13:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169969961565949993/image0.jpg?ex=6557566f&is=6544e16f&hm=538897402cb063d243d6420b724f329da2b68bbd5c2fdb26e35819b39c2e1076&
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always season, but i tasted different meats and flavour changes drastically
13:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> celsius
13:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think
13:03 < bridge> <teero777> yea odc
13:03 < bridge> <teero777> yea ofc
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stop being europe and say farenheit xdd
13:03 < bridge> <teero777> ah you're having it pretty warm I see
13:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @learath2 btw we were talking me about worrying about long covid, and that we had a vegan ddnet server and then im gay and then ryozuki showed up. now you all caught up :kek: :kek: :kek:
13:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you guys would cry if i did that
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 🇪🇺 🇪🇺 🇪🇺
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> eu chat
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> You are missing out on exactly one massive food group. It's just that there are other options now that are decent
13:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> uh yeah. why do you think i used celsius
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> duck meat is nice
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169970431009230918/RDT_20231017_1038315228188648795359444.jpg?ex=655756df&is=6544e1df&hm=30b839ee98cc77fad3339a4248749f47a40dbea3d64fc4c582fab206378ad0f6&
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> Vegan ddnet server? What do you do? Talk about meat alternatives while playing gores? 😄
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but let's be honest. most ppl buy the shittiest cheap meat.. they don't even notice the difference between chicken nuggest and vegan alternative
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs it's not about the chicken but what is around it
13:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not mine, just someone said that
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u eat really good meat, it's probably very expensive
13:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why gores tho
13:05 < bridge> <teero777> And it's pretty good ;)
13:05 < bridge> <screeeny> we have cooking competitions and make fun of Ryozuki
13:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> reddit moment
13:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> im probs gonna go to argentina for work 1 week, and its said they have good meat there
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> While it has gotten stupid good. I can still definitely tell a vegan substitute of chicken. There is one very successful fake meat and that's what beyond accomplished
13:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> can i sign up for the later part even tho im not vegan?
13:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
13:06 < bridge> <teero777> Imposter
13:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> But honestly, I much much prefer actual vegetarian/vegan food rather than attempted imitations of meat
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> amogus is out of date
13:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> r/angryupvote
13:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @learath2 i do need your thoughts on long covid tho. please tell me you dont believe in it and im just lazy
13:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no it isnt
13:08 < bridge> <teero777> stop thinking of time
13:08 < bridge> <teero777> time is useless
13:08 < bridge> <teero777> until sometime it gets useful
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, not something I researched very well but I don't see a reason such a thing wouldn't be real
13:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> burh
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Why do you think you are suffering from it?
13:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway i haven't eaten meat since my teenages. I absolutely don't miss it. I also don't remember the taste of it anyway it's been over 13 years.
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Many ppl only eat sweet or salty
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet u never eaten 100% chocolate
13:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i had serious coughing at the end of september
13:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> recovered during mid october
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> I have, it's awful 😄
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are so many tastes
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> See, i like it
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's about getting used to stuff
13:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> now i basically cant walk after 7pm
13:09 < bridge> <teero777> chocolate is nice. 💕
13:10 < bridge> <learath2> Well you can also get used to eating sawdust. Imo it's not about getting used to but it's about enjoying ones meals. But I live for food rather than eat to live, so idk
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On the other hand i really dislike sweet chocolate
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My point is more about being open for new tastes
13:10 < bridge> <teero777> What are you whattfuck is wrong with U?!
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> For me the sweet spot for chocolate seems to be around 70%, and not very sweet
13:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it wasn't too bad this monday, but im getting increasingly exhausted. and yesterday i fell asleep at 8pm can couldnt really move until 8am this morning even tho i woke up like two times
13:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it wasn't too bad this monday, but im getting increasingly exhausted. and yesterday i fell asleep at 8pm and couldnt really move until 8am this morning even tho i woke up like two times
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Trust me. If u dont eat sweet stuff for a longer time u start to notice how f king over sweet all stuff is
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But u cannot judge about it other than me
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Who tried both
13:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i love sweet stuff..
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> But how can you say that when you aren't open to a new taste? If your position was moral or ecological I'd understand it but this seems rather odd
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> coffee without sugar
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I ate it. I don't miss it
13:12 < bridge> <teero777> Do you like icecream?
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought i just didn't had enough sleep. but i've been having 10hrs+ sleep for the past two weeks
13:12 < bridge> <teero777> Just vanille
13:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Tea without sugar. It was such a bizarre experience for me having sugar in tea after a decade
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe u need to eat other stuff
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My point never was about taste. My point was about wasting land.. especially with the amount of meat
13:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like meat?
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Most ppl eat every day
13:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Just one cube and it felt like drinking syrup
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm maybe carbs
13:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh i tried
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> do chinese eat pasta
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> like italian pasta
13:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive been increasing my breakfast orders for the past two days
13:13 < bridge> <teero777> A little honey is good for me ig
13:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169972767177834527/IMG_20231103_083921.jpg?ex=6557590c&is=6544e40c&hm=99c940bc9c4e01c72a1237bd7ffbd7de11632756cacb0e5dd5a3105fe8f19c80&
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Well no one complains about the metric fuckton of water that goes to avocado farming. As with most things the answer probably lies somewhere inbetween the extremes
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like avocados
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use them on my salad
13:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is my breakfast today, i dont normally order this much carbs
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> That looks enjoyable, what is it? Some sort of jianbing?
13:14 < bridge> <teero777> I'm out bb
13:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> jianbing and porridge
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Very chinese 😄
13:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i dont think what i had this breakfast was the point lmao
13:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Im germany id say the opposite is true
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ppl care a lot bout such stuff
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> I had a very chinese breakfast a couple weeks ago. Youtiao and congee
13:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> anyway, good luck on the vegan talk. i really need some rest now
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lat least under those who care
13:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think looking at the chat here just made me more sleepy
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Atleast under those who care
13:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> Another one is organic vs industrialized farming. Organic farming wastes much more land but many vegans and vegetarians seem to show a bias towards organic
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Organic meat or vegetables?
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> Veggies
13:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't really notice. is learath2 antivegan too
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How much more% is that?
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> But similar for meat too, the worst kind of meat is probably the most land efficient
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet eating no meat is already buffer enough
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And the animals having the shittiest life possible?
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> Does it matter? Point is that there is a percentage below which the extra is acceptable to you. Balance is key
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And having paid mass murders?
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly. So land use isn't the only important factor
13:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> iirc pork is not too bad for the environment compare to beef. chinese mostly eat porks i think.
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it's simply out of league
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Meat from a laboratory is much better
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> I love vegan food as much as I love other food. I'm just not on a moral mission
13:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also we dont really have vegans here
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> In land use sure. In taste it doesn't even come close
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So why do you try to tell me that i have to accept meat then?
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ur 100% on a moral mission
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U try to tell me I should accept ur flawed facts
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So u feel nice about eating meat
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> I actually don't care what you eat. I'm just curious on what your position is
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't care until someone tries to tell me that they are on the high ground
13:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did he tho
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This world is already a trash place for many reasons
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> I never said I was
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Independent of meat
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Somewhere one has to start
13:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i dont think meat taste nice was a high ground to stand
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least that is my personal motivation
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> I'm morally abhorrent compared to any serious vegan/vegetarian. For me my morals are less important than the yummy yummies in my tummy
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo aggressively told me I'm a stick for the soul reason I'm not eating meat
13:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> to be fair you do taste with your tounge, not your tummy
13:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i know that, but i dont like you attacking learath
13:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fuck ryo tho
13:23 < bridge> <learath2> At some point lab meat will be good enough to replace real meat. Then I'll also switch because that's the right thing to do
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i like Learath so much that i dont like you think he's being aggressive
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> Until then I just eat less of it because I care somewhat about the world and the future. Just not enough to strip one of the few joys I have
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also im gay
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thats unrelated thi
13:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thats unrelated tho
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> I am not, but we are all human
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> Thanks for coming to my ted talk
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes and that's already smth that imo is good enough. Being open for future solutions
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But trust me i know lot ppl that would not be open for this
13:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think we know that
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They say that meat from lab is not "natural"
13:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its not that hard so tell just by scrolling up a bit
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure we can convince them when the lab produces 10 cent Kobe beef
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then i tell them. have u ever looked how your fucking pig lived before it died
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf is natural about that xd
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep. it's sadly always about the price
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh right we have beyond meat in china
13:26 < bridge> <learath2> I'm willing to pay a premium to be more ecofriendly but that is a privilege I have and it's limited to some value
13:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just found that out a few months ago
13:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too bad i dont cook tho
13:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im considering buying some for my mom and see what she thinks about thek
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol not aggresive xd i just asked
13:27 < bridge> <learath2> Beyond burgers are actually not bad, but very sodium filled

13:30 < bridge> <learath2> The only bad part about sleeping at 2000 is that you wake up so early. I usually push through to atleast 2200

13:41 < bridge> <learath2> Inb4 he forgets to check back in and an ambulance wakes him up
13:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thats probably for the best
13:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i did got my package
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning

13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s dark out for me too
13:45 < bridge> <learath2> Tactically

13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> are you going to prison
13:53 < bridge> <learath2> Communist china moment
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> voluntary prison
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf :feelsbadman:
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169982934581776464/image.png?ex=65576284&is=6544ed84&hm=74ca39b4721b09cd6308ce007ac9189a9bbabe552727e86a7136a66d2bd63298&
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think prisons would have elevators if they build 10 stories high prisons
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which means prisoners probably lives better than i do
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i honestly have no idea what chinese prison looks like
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i assume us prisons would looks like those in movies but maybe i'm just wrong
13:59 < bridge> <learath2> I saw some people post from chinese prisons from when some were repurposed for covid isolation. They looked meh
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but we do still have death sentences which you get shot in the head tho
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> usa prisons are probably mostly accurate to movies in the way the prison is laid out
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok nevermind about living better than me then
14:00 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if highrise prisons are even a thing 😄
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1169984536516505632/images.png?ex=65576402&is=6544ef02&hm=e85e5372d628d0999e82eaa70ef6a11554375d771b3716ae4aaeb44f9a8b3cbe&
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh bruh
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is literally all chinese dorms looks like. highschoolers and colleage students lives like this
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> exactly
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i still remember that we have to make our bed like that exactly or we get score deducted
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> luckily i had mental breakdowns in dorms so they kicked me out so i can stay at home with my mom.
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably is in some european countries where they are really really nice to prisoners
14:05 < bridge> <Ewan> white collar prisons exist everywhere
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think most of my highschool teachers except one thinks i'm mentally challenged
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> to be fair i probably am
14:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I remember that my elementary school teacher warned my mother that she should keep me away from computers because it seems to be hindering my grades
14:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: and my mom never did
14:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my mom was like "I think you should try to learn programming" then I did
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm trying so hard to stay awake lmao
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> w mom
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i am indeed the kid who does nothing but talking to his computer tho
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Man serious question. How do u fap there
14:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like in highschool?
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah in these bed rooms
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk. actually. i was there for like two months before i get kicked out
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i'd imagine you would just do it and hope no one noticed
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually wait
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are public bathrooms tho
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what am i even thinking
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you have to do it near your bed? it is a you thing? lmao
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It must be comfortable xdd
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i think i got kick out also because i was being weird
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe bcs i was gay and i didn't know
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Poor kids
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie are you a touchy person xD
14:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
14:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually probably
14:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i've been trying to actively not touch my colleague since i started this new job which might be a weird thing to say
14:27 < bridge> <teero777> how hard could it be? xd
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
14:28 < bridge> <teero777> https://tenor.com/view/harvest-cpu-tech-technology-computer-gif-22646316
14:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that hard really. it's just that i didn't really notice that I do it so often before lol
14:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i like to put my hands on someone's shoulder before talking to them i think
14:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you a guy btw
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> please spare me
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> i beg you
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no i just have a question. if you in middle school or high school have the chance to touch female classmates like you would interact with your bros normally and it wouldn't seem weird to do it, would you.
14:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> nah im a computer scientist i dont touch wome
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> nah im a computer scientist i dont touch women
14:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> fair enough then
14:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then i guess i am indeed weird
14:41 < bridge> <Ewan> fred u wanna play some ddrace
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm so tired

14:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't really play teeworlds anymore
14:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yea

17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> interesting artifact for such an issue
17:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it is 100% a hardware issue but dang. this feels nice now
