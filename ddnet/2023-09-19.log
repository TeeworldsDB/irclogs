00:16 < bridge> <deen> What gcc version are you using? Maybe it's too old
00:19 < bridge> <mazty> emm
00:19 < bridge> <mazty> idk
00:19 < bridge> <mazty> i just put "sudo apt install mingw-w64"
00:20 < bridge> <mazty> capybara@zombie10:~$ gcc --version

01:18 < bridge> <Ewan> you‚Äôd need to use your x-compile gcc, it‚Äôs a different compiler
07:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
07:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> its gentoo tuesday
08:25 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, seems it‚Äôs debian trixie, should have gcc12 in mingw, I think that‚Äôs new enough
08:26 < bridge> <learath2> You are missing the rust target, so get that one, see if some of the errors clean up, also show your cmake command and it‚Äôs output
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> me every morning

17:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :gigachad:
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> kek im reinstalling arch now.
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> ive decided to try hyprland
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> You don't have the windows target for rust
17:24 < bridge> <headshotnoby> voxuis rushing to install windows 11 on an old pentium 4 that's running linux:
17:25 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :justatest:
17:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> false
17:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i would never use windows 11
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> accepting that linux is better than win11 is the first step into the right direction
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm proud
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 #7205 did u switch the backend to vulkan, i see that the default changed
17:38 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7205
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean for v 16.6
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also with "memory" u mean system memory?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or VRAM?
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Good call, it also happens on 16.6 with Vulkan backend
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> So it seem like a leak in Vulkan
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean system memory
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Or whatever task manager shows I guess
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i try to reproduce, i hope it's nothing special xd
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> im not in mood to fix stuff xd
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u run valgrind?
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> no, I didn't do much testing yet
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I tried to reproduce the crash but maybe it only happens in release :/
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Or only very rarely
17:42 < bridge> <headshotnoby> voxuis rushing to install windows 10 on an old pentium 4 that's running linux:
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the killmsg bug seams unrelated
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to me
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .. how can a memory leak cause UB?
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even rust allows memory leaks üòÇ
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> The random kill messages are very strange, yes
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> But it does look like it happens only after you reload the skins a bunch of times
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> such beatiful UI üòÇ
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1153719939170054296/image.png
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no direct memory leak, so that's gotta be annoying to debug xd
17:54 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ```cpp
17:54 < bridge> <headshotnoby> char aBuff[256];
17:54 < bridge> <headshotnoby> str_format(aBuff, std::size(aBuff), "%s [%d/%d]", CompCounter == 40 ? Localize("Why are you slowmo replaying to read this?") : Localize("Initializing components"), (CompCounter + 1), (int)ComponentCount());```
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> trolldeen
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> found smth
18:13 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hey
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but won't test if this fixes the killmsg stuff
18:13 < bridge> <cyberFighter> im on ddnet steam nightlies but the version in the top right of f1 says 17.2.1
18:14 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i see the slowmo message like every single time i open the game up
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it's known
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but thanks for report
20:03 < bridge> <robyt3> gperftools couldn't find any more relevant leaks either on strict setting, except a few KB leaked in libraries
20:03 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1153753209458917406/tmp.png
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> Well, good thing i bypass most of these with physical fault injection
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> But you suspect there is a leak somewhere?
20:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Not really, just wanted to see if this finds more than UBSan
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> On "draconic" setting it shows a few globals that are technically not freed, like the loggers
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> valgrind finds these too
21:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> just had a bug where if i tried selecting text in the console it would select everything from the start of the page up to where i was trying to select
21:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> and it fixed itself after i went up by like 60 pages lol
21:09 < bridge> <teero777> btw has anyone tried hyprland yet?
21:09 < bridge> <teero777> gonna try now along with a reinstall.
21:13 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> It's pretty nice, only had an issue with DDNet where it wouldn't capture mouse events until I opened f1. Really weird.
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> k cool :brownbear:
