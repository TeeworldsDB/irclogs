00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> Is there a name for the style of UI element manament by splitting lots of rectangles that ddnet uses, or is it a custom idea?
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> Is there a name for the style of UI element management by splitting lots of rectangles that ddnet uses, or is it a custom idea?
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> What alternative way is there?
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> It seems natural to me when you have a large rectangle to fill, that you split it into smaller rectangles
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> immediate mode gui
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> AH
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> imgui
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i documented them explicitly
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> WHEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://codedoc.ddnet.tw/classCUIRect.html
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read the text
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> fuck me baby
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the source files
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> question, but how does the order of things work with these functions? isn't there something like position: absolute on css?
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> question, but how does the order of things work with these ui functions? isn't there something like position: absolute on css?
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think everything starts with a CUIRect that defined the screen size
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the CUI has a method
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to get that rect
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but usually u start from another rect
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g in the settings there is a rect already
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should check how other code does stuff
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think everything starts with a CUIRect that defines the screen size
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> yes im trying to study this shit xd
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> according to you when doing MainView.HSplitBottom (30.0f, 0, 0); what effect the MainView should have
00:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I think it does nothing
01:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the main MainView  stays the same
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it modifies the 2 rects u pass it
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969735176303288351/unknown.png
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the italic "this" means the MainView in this case
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggers
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Got to fix linking
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Has anyone ever attempted to create a system similarily to tee skins to feed custom game skins to other players aswell? Not quite sure what you call this ^^
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> basically this:
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969742169621544960/unknown.png
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yes like skin download but for gameskins
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i know its been requested a bit in the past
02:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> gif instead of png were requested too
02:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> see i WANTED that do be an idea
02:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> but i was told it'd not only affect the loading time by a LOT, it wouldnt be very efficient with the code
02:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Smetanolub gif request means request for animations, probably?
03:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> yeah
03:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> do gifs even WORK in game-engine environments?
08:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how come mingw is not outdated? custom version?
08:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw ever tried clang with mingw? ðŸ˜„

08:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/tpoechtrager/wclang
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gifs arent really nice for games, since they are frame capped
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also if u dont do custom gifs they usually have bad quality
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and if u do custom ones, u can also use a better format ðŸ˜„
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you can manually put a bunch of images in a map
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> and then use envelopes
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea place each frame manually and then use alpha envelopes to show and hide them.I created this messy animation using this technique. Also used ddnet Sounds Feature.https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/video.php?t=cod_montage.mp4&u=chiller
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf xD
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> too slow
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the rick astley map is better

09:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chillerdragon ur github bot always mentions my prs
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES3_Sus:
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> chill ur changes then :p
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i find it stupid that github shows the link on the linked site too anyway
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i understand its nice to have on the site where the link is posted
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> yea i also feel a bit intrusive spamming those links
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> @c0d3d3v this was used to cheat parts
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> https://ddnet.tw/news/swap-cheat/
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> mingw updates with each gcc version
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but why is mingw c++17 ready while the gcc libstdc++ isnt
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because I use debian 9 for windows builds, but arch linux for windows
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok ðŸ˜„
10:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I'm updating to debian 10 now, because libc++7 doesn't support static linking yet, was only added recently: https://reviews.llvm.org/D96070
10:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (fails silently, noticed while testing the executable)
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ðŸ˜„
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Someone enlighten me what pr #5049 does
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5049
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> doesn't it reintroduce the exploit we removed?
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe it holds the hook on the swapped tee
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> instead of on the same tee just swapped
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tee swapping is too complicated anyway, just swap the network slot
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and rename etc
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 100% 0 bugs
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in worst case wrongly named tee
11:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Does anyone know why I get `[2022-04-30 11:21:01][net]: can't send ipv4 traffic to this socket` when connecting to a server with a second client?
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> set a port?
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> over f1 command
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cl_*port
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> oh right, I did set a custom port
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> theres still potential to cheat though :thonk:
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> I'm getting major brain damage just thinking about swap
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes bcs its too complicated thinking about side effects
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that what i mean
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao, when your paths are completly fucked up and logitech gaming framework uses a file from mingw xD
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so annoying that u cannot upgrade on windows while files are in use XD
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969896085025878027/unknown.png
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> There are other problems with this though. Rcon auth, /c whispers for example
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rcon ok
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest is not as critical as cheating in maps
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Secret whispers might be more important to some players
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but its not like we dont write it with that in mind
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> question is, are there as many edge cases as using the save-load mecanism that is designed for teams not individual tees and having to add edge cases all the time
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD does someone also get two joined team messages on nightly server?
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969909360966918164/unknown.png
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xdd
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> never update server xddd
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is it client bug
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then never update client xdd
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> also get it twice without a dummy
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe the new logging can cause this?
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i cant think of any bigger commit lately
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think messages like the following in the terminal are also from the new logging:
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> [2022-04-30 12:19:41][console]: Command 'sv_show_others' cannot be executed from a map.
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at least I think I have not seen this before
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969910145985441792/unknown.png
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best is u create an issue
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its not lost
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what I actually was going to test, was if you get the swap messages of team 0 only in team 0 ðŸ˜„ And I ended up seeing two joining messages xD
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I do not think its a client bug, then I would also get the messages on the official servers
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> lol I thought you can only use  Up, Right left and so on only on test server. But default moderators and helpers can it too o.O
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is probably a result of the logging unification
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Things printed on the console only are now also printed on the terminal and vice versa
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on test servers
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> helpers can use it
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but everyone is a helper
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on test
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> hey, why when you create a new tab, if you restart the client, it opens the one right above it? is there anything else to do?
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the client is above a browser tab?
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i actually made the client always start at the center of the screen, dunno if it was changed again
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> well, i'm not sure we're talking about the same thing, im probably not clear, here is a video : https://streamable.com/1tnj65
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> im talking about these tabs, so i basically created another tab, but when i restart the client it open the assets instead of the test one
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah lol
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a new settings page xD
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> ye x)
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> mb
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i assume its clamped somewhere
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me see
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> UiSettingsPage, ui_settings_page, 0, 0, 9, C
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe make it 10
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> isntead of 9
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in variables.h
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> yup thanks, it was quit easy xd
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <wlimpie> hey, quick question: can you change the defealt_zoom to be a bit more zoomed out? if so, with what command? :D

17:29 <+ChillerDragon> is there some public data wether ddnet servers are under ddos or not? Sometimes im curious if its maybe my net or the server and then if its like ddos or something else
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> i guess there is https://ddnet.tw/status/
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> $ddos
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> $ddos
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt work
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> there is something going on on fra (5.196.8.244:8298)
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> but i can not see it in the status
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> @louis i assume $ddos is some discord feature? can you send me the output for the ip i sent?
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ChillerDragon: it is a discord feature, the bot says FRA seems fine
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> wetfek
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> its not -.-
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> it compares incoming and outgoing packet rate
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> idk maybe its not even ddos but something is up here!
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is it possible to render demos on linux?

22:03 <+irc_tester> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5033
22:03 <+irc_tester> Encryption is being added to DDNet?
22:03 <+irc_tester> Can I ask why?
22:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> to make some ransomware
22:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> maybe to make it possible to add some account stuff and crypto to prevent more ddos
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> for bitcoin mining obviously
22:20 <+irc_tester> ...
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then add key pair for encrypted chat, that only the users can read not even the server ðŸ˜„
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs chat should finally be encrypted
22:23 <+irc_tester> Sure, but is it really necessary? I mean I don't think anyone would care if someone reads their chats in a video game, especially public servers.
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what speaks against adding it tho
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean u dont have to do it ^^
22:27 <+irc_tester> Idk dealing with spams? Using extra resourses for encryption?
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u could still make the length of the message identifiable
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also the extra resources won't fall into account really
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not like u chat every game tick
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also i was actually more talking about whispering
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not the public chat
22:33 <+irc_tester> Oh, makes sense
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw edg-l is me
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: Yes, there was a DoS attack, the hoster tried blocking it and probably (as always) blocked legitimate packets too
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this would require some kind of DH-Key Exchange... just jump over this step and implement the signal protocol
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I'm sure you mean this as a joke. There is no real reason to encrypt ddnet chat xD but we could use some kind of DTLS to encrypt the complete ddnet communication to stop mitm attacks xD
