01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga I tried to use shader storage buffers now for tile rendering (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/pull/113).
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now ddnet-rs is actually competitive against twgpu with VRAM usage, and it doesn't seem to suffer performance wise.
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. on arctic festival it beats twgpu now.
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Considering it also allocates more textures (for tees etc.) it probably beats it by an even bigger margin.
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (Also added ddnet as comparision)
01:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't want to lie, I am bit surprised normal ddnet is so low, I'd have thought the difference is more around 4x, since I now only save the data of one vertex instead of 4x, but don't want to investigate rn, maybe tomorrow üòÑ

02:28 < bridge_> <patiga> great job! I thought I was using textures and not storage buffers (also for envelope values) for some wgpu platform compatibility. however I can't find where they wouldn't be supported (on phone rn tho), maybe webgl?
07:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
07:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> good morning üòÑ
08:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes you do, i recommended storage buffers to you once because of the texture size limits. Sadly they are opengl 4.3, so maybe unsupported by webgl indeed
08:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But one disadvantage is that there is no u8 and u16. So you would need to manually unpack the data if you don't want to waste space
12:28 < bridge_> <Assa> good morning ü•¥ üçª
12:33 < bridge_> <smetanolub> is there a way to add friendly_clan? to highlight it with different color in tab
12:33 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I think tater client can do it
12:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> why ddnet isnt adding cool features but other clients do?
12:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> like, show only empty servers is very easy to make, we need it
12:35 < bridge_> <smetanolub> friendly clans? wars/dodge lists as a friend list?
12:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have you ever opened a game and have 3000 filters on the filter page?
12:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No? Because it was not ddnet
12:35 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> mad
12:35 < bridge_> <smetanolub> just add 1 box of "only empty servers" bro
12:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sort by plaeyrs
12:36 < bridge_> <smetanolub> meh need to scroll
12:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can change the sort in both directions
12:36 < bridge_> <smetanolub> how?
12:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just click the column header again
12:37 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i can only make it show with players sorted by ping
12:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just click players so often until 0/63 is on top xD
12:37 < bridge_> <smetanolub> they are not sorted by ping
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can filter regions
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> XD
12:38 < bridge_> <smetanolub> why need that everytime i search empty ones
12:38 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> clan wars when
12:38 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i play all servers with any ping
12:38 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> matchmaking in ddnet when
12:48 < bridge_> <jxsl13> when we get 300 active devs and 5+ million concurrent players
12:52 < bridge_> <Assa> Does an UI like this look okay? Or would you make it smaller?

12:52 < bridge_> <Assa> Backend: :happy: UI: :tear:
12:53 < bridge_> <Assa> idk I'd move it together, at least vertically
13:00 < bridge_> <Assa> I think like this it looks fine :owo: UI with UI taste

13:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> I meant a similar size as this popup

13:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> Also buttons should be positioned consistently like this
13:43 < bridge_> <Assa> I mean I have it consistently placed left and right with Go and Cancel
13:43 < bridge_> <Assa> I think this looks good now :3

13:43 < bridge_> <melo∆û> when buttons same as the one roby sent <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
13:44 < bridge_> <melo∆û> consistency is key in a good UI
13:44 < bridge_> <Assa> when guide to UI?
13:44 < bridge_> <Assa> like I am fighting against it
13:44 < bridge_> <melo∆û> just check how the other popup places the buttonis
13:45 < bridge_> <Assa> I did, but I don't get it, because the default View object it gets doesn't have screen size already ü´†
13:45 < bridge_> <melo∆û> xD - let me see if i can explain it in like ~20 mins
13:45 < bridge_> <melo∆û> warframing rn
13:45 < bridge_> <-StormAx> :Farmm:
13:46 < bridge_> <Assa> additionally, popups are not always centered
13:53 < bridge_> <melo∆û> they aren't ?
13:53 < bridge_> <Assa> for example error popups are at the mouse position
13:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ah you mean the DialogError thingies - true.

13:58 < bridge_> <Assa> If you want to help me üò¶
13:58 < bridge_> <Assa> maybe the way I already create this popup is ... scuffed xD

14:14 < bridge_> <melo∆û> hackiest solution i could do in like 5 minutes

14:15 < bridge_> <Assa> looks almost the same xD
14:15 < bridge_> <melo∆û> but yeah i dont really know why you didnt just use PopUp and increase its .h and .w to fit <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
14:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> That's not necessarily good UX though, as least for large popups like this. Probably also done for convenience in some places

14:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> The popup menu functions will create and draw the popup menu background for you, you don't do UI from a callback function. You should only have to specify the position and size of the popup when opening it.

15:53 < ChillerDragon> does someone want to give a tutorial on how to iterate utf8 strings?
15:54 < ChillerDragon> lets say i want to count the amount of poop emojis in a chat message
15:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (you dont need to be utf8 savy for that)
15:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (you can just look for üí© )
15:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (you can just look for the bytes üí© )
15:55 < ChillerDragon> right
15:56 < ChillerDragon> the utf8 iteration seems to be happening in str_utf8_tolower but i struggle to wrap my head around https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d3ec3e0ac0adc9dafbd0da07737664d1e28e0c00/src/base/system.cpp#L3789-L3805
15:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> `str_utf8_decode(&input)` iterates the input by the number of bytes and returns an int (4 bytes, max utf-8 length)
15:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> then `while(*input)` checks for null
15:58 < ChillerDragon> thanks sollygpt
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ur welcome coldgpt
15:59 < ChillerDragon> how can i print every code point then
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i was just writing that
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but i assumed u would..
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> while(*input)
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> {
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   const int code = str_utf8_decode(&input);
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   printf("%d\n", code);
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> }
15:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:59 < ChillerDragon> ye but thats a number
16:00 < ChillerDragon> can i print it as const char* str?
16:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess u can do jank unsafe stuff
16:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait no chars[] arent padded ever its safe
16:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or well defined behaviour
16:00 < ChillerDragon> encode maybe
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> int code;
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> char str[5] = {};

16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> printf("%s\n", str);
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or str_cpy will null terminate it for you
16:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i was thinking casting to char[4]
16:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but that is unneeded
16:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> \`\`test\`\`
16:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or str_cpy will null terminate it for you

16:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> const int CharSize = str_utf8_encode(aChar, Code);

16:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> printf("char='%s'\n", aChar);
16:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ```
16:04 < bridge_> <Assa> ?? this loop looks very wrong to me
16:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> its the same as the one in tolower
16:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> this is what i needed and it works wonderfully, thanks solly
16:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> minus the `str_utf8_tolower_codepoint`
16:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> wrapped in a `while(*pUtf8Input) {}`
16:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> str_utf8_encode does some black magic
16:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought codepoints were the same as the bytes
16:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Well, it's UTF-8 encoded
16:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Codepoint (int) --> 1-4 bytes of UTF-8

16:44 < bridge_> <Assa> we don't yet have the `Add rendered Tee` tool, I could write it :justatest:
16:44 < bridge_> <melo∆û> https://github.com/edg-l/teerender :cat_cracked_hehe:
16:44 < bridge_> <Assa> What I mean is creating the Tee-PNG and then loading it into the editor as pixelart as tool
16:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> :justatest:

16:45 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> when view demos whilst in game
16:45 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ><
16:45 < bridge_> <melo∆û> is that what you've been looking at for 2 hours XD
16:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> ye
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> watafak, ddnet will get livestreaming support? xd
16:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> With larger delay it could probably work with a HTTP stream üòÑ
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Demo SyncPlay
16:47 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> add prediction to demos B)
16:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> But you need to get the entire demo from the beginning initially
16:48 < bridge_> <robyt3> After that incrementally scanning for new keyframes seems cheap, at least on SSD
16:48 < bridge_> <melo∆û> @essigautomat xD
16:48 < bridge_> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366063372184846406/result.png?ex=680f9528&is=680e43a8&hm=2730c2e142caaf8ee095994364270c30e9e865fb5c0d5e57fde232604ef86d21&
16:48 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> cant the server create new "demo start points" every so often
16:49 < bridge_> <Assa> it's a bit lowres (I can select the pixelsize, so you don't need to scale down)
16:49 < bridge_> <melo∆û> thats just what Ryo's skinrenderer gave me :c
16:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> I guess it would somehow work without, but then the file operations get tricky. The demo player currently needs to scan the entire demo for keyframes first so it knows where it can seek in the demo.
16:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> damn what the hell is this game coming to
16:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> - reverse push
16:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> - quad pixels
16:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> - add health
16:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> are keyframes points where all the setup data is there
16:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> we should add a tile that kills you
16:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> Every keyframe contains a full snapshot, other demo chunks only contain deltas
16:52 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> now make something that converts svgs to quads
16:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> kk
16:53 < bridge_> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366064736936001656/screenshot_2025-04-27_16-53-04.png?ex=680f966d&is=680e44ed&hm=bfce73bccc7f5b393914dc6127d5dca50b9c97959621bbfc929a97e705265bbd&
16:53 < bridge_> <Assa> Easy, simply add SVG support to the game, I'll do the rest
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i meant that the server stores the file in memory instead of... in file
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> such that it can store the header, map and all keyframes (as just rawe data) in a (linked) list
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you can set an amount of time that people can seek back (when starting to stream), and keep as many keyframes as needed for that
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i meant that the server stores the file in memory instead of... in file
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> such that it can store the header, map and all keyframes (as just rawe data as if written to filke) in a (linked) list
16:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you can set an amount of time that people can seek back (when starting to stream), and keep as many keyframes as needed for that
16:54 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> how would svgs show up on older clients tho
16:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thats the fun thing
16:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> they dont
16:55 < bridge_> <Assa> ... yeah xD
16:55 < bridge_> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366065159747141753/screenshot_2025-04-27_16-55-02.png?ex=680f96d2&is=680e4552&hm=c18cc5ff3bbe22959b733b4d07092d1000bc30e9653d17765a137826bcc1dd09&
16:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no way svg uspport is being added
16:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> unless it severly cucked actually to standard svg
16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, as long as you start slice the last 10 seconds or so correctly starting at a keyframe then it should be easy to stream demo file. header and map can be concatenated directly from the file, you don't even need anything in memory I guess
16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, as long as you slice the last 10 seconds or so correctly starting at a keyframe then it should be easy to stream demo file. header and map can be concatenated directly from the file, you don't even need anything in memory I guess
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> _standard_ :lol: 
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I feel like every SVG implementation does it's own thing xD
16:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i gues having it file backed makes no difference
16:58 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> true tbh xd
16:58 < bridge_> <robyt3> That something that external tools can do (convert SVG to quads), the client won't get SVG rendering
16:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wee wo wee eoo
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @essigautomat if you need a new project, i'd recommend you split border tiles from normal tiles during buffer creation.
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i'll add a new packed format for tiles (which will not work for borders) to save VRAM
17:00 < bridge_> <Assa> I am aware, this was a joke ^^ Technically we support every graphics tools imaginable, if it supports PNG exports
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I am kinda too lazy to split the stuff xd
17:00 < bridge_> <Assa> :justatest:  yeah, that sounds easy to do
17:01 < bridge_> <Assa> :justatest:  yeah, that sounds easy to do /s
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice üòâ
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean it's not like super hard
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just bit annoying xd
17:01 < bridge_> <Assa> I put it directly under "implement water" in my todo list
17:01 < bridge_> <Assa> it's still above the material layer :justatest:
17:02 < bridge_> <Assa> it's still above the material layer :justatest: which I should honestly just give up
17:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Create a new game wiht all these features
17:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I wanna play and see if it's fun
17:02 < bridge_> <Assa> uhm ... no comment üòâ
17:02 < bridge_> <Assa> uhm ... no comment üòâ (Warning, may contain snails)
17:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> add snail putting like fancy pants gmae
17:03 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> yooo that would be so cool
17:04 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> we need that pencil weapon too
17:04 < bridge_> <Assa> We like snails, but those pesky slugs ... üò†
17:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> new weapon snail cannon, 1 ammo by default by goes up to 10
17:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> 0.75x the size and weight of a tee, interact with it the same, except that you get knocked back (/damaged) depending on speed
17:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> can activate switches :D
17:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and rolls
17:05 < bridge_> <Assa> makes you slower
17:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> there should be a way to make tees roll
17:06 < bridge_> <Assa> new pickup: skateboard
17:06 < bridge_> <Assa> new pickup: skateboard, allows you to go fast and do cool stunts
17:07 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i always wanted tees to be able to roll down the slopes or something like that
17:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> fun fact: in Finnish the word for snail is derived from the word for home, because they carry their homes on their backs
17:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's so cartoony and cute
17:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> peak etymology
17:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> i was gonna say the slugs are probably only so mischievous because they‚Äôre homeless
17:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> Gm
17:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> das is 0.8 stuff tho D:
17:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> tees on slopes would make me very happy

17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Deflate that shit
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Go to ddnet exe directory
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Drag and drop the skin onto deflate.exe
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Sorry uh
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Dilate
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
17:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> This is not zip land
17:59 < bridge_> <canarda_04> ok I will dilate the shit
18:00 < bridge_> <canarda_04> on the folder ddnet or DDNet
18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> wherever dilate is
18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> should be right next to it
18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> im on phone drinking morning brown
18:00 < bridge_> <canarda_04> xd
18:01 < bridge_> <canarda_04> found it
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wow the client really checks for the string `password` to know if a server is password protected xD
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I did some fancy stuff by first getting server info and looking in the field there.
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But GER3 often refuses to answer my requests.
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rip
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wow the client really checks for the string `password` after the kick to know if a server is password protected xD

18:02 < bridge_> <canarda_04> hardest part is opening the exe
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> it has no gui
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> drag and drop has ‚Äúmagic‚Äù
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> it calls the executable you drag the image onto with the image path as the first argument
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> the tool will run and output silently, either the image will be next to dilate or changed in place in its original directory
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> idr
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> holy shit
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> it works
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> @mpft ily
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> (friendly way)
18:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> ily too
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> I will submit it but it might get declined
18:05 < bridge_> <canarda_04> but I think it looks cool with inverted colors

19:36 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yo dilate that shit!
19:36 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> me when I'm filling my manure-powered vehicle
19:58 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> Hello everyone, I'm looking for a German programmer üòÑ
19:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> goated username osama
20:05 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 10‚Ç¨
20:05 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> per hour?
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'd assume it's for the consultation
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> if u wanted this guy on an hourly basis
20:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> you would be paying a lot more
20:06 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ^
20:06 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:06 < bridge_> <melo∆û> one does not simply go fishing for programmers. what for even? :p
20:07 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Just like, describe the issue maybe? :)

20:07 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:07 < bridge_> <melo∆û> for 40‚Ç¨ an hour i'm willing to:
20:07 < bridge_> <melo∆û> flex with my neovim setup
20:07 < bridge_> <melo∆û> write 200 loc by hand (the other 20K are written by claude)
20:07 < bridge_> <melo∆û> write unit tests for every third line of my code
20:08 < bridge_> <melo∆û> write handsome commit messages auto generated
20:08 < bridge_> <melo∆û> tell all other people i should work with that i use nix btw
20:08 < bridge_> <Assa> for what? :justatest:
20:08 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> teeworlds game mode and servers
20:09 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> melon write me privately again in German or can we write here in German
20:09 < bridge_> <melo∆û> no and no
20:09 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:09 < bridge_> <melo∆û> as mentioned, i dont randomly do stuff for free - i do stuff for free if i'm interested in that stuff
20:09 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you want someone to work on a game mode you're really going to have to start paying by the hour
20:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sprich
20:10 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> I'm paying huh xD
20:10 < bridge_> <melo∆û> man m√∂ge die Futterluke schlie√üen Jupstar, so mag das aussprechen der Germanischen sprache in diesen R√§umen untersagt zu bleiben.
20:11 < bridge_> <melo∆û> you're like the 20th person who came in here asking for a developer to help create a mod - so my expectations are low ^^
20:11 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:12 < bridge_> <melo∆û> but no, i have enough to do in 2 communities already
20:12 < bridge_> <Assa> Dieser Kanal ist jetzt Eigentum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland
20:12 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> do it now your family will be eaten million times this summer
20:12 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> xD bro chill out now why are you shitting on me like that
20:12 < bridge_> <melo∆û> i am not.
20:14 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> If you didn't want to, you didn't have to answer.
20:14 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> considering you probably want a significant amount of work done you should clearly describe the nature of the work, the requirements, and the compensation
20:15 < bridge_> <Assa> We are actually not, you just don't know what people ask developer what to do, it's like "I have a startup idea" _Comes as the 200th person suggestion something which already exists_
20:15 < bridge_> <Assa> We are actually not, you just don't know what people ask developers what to do, it's like "I have a startup idea" _Comes as the 200th person suggestion something which already exists_
20:15 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The way I see it, if your community isn't cool enough to attract contributors naturally, you're shit outta luck when it comes to getting work done for free
20:16 < bridge_> <Assa> give us some info, and we might be interesting in your mod. Is it teeworlds 5d chess with timetravel?
20:16 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> no xD
20:16 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Ey!
20:16 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> thats my wording
20:17 < bridge_> <melo∆û> just copy f-ddrace
20:17 < bridge_> <melo∆û> trust
20:17 < bridge_> <Assa> Ey! That's my mod WIP
20:17 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Lmao
20:17 < bridge_> <Assa> Ey! That's my mod WIP (okay just joking)
20:17 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> you are really arrogant people here crazy
20:17 < bridge_> <melo∆û> lets do it!
20:17 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> what? you work on 5d chess? i actually wanted to make that with tee skins
20:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> we're just doing a little trolling.
20:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> as mentioned, hit us with more information - asking for a "german developer" is just a bad way to attract interest xD
20:18 < bridge_> <Assa> Now for a 3rd time: Give some info please, or nobody is willing to help you
20:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> oh god admin is here
20:18 < bridge_> <melo∆û> guys hide
20:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Fr you people are being mad mean
20:18 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> I specifically asked for a German developer so that I can discuss things with him in German
20:18 < bridge_> <learath2> If you are not interested, no need to speek
20:19 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> because I'm writing here with a translator the whole time
20:19 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Learn English; it's useful!
20:19 < bridge_> <osamabinballin5636> I just forgot to say that I also pay

20:21 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
20:21 < bridge_> <melo∆û> people will dm you if they're german and interested.
20:21 < bridge_> <melo∆û> non-interested people can see what mod you try to create, which may increase visibility and they may come back to you if they find interest some other time
20:21 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 3rd party enjoyers can tell you that your mod was already created by someone else and is open source

20:33 < bridge_> <Assa> What's wrong with correcting yourself? I find it easiest to do it over GH directly
20:34 < bridge_> <Assa> and it's 400 lines of code, you'll loose the overview (√úberblick?)

20:40 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ask jupstar, he forcepushed ddnet-rs for 2 years and never really kept commit history
20:40 < bridge_> <melo∆û> meaning if something didnt work, he had 200K LOC to (maybe) look through
20:40 < bridge_> <Assa> 2 years, all on "initial commit"

20:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> luckely on rust everything always works üò¨
20:55 < bridge_> <Assa> Everything does exactly what it's programmed to do ...
20:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> my program grew legs and arms, slapped me in the face and ran away. i dont know how hangman ended up this way
20:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> one hell of a bug
20:58 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> one hell of a ~~bug~~ how i wrote it and totally intended it to be
20:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does someone know what the criteria is for ddos protected servers to answer to your packets?
20:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I tried reconnect, i tried changing socket, i tried spamming (probs not helpful xdd)
20:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It sometimes magically works, and often not
20:58 < bridge_> <Assa> I am not saying, that the program does what you **intend** it to do, it just does what it's **written** to do
20:58 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i know
20:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> one hell of a ~~bug~~ feature i wrote
21:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 behold! criminally bad assembly for a function which takes a struct on the left by value and returns 8th field's value
21:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366127063857238097/image.png?ex=680fd079&is=680e7ef9&hm=6cf3e8aef67786e1805b5f1707dc22034e6fdd3d5363faf27277e002de3d4e81&
21:01 < bridge_> <learath2> I‚Äôd guess it expects you to reply with the correct token, then you‚Äôll get a redirect/reconnect packet and that is the indicator that you are whitelisted now
21:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Watonearth?
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it should do the same as 
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ```c
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> int func(struct Param param) {
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat>     struct Param p = param;
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat>     return p.eight;
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> }
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ```
21:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
21:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CHILLER, please impl reconnect token in libtw2
21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as far as i can tell it never even reached the point where i got any packet
21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if it expects some packet from client
21:06 < bridge_> <learath2> Is there anything weird with your initial packet? The whitelist is quite aggressive to anything other than legit connect packets. Also if you were spamming stuff you may have triggered a protection
21:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont send the NETMSG_CLIENTVER pkg, that is sent before the INFO pkg.
21:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> However, it doesn't even reach the `Connected` state, so dunno if i even have to care.
21:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anything before connect is inside libtw2 and thus out of my control
21:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh and the client does fetch the server list, so i dont think it's that
21:15 < bridge_> <learath2> It should be way before this. So an issue inside libtw2 I guess
21:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and heinrich is afk :/
21:19 < bridge_> <zhn> libtw2 doesn't really support ddnet/07 token packets, does it?
21:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has redirect pkt
21:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and generally UUID support
21:20 < bridge_> <zhn> i remember tons of // TODO: token support or something similar
21:21 < bridge_> <zhn> maybe it was way old code though
21:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no idea, besides some missing packages and some quirks, libtw works quite fine
21:23 < bridge_> <zhn> yeah its really useful, added 0.5 support even :nouis:
21:23 < bridge_> <zhn> time to make ~~prolapse~~ 0.4 support
21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> time to write ddnet-rs 0.5 proxy
21:29 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> that would be hella cool
21:29 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i remember there being 0.5 servers
21:29 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> vanilla servers
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and what is better about them than 0.6 xd
21:32 < bridge_> <Assa> When 0.5 Nodes support?
21:32 < bridge_> <Assa> I don't know, half of you probably don't know what I am talking about
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You really think half knows? xdd
21:34 < bridge_> <Assa> optimistically in the dev channel :justatest:
21:36 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> call half of 20k members and see if any of them know
21:36 < ChillerDragon> i know nodes
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just at everyone
21:38 < bridge_> <pluskz> i cant connect to legacy servers in ddnet-rs
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the ddos protected servers kinda ignore the packages, dunno why yet
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most RUS servers I tested worked
21:42 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is this for having 2 clients open?
21:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but without freeze prediction it's not really playable anyway xD
21:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh lol he was serious about this xD
21:42 < bridge_> <melo∆û> thats really cool ngl
21:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the demo could replay while playing yes
21:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or watch party
21:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be cool too
21:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> I tested with a server demo being recorded but it should work the same
21:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oke doke
21:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> why cant demo player be run at same time as game?
21:46 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is it just cause only 1 gameclient instance
21:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> The actual code to make it work was done in like 15 minutes, but I kept finding more demo-related issues and things to improve :justatest:
21:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Everything about the demo player is currently just passed into the gameclient like game data
21:47 < bridge_> <melo∆û> that reminds me of the talk we had when you did file handling a little better
21:47 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
21:47 < bridge_> <melo∆û> suddenly 4 PR's with 400 LoC each because you kept on finding stuff xD
21:47 < bridge_> <pluskz> i cant connect to any server, even if it does not say on the server name that it is ddos protected, also for that i must connect from f1, otherwise if i join using the green button, it always sends me to the same vanilla server :T
21:48 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> so what i said after?
21:48 < bridge_> <pluskz> i cant connect to any server, even if it does not say on the server name that it is ddos protected, also for that i must connect from f1, otherwise if i join using the green button, it always sends me to the same vanilla server (which i guess is the ddnet-rs vanilla one) :T
21:48 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, everything gets fed into the gameclient so you can't have a game from a server and from a demo at the same like
21:48 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> just make another one specifically for demo playing
21:49 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> memory usage go brr
21:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, that would be too hacky. ideally it was all separated into different interfaces/systems
21:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont understand
21:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> demos feeding info into the game like a server is how it should be
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah it sends you to your LAN server, it's on my todo xD
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i can only tell you that the map download takes a bit, if it fails after 20 seconds it should automatically time out
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you see "timed out" or smth
21:51 < bridge_> <pluskz> yep
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok weird
21:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> no, it's the demo info being fed into the game"client"
21:51 < bridge_> <melo∆û> hmm it works fine for me
21:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is that not what the server does
21:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is that not what the server does (feed into the client which feeds into gameclient)
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try to start a server in ddnet client, then start ddnet-rs (dont go in lan tab) and then in f1 `connect_legacy`
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then you should be able to join your lan server by whatever port it has
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `connect_legacy localhost:8303`
21:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ideally you would have completely separate components for:
21:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> - demo player
21:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> - client and networking
21:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> - game
21:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> - rendering
21:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> right i see
21:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but wont that have a lot of overhead in the layers
21:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then you can use demo player without the client and networking being a weird interface
21:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and a lot of changes
21:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and **a lot** of changes
21:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, that's probably why nobody has attempted it
21:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i wouldnt mind having a jank way of having demos in game
21:55 < bridge_> <pluskz> "Connecting to:
21:55 < bridge_> <pluskz> 127.0.0.1:52188"
21:55 < bridge_> <DDNet> 127.0.0.1:52188 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
21:55 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> opening a second client is too much
21:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah that the port changes is normal, since it's a proxy, but it should not time out
21:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it does, then dunno, you are on macos right=
21:56 < bridge_> <pluskz> yeah im on macOS
21:56 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait can you not just swap out the gameclient instance? and everything should work
21:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean would be weird if macos behaves different for libtw2, but yeah dunno
21:56 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait can you not just swap out the gameclient instance? and everything should work (dont have to init everything else aswell)
21:56 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait can you not just swap out the gameclient instance? and everything should work (dont have to init everything else aswell, unless gameclient does... that)
21:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait can you not just swap out the gameclient instance? and everything should work (dont have to init everything else aswell, unless gameclient does... that... it does that crap)
21:58 < bridge_> <pluskz> why it says connecting to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
21:59 < bridge_> <pluskz> oh wait it randomly connected
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the legacy proxy always uses 127.0.0.1
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you basically connect to a proxy, that proxy connects to the real ip
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll improve the UI so it's clear
21:59 < bridge_> <pluskz> oh ok
22:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> The gameclient holds most resources, so you can't easily copy it. You'd probably also have to duplicate the entire engine because it holds the map for the server/demo.
22:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ugh
22:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wasn't there a time where you could rotate quads in the editor by holding shift and moving the green quad?
22:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no ctrl it was
22:29 < bridge_> <robyt3> You need to press R now I think
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you remember the problem with ctrl?
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it collides with other hotkeys?
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i tested vanilla editor and it allows rotation with ctrl, but also moving the camera with ctrl+lmb. it disables the camera movement while rotating
22:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> #6844
22:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6844
22:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wow the editor has so much features that are completly hidden to me xD
22:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> Probably hidden to a lot of players
22:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> Did you know about the envelope position preview that is activated when you enable tile info?
22:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes xD
22:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A friend discovered it few weeks ago
22:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I was stunned it was behind the tile number thing
22:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> We should probably put that behind it's own setting TBF
22:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> We should probably put that behind its own setting TBF
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be nice to have tooltips for everything. i mean to be fair, these tooltips are often out of date or wrong
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe still better than nothing
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366151064725749841/image.png?ex=680fe6d3&is=680e9553&hm=95f158f00a957e3300a92bb23c07a1818caab2299e8dd074a7e9a1f1e7423235&
22:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, editor needs larger tooltips than one line of text
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just now I noticed, the delete range is missing xd
22:37 < bridge_> <louis> there are some features u cant even teach with tooltips
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When you hold shift without any tile selected
22:37 < bridge_> <louis> like transferring a brush from one map to another by loading a new map with an active brush
22:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> Saved brushes should work the same, right?
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the editor just needs tabs
22:38 < bridge_> <louis> ye tabs would be great
22:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> We just have no UI for them so you can't tell what the saved brushes are
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366151522546618478/image.png?ex=680fe740&is=680e95c0&hm=f5ed1a9c073004f9f1b4e9713fdb17d7e3fc8e539603cd92fdd910188d3c4a39&
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lol
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think those hotkeys are wrong way around
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> funny how i find all these bugs rn xD
22:39 < bridge_> <louis> shouldnt it be ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab
22:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> Multiple tabs in the editor should be relatively easy, just a lot of changes but doesn't seem too difficult
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly egui blocks them, otherwise i agree
