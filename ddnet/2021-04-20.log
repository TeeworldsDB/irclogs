00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dont remind me on job pls, need to get one too xDD
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if it has "front-end" in the job title back away slowly and dont break eye contact
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> didn't know my name was credited ðŸ˜„
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> can someone master ban fokkonaut server for this atrocity?
01:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833843107250176030/unknown.png
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> random pointless coding project: making this page a table https://ddnet.tw/mappers/
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sort by total, type
02:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Actually not my fault, its because 0.6 laws are to NOT send bot players but to send the original slot count + player count
02:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So dont ban me for that, ban 0.6 lawd :P
02:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in 0.7 you can select Hide bots in the browser, they need to be marked serverside so the client can filter them out
02:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So my mod will always show max_clients - botcount = 128-5 in this case
02:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> :banhammer: :nobythinking:
02:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Asked heinrich before doing this, he said that too, even tho I dont think anyone should care, because this is not vanilla 0.6 and vanilla clients also cant see that server
02:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So this seems to be a DDNet rule too :P
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I meant that the heart icon is overlapped by text because your max player count is so **fat**
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ahhhh xD
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why can you see the server btw?
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> did you open https://f.zillyhuhn.com?
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> no I opened server browser and sorted by players
02:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh

03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what a cool video
03:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @Skeith care to clean up this mess? :P
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> @Victorrrrrrrrrr You know better than to post such things, you'll be muted for a day.
03:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's in all channels
03:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> btw
03:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, make that a week
03:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xD
03:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> rip
03:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> @lynn Thank you

13:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Crime has been committed
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What does it do?
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because it looks similar to something I have done
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/3a0d455f584333610c0607f27f4d02aeace17d49/src/game/server/entities/projectile.cpp#L347
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have forbidden tunings too :D Faking curvature or speed works :)
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just fake shotgun spread while still keep the owner info
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> If you use FillExtraInfo DDNet just assume all shotgun's speed is Tuning()->ShotgunSpeed. But vanilla shotgun is using m_Direction to affect each spread's speed.
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> But FillExtraInfo discards m_Direction's length...
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, even with the new FillExtraInfo?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> With the ddnet Packet
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk. i'm using 15.3.2
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is there a new one in 15.4?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <feliksz> player info is networked in tw?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a DDNetProjectile in it?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or is it shifted and hacked in the normal one?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I shifted and hacked it in NETMSGTYPE_SV_EXTRAPROJECTILE
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <feliksz> i mean tee color, type etc
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> let me check 15.4 just be sure
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/180ae570fb00d02b2f2ef8d4fa878a4b76e09819/src/game/server/entities/projectile.cpp#L354
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TsFreddie
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nope, this discards m_Direction's length at line 363
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why dont you fix it instead?
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> does int Data have extra bits?
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> by extra bits i mean unused bits
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can maybe put which spread is the current bullet in Data and use ShotgunSpeeddiff in client?
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think theres unused
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or maybe I stuff a half precision float in Data? that way mods can still use m_Direction to control projectile's speed (with less precision)
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll try to go with the half precision route.
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the issue here?
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they want to stuff more data into the projectile
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead, please fix that we cannot extend net objects
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and simply add a field at the end
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis:
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to learn how, refer to the billion times I referred to a decent idea by @heinrich5991 ðŸ˜„
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i just want my shotgun not be broken lol
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is there a Projectile format with owner that doesn't discard the length of m_Direction that i can use right now?
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is shotgun broken?
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddrace tried to stuff more data into the projectile
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> shotgun bullets has m_Direction with length that isn't 1
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the m_Direction went away, and we got m_Angle instead
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A direction vector really doesn't need a length, unless we are using them very wrong, no?
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can have an owner instead
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> shotgun bullets has been using it wrong
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want a speed vector, you need angle and length
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if the speed isn't know beforehand)
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if the speed isn't known beforehand)
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> to be fair the speed difference between bullets is known beforehand.
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> as in 'shotgun_speeddiff' tuning
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sooooooo
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what's the plan
14:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So they use the length aswell?
14:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, we get away with it because we don't use the spread at all, right?
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/6c6a3a0bb39caff5af643fc369c5edef2bbd3be9/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L367
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so I was thinking adding the spread index and use shotgun_speeddiff or adding a 16-bit float somehow...
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> EXTRAPROJECTILE has 19 bits left in Data.
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just dont use extrainfo for shotgun :) fixed
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ i still want owner tho
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie we have free bits left in extraprojectile?
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I don't think you can fix this in a backwards compatible manner at all, and the proper way to fix it is making netobjects extensible
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think we do unless I'm blind
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought that thing was jam packed, I'll take a look
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we left a couple bits for flags but 19 sounds too much ðŸ˜„
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I'm probably blind then
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can just stick with my hack that is still usable for vanilla shotgun
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh we do indeed have some space there
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :poggers:
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's a better idea to just let this weird relic of the past die tbh
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: how or when do you want to kill it tho
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> apparently holding arrow up while refreshing servers crashes the game
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant reproduce xd
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe you need to spam refresh a bit, it doesn't always happen
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> or it just doesn't happen in DDNet tab
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just hold it while opening the client and then it crashed indeed
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah just hold while opening, ez crash xd
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> for me it always happens when refreshing on Internet tab
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can crash it as soon as the list is empty, so even if you put a random search string into it that doesnt find a server
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> it does for me too
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah makes sense, since the DDNet tab is never actually empty
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Fast
