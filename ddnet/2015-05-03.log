01:05 <@deen> Nice, TTL exceeded to br.ddnet.tw
01:06 <@deen> Works from USA, not from Europe
01:06 < eeeee> usually means there's a loop
13:28 < heinrich5991> eeeee: have you tried tracerouting it?
13:28 <@deen> heinrich5991: that was my problem with br.ddnet.tw
13:28 <@deen> and it resolved itself after a few minutes

16:03 < savander> deen: question. Could you make clan server form me on ger server? Vanilla server, i'll send you configs etc. ?
16:04 <@deen> i don't understand the sentence
16:04 <@deen> "make clan server form me on ger server?"
16:04 <@deen> oh, "for you"?
16:05 < savander> for*
16:05 < savander> ye
16:05 < savander> :D
16:05 <@deen> We're always at the limit of RAM on GER, I don't think it's a good idea =/
16:05 < savander> or somewhere, ger2 maybe? 
16:06 <@deen> then eeeee has to pay traffic
16:06 <@deen> I don't really want to host non-DDNet servers
16:07 < savander> okay, so sorry
16:37 < savander> deen: You know someone, who would make one clan server for  me?
16:39 <@deen> No idea. I guess you could get an AWS server in Frankfurt. They're for free and you only pay for bandwidth (that's what GER2 is)
16:40 <@deen> what clan is it btw?
16:40 < savander> Vanilla Clan
16:40 < savander> old vanilla clan
16:40 < savander> reactivation :)
16:41 <@deen> I guess you can send me configs before you buy a server somewhere just for that
16:42 < savander> what is AWS?
16:42 < savander> amazon?
16:44 <@deen> yes
16:44 <@deen> Amazon web services i think
16:45 <@deen> great location, ping etc, just a bit more expensive than a VPS I guess
16:45 < savander> http://aws.amazon.com/de/region-frankfurt/?
16:45 < savander> i don't understand, english doesn't work xD
16:45 < savander> sad :/
16:46 <@deen> Nice, 404 on English^^
16:46 <@deen> Good job Amazon
16:46 <@deen> I guess you can start there: 
16:47 <@deen> https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/?nc2=h_ls
16:47 <@deen> And choose Frankfurt location later
16:47 <@deen> but it's all so complicated, no idea
16:47 <@deen> I don't like cloud services
16:48 < savander> in last summor i had server in filemedia.de
16:48 < savander> summer*
16:48 < savander> and was stable
16:48 < savander> and cheap
16:48 <@deen> yeah, but buying a server for a single TW server =/
16:48 < savander> but... filemedia now don't exists
16:49 < savander> transfered to dedify
16:49 < savander> and is much expensive..
16:49 < savander> i know, but if i'll buy server for this, i'll move all date from another server to one
16:49 < savander> if it'll better
16:49 < savander> be better*
16:50 < savander> lol, i have configs
16:50 < savander> from my old servers
16:50 <@deen> anyway, if you don't find anything send me the config and I'll set it up I guess
16:50 <@deen> I got the zcatch servers from you after all, they run great
16:51 < savander> don't want to burden you
16:51 <@deen> That's mostly why I don't want to run other servers, DDNet is so much work already
16:52 <@deen> Oh, and no empty DDNet GER servers right now =/
16:52 <@deen> Maybe I'll have to add a few more
16:53 <@EastByte> I also can run some servers
16:53 <@deen> EastByte: for savander or DDNet? :P
16:53 <@EastByte> savander
16:53 <@EastByte> ddnet servers need ddos protection :P
16:54 < savander> you could?
16:54 < savander> i have complete configs
16:54 <@EastByte> I have 2x vps at proplay (near frankfurt)
16:54 < savander> i'll check
16:54 < savander> how much?
16:55 <@EastByte> how much what?
16:55 < savander> price of server
16:55 <@EastByte> 1eur/month
16:55 <@EastByte> the other one is free for me
16:55 <@EastByte> (it ran out some months before but they don't care)
16:55 <@EastByte> deen: ^ :D
16:56 < savander> ah, lol
16:56 <@EastByte> deen: your datafabrik vps is down I guess?
16:56 <@deen> yes, went down after a few months
16:56 <@EastByte> ah
16:56 <@EastByte> well I should expect that aswell
16:56 < savander> So, you can run one server for me?
16:56 <@deen> It's a wonder that datafabrik is still alive anyway :P
16:56 <@EastByte> yea sure
16:57 < savander> okay, i'll send you a config
16:57 <@EastByte> proplay is looks kinda dead aswell
16:57 <@deen> Oh, DDoS on Chile?
16:58 <@EastByte> 1.4M|118K
16:58 <@deen> ok, looks like it's going down
16:58 <@deen> was higher when I looked
16:59 <@deen> Well, there goes my bandwidth for the month =/
16:59 <@EastByte> :/
16:59 <@deen> I wanted to switch back to the cheaper one since traffic is down thanks to http map downloads
16:59 <@deen> guess that won'T work
17:03 < savander> EastByte: could you compile this? https://github.com/savander/DDForce-Vanilla/commits/master
17:04 < savander> a bit changed vanilla server
17:04 <@EastByte> yep I can
17:04 < savander> thanks, i have config for it.. too much work to change 
17:04 < savander> configs
17:05 < savander> ( i added loading configs from ../maps")
17:05 < savander> and auto load map config
17:07 <@EastByte> well I'm busy right now, I'll set everything up this evening
17:07 < savander> okay
17:07 < savander> i'll send you config 
17:07 <@EastByte> okay
17:09 < savander> EastByte: http://savander.pl/upload/eastbyte.zip
18:26 < nuborn> hi
18:29 < savander> yol
18:33 < nuborn> I made a small addition to some code in ddnet, should i just create a pull request and describe it there?
18:34 < savander> yup
18:34 < nuborn> yes, that will probably be easiest
19:55 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] trml opened pull request #203: (antiping) improve prediction of collision between players (DDRace64...predict_player_collision) http://git.io/vJ2fg
20:50 < savander> deen: http://aws.amazon.com/free/
20:51 < savander> which i should take ? :D
20:51 < savander> Amazon EC2, EC3 ? ^^
20:51 <@deen> EC2 i think
20:51 <@deen> all you pay for is upstream traffic
20:51 < savander> yup 
20:56 < savander> u are allowed 15 GB of outbound data
20:56 < savander> for free
20:56 <@deen> nice
20:56 < savander> so . 12months free instace
20:56 < savander> 750hourse/per month
20:56 < savander> and 15gb outbound data/per month
20:56 < Learath2> savander: i can host you a clan server
20:57 < savander> localization?:D
20:57 < Learath2> germany
20:58 < Learath2> nuremberg to be exact 
20:58 < savander> btw. EastByte told me, he can host for me too
20:58 < savander> so i'll wait for him at this moment
20:58 < savander> but thanks :)
20:59 < Learath2> whatever floats your boat m8
21:01 < savander> On vanilla stable ping is more important than on ddrace, you know. I want to check his server, but i'm still happy, someone want to host server for Clan ;)
21:17 <@EastByte> well teeworlds servers basically have no cost
21:17 <@EastByte> except 100gbit ddos attacks
21:19 < heinrich5991> ^^
21:19 < eeeee> and except when you run an always full 64 player blocker server
21:19 < heinrich5991> well, the 64p is kind of a hack :)
21:19 < eeeee> consumes terabytes
21:24 <@EastByte> savander: I have the server running right now
21:25 < savander> well, for simple clan server
21:25 < savander> enough i guess ( aws)
21:39 < savander> EastByte:  change motd.cfg if you can xD
21:39 < savander> From EastByten to EastByte hahah
21:39 < savander> and delete "|" this character
21:39 <@EastByte> and I'll add "Savander needs to learn spelling"
21:41 < savander> Definitly!
21:42 < savander> and i'm doing what you said. Fork official github and push my changes :D
21:42 <@EastByte> great
21:44 < savander> my master.
21:44 <@EastByte> better not
21:44 < savander> btw.
