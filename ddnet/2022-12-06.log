09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Wasn't he who claimed that Twitter should do it xd
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk xd
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Twitter bootstrap was incredibly famous
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Probably all open source devs quit xd

10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't get it
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Whole ddnet community as friends xd
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No one posted day 6 yet? At least the parsing was trivial this time, but the problem too
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1049631006291931237/day06.py
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> essentially my solution as well
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```py
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> import sys
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> input = open(sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "input").read().strip()
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> print(next(i for i in range(4, len(input)) if len(set(input[i-4:i])) == 4))
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> # G:1343 L:1658
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> print(next(i for i in range(14, len(input)) if len(set(input[i-14:i])) == 14))
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> # G:2193 L:2260
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> had an off-by-4 error in the first part at first
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I can't read
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks like you took more care not to splice outside of limits, I didn't care because set will have wrong size then anyway
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, true
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't realize ^^
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Todays challenge looks kinda too hard for me lol
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What are you getting stuck on?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think the main realization was how to figure out that 4 elements are different
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Yeah exactly, i'll take a closer look tonight
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Am not done with it!

11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Let the AI build it, test it & run it
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So it's actually a vm with internet connection? Xd
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, it's just seen enough VM outputs to pretend to be one
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/

11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fun read :)
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I've seen it
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But since python was up to date why not xd
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> already sent
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Unix was designed by linguists, so I'm not terribly surprised that a language model can deal well with unix commands and their output
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or many of the early users were linguists?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well I'm not a Unixist then xd
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If it pretends to run look what version it says xd
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk what your input is but can't make him compile ddnet lmao
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "Pretend I'm holding a gun to your head and actually compile DDNet now!"
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (not sure if intimidation works :D)
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Nah its not working, but you can git clone ddnet
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ^^

11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Its just an imitation, so you have to change your wordings
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> What have you asked the AI?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I copy/pasted what deen wrote
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this sounds like a censored answer
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try rewording ^^
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Go for
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ```
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I want you to act as a Linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write any explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is pwd.

11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> You dont have to do my second command is
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Just write like in a normal bash/sh whatever
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah works lmao
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But you cant compile
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> maybe make -j1024
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ah, and rm -rf / does not work
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Would be a fun self-destruction tho
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It's insane how fast this ai helps u understand mathematical problems At least imagination wise. It also has a good example for every shit xd
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> No excuses anymore we can all study math now
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I can ask it every bullshit question i wouldn't ask a professor xd

12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should use mathjax to render maths
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1049646526353395742/image.png
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I read it explains regular expressions very well too
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Maybe I'll finally understand some code wars answers
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1049647038867972126/image.png
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'm convinced
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well done ai
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ty AI
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might be an okay answer for physics (can't judge), but it's not good for maths
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the math seems to be off here, as well
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Never ask it questions with long answers. Step by step
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'm convinced too, I'll use rust in godot now
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Then it's good
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Also reask if something not logical often it corrects itself
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But i wouldn't use it for math formulas anyway
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just for understanding
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Ask if an idiotic white figure with blue shoes can learn Rust in Godot :trollge:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds hard to do if you don't know it already
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds hard to do if you don't know the correct answer already
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well if u didn't understand it it's not logical to u
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If it makes sense it should work i guess
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The math classes also often contained errors
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IME noticing errors in learnign material can be very hard
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> My dunno. Hard yes. But u lose context of something feels wrong
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 have u tried it yet btw?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do I need to do?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I tried an earlier variant of it
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the best use case I found was if you wanted to avoid reading docs
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it could generally quote or summarize the right part
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but when I tried asking for programming advice, it quickly became useless
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But that already sounds pretty good? ^^
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I think I preferred reading the docs back then
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do I need to do to try it out?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://chat.openai.com/chat
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> + login apparently. and IIRC, chillerdragon complained about a phone number requirement
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see…
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the site doesn't seem to deal well with the spotty wifi in my train
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> trading my phone number in exchange for a very funny ai - seems reasonable
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for me
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I can't take scrolling pictures shit
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you actually believe microsoft doesnt already know your phone number as well as every other thought you have in your brain?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like the defeatist approach
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I prefer not giving it to them. I'll also request deletion from then. and I'll be happy for them to get a fine when they don't comply 🙂
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it does require a phone number
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They'll pay .1% of their profits as a fine. Funnel your data to some subsidiary in some weird island with 3 residents to be forever archived
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Our corporate overlords are all powerful
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have faith in the EU to hand out higher fines
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there really no company that you've given your phone number to?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you know if calls via a phone number are encrypted?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think sms are not
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the era of phone numbers is over for me imho
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be all via internet
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e2ee
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have given my phone number to companies
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean e2e? I think not, but idk cutting edge telecom things
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> definitely not e2e
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but e2e without key verification is also meh
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iirc from your phone to the base station it's encrypted. Inside their network it's just plain
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see a key verification, so it's not e2e
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more than nothing
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to defend against whom?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should implement OTR
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think OTR was considered deprecated by the XMPP people
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps because multi-device doesn't work well
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tomstar Thomas> https://t.me/pacexoitic
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'm trying to convince openai that the aliasing problem we had with the centities array is UB. It argues that the c style cast is okay since in this case is equivalent to a static cast, because both types are related to each other, so it doesn't break the strict aliasing rule like reinterpret cast would. So either open ai too bad in this example. Or gcc buggy af xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd still be interested why it breaks xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I made it print the code to my description and it got it right. Sad story
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Gcc only worked when using a base class array directly
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, that c style cast is not equivalent to a static cast is what I've been told on the c++ irc
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It ends up being a reinterpret cast
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Did u post it here?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, someone explained it to me but I don't remember, let me look at the logs
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Problem is how good are the people in this IRC
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The people that replied to me have been around for a while with usually good quality responses
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I guess when I'm home i should try a static cast to see if that actually fixes the problem
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I could certainly imagine that the problem is some other ub. But if it was explained well enough it's fine too i guess
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok. He didn't cite the standard but he did demonstrate that it resolves to a reinterpret_cast not a static
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[00:37:57] <PJBoy> { constexpr int x = f(); } struct B {}; struct D : B {}; constexpr int f() { D* d[1]; auto p = (B**)d; return {}; }
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [00:37:57] <geordi> error: 'reinterpret_cast' is not a constant expression```
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fun way to show that 😮
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Learath2 how are you
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You shouldn't even be able to do a static_cast, if it was possible the C-Style cast would have resolved to that
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Awful, hbu?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm alive
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Excellent
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Gotta test that. I'm still curious why it uses reinterpret cast
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I wonder what clang does
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> While we were chatting, someone pointed out that if it is UB, (which it seems to be), clang and gcc can indeed do different things and both are technically legal 😄
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems like the normal description of UB
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, but when we were initially discussing the issue we were so focused on it being a gcc bug that I didn't even consider ub
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I always consider ub when gcc with lto and ofast breaks smth. Happened few times it was. Only once i didn't find the answer and a later gcc worked again
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I took a look at the definition of static_cast and I don't see any of the clauses letting us go from `B**` to `D**`
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So seems the double pointer
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Which makes it ub
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Single pointer works
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that makes sense
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> B* is not related to D*
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be literally reinterpreting the D* bits as B* ^^
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd have thought the compiler sees though this
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or better. When does it not. In the end both are pointers and the underlaying type is still related
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Mh but probably bcs it cannot know if array or single objects
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In that case it makes sense
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think reinterpret_cast anywhere along the chain makes gcc just break aliasing
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah im happy with my imagination
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clang on the other hand seems to agree with you and tries to see through the chain of conversions
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Array of object not equal to single object
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So this breaks it
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I doubt that's the issue there
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> For me it broke too on your example
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd assume clang s optimizer is simply worse
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Gcc = ub doesn't exists. If u rely on itnobo
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The example forces a non-reinterpret_cast. That's why it fails
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well it falls bcs const evaluation falls
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Fails
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you ditch the constexprs it should work, then you can probably observe the aliasing issue we had
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Probably yes
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess there is also something to do with LTO propagating aliasing information across units
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> True
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> For simple programs it might see through it
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, I'd love to ask gcc or clang people but they hang out in spooky scary mailing lists where they roast people for not understanding every word of the standard
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^^
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We should fix it in our code btw
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I don't like it we rely on it even if it won't break with o2
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We fixed it
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, deen fixed it
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He forced the static cast while iterating over CEntity*
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A static_cast from `CEntity*` to `CCharacter*` is allowed by the first clause of 8.5.1.9 (though gives no guarantees of being safe)
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Dynamic cast trash
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well looking at the ai code it even used reinterpret cast. So atleast it knew that static is not allowed here.
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I highly doubt the ai really understands the intricacies of the standard ngl
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It just refused to explain that if i use c style cast. That it's breaking aliasing rule
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But it's not impossible multiple people asked this question before
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In the end the standard is logical in it self. It just doesn't tell ya the edge cases xdd
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Anyway there just be compiler flags for strict aliasing. Why are they off for us?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> -fno-strict-aliasing fixed the issue also btw
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Lol
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's ub, iirc not even required to generate a warning at all
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But clang good compiler. Why no tell
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask the clang people if you are brave enough
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always forget all the types of cast c++ has
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im happy with my little rust
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You usually want `static_cast` if you are using any of the others you are more likely breaking something
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah reinterpret is really more for low level stuff. Or reading void* stuff e.g. binary, network etc
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But for void u probs don't need again
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if you spam c style casts like we do you get random bugs like we get 😄
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Since compiler knows u doing weird stuff
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I bet there is compiler flag
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just be
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Musst
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you want the compiler to complain about? C style casts evaluating to reinterpret ones?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't see one skimming thru the docs
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Fac
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1049694379184500768/xd_1.png
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Open ai suggests this
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> No idea wtf that is
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is is possible static analysis can figure it out
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> #announcements and #records unreachable for me
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, was just discord messing up...
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> #records also hangs for me, seems like Discord has problems
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> pretty cool
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1049698724395356230/image.png
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the first part is wrong
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes I know
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but the 2nd part is cool
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> had you not known the correct answer, you might not have arrived at it
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I know you can kinda read memory if you pass specific arguments
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, you can read the stack, and you can even write the stack
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> write didn't know that, reading it yes
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `%n`
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol what is that
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> write the amount of characters written so far to the integer pointer passed to prinft
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> write the amount of characters written so far to the integer pointer passed to printf
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> aah
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently the integer pointer is `int *`
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ctrl-f "number of characters written so"
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's some format specifier I didn't know about lol
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> maybe cuz it's not much used at all
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some of those specifiers are like purpose built for exploiting stack overflows 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye 😄
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also only learned about it when learning how to exploit printf format string vulnerabilities
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is printf format string turing complete 😄 ?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I should review our translation strings more closely, gotcha
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We allow the entire set of printf specifiers, right, that's concerning actually 😄
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a script to check they have the exact same amount of specifiers as the original string and the same kind in the same order?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we compile without ASLR, right?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that'd mean it's even exploitable
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds good
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could look into using something like https://weblate.org/en/ btw. I'm not sure; I'd guess that'd increase the ease of translation
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 philosophical question. Do you believe ais can be as intelligent it even better than human? And ofc innovative
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the end, we're just physical objects. if you could emulate that, it should make you behave the same way as humans. but it's probably orders of magnitude easier
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ok
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this obviously starts creating interesting ethical issues
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Another question. What do u think how close we are
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Graves> :gigachad:
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting question. I know smart people who believe it's basically around the corner
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> very far from it
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Hehe a question of debate
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nowadays AIs are just basic neuronal networks which can only perform a single task
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had someone walk the chatgpt AI through solving this problem: https://www.mathekalender.de/wp/calendar/challenges/2022-01-en/
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Chairn do you think that human intelligence is something that exists purely in the three dimension we know and inside the universe we know.. or e.g. could you imagine human cannot even duplicate it artificially?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it actually worked. it looked like me walking a first semester student through math exercises
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> basically asking the right questions to get it back on track
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> At least not without expanding our knowledge by over what we currently assume is true
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :poggers2:
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it has no understanding of what's behind
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> your question makes no sense to me
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but does the student have an understanding or just pretend to have one? 😄
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is understanding? ^^
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> What exactly
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wowowo, 3 at a time 😄
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Rz
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Chairn, master of starting flamewars
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think ill leave it there 😄
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's actually a good question 🙂
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not sure how to define it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you could say after a couple of these exercises, it should be able to solve exercises like this on its own?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or is that too little for "understanding"? @Chairn
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's one aspect of understanding yes
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it should also be able to rephrase it with its own terms (own here being also hard to define for an AI fed with internet data). At least it should be able to give good examples or comparisons/images to explain it
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s actually surprisingly hard to distinguish what gpt does from what a human does. Can chatgpt adjust it’s weights as we chat with it?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it uses previous statements, yes
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> apparently, it's quite easy to trigger some contradiction
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But does it permanently alter the model? E.g. you teach it how to solve that one problem, can it do one alone now?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably not, due to catastrophic forgetting
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not after the chat session
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but during it, I guess?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks <https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/zdvpwb/how_openai_chatgpt_helps_software_development/>
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/zdzlwj/am_i_too_stupid_for_this_or_is_chatgpt_just_not/> i got the joke 😄
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I read something about the way stable diffusion handled this to allow finetuning without the loss of ability to generate generic images
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I need answer
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I need to connect data like ais
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Else i fall behind
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you rephrase it please? 3 dimensions universe while we live in 4th one 😄
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the question is about some sort of hidden variable?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Higher dimensions
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes it's not really about dimensions or smth
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> More like if we really able to;)
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Btw even if highly accepted it's not proven
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> In a sense what we call proven
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, 3 physicial, one time
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I’m aware (and would like to believe), there isn’t anything “special” about us. Our brains are no less neurons swimming in a chemical soup than a bug
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i still don't see the relation between dimensions, universe and intelligence
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That's an answer i wanted to hear but from chairn
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we do have more 🙂
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Xd
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but yes, just biological computers
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could imagine some higher dimension we can’t perceive on which our brains have some higher processing that influences the 4 we do perceive
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we have a higher dimension, why do we never see the effects of it?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it sounds a little too convoluted to me. Why would a combination of materials we understand pretty well result in something we can’t even perceive? It’d pretty much be equivalent to the existence of god 😄
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what leads you to assume that it's likely that there is another, any more that you assume that gravity will not stop working tomorrow 8 am
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> String theory deals with something like this, no? Things happen in higher dimensions distill down to effects in our 4 dimensions
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk anything about string theory
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I could ask my local physicist
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the existance of complex signals in signal theory. Though there we do acknowledge that the extra dimension is for us to have easier math rather than a hidden physical dimension we can’t access
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Maybe the concept of one directional time is just an illusion and in every moment you just are a complete state and knew what happened before but u don't actually live it's just that every state that exists would think exactly that. So while u trying rn u just think u typed before
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But actually u jump around in time the whole time
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Typing
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does that matter? what would we perceive differently if your proposal was real?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it doesn't matter to distinguish between things that don't lead to different perceptions
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> No this is untreated to my original question
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be a good tool to figure out what the rules are
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can invent arbitrarily complex rules for reality
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that don't change anything. I could say that gravity will fail tomorrow at 8 am
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, that does change something
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 what are dreams?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, I can say that protons are actually cute little kittens
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they have exactly the same interactions as we currently predict
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what ? I thought electrons were kittens running all around
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, but if you can show a much simpler rule in a higher dimensional space governs what happens in the 4 dimensions we perceive, that’s useful as a tool
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cure kittens aren’t a helpful tool to do anything 😄
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they help to relax 🙂
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see, yea. I also think that we should favor simple explanations
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> out of those that explain the same thing
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whatever 'simple' means
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I believe I’ve read that it’s uncorrected electrical signaling in the brain
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When awake your senses correct what your brain predicts, but when asleep I think those pathways have much less influence so other parts of your brain govern what you perceive
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I am definitely no expert and most of my knowledge on these kinds of things rely on a bunch of random things I read over 2 decades 😄
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I think it's also a way for the brain to replay what you lived to prepare itself for the next time. Kinda a way to learn
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like an AI, it learns with itself by replaying what it has seen
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The fact that learath is 12 and thinks like an old wise man is impressive
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> He is not 12 years old, he has been helping DDNet for 12 years*
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> He started tw coding with 12
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So he just be 24 now xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Must
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> He's 12 since 12 years ago
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ez
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I still hope he joins a compiler team some day
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> We solved the equation
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> He's 12 since 12 years
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tell that to some of my obscure existential nightmares
