00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 thes nums are actually provided by the NSA arent they?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are there no problems with older linux system with that long names?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is max map name for maps?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #developer just became #media xd
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hopefully (at)jao#5991 wont recognize our secret activity here
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i only find max_name length at 255bytes \0
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but im not quite sure how linux handles the name files actually
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ no
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only problematic thing is windows
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> as always xd
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> windows has (by default at least) a limit of 260 characters for the full path to files
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fuul path!`wtf
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> paths can get long
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chiller ofc only older windows
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> modern has 32k or smth
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ no. even windows 10
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xdddd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as long as you don't use `\\?\` paths
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no jao spotted us
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pss
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> remove the media
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's an option in windows 10 now to enable the new 32k limit
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's opt-in for now
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> so I couldnt use your cool sha2048?
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you have a source for the linux limit tho?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by the file system, I think
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see the full path can be 4096
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 256 per component, `MAX_PATH` is 4096 IIRC
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Max. filename length     255 bytes
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe we need a file storing tge hashes
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no wait that doesnt make sense
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whyß
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a database?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what is tws limit for filenames then?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because the the file name is not enough space
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 255 - 64 - 4 ?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why should your map name be longer than 100 chars?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just wodnering, if the editor should disallow that then
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just people's own fault
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> k xd
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AzMhJ/372134c6fd.png
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> now I see why everyone hates microsoft
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah older ext version all fine ok, thats what i wanted
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> weclome in the club @lola
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont hate them, neither i love them
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they have the most glitchless desktop enviroment IMO
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @Jupstar ✪ you can't be like that
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but dont hate too much keep in mind all this data is public and archived @lola
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> macOS is glitchlesser
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> macos is the glitch
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> but I don't share my data, how it can be public?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> BSD is the best
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> BSd c:
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but too old drivers always xD
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never tested it et
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its on the long todo
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and KDE has glitches too
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> windows 10 is not that bad as 8
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> believe me
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well linux is awesome for developping things
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but GUIs arent great in many apps. depends on if you like to use them or not
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I want developing things
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i suggest you something like debian
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> but I don't know how to start
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sololearn.com
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> add me as friend there is my main handgout 24/7
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> hmmmm
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for real as a beginner i can really recommend this site it is very motivating c:
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with rankings and xp and stuff
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just never learn java, or i get cancer
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am planing to make that course
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even tho i really dislike java somehow
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but its fame and i guess it will help me some day since a lot of stuff is written in it
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mostly hate that android's system uses JNI and shit. and java is slow
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its wasting my good energy
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> java is surprisingly fast
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> enterprise software is what's slow
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is useless RAM wasting, useless Array checks. Exceptions
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never heard of fast java apps
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> all expierences i had with java were slow .-.
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. array checks and exceptions are not what is slowing down java programs
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ofc bytecode too
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is JITed
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. compiled at runtime
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the problem is the more RAM must be loaded, the more RAM comes in action
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes wow
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so much better than compiling before
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> especially for dektop enviroments using x86_64
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what I said
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't think your claim "java is slow" is really true
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. intellij idea is a piece of java software that is well-done
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think there is
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> any overhead creates makes something slow
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise c++ would be dead slow 😛
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it creates overhead over C
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's not
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that makes it a few nanoseconds slower than c
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that isn't what makes some piece of software feel slow
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and even that is wrong
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that depends on the feature set you use
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed, but if you have a high performance algorithm or a game you feel it
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well sure, if you write a loop adding 1 to your register
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. not whether you compiled your code with c or c++
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> java might be just as fast wow xD
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> java is indeed not the language I'd choose for games
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah c and c++ are near to each other, but having objects with vtables etc. needs more RAM loading
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is slow
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's bad for performance in java is e.g. that there's no way to create value types
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. types that aren't boxed
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what i meant with their RAM wasting actually
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everything is an object
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not a problem
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the boxing is the problem
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can put everything in C++ classes as you wish, that won't slow down runtime
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [it will slow down compile time a little]
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and how is that not a problem then
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the slower compile time you mean?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, you mean the problem is it isn't boxed.. ofc it's not boxed, since everything is an object.. you only store references.
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> boxed = behind a reference
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least that's how I know the term
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so where is that not a problem?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> problematic for java performance is that you can't declare [except for primitive types] that something shouldn't be boxed
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> creating an object in java is that isnt it
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as soon you create something it's an object(a reference
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes [unless it gets killed by escape analysis]
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> any object in java has it's address and stuff you can access
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but that's not really a problem of objects
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and its class name xD
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C++ has objects, too
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can increase the class size instead of pointing to the object
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know what you mean, but  you sad its not a problem
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> boxed = boxing things together
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4 floats make a class 4 * 4 bytes
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in java floats are boxable
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but Floats not
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because Floats are objects xD
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> something like that
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, then we have different definitions of 'box'
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem I wanted to mention is that everything has to be behind a pointer
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that's atleast i imagine as the definition of the word xD
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats the consequence
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its not boxable
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's not a "default" datatype
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, can you stop using that word? if we have different definitions, it's not useful
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. the problem we [apparently?] both agree on is that you can't have value types, types that aren't behind a pointer
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't create aggregations of values that aren't possibly put behind another allocation
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok, boxing is meant like putting it in
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so. then – have you tried intellij? it's a nice piece of software …written in java 🙂
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah probably the opposite of what i thought
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats special about intellij
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean i used android studio
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or dont u mean the IDE
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean the IDE
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you asked for a good piece of java software. I think that's one of them
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah from idea wise sure
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> android studio 🤢
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but in the end i care about performance
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> minecraft java is also a good game
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt mean it performce well
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> Always took 30 mins to start at univ
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. it's not well written IMO
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> can't work on this ide
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Amu~Cookie mh. doesn't here. and I don't have a good PC
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt u can increase the performance alot
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> android studio ?
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Amu~Cookie yes
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the mobile version (and win10 version) works better
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since it uses some c++ framework i think
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> of what?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> minecraft
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how do you tell its badly written
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe these had more constraints than the normal version
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. less block height, etc.
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not really anymore
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> minecraft java is always a bit more modern
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but chunk loading etc is insanly much faster
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or TNT explosion
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> I have a terrible experience with android studio because it's alway seem to do huge task on startup @heinrich5991 but that's was more than 2 year ago so I dont know now
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Amu~Cookie perhaps the machines have too little RAM
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's usually the first reason why programs start slowing down
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon https://www.laurencegellert.com/software/github-graph-builder/
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the whole plugin(overwrite) stuff makes java slow at startup
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno if google uses complete own impl tho
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> yeah
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> But now I rethink about it. It was probably a huge server issue combined with ram. Since the data were stored on server that sometime took us more than 20 minutes to start only our windows session.
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol @heinrich5991 i already thought about faking it... it sucks that there is even a full automated website for it
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well my art is going to be real and it has some flaws due its realness c:
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AzQqZ/9c3d34a3fc.png
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good morning!
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> time for another commit c:
02:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1137: Update credits (master...UpdateCredits) https://git.io/vhREm
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe full selfpushing @heinrich5991 i took that serious :p
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shaemless elfppromotion xd
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what a waste xd im not allowed to use github until sunday .-.
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to draw a ❤
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pixelart in my contributons graph
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AzQUG/f108030634.png
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah good luck 😉
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye thanks c: huughe project
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess ima check rl for a few days c:
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good night @dezveloperz and lola
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Intellij while a very decent IDE it really is a memory-hog it easily takes up 2-3 gigs
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Java is quite fast nowadays but when working with low latency applications or very high volumes `quite-fast - raw-speed` grows very quickly
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the lax nature of these languages and their reliance on a GC makes them very prone to be memory hogs
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also generally the performance comparisons you get between the language conveniently take out the java startup time and the JIT getting used to the patterns, yet the users experience the startup time
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I don't Know If i did something wrong but i once used newlines in a console application in in Java to refresh the "frame".
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And you could see the text moving slowly up. With any Other language it looked like a clear screen

10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks deen c:
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> adding yourself to credits is bad luck 😛
12:51 < ***> Buffer Playback...
12:51 <+bridge> [12:50:28] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😀
12:51 < ***> Playback Complete.
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yup. startup time and latency is parts where java doesn't shine
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, try making a console command with java – it won't work, startup latency is too big
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.25 seconds for a hello world program on my computer
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 ikr and it feelt really weird but heinrich said it so i coudlnt resist. This was a hughe goal in my life for a long time c:
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye thats what i also exoirenced with my console app in java
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wasnt there a way to have clear entities with the map background? i forgot the settings

19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> not wrong his picture, this founded some bugs
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Is tw/ddnet using opengl?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I wonder why apple deprecates it
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye we newly added it as far as i remember
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I don't even know what it is
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Is it for the graphical rendering?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Okay and why is it bad,
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we also use SDL and SDL2 i guess
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Okay and why is it bad?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but this opengl is some new feature i think
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you mean why apple stops the support?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Gabbo opengl is not bad
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple wants devs to use Metal instead of OpenGL
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz apple
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Oh I see
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> But Metal is apple-only right?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> wow #surprise #unexpected #new
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD

21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wp
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> #developer ??
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only dev talk here
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we are talking about languages
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh – a little off topic is fine. we had that in #ddnet on IRC as well
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> SO AS I WAS SAYING \*arhm\* I believe the c function of ddnet shall be rewritten
21:44  * bridge [ddnet] <Gabbo> doesn't code
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> me neither
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then what exactly are your PRs, @ChillerDragon ?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😛
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Well I understand code and review a bit but I'm not into maths
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> was my cat running on the keyboard @heinrich5991
21:44  * bridge [ddnet] <Gabbo> -> sysadmin -> Coders hero
21:44  * bridge [ddnet] <Gabbo> -> sysadmin -> Coders' hero
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 👍
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I ran to the sysadmin of my faculty at university the other day
21:45 <+fstd> ^ that is a unicode that even my utf-8 view can't even
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they were very helpful
21:45 <@heinrich5991> that's just some discord emoji
21:46 <@heinrich5991> it replaces stuff automatically
21:46 <+fstd> ah
21:46 <+fstd> he a unix person?
21:46 <+fstd> the sysadmin, i mean
21:46 <@heinrich5991> he's running macos on his work station
21:46 <@heinrich5991> but he seemed competent
21:47 <@heinrich5991> after determining that the next problem lies with the university's (and not the faculty's) computer systems, I went there
21:47 <@heinrich5991> and experienced the opposite
21:47 <@heinrich5991> I talked to the help desk guy
21:47 <+fstd> well what does he run on his servers tho? :)
21:47 <@heinrich5991> we have linux I think
21:48 <@heinrich5991> the help desk guy was the opposite of useful
21:48 <@heinrich5991> the first question I asked was "where is the sysadmin?" the answer was "what's the problem?"
21:49 <+fstd> yeah that doesn't really sound like a good start tho..
21:49 <@heinrich5991> "the stunnel for the mysql connections from my faculty to your systems on port 13008 seems to be down"
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AAjLW/9d5b01d3c8.jpg
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> coder cat
21:50 <@heinrich5991> he goes on to call someone, omitting all the details
21:50 <+fstd> mhh
21:50 <@heinrich5991> he tells me to write an email to the user's help address
21:51 <@heinrich5991> I ask whether I can go to the sysadmin, but no, important computer systems are on the way to their office
21:52 <@heinrich5991> fortunately someone had the nice idea of searching the staff listing for a person who might be the one I needed
21:52 <@heinrich5991> and indeed, found a phone number, called it. 30s later it was working again
21:52 <+fstd> hah i was just gonna recommend trying to find that in the DNS :D
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> everything that we write here is relayed on IRC?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:52 <+fstd> it's a shame that you aren't actually on IRC tho
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> so fstd knows when I say that he is not smart?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:53 < Gabee> Hi
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, since IRC hiliting works a bit differently from Discord hiliting, he'll even get a popu
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> p
21:53 <+Gabee> Wow it really works
21:53 <@heinrich5991> you're starting weechat as root?
21:53 <@heinrich5991> sounds like a good idea
21:53 <+fstd> i'm not smart enough to understand what the "popup" is trying to tell me
21:53 <+Gabee> heinrich5991: ye
21:53 <+Gabee> heinrich5991: weechat in gnome-terminal
21:53 <+Gabee> in the root session
21:53 <+Gabee> on rdp
21:54 <+Gabee> but it's safe I log IPs
21:54 <@heinrich5991> what if your IRC client has a bug?
21:54 <@heinrich5991> instant root access? ^^
21:54 <+Gabee> It has no bug it's weechat
21:54 <+fstd> talk about smart
21:54 <@heinrich5991> fstd: I don't know – an LED, warning lights, a window popup, etc.
21:54 <+fstd> but regarding rdp, there's been a huge vulnerability just the other week
21:54 <+fstd> you better have that p atched
21:54 <+Gabee> nice heinrich5991 
21:54 <+Gabee> you're on arch
21:55 <+Gabee> fstd: I'm trolling
21:55 <+Gabee> if you guys don't believe me ctcp version me
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon ill also do some kind of abitur in some days D:
21:55 <+fstd> heinrich5991: it beeps my terminal bell and causes the message to be yellow and also appear in a different part of the window
21:55 <@heinrich5991> Gabee: https://weechat.org/doc/security/ – oh true, look at it, all the security vulnerabilities are fixed
21:55 <+Gabee> the whole rdp / root / gnome is obviously a troll guys
21:55 <+fstd> you don't seem to troll well
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool @Ryozuki c:
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i already did a lot of abitur im like 4/5
21:55 <+Gabee> well you believed me :c
21:56 <+Gabee> anyway
21:56 <+fstd> doesn't speak for you that i found it easy to believe that you might be stupid :-)
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon we do all exams 3 days in a row
21:56 <+Gabee> I like how it is 2018 and quakenet has no ipv6
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sick sick

21:56 <+Gabee> fstd: everyone is stupid on the internet

22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You're in a massive protest
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Some people destroy things
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember how it is called
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The police requests people to disperse, to go away
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They do not
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They ask again
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They do not
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They ask one last time
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They don't
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They send a grenade
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wow
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The guy took the grenade in his hand
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that escalated quickly
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😮
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Gabbo they were ocupying a land to protect it against a company wanting to build on it and destroying all nature
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> What do you think would happen?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and police came in with grenades
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> no they're not
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Notre-Dames-Des-Landes was already canceled
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> They were getting rid of the people occupying illegaly other people's property
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they cut off someones hand
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw a raw image
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Because they gave 3 months for the people to go away
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki they did not
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The guy had 3 months to leave
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The project was abandonned
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The lands were given back to the previous owners
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 idk if i like germany
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> But the owners couldn't use the lands because it was occupied
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt go to america due to their selfishness + kids with weapons and etc
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> So the police said 3 months
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki So for that, maybe you get documented more
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki Regarding imperialism, we're against it as well
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki tbf, germany seems to have quite some german fetish, they want you to learn the language. other countries like sweden or so do not insist on that too much
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Gabbo your president is from the right side right?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know they want to kill north-catalan language?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> france
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you saw the protests?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it's like spain
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you use my language otherwise i hit you
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @heinrich5991 it's insane how swedish ppl, danish, dutch, speak a very well english
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Gabbo the young generation is a little bit better in germany
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Catalonia
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki France only recognizes French as the language of the republic. But it's going to change
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you have to much faith
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these politicians always lie
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Gabbo but that's the result of every movie, book, etc. getting translated into german
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they never do what they say
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast here
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki It's the same thing in Bretagne with Breton, in Toulouse with Occitan, in Corse with corsican etc
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have less incentive to learn english
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki well
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well english doesn't need to be everywhere
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multilanguage is not bad
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki 10 years ago you would not have been able to learn a local language within France
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki For 5 years now they created this Breton degree
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki It is now taught in school
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki It's progressing, on the right side
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalan was forbidden here for decades
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> due to fascism
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we kept using it
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Yes it's slow, yes it's misunderstood, but no, stop spitting on your country
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You say english doesn't need to be everywhere yet you speak it
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on my country?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont consider spain my country
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> sure
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i'm catalan
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from catalonia
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> great
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> so what?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Cataluña should get recognized more, yes
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pls
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont kill me
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> write it "catalunya"
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Cataluña should have a better recognition, yes
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not cataluña
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> that's how I learnt it
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I can also say Catalogne, or the Catalan region
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> When you say Paris with the S at the end, I'm not triggered
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://spanishpolice.github.io/
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The entire world say PariSSSSSSS
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Do I complain about it?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you are speaking in english
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the proper way is catalonia
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> the proper way according to who
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to english?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> There's nothing that says "it's written like this", it's all a consensus of people talking the same language
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ...
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> About that
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> This was purely illegal
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The referendum
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you are dumb
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You guys should have been smarter
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew a french imperialist would always say this
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> A french imperialist
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You complain about politics
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> And you follow them
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I'm just stating facts here
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Puigdemont?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no you are not
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The pro catalan
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> flying away his own region he loves so much
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you speak like a shitty fascist spanish
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he didnt fled from there he would have went to jail withtout a court
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> likethe politicians already in prison
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they havent even had a judgement and are already in prison
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I'm just gonna say one last thing before we stop because it's totally offtopic (and if you want, we can PM so you can show me more about catalan region)
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i wont talk with you since i can see the ignorance already
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> The fact that you tell me I'm dumb, I'm a french imperialist, I'm a shitty fascist spanish
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> It's not respectful
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah im sry
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You wouldn't tell me that if I were in front of you
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Because if I were in front of you
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> You'd be nicer and explain me how it works
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this pisses me in another level
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this pisses me ro another level
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Just like I did when you said "oh the french police cut someone's hand"
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I tried to explain, so you could understand
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i had proofs of that
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i know they did it
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> No one is attacking you, no one is threatening you, I'm not stealing anything from you
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> So relax, breathe, and we can talk & exchange
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> We might learn something from each other
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I'm totally open to learn anything about Catalan region
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I'm totally open to learn anything about the Catalan region
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Cuz I know it's part of France, so is the Basque country as well
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "part of france"?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> basque country too?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Part of france
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> As in the territory
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where you get that from
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> We have catalan people living in france too
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but that doesnt mean its part of france
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Not that much but still
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the imperialism i mean
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Yes sorry I did not mean that
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki pm?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> k
22:27 <+Gabee> fstd: you gone?
22:28 <+fstd> i haven't been paying attention
22:28 <+Gabee> I feel bad that you think I'm stupid
22:29 <+fstd> Gabee: someone told you i'm a BSD fanboy didn't they? ;)
22:30 <+fstd> if not, i can one up that by running NetBSD practically everywhere from desktop to router to wifi AP to embedded crap :-)
22:30  * fstd looks around with a smug expression
22:31 <+fstd> i still have to sneak in some BSD at work tho :(
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Gabbo I'm BR, sponsor of DDNet Brazil. :)

22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Guys I'm sorry for the huge offtopic
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I hope you'll pardon me
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I hope you'll forgive me
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love flexbox
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki come to holland, we got lots of jobs in IT
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👌
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Tell me once you are arrivex
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Tell me once you are arrived
22:58 <+fstd> Gabee: you gone?
22:58 <+fstd> tfw he gone
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki flexbox the wm?
23:14 <+Gabee> fstd: i are here
23:14 <+fstd> so are i
23:16 <+fstd> you strike me as dutch
23:16 <+fstd> you dutch?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @n000b you live in holland?
23:19 <+fstd> please don't conflate holland and der neederlaanden.
23:19 <+fstd> it insults my ancient dutch nobility (which allows me to wear the "van" in "van fisted")
23:26 <+Gabee> hahahaha
23:26 <+Gabee> fstd: Ik ben Frans maar ik leer Nederlands
23:27 <+Gabee> Ik ga de hele tijd naar nederland
23:28 <+Gabee> fstd: wait, do you speak dutch?
23:28 <+Gabee> lmao
23:28 <+Gabee> I'm french, just this
23:28 <+Gabee> french
23:29 <+fstd> i can kinda sorta understand dutch when it's written
23:29 <+fstd> but only because it's like fucked up german
23:29 <+fstd> when spoken i can't understand a thing
23:31 <+Gabee> so you're german?
23:34 <+fstd> i'm so german, i'll wait on a red light at night on an empty intersection
23:35 <+fstd> as a pedestrian!
23:35 <+Gabee> You laugh but ever since I went to germany I do that in france
23:35 <+Gabee> … and I'm the only one
23:36 <+Gabee> But it's so less stressful than looking at cars and try to be smart
23:36 <+fstd> i guess that would depend on the average number of cars in an empty intersection...
23:36 <+Gabee> lmao
23:37 <+Gabee> I really like germany too
23:37 <+Gabee> it's crazy the differences you encounter across the länder
23:38 <+fstd> i too like germany, but i hate the german obsession with rules
23:38 <@heinrich5991> come on
23:39 <@heinrich5991> norms [is that the word] are cool
23:39 <+fstd> literally yesterday someone called the police on me merely because i had accidentally and for the first time ever parked in their parking spot (thinking it was mine when mine was really the one next to it)
23:39 <+fstd> and the one next to it is literally always unoccupied (duh, because it is mine) and that person even knew it so they could easily have parked there
23:39 <+fstd> or put a note on my car or whatever
23:39 <+fstd> but nah, calling the cops it is
23:40 <+fstd> heinrich5991: norms are something entirely different imho
23:42 <+Gabee> calling the cops for that
23:42 <+Gabee> wow
23:42 <+Gabee> always knew the germans were that extreme
23:45 <+fstd> yeh we literally hitler
