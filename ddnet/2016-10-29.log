11:06 <@heinrich5991> deen: it seems that multi-codepoint confusables are not part of confusables.h. correct?
12:11 <@deen> yeah, i think so
14:15 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] elemongw opened pull request #576: Fix macOS server icon (master...fix-server-icon) https://git.io/vXLIt
17:54 <@Nimda> Unisex by Oblique just released on Brutal at 2016-10-29 17:52
21:30 <+Ryozuki> maybe add ddnet here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games
21:31 <@deen> Ryozuki: it's a wiki, do it yourself
21:32 <+Ryozuki> ok so to be sure,
21:32 <@deen> and there are probably many better known open source games missing on that list
21:32 <+Ryozuki> when ddnet was first released, what genre has ddnet?
21:32 <+Ryozuki> engine license
21:32 <+Ryozuki> content license
21:32 <+Ryozuki> and a description
21:33 <+Ryozuki> i wonder if hooking corners would be a valid  genre
21:33 <+Ryozuki> xD
21:33 <@deen> dunno, someone will remove your addition anyway
21:33 <@deen> and I'm a primary source, can't use me to get that information :P
21:33 <+Ryozuki> Who will do it?
21:33 <+Ryozuki> and why :O
21:34 <@deen> other editors, because ddnet not relevant
21:35 <+Ryozuki> i don't think they care if relevant or not

21:36 <@deen> you again...
21:36 <+Ryozuki> well won't do it anyway, nobody sees that page
21:36 <@deen> Ryozuki: well, do what you want
21:37 <@deen> wikipedia is widely read
21:37 <@deen> I think I always get a few visitors to my blog from Nim's page
21:37 <+Ryozuki> Teeworlds is on that list
21:38 <@deen> Teeworlds is widely better known than DDNet
21:41 <+Henningstone> DDNet is just a mod of a mod of Teeworlds if you will, thoughâ€¦
21:41 <+Ryozuki> deen considers it a game
21:42 <+Ryozuki> tw domain rank: 376898 ddnet rank: 404246
21:42 <@deen> Yeah, but I'm not an authority on what's a game^^
21:42 <+Ryozuki> not much difference
21:43 <+Ryozuki> i would say that if ddnet breaks teeworlds compatibility it would be 100% considered and independent game from tw
21:44 <+Ryozuki> and it would also let us do lot new features, who knows
21:45 <+Ryozuki> and maybe, ddosers stop, since it won't appear on teeworlds masterserver
21:45 <@deen> haha
21:45 <+Ryozuki> xD
21:45 <@deen> you live in a fantasy world :D
21:45 <+Ryozuki> i know :c
22:00 <+Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy
22:00 <+Ryozuki> this thing, it's one of the main reasons that people do dos
22:00 <+Ryozuki> damn human xD
22:05 <@deen> No, that's the reason: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun
22:05 <+Ryozuki> xD
22:06 <+Ryozuki> "Children having fun playing with snow"
22:06 <+Ryozuki> http://readme.io/
22:06 <+Ryozuki> nice page to make docs i think
22:07 <@deen> you're advertising for them?
22:07 <+Ryozuki> no, i want a proper ddnet doc
22:07 <+Ryozuki> xD
22:07 <@deen> documentation needs content, not a fancy looking website
22:08 <+Ryozuki> example doc
22:08 <+Ryozuki> https://tshock.readme.io/docs/
22:09 <+Ryozuki> The content can always be added (?)
22:10 <@deen> the design can always be added
22:10 <@deen> but the content is actually important
22:10 <+Ryozuki> i never said it isn't -.-
22:11 <+Ryozuki> I know you are a practical person, but some design doesn't hurt anyone :P
22:18 <@deen> eh, sure it hurts
22:19 <@deen> people used to do webdesign with nice images that contained the text, can't read them when you're blind
22:19 <+Ryozuki> eh.. well
22:19 <@deen> nowadays designers think it's nice to have no contrast, so my eyes hurt when reading their websites
22:19 <@deen> because black on white would be too simple!
22:23 <+Ryozuki> well then you have a problem with whole internet xD since most of websites do this xD
22:24 <+Ryozuki> well but atleast having some kind of documentation, even if it's black text on white screen
22:28 <@deen> I know: https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6
22:39 <+Ryozuki> read the first comment xD
22:55 <@deen> haha, ddnet client segfaults when you remove the demos directory while playing and cross the start line
23:00 <@heinrich5991> because errors are not checked in teeworlds :)
23:00 <@deen> yeah, but i rarely get random crashes
23:00 <@heinrich5991> the file open fails, returns a null pointer, which is later dereferenced when trying to write to a file
23:00 <@deen> just cleaned the demos directory because it grew too large and was surprised
23:00 <@heinrich5991> ah
23:03 <+Ryozuki> btw the forum doesn't have lot of contrast too :/
23:03 <+Ryozuki> and sometimes in night i get pain in eyes cause it's to bright xD
23:03 <@deen> you have to adjust your screen's brightness at night
23:04 <@deen> and not make all websites have less contrast because sometimes it's dark outside
23:06 <+Ryozuki> from what i read on ur link, designers do that to attract attetion to desired places
23:11 < fokkonaut> Hay
23:11 <+fokkonaut> He,
23:11 <+fokkonaut> Was geht
