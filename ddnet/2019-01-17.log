10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jxsl13 well is it compatible with savander's one?

12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Does anybody know why i'm like lagging in game but not really, like the chat is no laggy, emotes neither but like when I move its like if i have 500ms ping put i only have 20ms

13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @Learath2  it's a different ranking system. And every zcatch mode has its own table.
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or did you mean some other compatibility?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> interesting git diffs aspect there.
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @archimede67 cl_predict 1
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> already on 1 :/
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try local server
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> local is doin grat
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> local is doin great
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but idk why my prob happens when I join a server, but disappear after some time
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> and sometimes i don't have the problem
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its so weird
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it's because tw doesn't use real ping, i have that too sometimes, if you have real ping of 25 it's the same as if u have real ping of 10
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it's because tw doesn't use real ping, i have that too sometimes, if you have real ping of 25 it's the same as if u have real ping of 10(ingame ping is the same)
14:52 <@deen> tw 0.7 fixed that I think
14:52 <@deen> someone should port the fix
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we should just port to 0.7 :D:D:D
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> üòÑ
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> let's port 0.7 to 0.6
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> let's port 0.7 to 0.6.7
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> lets have 9999 ping again
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> not 1000
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> server don't shows my score after reconenct why?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> there is no problem about save i can saw my score with /top5
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was pretty against porting to 0.7, but 0.7 seems to be getting constant improvements and they don't seem to be hostile towards mods, maybe we should port sometime
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sometimes sound good
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
17:02 <@heinrich5991> also 0.7 has native 64 player support :)
17:02 <@deen> no physics problems for us?
17:03 <@deen> would be great to keep maps working
17:03 <@deen> and ranks same
17:03 <@deen> if that's ok, then I don't have anything against a port of DDNet to 0.7
17:03 <@deen> just sounds like a lot of work
17:07 <@deen> Would need to split it up into well-defined smaller tasks with some clear goals
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> map things changed
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont need to dilate
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess that would break lot of maps
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only looks tho
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if physics changed
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i wouldnt start updating ddnet yet
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks like they are still changing the protocol
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> 10 year long break bud
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or atleast its what i notice when i look fast on their discord
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> writer converter
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> write converter
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just embeed 0.6 stuff
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wayland works rly bad
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> Yeah it depends on what you want to do like for a basic usage such as sway, a console and a web browser, it can be all right
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt work correctly for 144hz
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its rly slow
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it even locks games
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> y i guess it's still far from perfect
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to less fps
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 60 fps feels laggy for me xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> ^
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> 60 fps doesnt even feel like 60 fps
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @onby do you use iomanip to format your chat/ server message output ? does the chat have the same spacing issues like rcon?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> cuz font/whitespace dont have the same width
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is "‰∫∫ÂΩ¢" displayed as large 88 in-game lol
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/535565817551650818/unknown.png
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so weird
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/535565867488903209/unknown.png
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lol nice
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i need that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :troll:
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you type it in chat it looks like MM but when you send it it looks like in clan tag
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/535566852202430487/unknown.png
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you type it in chat it looks like MM but when you send it it looks like in clan tag/name
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/535566852202430487/unknown.png
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in broadcast it's russian :D
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/535567197221945394/unknown.png
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> that's funny
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lul
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> shouldn't it be displayed as empty boxes
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> i don't know if ddnet is supposed to accept those characters, Èº¢Èª≥È∏•Âøç becomes "9999" when i type it in chat, i guess you could get different results with differents characters from the CJK Unified Ideographs unicode block
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> yeah that's strange, the server log gets the correct characters tho
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> display prob then
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like some utf8 decoding mistake
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> server just dumps them straight as it gets them
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> open a bug please if you guys don't find a fix so that we don't forget about it
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There seems to be a problem with master servers. master4.teeworlds.com (ddnet.tw) appears to be the only one working right now, so I forced the DDNet servers to register with it for now. Not sure if that's a temporary problem
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @deen  to force the usage of ddnet's master server, wa it some kind of masters.cfg file?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm, weird, sending heartbeats to master4, still not able to find my server using the browser :'/
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> sad life
