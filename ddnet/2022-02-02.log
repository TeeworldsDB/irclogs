14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> His nickname is Monty ðŸ˜„
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's a popular name in Scandinavia based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> His nickname is Monty ðŸ˜„ https://fi.linkedin.com/in/montywi
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> In the new hud, what about adding a status icon for some mates?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Very useful in gores to check if friends failed, because cannot easily pause/spec.
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's just an idea, instead of multiple zoom-.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> How would you handle 64 player teams?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Select you mates only.
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> You can even use chat, because of autocompletion.
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> set_local_mate_checker Wohoo Avolicious
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Up to, let say, 5 tees. 
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Then
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> unset_local_mate_checker
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Send cmd from chat to console, with some sintax, would be nice too
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Do you have to bei in the Same Team?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Save/load different configs?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But you could give IT a try ðŸ˜… imho would be to complicated to be used by Most users
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Why save/load config?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's a client side only indicator
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was implementing something like this back in the day, then people told me it'd be useless, so I never finished it up
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen why did you implement the super prediction with TEAM_SUPER instead of DDNetCharacter::m_Super?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think its a problem with the http master, since ddnet and other servers also have this.
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> especially with fuller servers
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Someone remember the map that faked hud icon?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> There was a map that simulated powered hook. 
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> In that map you are teleported to another identical zone, but everything is hookable.
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Hook icon appear because of parallax.
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably, didn't know about m_Super
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be better to use that, before release
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because the client should not think players are in a different team just bcs super is activated
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (idk if you fixed highlighting, for example)
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> + that wouldnt need a fix on other servers
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> FRA servers ok?
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> they seem laggy :c
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30181291
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this reminded me of you
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree with the top comments ^^
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> Sounds weird, but I can't run Arctic Frost on the client from source. Other maps works like a charm
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/938524769039573013/Screenshot_1.png
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> If you look at the logs, the map is loading and I am connecting to the server. But after the client requires too much memory and freezes on the loading screen
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/938524841089323108/MyLog.txt
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> simply dont use 32bit
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when I have a lot timeâ„¢, I'll cut down the memory usage ðŸ˜„
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> better not xd
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see why we can't display a certain map with 2GB
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will decrease performance
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doubt that it'll decrease performance
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, I think with the factorio technique, it'd actually increase performance
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt it will not
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt that
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> reusing images is probably slower
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then redrawing, if the scene is not complex enough
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://tenor.com/x1EU.gif
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how can that happen? each pixel needs to be touched at least once for rendering
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes but the GPU doesnt like to use memory it writes to
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this requires synchronization
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> (sorry for disturbance) ðŸ¥·
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, e.g. if you're zoomed out, it'll definitely improve performance
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the fps go down if I do that on my computer
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my computer can definitely support rendering a static image at 60fps, though
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only problem with zooming out is the maps extended rendering, but yeah it would improve it in this case
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you explain why factorio saw performance improvements? your reasoning would work against their results as well
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-333
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as said
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only worth if the scene is complex enough
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they only do it for the background
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems similarly complex to tw maps
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe it is not as good as they say in every case
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well try it out, i bet against it \:P
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Side note: You might ask, why do we bother with caching the terrain in the first place and not just re-render it from scratch every frame. Short answer is - because Factorio's terrain rendering is insane due to its complicated tile transition rules, and re-rendering it every frame is just not fast enough.
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that says something similar as you do
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cannot judge on that
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> And, the official ddnet 32bit release also cant run heavy maps. Looks like a huge bug
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> Ah, the official ddnet 32bit release also cant run heavy maps. Looks like a huge bug
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it can
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with gl 1.x
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also i'd prefer to let 32bit die
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why bother with it
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u on some arm machine
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 32bits in 2022
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is also a windows limitation
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on linux 32bit it seems to work
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its a single huge allocation that fails
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does linux have something like overcommit or smth
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my 32bit android phone can run that xd
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Moyoi are you on a 32 bit computer?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i guess windows allocation just chunks differently, i dunno what the exact difference is
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> nope, 64
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then use the 64 bit version, that should work
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Jupstar âœª: maybe address space exhaustion?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moyoi> yes it is, thx
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh i cant remember if i tried with LARGEADDRESSWARE
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe that can work too
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> AWARE\*
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but my phone is pure 32bit, so this is defs also a windows problem
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LARGEADDRESSAWARE gives you 4GB instead of 2GB on windows?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently yes
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what exactly it does, but it fixes allocations, there is a 4gb patch that fixed me some anno game in the past
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw todat is 2/2/2022
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Today*
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 2032 INCOMING
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 2038 INCOMING
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Popular wedding day, or why @Ryozuki? ðŸ˜„
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz its full of 2
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://archlinux.org/news/debug-packages-and-debuginfod/
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm i dont see any info about using this on aur packages
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki wait for 22.02.2022 ðŸ™‚
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> symmetrical
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That 32bit issue arises due to a complicated series of actions leading to the memory getting just fragmented enough that the new huge chunk wont fit
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/actions/allocations/
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For an instant there we basically have 2 copies of that massive vector on the heap, if one could rework that algorithm such that it can be done in-place, you could fix it
