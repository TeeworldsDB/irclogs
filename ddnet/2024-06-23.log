01:14 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what that means. But feel free to open prs I will have a look. Can’t promise I will merge anything. If you want to copy paste my code into yours also feel free to do so. I think I have no license file yet. But code I write is usually public domain or bsd 2. So feel free to do what ever with it. Credit is appreciated but not needed.
02:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> What's the best way to check if a server with a specific IP and port is running, in LAN and in Internet?
02:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> For Internet I assume just fetch the master json, and for LAN? Maybe send a serverinfo request?
02:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Is there maybe something that can be used for both equally?
02:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> E.g. serverinfo request might not work if a server uses whitelist (such as ger10 or my srv)
02:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> (I think)
02:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> oh wait actually, i can just use 0.7 protocol serverinfo || master json entry existing
02:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> or well, i just dont care about LAN maybe
02:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: I think you have to create a seperate loop here, there's a break: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/123a21bb016f5fd8e6b65819cb6a255313f49f11/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L2975-L2985
02:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> or dont break :troll:

08:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont get it fokko xd
08:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean if two players are being redirected at the same time only one at a time is being dropped?
08:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can't even remember writing that code i just remember its something heinrich pushed maybe i just copy pasted his recommendation 
08:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, sorry, I posted the link at a level hight than you understand
08:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
09:00 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> what script is used to add a new translation? 😄
09:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Does the server know it's own address?
09:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no
09:07 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thought so
09:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you can specify one in 0.7 iirc, but that's just a configuration thing.
09:07 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
09:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i believe master knows your IP if you register, but i'm not sure if master tells you what your ip is
10:28 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> can sb explain, how spectate_multiview works? I am selecting a client ID with select_multiview id, but the spectator view doesn't change, I am still in freeview
10:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we have multiview now?
10:29 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> ah, i need to set multi-view in the spectator view, okay
10:30 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> hmm, it doesn't split the screen tho
10:31 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Any ideas about client members leaks? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/4344365857079682566/?tscn=1719080070
10:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> memory?
10:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> cc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fnV_o2j0BE
10:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> Multi-view doesn't split the screen, it dynamically changes the camera position and zoom to cover multiple tees
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i already talked to him here on discord, we even tried a clean client.
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this must be outside of ddnet i guess. it could still be caused by ddnet, e.g. with a plugged in controller. But could aswell be some weird overlay or other stuff.
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @.doc_. do you have a controller plugged in?
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did you already try to reinstall windows? xd
10:59 <+bridge> <totar> Was the chat message leak fixed in the newest version
10:59 <+bridge> <totar> If there's some error message spamming the console every frame it will cause that on old versions
11:00 <+bridge> <totar> Was the chat message leak fixed in the newest version?
11:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> Yes, the leak when no logfile is set should be fixed in 18.3
11:02 <+bridge> <totar> The timing of 20-30 minutes for 10gb is pretty similar to what I was getting with 1 message per frame at 2000fps
11:03 <+bridge> <totar> you could just ask him to check f1 to see really quick
11:03 <+bridge> <totar> The timing of 30-40 minutes for 10gb is pretty similar to what I was getting with 1 message per frame at 2000fps
11:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he said it allocates 5gb already when starting here in discord
11:05 <+bridge> <robyt3> The entire console log would be useful
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least that was way to quick after just starting a fresh client
11:14 <+bridge> <robyt3> @.doc_. Please load this map in the editor (it should crash the client) and send the latest crash dump (`.RTP` file) from the `dumps` folder in your config directory. That should list all the loaded modules so we can see if any overlays or other 3rd party tools are involved.
11:14 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254364048305426493/crash.map?ex=6679390e&is=6677e78e&hm=68c004e275770e90bddc63e448bd56b33310c4214c2ef050b0afa4cfd96b5756&
11:15 <+bridge> <archimede67> When does this script get executed?
11:15 <+bridge> <archimede67> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/5c10e4ec7424c51954b33b02a44e4ee1e78f9883/servers/scripts/recalculate-points.py
11:16 <+bridge> <archimede67> I cannot find anywhere within the scripts themselves where it would be executed
11:17 <+bridge> <robyt3> It's executed automatically I guess once a night, or manually after renames
11:17 <+bridge> <archimede67> Well that was my guess, but looking at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/5c10e4ec7424c51954b33b02a44e4ee1e78f9883/crontab and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/5c10e4ec7424c51954b33b02a44e4ee1e78f9883/servers/scripts/update-everything.sh, it does not seem to get called
11:19 <+bridge> <.doc_.> i have a controller allways plugged in
11:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and have you tried to see if the problem is gone if the controller is not plugged in?
11:19 <+bridge> <.doc_.> wait a sec
11:21 <+bridge> <.doc_.> what is the normal ram usage
11:21 <+bridge> <robyt3> Not sure, but I guess the crontab file in the repository is outdated
11:22 <+bridge> <robyt3> Around 250 MB
11:22 <+bridge> <robyt3> (when starting)
11:22 <+bridge> <.doc_.> i think the problem is done the game does not go above 320
11:23 <+bridge> <meloƞ> was it fixed by you unplugging the controller? or smth else
11:23 <+bridge> <.doc_.> umpluging the controller
11:23 <+bridge> <meloƞ> should/could be related to #8509
11:23 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8509
11:23 <+bridge> <archimede67> Hmm that would explain, is it possible to update the scripts then? I'm trying to figure out how the `record_points` table gets filled and used
11:24 <+bridge> <robyt3> Please try downloading https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.30.4/SDL2-2.30.4-win32-x64.zip, unpack it, and replace the SDL2.dll in your game folder with the downloaded file, so we can test if this is fixed by the latest SDL version
11:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> & plug in controller xd
11:27 <+bridge> <.doc_.> in this folder? DDNet-18.3-win64
11:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> yes, copy `SDL2` from `SDL2-2.30.4-win32-x64` to `DDNet-18.3-win64`
11:28 <+bridge> <robyt3> then plug in the controller and check if the problem still happens
11:28 <+bridge> <.doc_.> ok
11:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> also check in the console (F1) that it shows version 2.30.4 as SDL version
11:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254367631075446907/image.png?ex=66793c64&is=6677eae4&hm=5ce20ce7f65ec075e87e3549f03a5cda5f6badc055b563893f1e5d5c6ba4eb8d&
11:30 <+bridge> <.doc_.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254367891923537920/image.png?ex=66793ca2&is=6677eb22&hm=839ec9d586476f6f80151f0bf33b7302e1bb9e69294becd10aaebdbf8096f3fb&
11:30 <+bridge> <robyt3> ok, does the memory keep increasing or is it fixed now?
11:31 <+bridge> <.doc_.> its fixed
11:32 <+bridge> <robyt3> does the controller work in the controls settings?
11:34 <+bridge> <.doc_.> yes
11:34 <+bridge> <robyt3> ok, thanks for testing. you can keep playing with the replaced `SDL2.dll` or without the controller for now
11:35 <+bridge> <robyt3> @0xdeen we should update SDL for next release, looks like the memory leak is fixed by updating
11:35 <+bridge> <robyt3> this issue is likely also fixed by updating SDL
11:35 <+bridge> <.doc_.> but i just tryed the controller in the steam version with this same version and didnt crashed
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @.doc_. also if you encounter memory going up again, please report it 😄
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but does RAM go up?
11:35 <+bridge> <.doc_.> no
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it only happens sometimes?
11:38 <+bridge> <.doc_.> Before it always happened but now it doesn't happen anymore and I'm not using the new SDL
11:38 <+bridge> <robyt3> Maybe new SDL version fixed the bad driver behavior, or by opening the controls settings and using the controller it fixed the driver-hiccup :thonk:
11:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or he restarted windows which restarted the driver
11:39 <+bridge> <.doc_.> na
11:39 <+bridge> <robyt3> You could try restarting and see if that brings the problem back :justatest:
11:40 <+bridge> <.doc_.> ok
11:40 <+bridge> <robyt3> (on the Steam version)
11:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
11:42 <+bridge> <.doc_.> ye now is growing the ram
11:49 <+bridge> <robyt3> Does the controller work in Steam version?
11:57 <+bridge> <.doc_.> if i plug in the controller the game crash
11:58 <+bridge> <.doc_.> but if i plug in before starting the game it increase the ram usage
11:58 <+bridge> <robyt3> ok, thanks for confirming, so it's definitely seems like updating SDL is necessary
11:59 <+bridge> <.doc_.> 👍🏾

15:48 <+bridge> <APFFF> What is triggering events like showing the freeze bar?
15:58 <+bridge> <learath2> In the extended character snap object, we have the tick when the character will be unfrozen
16:01 <+bridge> <learath2> If that tick is after the current tick, we render a freeze bar
16:01 <+bridge> <APFFF> Thats where say `RenderFreezeBar()` is being called?
16:02 <+bridge> <APFFF> Just trying to figure out the project, sorry if the answer to my question might be obvious
16:02 <+bridge> <learath2> `RenderFreezeBar()` is always called in `CFreezeBars::OnRender()` if the character is on the screen and has extended information available
16:03 <+bridge> <learath2> Then inside `RenderFreezeBar()` we check if the character is currently frozen using `m_FreezeEnd` `m_FreezeStart` and the current tick
16:03 <+bridge> <APFFF> Ah, so `CFreezeBars` is the one who's checking for conditions?
16:04 <+bridge> <learath2> That's how all our `CComponent`s are. They get called by a series of hooks and they handle on their own whether they need to do something or not
16:05 <+bridge> <APFFF> ah nice, exactly the information i was looking for!
16:05 <+bridge> <learath2> `src/game/client/component.h` for all the hooks available to you within a component
16:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 srsly
16:34 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> casually dropping 2k line pr bruv
16:34 <+bridge> <jxsl13> it's mostly the same 😂
16:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but epic stuff
16:35 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it was properly separated prs i would already have merged half of it
16:35 <+bridge> <jxsl13> broke some test, currently don't have time to investigate
16:36 <+bridge> <jxsl13> might have forgottenn to append to some byte slice or so
16:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i for sure would love to merge parts of it any chance you could split it up into separate prs so i can merge it tomorrow morning (for me)
16:37 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the problem is that once you start introduce error handling and error responses, everything start to become red
16:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im all sleepy head now but i will continue working on the project in around 10 hours
16:38 <+bridge> <jxsl13> will try to separate a little bit either today in the evening or tomorrow
16:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> amazing thanks if you won't make it till evening i might manually cherry pick tomorrow :D

16:47 <+ws-client> <Mazty> muahahaha
16:47 <+ws-client> <Mazty> easy to hack
16:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes
17:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 if you won't make it to split the pr until I wake up are you cool with me making up commit messages yoinking parts of the code and setting you as the commit author and then pushing straight to master?
17:26 <+bridge> <jxsl13> that's cool 🙂
17:26 <+bridge> <jxsl13> fine with me
21:13 <+bridge> <chairn> uh, why github messages are echoed twice ?
21:34 <+bridge> <jxsl13> because one is from the bot
21:37 <+bridge> <zhn> wasnt it documented already
21:40 <+bridge> <zhn> didn't find issue, nvm
21:40 <+bridge> <zhn> seems it just went thru #developer as always
21:53 <+bridge> <APFFF> How can you start a `debug session` (For Debug Logs) ?
