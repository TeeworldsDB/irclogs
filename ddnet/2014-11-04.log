01:09 < laxa> deen: idea for website, you should make the flag for favorite server for the last played month or something
01:09 < laxa> cause I still have german flag when I try to play on EUR/FRA whenever I can
01:26 < eeeee> as for usages yeah the demo player is what i had in mind. the shown demo is like 15 minutes long and only 1.1mb when gzipped (together with all the mapres .pngs)
01:27 < eeeee> if we fix the serverside demos then you'll also be able to navigate (unlike the youtube solution)
01:28 < Fifi> Some guys kicked me right after joining without a reason :( where should I go with it?
01:29 < Fifi> 95.172.92.151:8305 server
01:29 < eeeee> alternatively we could make a server have a special no-clipping mode for a dummy client which is gonna do the recording or streaming in a separate process, to prevent any interference with ongoing tournament server
01:29 < Fifi> (DDNet GER - Novice, one with GlassBox8 map
01:29 < Fifi> )
01:32 < Fifi> Hmm, I dunno, maybe that vote was a joke but the other tees f3ed, I joined again and they didn't kicked me, nvm. xD
01:32 < Fifi> Sorry for interrupting you :c bb
05:21 < o_be_two> hi
05:22 < o_be_two> hey deen , is mouse admin ?
05:22 < o_be_two> i hate force vote when i'm next to the finish -_-.
09:54 < laxadedi> o_be_two: probably aaa behind a fake name, otherwise, I have no idea.
09:57 <@EastByte> well I hope this doesn't repeat
10:02 < xRoThx> Hello
10:02 <@EastByte> hi
10:02 < xRoThx> How is it going? :)
10:03 <@EastByte> everything alright
10:04 < xRoThx> Ovh hosting isn't that reliable are most servers hosted with them? 
10:04 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
10:04 <@EastByte> most servers of tw or ddnet?
10:04 < xRoThx> ddnet
10:04 <@EastByte> nah only eur
10:04 < xRoThx> and r0x etc
10:04 < xRoThx> G@mer also works with OVH 
10:05 <@EastByte> yea
10:05 < xRoThx> isn't that smart I think
10:05 <@EastByte> why?
10:05 <@EastByte> depends on what plan you are using at ovh
10:05 < xRoThx> If they are sensitive for ddos attacks etc.
10:05 <@EastByte> ovh provides special ddos protections for gaming
10:06 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:06 < xRoThx> Really? Nice, where is it? Because I ordered cloud yesterday
10:06 <@EastByte> it seems to be not available in cloud vps
10:06 <@EastByte> I bet G@mer bought a professional server at ovh
10:07 < xRoThx> nfo sold out the ger servers.. So I had to order ovh to be able to make the webinterface install today
10:07 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
10:07 < xRoThx> I will check
10:07 <@EastByte> lol
10:07 < xRoThx> Thanks
10:08 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:09 < xRoThx> afk 15min
10:29 <@deen> o_be_two: i didn't see any players named "mouse" on GER and EUR today or yesterday
10:30 <@deen> laxa: i consider EUR/FRA/GER to be the same community and plan to fuse the flags together anyway
10:34 < xRoThx> laxa:  why would you do that? 
10:44 < xRoThx> They are all hosted seperated. Isn't it better to keep everything seperated aswell? 
10:45 <@deen> FRA isn't hosted anymore and EUR will be cancelled in a few days as well
10:49 <@deen> xRoThx: but nfoservers still can't get their ping issue resolved =/
10:50 <@deen> i always see my ping rise, even up to 120, and some other people as well
10:50 <@EastByte> one player on eur <3
10:50 <@deen> 2!
10:51 <@EastByte> yea
10:51 <@EastByte> I think the network stabillity of ger and eur are is pretty much the same
10:52 <@EastByte> in average
10:53 <@deen> GER didn't go down, even with the team-ddos they did at the last tournament
10:54 <@EastByte> well eur also has no downtime yet
10:55 <@EastByte> and the connecting issue has been fixed with the optionlist balance
10:55 <@deen> but ovh's firewall did weird stuff when the ddos happened, right?
10:55 <@deen> ping 250 on some ports
10:56 <@EastByte> ddos mitigation was enabled for a short time
10:56 <@EastByte> maybe it wasnt the firewall
10:57 <@EastByte> I got the mail on day afterwards
11:00 <@EastByte> hm, since the protetion only works from user -> server
11:00 <@EastByte> you could run every server on two ports and let just the one respond where the request arrived earlier
11:01 <@deen> ^^
11:08 < xRoThx> deen: I have ordered a FRA server Strassbourg
11:08 <@EastByte> a good thing is that a ddos protection mitigates the traffic directed to an ip and not the server itself
11:08 < xRoThx> I will use it for my webinterface but DDNET can host its tournaments on it
11:08 <@EastByte> it already would help to buy ~10 additional ips and run every server on a different ip
11:09 <@EastByte> that will distract attackers aswell
11:09 < xRoThx> EastByte:  Good idea
11:09 < xRoThx> I have 8GB ram & 6vCpu
11:09 < xRoThx> On ovh.. 
11:10 <@EastByte> which server did you buy ?!?!
11:10 < xRoThx> Not 100% safe.. But should be enough I guess
11:10 < xRoThx> Cloud
11:10 <@EastByte> link pls 
11:10 < xRoThx> http://www.ovh.nl/vps/vps-cloud.xml vps cloud 3
11:10 < xRoThx> to be able to upgrade after :)
11:10 <@EastByte> ah okay
11:11 <@EastByte> well EUR is vps cloud 1
11:11 <@EastByte> and afaik the vcore will handle 200 players without problems^^
11:12 <@EastByte> I think you should have bought a cheaper one and add additional ips instead
11:12 < xRoThx> I can keep this one and add additional ips :P 
11:12 <@EastByte> well it's your money
11:13 < xRoThx> Why is EUR running out in a couple days? 
11:14 < xRoThx> g2g now. Will talk later
11:14 <@EastByte> because I didn't tell deen that I wanted to extend it^^
11:14 <@EastByte> cya
11:15 < xRoThx> I can mail if you want
11:15 < xRoThx> materne.thomas@gmail.com
11:15 <@EastByte> okay
16:16 < Maple> sup
16:22 <@deen> hi Maple 
16:29 < NICOS> HII ddnetters
16:30 < NICOS> Hey Maple
16:30 < Maple> hai tehr
16:30 < NICOS> hey @deen
16:30 < NICOS> XD
16:31 < NICOS> I'm afk... if someone need some help for bug fix CALL ME
16:31 < NICOS> NICOS
17:27 < NICOS> NEED HELP? ASK ME
17:27 <@EastByte> NICOS: don't do that on irc
17:28 < NICOS> Why? IRC is created for say help to pro players
17:28 < NICOS> i just want to help people...
17:29 <@EastByte> you can help them when they ask
17:30 <@EastByte> and stop writing in caps
18:04 < laxadedi> idea : moderator on forum to remove any not-english thread !
18:04 < laxadedi> and posts too :)
18:29 <@EastBite> wtf is going on with quakenet
18:45 <@EastByte> funny
18:45 <@EastByte> huge netsplit, quakenet realises that about 10 minutes too late
18:45 <@EastByte> and people are getting G-lined
18:49 < laxadedi> Leaving work, bye <3
19:13 < o_be_one> :(
19:13 < o_be_one> Invite to priv please :)
19:14 <@deen> i still don't know how to do that^^
19:16 <@deen> o_be_one: ok, should be done
19:20 < o_be_one> ty :)
21:41 <@deen> Cool, they downgraded win32api in mingw and now ddnet doesn't compile anymore: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.user/44121
21:42 <@EastByte> hmm
21:43 <@EastByte> then stick to an older version^^
21:44 <@deen> it's not a problem for me, but if anyone else wants to compile using mingw
21:44 <@deen> i don't understand why, but somehow the window flashing functions aren't found
21:45 <@EastByte> hm
21:56 <@deen> hm, how to contact Deutsche Telekom about the daily ping problems?
22:01 <@deen> ahaha
22:02 <@deen> the ip that's causing the problem has been reported 2 years ago
22:02 <@deen> it had high packet loss back then and still does
22:03 <@deen> ouch, the thread is still active, 2 years later: https://forum.telekom.de/foren/read/service/internet-festnetz/internet-performance/unannehmbare-ping-zeiten,790,11067620,page=140.html
22:04 < Learath2> deen: mingw compiles fine
22:04 <@deen> Learath2: when did you install mingw?
22:04 < Learath2> i updated today
22:05 <@deen> yeah, but it matters when you first installed it
22:05 <@deen> which is totally stupid
22:05 < Learath2> well its been quite a while
22:05 <@deen> they downgraded a package, but when you upgrade it doesn't get downgraded
22:05 <@deen> for me it works with old installations, but not with new ones
22:06 < Learath2> what kind of errors does it throw ?
22:07 <@deen> in graphics.cpp & backend_sdl.cpp FLASHWINFO and FlashWindowEx are not known
22:07 <@deen> including windows.h doesn't help either
22:09 < Learath2> deen: could be fixed by some define trickery 
22:09 <@deen> yes, probably
22:09 < Learath2> let me install a new copy of mingw on a vm and see what i can do
22:09 <@deen> thanks
22:10 < Learath2> O_o i already have a VM
22:10 < Learath2> thats the first time i have a vm ready when i need it
22:17 < Learath2> deen: didnt test it but it looks like http://codepad.org/BjKigvTO should get it compiling
22:17 < Learath2> looks horrible
22:17 < Learath2> but enables FlashWindowEx and FLASHWINFO
22:17 <@deen> yes, horrible indeed
22:17 <@deen> hm
22:17 <@deen> that might break other stuff later
22:18 < Learath2> or could migrate to older FlashWindow
22:18 < Learath2> no idea if that even has the same capability tho
22:23 < Learath2> deen: http://codepad.org/Zxp4dZmI
22:23 < Learath2> should work as a replacement i guess
22:24 <@deen> tested or guess?
22:24 < Learath2> mingw is downloading 
22:24 <@deen> i think you would need a timer and stuff for that
22:26 < Learath2> i believe that is the concern of the OS but will see
22:31 <@deen> i explained the situation to nfoservers. i still hope they can get internap to consistently stop routing deutsche telekom users over gtt, because that seems to cause the problem
22:32 < Learath2> deen: src/engine/client/client.cpp:L62
22:32 < Learath2> already has the ugly define
22:32 <@deen> oh
22:32 < Learath2> should be able to move it up and it shall all be k
