14:31 <+ChillerDragon> yo fstd what irc setup do you run and why is it so unstable? o.O
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's his internet that's not gr8
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And he doesnt run a bouncer last I checked
15:49 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: have i disconnected more than once a day?
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> eh i did not count
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> but it is like noticble only you also having this fstd_ name  idk what irc magic that is
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> so you have no bouncer? How are you online that much then? o.O
15:51 <+fstd> i run irssi which connects to ircdenoise which connects to fagbnc which connects to freenode ;D
15:51 <+fstd> on my end, i don't notice anything about disconnects
15:52 <+fstd> best i can do, sucks to be on the other end ;P
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> haha sounds like a crazy setup
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> like in those movies where the hacker uses 7 proxies
15:52 <+fstd> well both those "proxies" run on localhost so there's that :D
15:52 <+fstd> i call them reverse bouncers
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> lol
15:53 <+fstd> fagbnc hides the disconnects and ircdenoise hides join/part/quit/nick spam of people who haven't talked in a while
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> so you only have logs of chat that happend during the time ur local machine is connected to irc√ü
15:54 <+fstd> yes i'm afraid i lose a minute or so per day
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> o.O
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> how do you have such a high uptime on your localmachine?
15:55 <+fstd> i guess by not running windows on it? ;)
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> fair
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> i also do not run windows but my laptop is at least standby during the time i sleep
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> or do you use some "server hardware" like a raspberry?
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> or would that be considered bouncer :D idk
15:57 <+Ryozuki> why run 2 proxies when ur client can do all that?
15:57 <+Ryozuki> well atleast weechat can
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> weechat masterrace
15:57 <+Ryozuki> https://blog.weechat.org/post/2008/10/25/Smart-IRC-join-part-quit-message-filter
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> weechat is so complicated tho
15:57 <+Ryozuki> https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#irc_smart_filter_join_part_quit
15:58 <+Ryozuki> its not complicated lol
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> it is!

15:58 <+Ryozuki> always asking questions
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> mimimi
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> yo Ryozuki can u recommand a fun techtalk?
15:59 <+fstd> idk i don't see a reason to change, i like irssi and this setup is pretty old
15:59 <+fstd> also i don't think wechat can hide my own disconnects from myself
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> im sure weechat can do everything
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> it can probably also run doom
15:59 <+Ryozuki> not a tech talk as is but fun https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8
15:59 <+fstd> also i wrote both "proxies" myself, so i have an emotional attachment to them
15:59 <+fstd> even if they're ugly af
