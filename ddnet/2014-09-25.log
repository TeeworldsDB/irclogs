00:31 <@deen> hi Maple 
00:31 <@deen> you missed GER going down forever
00:45 < Maple> why
00:45 <@deen> ddos was too strong
00:45 < Maple> gambol still at it?
00:45 <@deen> probably other people
00:45 < Maple> damn
00:45 < Maple> theyre really obsessed
00:46 <@deen> afterwards they ddosed FRA for 6 hours straight
00:46 <@deen> ddmax went down as a precaution
00:46 < Maple> lol
00:46 < Maple> ddmax still exists
00:46 <@deen> yeah, they more players when GER went down and FRA was lagging
00:47 <@deen> had*
00:50 < Maple> theres some lag in usa too
00:50 < Maple> idk if its related
00:51 <@deen> probably not
00:55 <@deen> I'm finally done with switching everything from GER to FRA
01:02 <@deen> too bad some can't play on FRA at all
01:16 < Maple> y not
01:24 <@deen> higher ping, lags
01:54 < Maple> higher by like 20
01:57 <@deen> +60 for some
02:16 < Maple> laxa when will you upload hall of fame vid, i want to show it to all my friends
02:22 <@deen> laxa is probably sleeping
07:40 < Savander> hi
08:05 < laxa> deen: hall of fame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_0XitBSS9U

08:18 < Savander> n1
10:21 < laxa_work> Find me an idea for a nimda plugin, I wont have much work this morning !
10:22 < EastByte> notify about ddos
10:22 < EastByte> or server down
10:22 < EastByte> like "chile went down"
10:22 < EastByte> "chile is back up"
10:23 < laxa_work> how could I know a server is being ddos ?
10:23 < EastByte> check whether the servers respond
10:23 < laxa_work> that doesn't mean he is being ddos 
10:24 < EastByte> right
10:26 < EastByte> btw. there is a bash exploit
10:27 < EastByte> env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
10:38 < laxa_work> I upgraded my server this morning, there was a bash upgrade, I guess to fix it no ? :)
10:42 < EastByte> right
10:54 < pause> Crazy vuln
10:55 < laxa_work> pause: your mac is still vulnerable I think :p
10:55 < laxa_work> mine too...
10:57 < pause> Yes it is
11:31 <@deen> thanks for the video, laxa
11:32 < laxa_work> artkis made this one
11:33 < laxa_work> not sure adding music was a good idea, I guess german won't be able to see it...
11:33 <@deen> that explains the music^^
11:34 < EastByte> I would rather enable ingame audio instead of adding music
11:34 <@deen> i agree
11:34 < laxa_work> We will do that for next videos I think. No music = no copyright / access problems
11:35 <@deen> i mute the music immediately anyway, but others may like the ingame sound
11:37 < Nimda> Simple World 3 by &lt;BÂµmM&gt; just released on moderate at 2014-09-25 11:36 : http://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate/#map-Simple_World_3
11:37 < laxa_work> Boahhhh
11:37 < laxa_work> I thought I had thought of everyproblems xD
11:38 < laxa_work> !php htmldecodeentities
11:38 < Nimda> Nothing matches your query, try search: http://php.net/search.php?show=wholesite&pattern=htmldecodeentities
11:39 <@deen> haha
11:39 < pause> PHP =/
11:39 < laxa_work> It's not a php problem...
11:39 <@deen> laxa_work: while you're at it, maybe it's better to link to ddnet.tw/releases
11:40 <@deen> because it gets updated immediately
11:40 <@deen> i don't update /ranks/ immediately because noone has a rank when it's released anyway
11:40 <@deen> I'll be gone all day, bye
11:40 < laxa_work> maybe later, I would need to change my regex etc
11:40 < laxa_work> bye
11:40 < EastByte> cya
12:03 < laxa_work> EastByte: can't get informations on ddnet.tw/status to know if a server is up or down :x
12:08 <@deen> laxa_work: Refreshes every 2 seconds i think: http://ddnet.tw/status/json/stats.json
12:08 <@deen> oh, actually every second^^
12:09 <@deen> online4 should be the interesting field
12:09 < EastByte> deen: you are still here
12:09 < laxa_work> I guessed that alone :p. Then doing such plugin should not be too hard.
12:10 < EastByte> you could also use my api to test the tw servers
12:10 < EastByte> since ddnet.tw can also be down :P
12:12 < laxa_work> ddnet.tw should not be down for more than 2 minutes now
12:12 < laxa_work> and to use your api, I would have to keep updated a list of ddnet country + port of one server
12:13 < EastByte> yep
13:17 < Savander> laxa
13:17 < Savander> you know about no-copyrights musics?
13:18 < Maple> lol the video
13:18 < Maple> the music is funny

13:22 < Savander> i used it
13:22 < Savander> to my videos
13:22 < Savander> i never have problems
13:22 < Savander> :)
13:22 < EastByte> we don't know what artkis used
13:22 < Savander> had*
13:22 < EastByte> he made the vidoe
13:22 < Savander> ok
13:22 < Savander> that's all
13:22 < Savander> on youtube
13:22 < Savander> now websites:
13:23 < Savander> http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/
13:23 < Savander> sometimes i used it
13:23 < Savander> https://machinimasound.com/
13:23 < Savander> so, that's all i guess
13:23 < Savander> ":)
13:23 < Maple> xD nice
13:23 < Savander> have fun with video making :D
13:24 < Maple> ;)
13:24 < Maple> if only there was software on linux for video editing
13:25 < Savander> Premier Pro should works?
13:25 < Savander> from adobe'?
13:25 < Savander> don't know, i use windows
13:25 < Savander> on mac works :PP
13:26 < Maple> maybe with wine
13:26 < Maple> never looked it out
13:26 < EastByte> nah
13:26 < Maple> :/
13:26 < Maple> brb
13:31 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/files/txt/royalty-free.txt
13:31 < Savander> xD
13:31 < Savander> WOW xD
13:57 < EastByte> http://www.openshot.org
13:57 < EastByte> seems to be promising
13:58 < EastByte> opensource video editing software based on ffmpeg
13:59 < o_be_one> hi
13:59 < EastByte> hi
14:00  * o_be_one takes a look on openshot
14:00 < EastByte> seems to be written in python
14:00 < o_be_one> they need a modern designer :(
14:10 < _KinG> hi all hi deen 
14:11 < _KinG> deen: bor talked with you about vps? ^^
14:11 < laxa_work> deen is away for the day _KinG 
14:11 < _KinG> omg
14:12 < _KinG> laxa_work:  bor came here?
14:14 < EastByte> !seen bor
14:14 < Nimda> I've last seen bor 9 days, 19 hours, 55 minutes and 39 seconds ago in #ddnet saying "deen: yes tnx".
14:14 < EastByte> !seen bor_
14:14 < Nimda> I don't know bor_.
14:15 < _KinG> omg lol
14:15 < _KinG> !seen bor
14:15 < Nimda> I've last seen bor 9 days, 19 hours, 56 minutes and 21 seconds ago in #ddnet saying "deen: yes tnx".
16:26 < _KinG> laxa_work:  u here?
16:27 < _KinG> anyone here? ^^
17:42 < Maple> theres a dislike on the video :(
17:42 < Maple> xD
17:42 < EastByte> haha
17:57 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/files/txt/royalty-free.txt - laxa_work  YOU SHOULD USE IT XD
18:19 < laxa> Savander: I didn't made the video, artkis did, otherwise there would have been no music.
18:23 < Savander> you;re weird
18:23 < laxa> ?!
18:23 < Savander> videos without music are boring
18:23 < laxa> use your own music and mute the video
18:23 < laxa> isn't it better ?
18:24 < Savander> no
18:24 < Savander> :D
18:24 < laxa> ...
18:24 < Savander> good videos need good montage, music, gameplay
18:24 < Savander> gameplay is good, but montage and music... xd
18:25 < laxa> We make simple videos
18:25 < laxa> we don't have time nor skill to do such things...
18:25 < EastByte> also the videos are not for entertainment?
18:25 < EastByte> but we should get some video makers into the boat of ddnet
18:26 < laxa> Yeah sure why not
18:26 < laxa> find it ! xD
18:27 < laxa> besides artkis, I don't know anyone in teeworlds that can do video editing
18:27 < Savander> shreko
18:27 < Savander> :P
18:27 < laxa> and I thought artkis would make more than just add music
18:27 < Savander> Magnet
18:27 < Savander> :P
18:27 < Savander> Urquell :P
18:27 < laxa> ok
18:27 < laxa> busy now
18:27 < laxa> coding : DDnetStatus plugin !
18:27 < Savander> :)
19:26 < Maple> got class brb
19:39 <@deen> back
19:39 <@deen> FRA getting ddosed since 18:50
20:38 < pause> Looks like ddos is everyday here xD
20:38 < pause> Gettin some love
20:49 < laxa> deen: !config ddnetstatus enabled yes
20:49 <@deen> !config ddnetstatus enabled yes
20:49 < Nimda> Config variable enabled for plugin DDNetStatus has been set to yes for channel #ddnet on quakenet.
20:49 < laxa> fully tested, even detects removal or new servers :)
20:50 <@deen> i just added GER, your script is too late :P
20:50 < laxa> boah :(
20:50 < laxa> thing is, it won't say when FRA is down
20:50 <@deen> FRA shouldn't go down
20:50 < laxa> new ger server ? or they gave you IP back ?
20:51 <@deen> somehow the IP came back after ~30 hours
20:52 < laxa> boah, I deleted all my GER favorites yesterday lol
20:53 <@deen> that's why we have the DDNet tab
20:53 < laxa> ddnetstatus plugin if some are interested : https://github.com/Laxa/Nimda3/commit/41a4e6955a428f2e3fb6eaeab8051fe08f3927e1

21:01 < EastByte> it was down for one second
21:01 < EastByte> ah
21:01 <@deen> it goes off and on every few minutes
21:02 <@deen> no idea what's wrong with chile
21:02 < laxa> so it should not spam too much

21:02 <@deen> udp not
21:03 < laxa> fuck, someone made a rank for me... I didn't asked for anything beh
21:06 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went down!
21:06 < EastByte> laxa: you should whitelist chile

21:07 <@deen> internet connection to these countries isn't stable either
21:11 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Chile went back online!
