15:45 < Savander> I thought and I said I'm too stupid for programming, when i reading something here, it's.. weird ^^. You making a lot of useful stuff, where i can do just calculator haha
15:53 < o_be_one> hi folks :)
15:59 <@EastByte> hellow
16:40 < heinrich5991_> deen: why are there two sound layers? :)

22:38 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3b7fca8 def: Initialize pReleasedString
22:49 <@EastByte> wut
22:50 <@EastByte> didn't know that kind of assignment is possible: char pReleasedString[60] = "\0";
22:50 <@deen> looks like it is!
22:51 <@EastByte> but wouldn't "" be enough then?
22:51 <@EastByte> since cstrings are implying the null terminator
22:58 <@deen> probably
23:06 <@EastByte> char testBuf[8] = "test"; results in:
23:06 <@EastByte> 4:   48 c7 45 c0 74 65 73    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x40],0x74736574
23:06 <@EastByte> looks quite efficient
23:33 <@deen> ddos on GER
23:34 <@deen> not tw specific, just 100 Mbit/s getting through
23:35 < eeeee> must be some random kid trying out his 1337 h4x0r skillz
23:37 <@deen> hm, no. actually sent to the Blocker#2 server
23:37 <@deen> but doesn't cause any load, strange
23:42 <@deen> oh, big packets instead of many, weird strategy
23:47 < eeeee> yeah as i said sounds like someone is making their first steps in ddosing. ddnet is used as a ddosing tutorial now :P
23:50 <@deen> haha
23:54 <@deen> i think it's the same 5 people all the time
