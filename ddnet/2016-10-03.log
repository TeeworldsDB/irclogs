12:01 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menus.cpp#L832
12:01 <@deen> lafumafin: grep would've helped
12:01 <@deen> or a code search on github: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22Loading+DDNet+client%22&type=Code
12:02 <@deen> translated to an awesome number of 2 languages!
12:02 <+lafumafin> no didn't  not in the src i have. i don't have std ddnet src
12:02 <+lafumafin> but anyay thanks for help
12:02 <@deen> just edit the binary, who needs source code
12:05 <+lafumafin> mhmm thanks
12:44 <+laxa> Hey guys
12:45 <+laxa> There was a german CTF this week-end (security competitions), and there was an easy challenge that was to find the name of logos.
12:45 <+laxa> Teeworlds was on the logos page lol !
13:23 <+lafumafin> so fame :D
13:23 <+lafumafin> have a name of that competition?
13:24 <+lafumafin> deen, btw i am talking about actual ATH src
13:36 <+laxa> lafumafin: tumctf. url is: ctf.link
14:02 <+lafumafin> tthx
14:31 <+mrQ> Hey @all! Did anyone face with the problem on adding Tuning param to src/game/tuning.h? The server bam doesn't show any error, but after running it, rcon console stops working at all.
14:31 <@deen> mrQ: yeah, that sounds like something i remember
14:32 <+mrQ> oh, how did you solve it? What was the problem? I just don't get it
14:33 <@deen> you have to adjust the total number somewhere i guess
14:33 <@deen> or recompile the client as well
14:33 <@deen> or add a new version to the client to send a bigger tuning only to clients that support it
14:33 <@deen> search for VERSION_DDNET_EXTRATUNES I guess
14:34 <+mrQ> Thanks a lot, I'll try it now
14:38 <+mrQ> So, if I don't want to recompile the client, I should increase VERSION_DDNET_EXTRATUNES by 1 in src\engine\shared\protocol.h?
14:39 <@deen> nope
14:40 <@deen> you can add a new VERSION_DDNET_ANOTHERTUNEYAY and check for it in gamecontext.cpp
14:54 <+mrQ> I got the idea. But all the clients will have m_ClientVersion < VERSION_DDNET_ANOTHERTUNEYAY, so does it means that they can't use this tuning or they just don't see it, but it will work anyway?
14:54 <@deen> right, you can't send the client new tunings if it doesn't support them
14:55 <@deen> so it can just work serverside
14:58 <+mrQ> Maybe I just look in wrond direction. I just need a simple bool variable that should be avaliable on map config file: enables with the special map and resets to default when the map changes back
14:58 <@deen> yes you are
14:58 <@deen> tunings are for stuff that needs to be predicted by clients
14:59 <@deen> edit config_variables.h and edit gamecontext.cpp at m_SvDDRaceTuneReset to reset the value
15:01 <@deen> or variables.h, i can never tell the difference
15:01 <+mrQ> Awesome idea about SvDDRaceTuneReset. I think it solves my problem =)
15:02 <+mrQ> every map change will reset the variable. Now I'm feeling nooby xD
15:02 <+mrQ> Thanks!
