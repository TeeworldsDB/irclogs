17:12 < bridge> <title4015> th)
17:42 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks this is one for you, feel free to angrily hit me with a hammer
17:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> 25th baam mentioned? üëÄ
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am not angry, I am disappointed
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> üôÅ
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is it not clear to you that all you do is offload the work elsewhere
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in this case to the rasterizer discarder
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> yesn't, it's clear to me that this work is offloaded elsewhere, but I didn't know out of the H√ºfte which part of the graphics pipeline does this
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> > This only works bcs your GPU is not the bottleneck.. Test your changes on some laptop with integrated graphics too
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> 
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> As I already stated in the issue, a hybrid approach might be good. Do you know if we can somehow determine if a direct call would be better or not?
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think it's not really worth it, do we have zooming out problems?
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A hybrid would be to swtich if the full map is in view
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (or almost)
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> I think not as much as you think (at least on my setup) like the benchmarks even show improvements (or at least almost equal) on really wide maps
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> but yes we could determine X0/XR width vs map width ü§î
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's only a cpu optimization and only for zoomed out maps
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and idc if we have 50fps less when zoomed out far.. you cannot play then anyway
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> top prio to me is and always been to give best gaming experience
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> not necessarily, you can benefit from this optimization even on normal zoom
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> this is, ofc, highly map dependend
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my pc maybe
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the avg case
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah wow.. ctf1 or what xD
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> think in terms of details, sometimes mappers just use a tilelayer for a small part of a map
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> yes, a lot of maps are just one tilelayer for everything and gib ihm
18:04 < bridge> <Assa> I'll set it up as draft for now, I'll create benchmarks with my laptop (integrated graphics) and maybe switch to a hybrid approach
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or close pr
18:09 < bridge> <Assa> btw, yes we do.
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
18:46 < bridge> <Assa> for me as well, I thought about this further, do integrated circuits even ever support vulkan or ogl3?
18:47 < bridge> <Assa> one google search later, yes they _may_ do
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> What does that mean really?
18:58 < bridge> <Assa> this is important here, because the optimization above only applies to buffered rendering
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> No like what do you actually mean by "support vulkan or ogl3"?
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> 
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> Intel Battlemage only really has support for VK e.g.
19:01 < bridge> <Assa> I just read it up, I wasn't sure if onboard gpus (or integrated gpus) support stuff like this at all, or how they handle vram
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> (gl and dx are done with driver translation on that architecture)
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, igpus
19:01 < bridge> <Assa> yes
19:02 < bridge> <Assa> because jupey is right, in my case, the gpu is just bored and offloading to it gains more performance, but here the benchmarks might not generalize well
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> can someone explain to me how passkeys are actually secure? it seems to defeat 2fa for local attackers
19:19 < bridge> <Assa> you mean like passkey, the password manager, or a passkey on an ssh key?
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> It's a "new" tech, basically a u2f that is inside your device
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> so it allows your device to become a second factor
19:23 < bridge> <Assa> I don't understand how a second factor **ever** can be on the same device
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> Well technically it goes even further, it's actually passwordless
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> Hence my difficulty in understanding how this can ever be secure, if anyone ever has access to my device it's over
19:27 < bridge> <learath2> Like it's maaybe secure if you use a hardware source of security, create them with a private key that can't be extracted, then have that require a long passphrase then we are back to a password manager level of safety
19:28 < bridge> <Assa> that's what a tpm is for, still doesn't protect you from literally stealing your device or gaining access to it
19:29 < bridge> <python311> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428072190011506718/fido2-sequence.png?ex=68f12b5e&is=68efd9de&hm=dd2e6b2a4ac95965051fc8fd92787c4459c0b3d97dbb169ff3e4bb4426ddf50c&
19:29 < bridge> <python311> And by keeping it separate from your PC, somewhere safe it adds an additional layer
19:29 < bridge> <Assa> a yubikey has a similar protocol, but it's a key you can remove from devices
19:30 < bridge> <learath2> I log into my computer, I forget to lock it and leave it unattended for 5 minutes. Does that imply that everyone can log into anything I have?
19:31 < bridge> <Assa> yes, but this even applies if you have your second factor on your phone and you're logged in üòÑ
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah this one is sane, you can literally not extract the private key from those without an electron microscope
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> but that one I know is my second factor, I'd never leave it anywhere ever, especially not unlocked
19:32 < bridge> <Teero> I'm buying
19:32 < bridge> <Assa> yes, but when you're already logged in it doesn't matter, even if you do 5FA
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> this passkey thing turns my one critical device into 50 and password managers also store these, so if I make a catastrophic mistake and leak my password manager db, now not even 2fa can save me
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> Well logged in to the website, this makes logging into the computer the sole root of trust. After that you are instantly sudo
19:33 < bridge> <Assa> I am talking about leaving your device open logged in unattended
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not permanently logged in on anything important, they can look at my mail and my github I guess
19:34 < bridge> <Assa> like no matter how many locks you put on your car, if you let the keys in it and let the door open, everybody can steal it
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> and a lot of sites ask for 2fa when doing anything important even when logged in, e.g. github
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> idk, I think I'll be steering very clear of these passkey things unless maybe someone starts providing one that I can physically remove the private key and have it on me
19:36 < bridge> <Assa> at work I was already annoyed, because I am forced to use 2fa, and since we don't get a buisness phone, they recommend using a 2FA manager on your system
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> This one is insane, my password manager has the same oxymoron, it lets you store 2fa and the password in the same place
19:37 < bridge> <Assa> it is insane, I told them they are insane, but they are doing it so you are annoyed and just use your private phone.
19:37 < bridge> <Assa> they just can't force you to use your private phone
19:38 < bridge> <louis> you usually have to input pin or equivalent each time u want to use a passkey tho
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> Well the one job I had pushed me into that too, but honestly idm having one more in my 2fa app
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all hardware after 2016 supports vulkan
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also phones
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that's nice, I wonder how well the OS protects the passkeys from extraction
19:39 < bridge> <Assa> they are literally encrypted on the hardware, without your master password you can't extract them
19:40 < bridge> <Assa> they are literally encrypted on the harddrive, without your master password you can't extract them
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> I highly doubt that, this computer I'm on doesn't even have a TPM new enough to support windows 11, it has passkey support
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> I'd guess it just stores them normally encrypted by your "master secret" whatever microsoft uses for that on windows
19:41 < bridge> <Assa> you don't need to, you need to unlock a password store with your master password in order to use it, like an actual master password that you need to remember (not some hidden tpm value)
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> you changed that to "on the harddrive" yeah that's what I guessed too
19:42 < bridge> <Assa> harddrive is also hardware ü§ì
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it's still far more secure than what most people do with their passwords tbh
19:44 < bridge> <Assa> as long as you don't use the same password everywhere, including your password manager ...
19:44 < bridge> <Assa> or have the master password written on a note next to your computer ... man I worked in the IT of a business, some people, how do they even remember to breath
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> That's a huge issue especially with older people
19:52 < bridge> <timakro> Help SQl people, I got so frustrated with this query that I even created a Stack Overflow question https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/347994/slow-best-so-far-query something I haven't done in years

20:45 < furo> @timakro This is how I solved it when I wanted to do something similar. It's not a single query that you may want, but runs in under a minute on the entire DDNet database https://p.fr33tux.org/248b35 (example with postgresql, but easy to port to MySQL)
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> I mean it's probably correct, but I doubt it really says much. China could not have inherited billionaires rn because china was extremely poor within our grandparents lifetimes
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> I think I tricked myself to thinking SQL is actually smart away to do my query (which is squared time if you do it in the naive way) in linear time, especially if you write it as a window function. But I guess it just isn't i'll try a variable based approach, something like this which I can't see not being linear time:
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> 
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> ```
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> SELECT Map, Name, Timestamp, Time
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> FROM (
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>   SELECT
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     Map,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     Name,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     Timestamp,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     Time,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     @is_new := IF(@prev_map = Map AND Time >= @best_time, 0, 1) AS is_new,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     @best_time := IF(@prev_map = Map AND Time < @best_time, Time, IF(@prev_map != Map, Time, @best_time)) AS best_time,
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>     @prev_map := Map AS prev_map
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>   FROM record_race
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>   JOIN (SELECT @best_time := 999999999, @prev_map := NULL) AS vars
20:47 < bridge> <timakro>   ORDER BY Map, Timestamp
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> ) t
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> WHERE is_new = 1
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> ORDER BY Map, Timestamp;
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> ```
20:47 < bridge> <Assa> on the website they further analyze and descirbe their data a bit, apparently Europe is really different from the rest of the world
20:47 < bridge> <timakro> I think I tricked myself into thinking SQL is actually smart enough to do my query (which is squared time if you do it in the naive way) in linear time, especially if you write it as a window function.

20:48 < bridge> <Assa> I had in mind, that 80% of the billionaires are by inheritance, well, yes in germany, but this is not correct for the rest of the world
20:48 < bridge> <learath2> Does not surprise me one bit. Europe dominated the world for so long and so long ago. It's not weird that they have lots of inherited billionaires
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> "source: forbes", so its probably more
20:48 < bridge> <zhn> can they add category for corruption money wealth lmfao
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> if someone inherited the wealth they wont declare it to forbes imo
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> If they do that turkey would be 80% corruption üòõ
20:49 < bridge> <zhn> russia had none of such amount of self made billionaires
20:49 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> Well they personally did the corruption. So it is self-made technically
20:50 < bridge> <Assa> now I'd need to lookup the history of this in germany, I guess ww2 and the cold war with west/east split wasn't helpful for that
20:50 < bridge> <zhn> inherited from the state :troll:
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> Even if y'all lost your previous billionaires, afair ww2 has been great in minting lots of new ones, who by now have left their wealth to their children
20:58 < bridge> <Assa> this goes in both ways, like some people got robbed of everything, others benefitted from the system, I think a famous example was Volkswagen
