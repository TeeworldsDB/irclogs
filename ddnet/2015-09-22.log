01:16 < fgfgf> >>@deen> anyone want to add support so that ddnet servers can run on multiple sql server backends?
01:16 < fgfgf> Maybe better to do it with external soft without implementing it in ddnet server?
01:17 < fgfgf> something like mysql proxy
01:17 < fgfgf> http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-proxy/en/mysql-proxy-using.html
01:19 <@deen> fgfgf: sure, if that works well with little resources
09:29 < o_be_two> hello :)
09:30 <@EastByte> hellow
09:30 <@EastByte> yesteray we tested a vps with voxility ddos protection, didn't work out well
09:31 < o_be_two> oh ? bad ddos protect ?
09:32 <@EastByte> udp got immediatly black holed on ddos
09:38 < o_be_two> :/

12:53 < devnull> gello tyurd
12:53 < tyurd> hi devnull
15:25 <@EastByte> deen: gametown-projects seems pretty new and unstable, I ordered a cheap openvz just for testing
15:26 <@EastByte> pretty funny, I cannot login on the main site because my customer ID is not known and the webinterface is spaming me with password reset messages
15:27 <@EastByte> also they sent me the wrong openvz container information (not my containers ip address & password)
16:05 < tyurd> hi, which linux distro you would recommend for development and some gaming (teeworlds and CS:GO)?
17:43 <@deen> EastByte: well, i could've told you that^^
17:44 <@deen> EastByte: but i'm more worried about the ddos protection and they're not providing that, voxility is
17:47 <@EastByte> "Unser Hauptziel ist die Entwicklung eines eigenen Webinterfaces. Mit diesem Kunden freundlichen Webinterface können Sie problemlos und übersichtlich Ihre gemieteten Server verwalten."
17:47 <@EastByte> their main goal is to make a webinterface, so...
17:50 <@EastByte> hm, I wonder how much control (ddos protection) a cheap hoster gets by renting services voxility
17:53 <@EastByte> the owner of gametown-projects probably just rented hardware at voxility and expected it to work in every case
17:58 <@deen> eeeee: you're aware that teewebs doesn't find any servers currently? you were running the serverlist program on GER2, we can move it elsewhere if you want
18:00 <@EastByte> what abuot putting the list in a ddnet repository (github)
18:00 <@deen> EastByte: our json?
18:01 <@deen> or the one for teewebs?
18:01 <@EastByte> the teewebs srv list
18:01 <@EastByte> but for our list it's nice aswell
18:01 <@EastByte> since we are heavily using http in client already
18:01 <@deen> dunno, i think it's auto-updated by some javascript program of eeeee 
18:01 <@deen> i didn't look into how it works
18:06 < o_be_two> EastByte: lol about gametown ..
18:11 <@deen> I still have high hopes for o_be_two's Strasbourg server
18:11 <@deen> that could solve our GER problems
18:12 <@EastByte> we don't know yet how aggressive the ddos protection/mitigation is
18:12 <@deen> everyone should be able to live with ping +4 compared to Frankfurt
18:12 <@deen> yeah, but o_be_two can tune it? :P
18:12 <@EastByte> hopefully

21:25 <@EastByte> deen: thanks for fixing
21:35 < Henningstone> ger 50 average ping :/ some lag spikes inbetween
21:48 < Henningstone> and ger2 down now??
21:50 <@EastByte> Henningstone: GER2 is hosted on a new server, unfortunatly weak against ddos attacks
21:50 <@EastByte> and GER has routing problems as usual
21:50 < Henningstone> best requirements to play... :)
21:51 < devnull> just play on the chl. servers
21:51 < devnull> with a 250 ping :D
21:51 < Henningstone> ofc, it's just an extra challenge :P
22:01 <@deen> I'll try to cancel GER2, pretty useless server
22:03 < devnull> you gotta use anti-ping on a server with high ping
22:03 < devnull> good god you'll need to pukle
22:03 < devnull> puke*
22:15 <@deen> meh, spent so many hours on that server, nothing works and they don't even allow cancelling it
22:17 < devnull> http://img.nonreal.de/a212b4.webm
22:18 < devnull> you can't cancel the server deen?
22:24 <@deen> devnull: nope, they only allow cancelling the server if you never logged in on it!
22:24 <@deen> devnull: you're supposed to disable antiping when you're not draggin someone
22:25 < devnull> i see. but its boring that way :D
22:25 < devnull> but i didnt know that
22:25 <@deen> well, now i have a bad vps for 3 months, will see what i can do with that
