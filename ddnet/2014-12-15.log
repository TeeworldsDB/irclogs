01:27 < eeeee> deen: check this out http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html
01:27 <@deen> wow, how's it connecting?
01:27 < eeeee> through a proxy  :/
01:27 <@deen> ah
01:28 <@deen> hm, it worked once, then I closed the site and now it can't connect^^
01:28 < eeeee> prolly because of max clients per ip :P
01:28 <@deen> argh
01:28 < eeeee> if you didnt disconnect cleanly you have to wait till they time out
01:29 <@deen> set the max clients per ip to 64 on that server, still not working
01:29 < eeeee> oh yeah
01:29 < eeeee> my bad
01:29 < eeeee> proxy is not exactly stable 
01:29 < eeeee> try again
01:30 <@deen> awesome
01:30 < eeeee> whole proxy is a 10 line node.js script atm, with no error handling
01:31 < eeeee> not sure if i should try to improve it or hack some websockets into teeworlds instead
01:31 < eeeee> latter would solve the max client per ip issue as well
01:32 <@deen> i think hacking websockets in would not be that hard
01:32 < eeeee> i thought that too but even node solution didn't really work out of the box
01:32 < eeeee> i had to dig into the source and disable some frame compression feature
01:33 < eeeee> then it started working
01:33 <@deen> weird
01:33 < eeeee> protocol is convoluted
01:37 < eeeee> deen: sup with the server. i think it broke
01:37 <@deen> eeeee: sorry, my bad^^
01:37 <@deen> eeeee: i connected with 64 dummies
01:41 < eeeee> shit it crashed
01:41 <@deen> i see
01:44 <@deen> really impressive
01:45 <@deen> good night
01:45 < eeeee> nite
01:45 < eeeee> i think i'm done for today as well
