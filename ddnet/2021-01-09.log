02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I fixed the teehistorian2demo tool for 0.7 messages and 64p support
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you push it to the mod tool?
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @heinrich5991 thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Cheated top1 on "Thomas"?
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> or is it. May be legit
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> no, don't think so
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> can we ban him after you confirm its cheated?
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> legit rank
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> why not ban u, i think is better
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> :troll:
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> does tw need a lot of data? i use my phone internet now so i dont lagg but i only have 5GB per month
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ~10 KB/s
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 26 MB/hour
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 36 MB/hour
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cant get much less than this i guess
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thanks
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> playing 4 hours every day u waste 4gb a month more or less
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok its 5gb*
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well its a lot less that i feared
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt count map download
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i just wanna tryhard a map rn thats all
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe if its a solo map it is even less data
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> definitely
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont see other tees
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it didnt lagg for 2 hours but ofc i get a big spike once im a bit further into the map
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/797416176300720138/screenshot_2021-01-09_11-46-02.png
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> just my luck
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen what do u think about moving the debug info below the shields
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we should remove the shields and hearts
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on the map 'Vesper' on solo, there are 2 tiles in the switch layer with weird unused tileflags: `0b00100100` at x=45, y=50 and `0b10101100` at x=46, y=50
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/797432658347032586/Vesper-fix.map
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fix is reproducible with https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/master/src/bin/fix_map.rs
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `fix_map --ddnet --zero-unused-tile-parts Vesper.map Vesper-fix.map`
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> note that only the lower 4 bits of the tileflag byte are used
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> -> and of them the third lowest bite (0b0100) is the OPAQUE flag which is only for tiles layers
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> how do you show these graphs in debug mode :HuhChamp:
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> first ctrl+shift+d  then ctrl+shift+g
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @NeXus  first ctrl+shift+d  then ctrl+shift+g
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What was the command to safe records in a file?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> serverside? they're saved to a file by default
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea to sqlite3 files even nowerdays hm?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Trafalgar Law get wire again or join this discord if you want to chat w me https://discord.com/invite/ADhSwpt or find ingame but pls no middle mans :/
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can the rank website also show hours instead of minutes?

17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro ^
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So the answer is yes? xD
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thanks
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I happened to have one
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I just was about to commit this xD
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> guessed it
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also the typecast thing? oO
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see the {} thing
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> No
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What is that
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 'typecast' is not followed by whitespace.
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `(Boolean) abc`
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Eww
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> yikers got a few system crashes today and now even teeworlds is affected :/ zlib randomly fails to load mapres and sometimes some mapres are in these rainbow colors xd
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> its getting worse and worse seems like i have to burn my system with fire soon
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> any known places where i could have files that i forgot to backup? I feel like i have 0 files on my device that i need to backup but im not sure 
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried gdb?
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> me?
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> on what exactly
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the programs that crash
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or on the coredumps they produce
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> gdbing firefox sounds hard 
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gdb firefox
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> also debugging the whole system sounds out of my scope
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then check some coredumps
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> u sure i can just run gdb firefox
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> This is a great and super short gdb guide https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> i know gdb :)
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> i also know beej he is cool guy
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I continued with my embedded quadcopter project and finally learned a little bit of gdb
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The only thing I knew before was `gdb blabla` then `run`, wait for the crash `bt`
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> well for simple exectuable thats the case
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> when u start to debug things like firefox the kenrnel or ur wm its a bit more setup to do
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's all ChillerDragon needs to know for debugging a random program on his computer üòâ
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> ``gdb -ex=run firefox`` doesnt work as i expected
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe firefox is special due to its multi-process architecture
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You can do fancy stuff like showing the disassembled instructions in tui mode `layout asm` and stepping through them `si`
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> firefox keeps running even if it crashes or only invididual tabs crash etc
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye ik
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wait -ex just runs the command after startup?
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if there is anything simpler i can debug but all the things that make trouble are so nasty
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh i need that actually
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teeworlds can simply be put into gdb
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> i use it to create automatic backtrace logs and restart tw server
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> ye tw doesnt crash yet just a few random failures in zlib
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i'm constantly typing `arm-none-eabi-gdb` and then `target extended-remote localhost:3333` to connect to openocd
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> use .gdbinit
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but can you tell me why you completely ignore my advice to look for coredumps?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> coredumpctl
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea cuz idk how to search or active them
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then say that, not ignore me, please üò¶
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> sry xd
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> i expected something like google it as answer
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does coredumpctl?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> say?
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> show a list
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610210975.png
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it coincide with crashes you remember?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially those with corefile != missing
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> ye loosk good
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211035.png
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> get the coredump out of coredumpctl (check --help) and debug it with gdb
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Core_dump#Examining_a_core_dump
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice there is even auto start debugger with "debug"
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Now I know what a coredump is ^^
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211170.png
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> useful for debugging after the fact @timakro
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> but yikers firefox coredumps
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is coredumpctl systemd?
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> think so
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but coredumps are linux
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> you can either create a file in current dir or send it to a application like coredumpctl
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep, the kernel writes them obviously
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=core
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> creates files directly with the name core instead of using coredumpctl as far as i understood
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you list all threads?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (idk how)
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211336.png
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> oh vscode doesnt start at all maybe i can debug that boi
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> ye too bad ``gdb code`` doesnt work either
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is this firefox?
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> file $(which code)
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for me, /usr/bin/firefox is a shell script
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence gdb won't work
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye same w code
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check what it calls and call it manually I guess üòâ
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> electron wrpapper
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> its running js
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure where to slap gdb here xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211610.png
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after exec
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> well i guess i can try running electron with gdb and this js arg
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> yea
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> lemme try
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> LMAO
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> it works with gdb attached
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> xd
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm crashed
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> here's your fix
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> no stack
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no stack?!?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did it crash in a subprocess? :/
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> maybe electron yea
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check coredumpctl
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> its there
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debug it üòâ
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> if i knew how to get it xd
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't you just do it with firefox? ^^
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> i passed "debug" option to debug the first present one
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> ah it takes matches
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> maybe "debug electron"
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> hackerman
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> also libthread
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211838.png
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> its getting better an better xd
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610211869.png
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Where do the debug symbols even come from? Do distros compile their stuff with -g?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> relwithdeb
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro function names are always there
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debug symbols give you line, variable name information
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these function names are used for dynamic linking. everything that's not declared `static` in C is there
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ahh, right, has to be
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: is `info proc mappings` available for coredumps?
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> yes its there but is a lot
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check in which library it crashed I guess
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> i thought it is libpthreads
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you see that?
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> when the coredump is loaded
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> read wrong
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> i never used proc mappings what am i searching
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says what memory areas are mapped
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check where your execution is and check in which area it is
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610212601.png
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> hmm so the mapping starts at  0x555555554000 but the crash is already in 0x000055555ab2942d ?
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> i guess thats why it says ``in ()`` in the backtrace becuase its not mapped?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> isn't it in the second mapped region?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 6 < a < c
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> ah lol sure me brainded
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye so electron crashed in electron
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> so far so good
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> good to know üòÑ
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you know it's easier with a microcontroller where my binary is <1k and the only library is newlib
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> also debugging tw is easier
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> seems like i have to buy a new arch linux
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm trying since 1h to talk to the bluetooth chip on my drone but it's not answering! And I can't check if the serial connection even works because the connection is just hardwired on the board
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610216122.png
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea but this is libpthread for sure
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is sendmsg in libpthread? ^^
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> like sending a msg to a thread idk?
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> or do you think it is networking stuff that crashes multithreaded?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `man sendmsg`
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sendmsg ‚Äî send a message on a socket using a message structure
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> oof why do u have a man i dont?
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610216386.png
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> wait so its a syscall right does that mean it crashed in my kernel?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> so userland gdb wont even catch it?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ pacman -Qo /usr/share/man/man3/sendmsg.3p.gz
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /usr/share/man/man3/sendmsg.3p.gz is owned by man-pages 5.09-2
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not crashing in the kernel
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would be a kernel oops or a kernel panic
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> nice packet ima dl it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing that would generate a coredump
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only functions that have external linkage btw
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are those that are not marked with `static`
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh missed your follow-up
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know where the mod tool is hosted and could update teehistorian2demo?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet.tw
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can update it later tonight
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is the mod tool closed source?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki idk. it's essentially a frontend for downloading teehistorians and piping them through teehistorian2demo
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it just pipes the download of teehistorian to teehistorian2demo
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's also awfully coded but I can add that to ddnet-web too if you want
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> without the link to my home server maybe, but othewise yes üòÑ
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't expose your ip in the script
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but a host name?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that resolves?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no we proxy it
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't resolve
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good üôÇ
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw, I think we're using an unencrypted connection between the servers and the database server
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might want to tunnel that through wireguard or so, maybe I'll set that up if no one minds
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't mysql support tls?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds easier than wireguard
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like this: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/secure-connections-overview/

21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds easier indeed
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> is everyone not fixed yet?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it is
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wireguard is so cool
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but tls is much much easier üòõ
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you set up a wireguard already? I found it quite straightforward
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I used it for reverse-proxying something from the server to my home PC
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I even played a round of AoE2 over wireguard üòÑ that was fun, it just worked out of the box
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I finally got rid of openvpn a month or so ago
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe even 2 months now
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> works perfectly
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hello, devs. What is your opinion on work with other mod-makers? Teeworlds 0.6 has some base for mod development, but 0.7 is less and less moddable, so nowadays it makes sense to consider DDNet as the base for mods instead of any version of the upstream Teeworlds.
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are already mods based on ddnet, some guy with his infection server, the thing is, they die cuz no one plays them
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The issue is that DDNet (like probably all other mods) do the job in base classes instead of subclassing. I understand ‚Äî the reason for that is that Teeworlds API is not extendable. Classes are not subclassable, etc. üôÇ
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Oh, they're basing on DDNet. That explains a lot of things üôÇ
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, the game being fully open source makes the devs (of teeworlds) not really look much into "modding support" as you mean, the only thing u have to keep in mind generally when making a mod is keeping it compatible with the most used clients
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there isnt a api like forge for minecraft for modding cuz the game itself is already open source
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> For me, it looks like they're doing a game, and not doing the software. It always helps to have a good architecture with a clear separation between different levels of logic and implementation.
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 whats you vpn provider?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 whats your vpn provider?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro me myself and I
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaffeine it makes sense but this is just a huge bowl of spaghetti made over 10 years or so. It's not the result of design
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you yourself and u?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was 12 when I made my first commit üòõ
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was 15
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Absolutely true. But we can do some design step-by-step.
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> people just added things over the years not really thinking of the future at all
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to be fair nobody expected this game to live so long
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I can't agree more üòÑ
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaffeine certainly. There is a great place to start too, turning IGameController in 0.7 into an abstract base clasee
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> class*
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I stopped playing in 2011. And three years ago I got to know that the game still exists!
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I started rewriting ddnet trying to keep the modifications into vanilla as little as possible, but since IGameController is just pretending to be an I it's really hard to avoid it
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I started to rewrite some mode trying to keep the modification as little as possible too! 
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I'm managed to have `32 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)` to the upstream code (except CMakeLists) and working very basic gameplay (I'm re-engineering InfClass).
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Basically I just turned some `private` to `protected` and added some `virtual` here and there.
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that pr looks fine, but if we are gonna change all variable reads to getters we are in for a big diff xd, putting those packets into its own methods is nice
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> encapsulation is overrated
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I replaced all m_Pos reads with GetPos() ‚Äî it is about 130 lines. But we also have some writes and there is no SetPos() method in the upstream API. So I kept it as-is for now.
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it won't give us much moddability at all, especially while there is a lot of actual abstraction that needs doing
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i meant in the future, if we are going to others too
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like IGameController and CGameContext being too interconnected
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to change others*
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It feels like you're a software developer, are you? I mean your "paid" work.
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I still have no idea what is the idea behind those two. It seems that both do everything.
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, I'm a student still, one that probably won't graduate and become a burger flipper instead
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> oof
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I think you're kidding. ü§î  OTOH some known developers quit university. Mark Zukenberg, Steven Paul Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. You name it üôÇ
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I think you're kidding. ü§î  OTOH some known developers quit university. Mark Zukenberg, Steven Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. You name it üôÇ
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm just not good at the classical engineering stuff like analysis and signal theory
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Your commits look better than do half of my colleagues. You won't become a burger flipper if you don't want to.
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> do you study electronics engineering?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I'm not lucky enough to be born in a decade where basically every idea you get was new so dropping out will instead make me one of many bottom dwellers of society
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Computer Engineering
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ok, didnt realize they also have those things
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ur in italy still right
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here most tech jobs dont require u the uni title
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they require a technical title
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't realize I was signing up to become an artillery or communications engineer in the german army circa ww2 either
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk the name it varies from country to country
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ur in 3rd year right
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i quit at 1st year, but quitting at 3rd is another thing
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've already wasted 3 years, by the time I switch over to a tech degree and finish it I'll be too old to be hirable in the softwaresphere
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I'll be qualified enough to become a drug addict living under a bridge
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, in my country some of the CS/"informatics" courses seem pretty light on math
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, in my country some of the CS/"informatics" studies seem pretty light on math
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I probably could finish this, but my brain doesn't really want to cooperate, I'm awake like 3 hours a day üòõ
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doomed to failure by my own brain chemistry
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should probs be less here
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more there
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im not someone to say anything
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm only here at night anyway, I'm too tired to study at this hour
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u tried freelancing? i tried but i never got a client ever, its full of cheap devs with more skill in marketing than in developing
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a window of 3-4 hours between 1000-1400 where I'm awake enough to retain any information
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im 2 lazy to do any marketing
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdddd
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just the way it is, I can't do anything if my brain just plain refuses to do it
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get about 200mg of caffeine a day so I can atleast stay a bit focused, it makes my hands jittery as hell, but at least I'm a little productive in those 3-4 hours
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Indeed, it seems to be very hard to do some freelance. It is much easier to get a usual job :). I started to work for my professor and after a few years, it was not a problem to find a job anymore.

23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> freelance is such unstable income
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> And it is also more about marketing indeed. üò¶
