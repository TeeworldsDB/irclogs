09:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> oo that looks cool
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Can some1 explain the loop in PumpNetwork? I removed it and nothing broke xd

13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg an a
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> how to open ddnet server? with out lags and for finishing maps (with earning points)
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> is that even possible?
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> hmm DDNet Poland??? xD
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> from east Poland
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> You can ask if you are allowed to sponsor a poland server, but i dont think that its necessary. You should have a good connection to either ger or rus.
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I'm guessing you figured out what the loop does
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Nah I did not @Learath2 :/
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Im not Even sure what Update does
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Seems to be only relevant for connection loss. So in case the dummy Timeouts or something like that?
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @TortiLeq you can host your own ddnet server and set it up with MySQL but it wonâ€™t be connected to the official database.
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it calls update for all of the netclients we have was going to be my answer, but you dont seem to know what update is either :D
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Update basically runs the whole show, i dont see how you can remove it and things would still work for the dummy
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well okay feed is the actual important one, but update does all the resends and the keepalives
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dropix> Servers are again dead ?
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i have no long term tests but using update only for the main netlient worked fine in my tests even with dummy
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon it's wrong though, so just keep it
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd oke
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> @ScReeNy hmm...
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> maybe in future
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ScReeNy people are not allowed to sponsor a server, u just pay for it, to prevent shady ppl
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> You could even remove it for the main client and with some luck it would work. But as soon as some udp packet is lost you will run into some trouble
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you meant that
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Europe has great links to germany be it west or east europe, I doubt we'd ever get a second server
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> You could even remove it for the main client and with some luck it would work. But as soon as some udp packet is lost you will run into trouble
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We let people sponsor servers, but just monetarily, they give the money we get the server
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> german server often has connection errors
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unrelated
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are having trouble with ddos ðŸ˜¦
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wouldm ake no difference to poland
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, a new server would also get ddos
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> wait wait
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also wtf, ur close af to germany
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> i said: 'maybe'
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> no: 'i will make'
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know, I'm just saying why it probably won't ever happen
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> ok
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k good to know thanks @redix
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe ddnet gets only ddosed by polish people because they are mad they have no own servers. So hosting a pol server might fix ddos for ever :tee_thinking:
18:40 <+bridge_> [freenode] <b3z> where does this bridge go?
18:46 <+Ryozuki> quakenet and discord
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any reason we are using sha256 as the network token?
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or @deen maybe you know
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are we even calculating a token?
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr> czech ddnet when
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @bxlxr Do you want DDNet in Czech? I notice it is partially translated, and is in need of someone to translate the latest untranslated strings: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/languages/czech.txt
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feel free to finish it up
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar when you have a moment, could you run a mtr to my ip from your GER server?
