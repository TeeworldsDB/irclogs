11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alirezakaj> why you guys dont suuport  0.7 version   of teeworld?   a lot of steam players can  see the servers  .
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Because lack of development. It takes a lot of time and nobody is willingly to do it. Besides there are also people who dont even want to become 0.7
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 succ
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> reasons?
13:12 <+Learath2> that's just hate for hates sake :P
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks ugliewr overall
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have u seen the chat?
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks like 2000
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and skins are way worse
13:13 <+Learath2> It's mostly that we just don't have enough developers to port all of this, and advocate for mods to the vanilla people (who've been very unreceptive in the past)
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im happy we dont have enoughthen
13:13 <+Learath2> We can patch up all the issues we have with UI
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have ported current DDNet Server to 0.7
13:16 <+Learath2> (for the record I also much prefer the old look)
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Me too Learath, but you get pretty used to it tbh
13:17 <+Learath2> I'd rather not get used to bad design decisions
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some parts of the looks look really good
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what bad decisions?
13:17 <+Learath2> fokkonaut, do you have commits somewhere for your port to 0.7?
13:18 <+Learath2> Like the chat that looks like nyan cat puked all over it
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I have put everything in one commit, and the rest (small fixes) in seperates
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I manually took things from the DDNet source
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And somehow connected everything
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So things like layers, command, rcon and that stuff works, also map settings work and yea
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if ddnet is willing to port to 0.7, i will of course share it with you. At the moment it is in my private mod repo, but I can give you access to it
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we not willing so dont worry
13:22 <+Learath2> Hmm, the most difficult part is probably the client stuff though
13:22 <+Learath2> with all the changes in the ui code
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, thats true
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lets take the old UI :p
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I would actually welcome that
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Learath, in theory you can check my server on 0.7, just type my name and you will find it.
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check dm learath
13:41 <+Learath2> I'm having internet troubles at home, I can't really play tw, I can barely connect to irc
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof, thats bad...
13:47 <+Learath2> 70kbps
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Bad internet for an developer damm that sucks
13:57 <+Learath2> good news they'll fix it in 3 days
13:58 <+Learath2> bad news it's 3 business days
13:58 <+Learath2> even worse news, tomorrow is saturday....
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why not keep the current UI and port only the server and network protocol to 0.7? Sounds like a good compromise to me
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Especially since fokkonaut already started
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as long as the ingame physics stay the same I'd be open to run a few 0.7 servers first and then switch over once they prove themselves
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont count me in
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Count me in instead :p
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen we would need the skin system tho
15:30 <@deen> i don't care much about skins, sounds ok
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but it is needed
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is no way around it
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its quite a bit of work to port them, maybe a script would be needed, or make 0.7 users default skin ðŸ˜„
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be nice to have something like a proxy, or overlaying API that just transforms 0.6 and 0.7 net code to a central one
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª I would heavily disagree with not using 0.7 skins
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and where do i say to not use them?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did they do to skins?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª @heinrich5991 once talked of such a proxy, I doubt he ever made it though
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> skins are more flexible, u can choose the eyes, feets and decoration independently
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its quite nice indeed, would like to see that in the client some day
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure we can handle that
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only problem is
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. greyfox has decoration and it would be neede to redesigned
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> without decoration and the decoration seperatly
16:22 <+Learath2> oh the decoration on the tee?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:22 <+Learath2> hmm that's troubling, we could probably get a script to do a lot of the work, but fixing the decorations will require some artist work
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean for now u could just make it without removing decoration, but would be nice to have the freedom to select it ðŸ˜„
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or we give a shit about skins and only support new ones
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye lets remove all the work till today just for a update that provides nothing useful at all
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :brownbear:
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> people can port their skins?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just because you hate vanilla
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I dont see skins as a blocker. Its not that ddnet doesnt work without skins. And artitsts like Whis are still active and for sure willing to recreate some skins.
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> is it possible to specify a storage.cfg file via command line parameters when starting the server?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> I couldn't find any info  about cli parameters...
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> storage.cfg is the one thing with truly fixed path
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are only 2 paths it'll try, one is the cwd
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the next is if there is an absolute path to the executable in argv[0] it'll strip the executable name and look in the same directory as the executable
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> ty for the info
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> it could be quite usefull for a docker container to have the file in another directory than the executable, because then i could put it in a volume and not in the container...
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> may i try to implement that and create a pull request?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wollwolke> or is it not wanted, to be dynamic
