10:51 < bridge> <murpi> Has anyone ever come across a Discord embed that contains a functional video?
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is a functional video?
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A video that works?
10:55 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, im trying to upload a video and embed it, but for some reason it doesn't want to load.
10:55 < bridge> <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1095633175398584350/image.png
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It looks like it tries tho
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have u tried to press F5 xd/ browser
10:56 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, maybe it's because the media lacks some META informations so it doesn't embed properly :/
10:57 < bridge> <murpi> it tries yeah, but turns into the poop emoji image thing after awhile üòÑ
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why error in Javascript console? Maybe u can try a different video?
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Any error in Javascript console? Maybe u can try a different video?
11:05 < bridge> <Iza> yoo is that a new report system?
11:06 < bridge> <murpi> üëÄ
11:07 < bridge> <murpi> I've tried multiple videos, different types but all seem to fail. Meh.
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rip and embed by url not an option?
11:08 < bridge> <murpi> links should work, i'll give it a try
11:12 < bridge> <Iza> some video codecs dont work in embed
11:12 < bridge> <Iza> H.264 should work
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If he used a video rendered by client it should be h264

17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> HETZNER INTRODUCES ARM64-BASED CLOUD SERVERS
17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen ddnet on arm?
17:39 < bridge> <deen> I thought about that
17:40 < bridge> <deen> but we even had problems with physics differences on x86 servers, so arm would be even worse probably
17:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> f
17:40 < bridge> <deen> and if I make the main server arm, then have to cross-compile which is annoying
17:40 < bridge> <deen> and also lots of effort to set it up yet again
17:42 < bridge> <deen> and I don't want to know what kind of bugs mariadb or other software have which don't show up on x86-64 because it makes concurrency easier
17:42 < bridge> <deen> see for example https://research.swtch.com/hwmm
17:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is arm weakly ordered?
17:51 < bridge> <deen> yes
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice link
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i seen it before
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://deck.of.cards/old/
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg epic, but sadly more expensive than a vps on other hoster
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else i'd switch
18:21 < bridge> <Patiga> starting to render weapons ^^
18:21 < bridge> <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1095745552211255366/output.mp4
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
18:22 < bridge> <Voxel> i wanna make my own client with like, OTT graphic related things
18:22 < bridge> <Voxel> hard to explain rn
18:29 < bridge> <Patiga> hrmpf when did I break the tees again
18:29 < bridge> <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1095747442353385572/output.mp4
18:29 < bridge> <Patiga> ah I remember
18:30 < bridge> <Voxel> so this is to spectate tees on a web browser?
18:30 < bridge> <Voxel> sorry im dumb
18:31 < bridge> <Patiga> hm mainly its just my hobby project where I try to replicate the rendering
18:31 < bridge> <Chairn> cursed tees ghosts
18:31 < bridge> <k2d222> how is that dumb, could be
18:32 < bridge> <k2d222> cant wait for webgpu to stabilize ‚ù§Ô∏è
18:32 < bridge> <Patiga> but yeah that should be very easily possible, dunno about performance ^^
18:32 < bridge> <Patiga> I think chrome announced it for second quarter this year o.o
18:32 < bridge> <k2d222> Oo
18:33 < bridge> <k2d222> did you try your twgpu on experimetal chrome?
18:33 < bridge> <Patiga> no :d
18:33 < bridge> <k2d222> then ill try for you XD
18:34 < bridge> <Patiga> https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> @Patiga is this server demo rendering?
18:35 < bridge> <k2d222> atm my day job is doing gpgpu on the web (with webgl1) I cant fucking wait for webgpu
18:35 < bridge> <Patiga> this is a normal client demo
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> boring
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> but if it helps #reports
18:35 < bridge> <Patiga> hm?
18:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> cool
18:36 < bridge> <Patiga> oh interesting, what kind work do you do with webgl?
18:37 < bridge> <Patiga> you bring quite a depressing mood here ^^. what you see is a client demo, the graphic interface just takes a snapshot, so you could input all the other storage formats as well
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is a server demo even different from a client demo?
18:38 < bridge> <Patiga> I don't think so
18:38 < bridge> <Patiga> maybe default0 means teehistorian
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if webgpu works, try to benchmark against webgl2
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and also against ddnet client with webgl2
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettest/load_map.html
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here u can also render demos
18:40 < bridge> <k2d222> what? is there a webgl2 backend for wgpu?
18:40 < bridge> <Patiga> yes :D
18:40 < bridge> <k2d222> no way
18:40 < bridge> <Patiga> https://mapview.patiga.eu/
18:40 < bridge> <k2d222> omg
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ah yeah vsync is always enabled for no apparent reason, maybe it was a SDL bug üòÑ
18:41 < bridge> <k2d222> then why am i still not using twgpu then
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that suprises u more than webgpu backend? XD
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok its their main goal apparently
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so maybe indeed not surprising xD
18:43 < bridge> <Patiga> @deen could you please enable this again? :)
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u compile it with webgpu?
18:43 < bridge> <k2d222> hmmh i had this very bug using wasm/sdl2 cant remember the workaround but i can look it up if u want
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is it some flag
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh i dunno if the client still compiles to wasm with the rust bridge
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never tested it
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly) without the "webgl" feature enabled, wgpu relies on the browser's own WebGPU implementation. WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser, so that determines which WGSL features you can use."
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i assume simply remove the webgl feature
18:45 < bridge> <Patiga> I had hardcoded the backend https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/blob/8bb9c111af10cf85da90ab04ea856530fc2fbf35/map-inspect-web/src/lib.rs#L198 though I don't know if it will run straight away. https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Running-on-the-Web-with-WebGPU-and-WebGL this is quite outdated already üòÖ
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gitlab down, sad
18:48 < bridge> <Patiga> weird, works for me
18:49 < bridge> <k2d222> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettest/ is that twgpu or smth else?
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its ddnet
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> literally
18:49 < bridge> <k2d222> oh
18:49 < bridge> <k2d222> i thought why the effort to make the ui match XD
18:50 < bridge> <k2d222> it runs pretty smoothly
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just remove some data and added something that emulates a command parameter to work with the javascript input
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok the loadmap is a bit customized, it wanted to use it for official ddnet, but webgl2 support seems to non existing on macos lel+
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno why but my internet seems broken on many sites rn xD
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord also doesnt work anymore
18:54 < bridge> <k2d222> yes its a bummer, they say they support but its full of garbage
18:56 < bridge> <k2d222> is there a way to load other maps on https://mapview.patiga.eu/ ?
18:56 < bridge> <k2d222> is there a way to load other maps on https://mapview.patiga.eu/ ? @Patiga
19:01 < bridge> <Patiga> @k2d222 https://mapview.patiga.eu/?map=dm2 the `map` parameter for maps that are stored in the server behind the site (I think the teeworlds maps rn), `url` https://mapview.patiga.eu/?url=https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/Animations_c2aa2208a9f27fcfd8349f34cf1633c038c17bdedbc225c1cdd14d4ecc19c3c0.map needs cross-origin enabled, and `ddnet` and `ddnet-testing` also exists in theory but cross-origin is disabled there rn
19:02 < bridge> <Patiga> the map renderer doesn't have mipmaps yet
19:03 < bridge> <Patiga> and also no parallax-zoom :p
19:05 < bridge> <k2d222> cant help but notice its a bit laggy üòÖ
19:06 < bridge> <Patiga> yes, for me too
19:06 < bridge> <Patiga> on chrome its already better
19:06 < bridge> <k2d222> wow yes, so much difference
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why firefox is weird af
19:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i zoom out one step more(in ddnet rendering) for some reason it drops from like 240fps to 15fps xD
19:08 < bridge> <Patiga> otherwise, one of: tilemap rendering method is just less performent, gl2 backend is badly optimized (I think jupstar looked into the commands run in the background once and found a lot of redundant commands), wgpu cpu-intensive checks
19:08 < bridge> <k2d222> always had a couple fps more on chrome on wasm and webgl, but here its more than usual
19:09 < bridge> <k2d222> btw how do you mipmap the tiles? without the texture bleeds in the texture atlas?
19:09 < bridge> <Patiga> 2d texture array
19:09 < bridge> <Patiga> perfect fit :D
19:09 < bridge> <Patiga> (I don't do that yet tho :d)
19:10 < bridge> <k2d222> 1 layer per tile?
19:10 < bridge> <Patiga> yea
19:10 < bridge> <Patiga> 256 layers, actually the minimum of layers supported everywhere according to wgpu limits
19:11 < bridge> <k2d222> I do custom mipmap levels for tiles layer on my mc clone, that works well but hell to implement in js on the fly
19:11 < bridge> <k2d222> I have a gimp script to do that
19:12 < bridge> <Patiga> heh ^^
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont u just need to make multiple textures and upload them all without generating mipmaps and swap them on the CPU then
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its 2d u can estimate what mipmap would be used
19:15 < bridge> <k2d222> oh, I see u mean based on zoom level I swap the texture?
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u even have a concept like zoom
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah depending on resolution and zoom
19:17 < bridge> <k2d222> how is that better than having all the mip levels attached to the texture and letting gl do mipmap lookup?
19:18 < bridge> <k2d222> my issue is how do I generate the mip levels
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assumed u faced texture bleeding
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and in webgl1 u might not have 2d array textures or sampler methods in the shader
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well glGenerateMipMaps or a texture flag is it for old OpenGL at least
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else search a resize js library and always half the size
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else search a resize js library and always half the size
19:21 < bridge> <k2d222> my problem is, glGenMipmaps generates mipmaps by averaging 4 pixels, but for a texture atlas, that doesnt work bcs it will mix with the neighboring tile on the edges, thats what I meant by texture bleed
19:21 < bridge> <k2d222> what u need is to avg 4 pixels but taking into account tile borders
19:21 < bridge> <k2d222> so custom mipmaping
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep but even then it will make the rendering quite inaccurate
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for a 512x512 texture u have completly different texel offsets than 1024x1024
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1/1024 vs 1/512
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u basically face the opposite of bleeding still
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with your way of rendering
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally u cannot get the pixel perfect rendering without 2d array textures tho
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the edge texels are always cut by exactly half a pixel
19:24 < bridge> <k2d222> I dont get it ü•π
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok wait tbf it depends on if u are using linear interpolation for sampling
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are you doing it? üòÑ
19:25 < bridge> <k2d222> oh yea now I think I see what u mean
19:25 < bridge> <k2d222> I cant do the double interpolation thingy
19:26 < bridge> <k2d222> gl_nearest_mipmap_linear
19:26 < bridge> <k2d222> but gl_linear_mipmap_linear would not work is that it?
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that too
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but gl_linear
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and gl_linear_mipmap_linear
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gl_linear_mipmap_nearest wont work either
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically only with gl_nearest it might work
19:28 < bridge> <k2d222> right I get it now, still better than nearest
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still dont get the map-inspect to build at all xD
19:34 < bridge> <Patiga> have you tried the steps from the readme? ^^
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wasm ah yeah
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cargo is my second package manager xd

19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah bad design
19:42 < bridge> <k2d222> then, probably not soon XD
19:44 < bridge> <Patiga> wat o.o
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh weird, 0.10.3 also crashes
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let me try rust stable
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh no chance, rip
19:47 < bridge> <Patiga> bro how

19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> both dont work
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where do i need to run it xd

19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah weird that it crashes for me üòÑ

21:07 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks did you manage to solve it? üòÖ
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but it doesnt run, adapter cannot be created, maybe a newer version of wgpu fixes problems with webgpu?
21:10 < bridge> <Patiga> twgpu is currently on the latest major version of wgpu, so that shouldn't be the issue

21:24 < bridge> <Voxel> "Easy" API
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its rly called like this
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on the C side too
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look at ddnet code
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u will find itg
21:24 < bridge> <Voxel> wait wtf i thought that was sarcasm
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the easy api is meant to be ez to use
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz curl has million options
21:24 < bridge> <Voxel> fair
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw curl is everywhere
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> under ur bed too
21:25 < bridge> <Voxel> i curl under my blanket when i go to sleep does that count
21:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> y
21:25 < bridge> <Voxel> its comfy,
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm impressed how good lapce became in such a small time frame, if it has debugger support it could already replace vscode for rust development
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the performance is superb
22:33 < bridge> <matricks> lapce you say üëÄ
22:43 < bridge> <matricks> Q: Can lapce invoke building of a project?
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess not yet
22:44 < bridge> <matricks> yeah, I couldn't find it. Snappy however
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hope they get it done this year, would be nice to have a bit of challenge for vscode üòÑ
22:46 < bridge> <matricks> I've tried to like vscode... can't....
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like it tbh üòÑ
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can even use it in a browser and write code on my vm
22:46 < bridge> <matricks> For me it always feels sluggish
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but sometimes it gets slow already yeah
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on my desktop its ok, bcs good hardware
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but laptop is already little struggle
22:47 < bridge> <matricks> But it feels very wrong that you have shit-ton of good hardware, and Turbo Pascal back in the 90s was snappier
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when it comes to electron and javascript in general, i'd still say vscode is one of a kind.
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most js stuff sucks so hard, vscode is pretty nice compared to it
22:50 < bridge> <matricks> I rather not touch JS even with a 10 foot pole
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i feel like the discord app on my phone is slower than opening it in the browser ^^
