00:25 < bridge_> <totar> what??
00:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just c++ things
01:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> we really should look into getting some sort of events system for jobs
01:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> having no way to communicate between threads without polling a status variable or something really is not ideal
01:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> especially if that's the intended avenue for new multithreaded stuff'

10:21 < bridge_> <art0007i> hey guys I was trying to compile ddnet on windows but when compiling the client specifically (server and most other things work fine) I get a ton of these weird errors and I have no idea what they mean. can anyone help me?
10:22 < bridge_> <art0007i> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1145996761744285788/VS2022ddnet_errors.txt
11:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Sounds like missing include
11:11 < bridge_> <metamuffin> Sounds more like missing libraries for the include.
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> No
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Standard library that is
11:12 < bridge_> <metamuffin> idk much about windows but you might need to install sdl2.
11:12 < bridge_> <metamuffin> that might be a problem too
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Robyte once cleaned up includes
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe it was too aggressive in rare cases
11:12 < bridge_> <teero777> I kinda worried that it can't find int
11:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It's unrelated
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Only read the first etror
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Error
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> The ones after are basically useless
11:23 < bridge_> <art0007i> well what does that mean? which include is missing and in which file? any steps for debugging this further?
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> In the files that the error shows
11:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Defined in header <cstdint>
11:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> So include that file in the failed files
13:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @chairn did u know about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics
13:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe ur interested @heinrich5991 @learath2

19:13 < bridge_> <XWA> only 1 player*
19:13 < bridge_> <XWA> drop the -s
19:15 < bridge_> <chairn> no i didn't, but it looks like just a change of domain to simplify optics problem
19:15 < bridge_> <chairn> just like you can use laplace transform to solve differential equations
19:21 < bridge_> <Zwelf> elementx doesnt support loading images from the discord bridge ðŸ˜­
19:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks I suppose we can just remove `gfx_finish` if there's no reason for using it. Should I remove only the config variable or also the commands in the backend? So is there any use for the finish-command for debugging or something like that so it would make sense to keep it?
19:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i don't really know what the usecase is, lets search the internet xd
19:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i see, it was basically the way to synchronize stuff before fences/semaphores existed in opengl
20:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if we'd need that functionality somewhere in the backend, it can add it manually, i don't see a reason why graphics_threaded should ever call it
20:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so you can remove the config and the command
20:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Good job Mr jupstar detective
20:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
20:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Gold
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki let's say two libs in your repo use serde.. you should probably keep the features (of the serde dep) in sync?
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or does it not bloat the binary if they differ?
20:19 < bridge_> <metamuffin> i am (somewhat) sure that if they are in the same workspace, the union of all features will be enabled.
20:19 < bridge_> <metamuffin> the version however must be exactly the same.
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ok interesting
20:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> can't that make problems in some cases
20:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> It's better if in ur crate u specify 1.0
20:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> And no minor
20:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> So cargo can avoid duplicates easier
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Well should be no prob according to semver here
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Nvm me
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u could still asnwer my question which isnt related to versions xd
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but to features
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i could also just search the internet
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but then it doesnt look like im interested in a conversation about rust with you
20:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> I updated #7094
20:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7094
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> "m_ClAssetsEntities"
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ohh unlucky xd
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> that will overwrite all config again xD
20:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nah, it's only the internal name, it shouldn't break configs
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> glÃ¼ck im unglÃ¼ck
20:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> But we should rename it to `cl_asset_entities` so it's consistent :santatrollet:
20:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but it's less correct ðŸ˜‰
20:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Just rename them all when doing the whole zip-assets rework
20:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7094/files#diff-4ff6cdeafe314c59f4e164922231de19c027161f296ef5e8592750903f60ffc4L6470-R6469 
20:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Any issues with this diff? The finish command itself didn't do anything in the Vulkan backend, but it's special-cased here.
20:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yes, my impl thinks that at some point swap command will come at last.. the finish command broke this xd
20:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so the diff is fine
20:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> So less hacky now, nice
