08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would've been interesting what changed in the config
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Only thing that i can add to this is, that other intel GPUs seemed to be affected by the performance hit as well(not like the sandy bridge versions, but around 100 frames less) and 11.1.8 seems to fix this.

13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> What also might be interesting is, that this only happened in VS 2015 and MinGW, VS 2017 worked fine

14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, strange stuff
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would be interesting to see what VS 2017 did differently and if we could emulate that
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how is it possible that ``/points chillerdragon`` says that chillerdragon has 0 points? xd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt it say no points collected so far
