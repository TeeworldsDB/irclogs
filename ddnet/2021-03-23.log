06:22 < Yi> hello Deen
06:58 <+YI> hello Deen
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to summon deen u need to type:
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> need deen
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You need to sacrifice 3 tees for deen to appear
08:24 <@deen> YI: hi
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> fng time
08:57 <@deen> I've gotten your email and responded. But we can also chat here if you prefer
09:51 <+YI> hello deen
09:51 <+YI> sorry was in a meeting
09:51 <+YI> just saw ur email and message
09:52 <+YI> are u still there?
09:52 <@deen> yes
09:52 <+YI> ok,cool
09:53 <+YI> first, appoligize for made a demo and post the page without tlking to u
09:53 <+YI> i played DDrace over 400 hours and half an year, really like it
09:53 <@deen> I think our license allows remixing etc, so that's fine
09:54 <@deen> Great to hear that you enjoyed DDNet :)
09:54 <@deen> I think it's a bit hard to make the game work on mobile though
09:54 <+YI> really really hard
09:54 <@deen> :D
09:55 <@deen> We once had an Android version, and removed support for it again since it was only useful for watching
09:55 <+YI> without mouse it is quite hard to do a lot of things
09:55 <@deen> Accurate mouse input is super important, so not sure how to fix that
09:56 <+YI> i like the idea players help each other, even for mobile they need a way to connect eachother
09:57 <+YI> about ur email, i understand if we want to make it opensource and free to play, it is just that we have cost
09:58 <@deen> Yeah, I figured
09:58 <+YI> actually i made this demo alone by myself(program and art)
09:58 <@deen> cool
09:58 <+YI> and we have not decided how it will goes in the future
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> pog
09:59 <@deen> (btw, this channel is connected to our discord server, thus the people from bridge can communicate too)
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> like me xD
09:59 <+YI> at first we want to see if people like it, and in the future maybe make it a F2P game with in game purchase
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Hello from the other sideeeee
10:00 <@deen> yeah, that's probably easier to make money with than pay-first
10:00 <+YI> no, that is always not a best choice for mobile game
10:01 <+YI> what i want to say is, at this time, we are not sure if we will go and finish the game,  either make it open source like u suggested, or make it a commercial mobile game with in game purchse
10:02 <+YI> if we choose the 2cd option, how should we get an authorize from you?
10:02 <@deen> 2cd?
10:02 <+YI> if we make a Free to play game with in app purchase
10:02 <@deen> Ah, if it's commercial, I don't think you should call it DDraceNetwork
10:03 <+YI> we didn't called ddracenetwork and will not do it unless get ur permission
10:03 <@deen> Would still be nice to credit DDNet, but other than that I think our license allows you to make a commercial game out of it already, so should be good to go
10:03 <+YI> now the name is forest friends
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Plus you're not taking any code or assets. I think you are free to do whatever you want as long as it is not associated with ddnet or holds ddnet with liability.
10:05 <+YI> well, if we are going to make it commercial, we'll do it properly, we want to make it in the right way, get ur permission, cradit DDnet etc
10:06 <+YI> do u have wechat? or other way for easier communication? or email only?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Discord I guess
10:06 <@deen> I don't have wechat at the moment. If we need to communicate more, I can get it again I guess
10:06 <@deen> Discord is blocked in China, isn't it?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean I'm here😋
10:07 <+YI> right, blocked
10:07 <+YI> aha, ok, if u want to reach me email is ok, oh maybe ur chinese friend want to contact me that is also ok
10:08 <+YI> i am ddrace player, we don't want to "steal ddrace" to earn money , we want to make it properly
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Nah. I don't have any say about the name "ddnet". Which sounds like your intent.
10:08 <@deen> Sure, I understand and appreciate you reaching out
10:09 <+YI> thx,mate
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I should leave you guys to it.
10:09 <@deen> And making another game based on DDNet is a form of praise in my mind
10:09 <@deen> TsFreddie: :D
10:09 <+YI> and to let u know at this time, our demo is compleltely free and we trying to test on Taptap, and once we decide to make it open source or commercial, i'll keep you updated
10:09 <@deen> Ok, cool
10:10 <@deen> I don't have an Android phone to try it out unfortunately, but the video looked nice
10:11 <+YI> i did give up a lot of things on mobile :(
10:11 <+YI> the connection between 2 players do not break , to make it easy enough :P
10:11 <@deen> Oh, and sorry about the guys giving bad ratings. Maybe it helps if you credit DDNet somewhere in the description
10:11 <@deen> And some kind of autoaim to hit other players?
10:12 <+YI> yeah, i'll add "ddrace discribtion" on our page if u allow us to do it
10:12 <@deen> Something like "based on DDraceNetwork" is fine.
10:12 <+YI>  some kind of autoaim to hit other players?  sorry i don't understand, my bad english :(
10:13 <+YI> ok,will do it soon today
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I can translate
10:13 <@deen> Thanks
10:13 <+YI> actually this demo is toooooooooooo easy for DDrace players
10:13 <@deen> Do you have to use the touchscreen to exactly aim at the other player? Or will the game help you hit the aim of hook perfectly?
10:14 <+YI> yeah, i did that
10:15 <+YI> and don't like it :(
10:15 <+YI> anyway if u got a chance to test the demo and give ur suggestion will be great
10:16 <+YI>  i did added something more to make the game funny, not 100% copy
10:16 <@deen> ok, nice
10:16 <+YI> wish u'll like it
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> There a video I can see? Just curious..
10:16 <@deen> It's on https://www.taptap.com/app/211037
10:17 <+YI> so i'll first add discription of DDrace on our page, and we'll continue for test the demo and see if chinese mobile player will like it
10:17 <+YI> by the way, can we pose ur steam page link ?
10:17 <+YI> on the page?
10:17 <@deen> Yeah, sounds good. Good luck!
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'd be careful about phrasing the credits tho
10:17 <@deen> Yeah, sure, that would be nice too
10:17 <+YI> ok
10:17 <+YI> thx
10:17 <@deen> TsFreddie: Why?
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm afraid of people attacking them depends on how they phrase the credit in chinese.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Chinese as a language is pretty weird when giving credits. I've seen it came across wrong before in other games.
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> not that I can make better description tho.
10:52 <+YI> hello deen, i am back
10:53 <+YI> was in a phone call
10:53 <@deen> welcome back YI
10:53 <+YI> onething want to make sure with u
10:54 <+YI> can we write on our page " get permission to test this demo from DDrace team" ? to avoid other DDrace players for bad words
10:54 <+YI> and as i mentioned, at this time , it is only free game test, if we will make it commercial later, we will tlk with u and ur team for official permission
10:56 <+ChillerDragon> YI can you show us what you have already? Do you have screenshots or a gameplay footage?
10:56 <@deen> I think that sounds a bit too close to us cooperating, which is not accurate. I'd prefer something like "is based on DDraceNetwork, which allows modifying and redistributing the game". Since basically our license.txt already allows all of that
10:57 <@deen> ChillerDragon: video is here: https://www.taptap.com/app/211037
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> is it based on ddnet? Like using ddnet source code?
10:57 <+YI> https://www.taptap.com/app/211037
10:57 <+YI> there is a video
10:57 <+YI> nope, it is by Unity
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> i see
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> haha the music is scary af
10:58 <+YI> a lot of bugs i have to say :P
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> i mean if you rewrite the engine and change physics maybe you get it to work on mobile more smoothly
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh u plan to release on iOS?
11:00 <+YI> thx for suggestion, at this demo we want to test if people like such game play on mobile first
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> yo
11:01 <+YI> about ios, no idea yet
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1616493594.png
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> :-)
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> teeworlds to ios pog
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> multimap the game :D
11:02 <+YI> ok, deen, understand, we'll update the page now
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its viable at all to have a game like ddnet in mobile unless to spectate people
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> yeah gonna be cancer to play
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> but still... why not XD
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u just walk and jump and use hook to get over gaps, its ok
11:02 <@deen> YI: thanks
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u cannot make such an action loaded game ofc
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> but for actual dragging or stuff like that its bad
11:02 <+YI> yeah it is super difficult to make it on mobile
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> unless you use a dongle to connect keyb + mouse which is a option but why not just use a latpo
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> unless you use a dongle to connect keyb + mouse which is a option but why not just use a laptop
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the best way to "praise" ddnet by making another game is to do stuff like tsfreddie did
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they fit much more a mobile game
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in my opinion*
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> that louis games?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> that louis game?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> dude yeah
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> its so fun
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i almost got WR for mobile xd
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i spent so much time playing that shit
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wanted to make the game "Toss the turtle" but ddnet themed
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it fits rly well for mobile
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/508440>
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a classic
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> do it
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i want it
11:08 <@deen> TsFreddie's game: https://tsfreddie.itch.io/biggernouis :D
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> lol, why mention that now.
11:09 <@deen> Because Ryozuki referred to it
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh i'm blind then
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> The thing is mobile ddnet would be ok but we would need to make maps for mobile that are not too hard
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean we have People playing ddnet with mousepad which is just crazy to me
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i know @孎嬜 plays with macbook's trackpad.
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> imagine ddnet phone edition
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> imagine ddnet phone
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> but it will need other servers and maps
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :nouis: i would kill for a mobile game that i can play fng on tho
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> me too
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> I USE HP
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> NOT MACBOOK EW
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Microsoft in Talks to Buy Discord for More Than $10 Billion"
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they all have too much money xd
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I predict Discord will be renamed to "Teams for Gamers", similar to Lync being renamed to "Skype for Business" before 😄
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> kekw. i auto connected trackpad to macbooks because pc usually have bad trackpads.
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/823887311808364595/video0.mov
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> @TsFreddie surprise , it’s a hp laptop :justatest:
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> one hand player! impressive
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> Too poor to record
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> Must use right hand with phone
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> :feelsbadman:
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <孎嬜> Too laggy to record
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not me
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh no
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well discord kinda did their "rebranding" to make it not gamer-ish
14:53 <+YI> hello! Deen
14:53 <+YI> finally the Editor approved our page changes, now the infos are visible on the page
14:55 <@deen> YI: Thanks!
14:56 <@deen> The reference to DDNet looks good
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 👍
15:19 <+YI> :P
15:21 <+YI> personally i suggest DDNet make some easier map, it deserves much much more players like "Fall Guys"
15:21 <+YI> just not so friendly for beginners
15:21 <@deen> Yeah, we are aware it's our biggest problem
15:21 <@deen> No tutorial, no good way to get started, too many hard maps on Novice
15:22 <+YI> see, i played over 400 hours, and some maps i have to give up ....
15:22 <@deen> This problem happened because we started as a Teeworlds mod, and the new players we would get were already Teeworlds pros. But now with new players coming in from Steam etc it makes no sense
15:22 <+YI> but goodthing is there are lot of guys help beginners , never see in any other game
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Well most chn players come from steam. That's one of the problems in CHN servers. Players base are quite divided.
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Beginners helping beginners kinda get us nowhere lol.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I wish I have more time to contribute, yet I spend my last bucket of free time on vanilla.
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you should be proud because those text changes are looking hella good
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But it is a nightmare to completely optimize that thing if someone don't step in and make some GPU side optimization tho.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> And still doesn't benefits most chn players rn
16:22 <+YI> chn means chinese players?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> chn is **c**oalition of **h**uman **n**eeds
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ofc chn is china
16:25 <+YI> okay
16:26 <+YI> ur name is bridge right? and u manage chinese community?
16:27 <+YI> sorry this chat channel is too complicated for me to understand which is nick name which is title etc.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im on discord
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @TsFreddie is managing actually, maybe not
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> TsFreddie is name
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I do manage chinese community along with some other og chn players.
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> You can find me in http://chat.teeworlds.cn
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean if you want to talk to me and irc is too confusing. You are free to join the discord as well if you know how, of course.
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Which would be ddnet.tw/discord
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> YI: bridge just means that the message is coming from discord which is connected to the irc channel you are currently in
16:42 <+YI> aha, i see
16:42 <+YI> thx, i am coming to the link u sent
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 found a new good quote: 
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > "Every programmer occasionally, when nobody's home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It's a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable colla
