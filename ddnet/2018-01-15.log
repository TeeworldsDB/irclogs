08:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @timakro looks like the last one is always same rank as previous one, interesting. On DDNet it doesn't matter of course since we have thousands with 0 points
08:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> thanks deen, still hadn't figured it out
08:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> I'm taking a look
08:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> I'm a bit confused how that ever worked^^
08:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> (all of our top sql code btw)
09:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> Well, the group by makes it work, but that seems more like an implementation detail and could change in later mysql/mariadb versions
09:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> SELECT Rank, Points, Name FROM (SELECT Name, (@pos := @pos+1) pos, (@rank := IF(@prev = Points,@rank, @pos)) Rank, (@prev := Points) Points FROM (SELECT Name, Points FROM foo_points GROUP BY Name ORDER BY Points DESC) as a) as b LIMIT 0, 5;
09:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> That should work for now, at least as good as the rest of our code

16:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> where do i find the vertex shader to change LOD (mipmap level)?
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> Jupeyy told me to try
17:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/data/shader
17:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> maybe here ?
17:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> idk
17:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> yes
17:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> where
17:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> xd?
17:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> what file is it
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I don't know, serach
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> there's shaders
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> im no coder
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> there are shaders
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> i dont know what everyhting means
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> then don't do anything, it's porgamming
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> me either. Im web dev ðŸ˜„

17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> jupeyy just told me to change vertex shader LOD to 0-5 what mipmap lvl i want
17:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> LOD means level of details
17:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> but no idea where you can change it in that code
17:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> mayhbe there's a Mipmap configruation in client

19:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @heinrich5991 google for gcc float problems^^
19:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> and try out a few
19:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> this one did the trick
19:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> but we should fix the code, it's more of a workaround
19:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @heinrich5991 how to get proper stdout output on windows again?
19:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> you removed my async output, implemented your own aio and then removed it for windows?
19:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> now we have slow blocking windows output and problems with encoding

22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> "BTW, the 2016 answer to -ffloat-store is: don't use x87 in the first place. Use SSE2 math (64-bit binaries, or -mfpmath=sse -msse2 for making crusty old 32-bit binaries), because SSE/SSE2 has temporaries with no extra precision. double and float vars in XMM registers are really in IEEE 64-bit or 32-bit format.

22:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> I can't see the players on a ddnet server in the serverbrowser
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> might be the server? i merged the server code into the unique race server code recently and i cant see the players online there as well
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> @timakro  i heard that you can't see the players because of the ddos attack. No idea why, but it helps protecting I guess. Correct me if I am wrong. I only write what I heard.
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> i see, now it works again
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> but why on my servers o.O
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> you mean
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> that your server wasn't even listed?
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> DDoS protection just cut income connections, and allows only a few of them
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Your trashmap servers works great when  there is a ddos attack on ddnet <3
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> that's why we can't see servers while ddos (sometimes)
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @heinrich5991 SSE2 only exists since Pentium 4 and Athlon 64. If this would be the only incompatibility, I'd rather keep building 32bit binaries that work on older CPUs. Everyone with a non-ancient CPU should be using 64bit anyway
