11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> Who knows how make the picture lag by 2 seconds?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> `cl_refresh_rate 2` maybe im not sure exactly what you want \:D
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can i get the server response from a fifo command i sent?

11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïÆùñçùñÜùñíùñïùñéùñîùñìùñò> @everyone
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> vodka
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> no, I need a smooth image, just having a delay between drawing
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> i still do not get it
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> maybe make an artificial change to the value in cl_showhud? it is possible?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> maybe make an artificial change to the value in cl_showhud. It is possible?
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> ??
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> U know about command cl_showhud?
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> in f1
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> but what artificial change
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> If I can change this value, and harden it, it can give the effect I want.
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> watafak
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what is hardening in this case?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> isnt setting it enough?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> hold*
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so you want to see the old hud?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 2 seconds old hud?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> whats your usecase \:D
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> wow, you do not understand me at all.
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> I need the game, the picture on the monitor, to be rendered for me a few seconds after it happened, that is, with a delay
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> For standart: Game -> 8ms -> Picture on monitor
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> What i mean: Game -> few seconds -> Picture on monitor
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> LMFAO best thing you've said
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry you can't see the reply but I'm referencing your "vodka" comment
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not within the client, maybe an external tool if u lucky, but never heard of smone wanting to have delay
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao i wanted to test if pkill can do he double dashes to ignore arguments and interpret it as value so i tried `pkill -f -- -a` and expected it not to throw and argument error... well i can not recommend trying that in your shell \:D
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> something goes wrong with https-master
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it doesn't update for me :p
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> master3.ddnet.tw is stuck
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 1-2 are stable
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe Thanks for the report. I have temporarily disabled master3 until @heinrich5991 can take a look
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I still think we should fetch from 2 masters
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and make it a race üòÑ
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what's benefit of using linked list for storing voteoptions?
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a simple data structure
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what if we will use common c-array?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like, what can we lose here
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> c arrays don't resize, so you can only store a limited amount of options
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so, someone wanted to do over9k options for voting xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey, thanks
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not only that, C arrays have a fixed size
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if you want the maximum to be 9000 you'll need to waste 9000 votes worth of memory
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An `std::vector` is probably better here btw
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> better = faster or better = less memory use?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just faster
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we iterate the votelist often, vectors play very well with prefetch and cachelines
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only scary thing about a vector is it can cause large `memcpy`s
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the vector is full and something is allocated after it and you want to add more elements the entire vector needs to move
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, is there a need to insert another voteoptions while server running
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mean
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> while player are playing on server
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> not about map load -> entering
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> while players are playing on server
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what if u store references in the vector
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then the memcpy is not a big deal
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well not very often which is why I think vector would be better there
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/reference_wrapper
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I found this the other day too, idk what I'd really use it for but it's cute
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It is frequently used as a mechanism to store references inside standard containers (like std::vector) which cannot normally hold references.
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it says it there
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well yes but when do you really want to keep a vector of references?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess maybe a data structure weaved through another one could have a use for this
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess to store the result of some operation that changes the order
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like shuffle shown in the example
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah that is cute
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> `CPlayer::m_LastVoteTry` is `int` when we are storing here `int64` for current tick xd
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do u mean?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> int64 is mostly used for time i think
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a8b3cc2a963f5b2273851ffdaa9eb8306163013d/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2075
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a8b3cc2a963f5b2273851ffdaa9eb8306163013d/src/game/server/player.h#L79
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the `Now` variable is wrong and useless
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah lmao
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> `Server()->Tick()` is `int` too xD
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can open a pr if it gives u compiler warnings or smth
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no, just eagle eye
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> :happy:
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats annoying me since forever xD
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we use int64 everywhere
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but servertick returns int
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> whats better to use tho
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> int64 for ticks or int
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ticks int is enough
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for time int64 is better
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean for mods int64 might be better bcs u have more theoretical options for envelopes üòÑ
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not vanilla compatible anyway
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> theoretical options? wdym
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can fake server time to show synced enveloped animatioms
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. u could fake a real life clock üòÑ
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as animations
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think would be funny üòÑ
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe i should add it to some map release üòÑ
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> jupstar do you remember h-client?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only used gamer
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh okey xd
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i know h client was something similar
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also from dune?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just it had good envelopes pre-show
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no unsigned char* did it
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://youtu.be/EI4geo5KJe8
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does that not exists in ddnet?
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thought i saw it before
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no i suppose
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah looks really nice
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a new editor should have it üòÑ
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hehe
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally i'd change envelops to be more like blender animations i think
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i kinda find the dots in the envelop screen annoying to maintain
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> better just use smth like this and add keyframes
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh another pr to look up xd
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u try to rebase against ddnet or what
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im trying to clean ddnet code and make new panic-like mod
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> now im making votemanager
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah server code is rip xd
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its like 1/8 of gmecontext
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its like 1/8 of gamecontext
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the basic idea of the server code is ok, but alot of smaller quick hacks
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> client code has docs right?
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> should write a bit docs for server side to rest ;d
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have that with lasers, original idea was envelopes tho :D
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cool thing about lasers is you can adjust thickness (ab)using starttick
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah üòÑ
