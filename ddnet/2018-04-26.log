09:59 <+Davide> Guys
09:59 <+Davide> I've one question
09:59 <+Davide> What is "Timestamp" on db structure of record_maps?
09:59 <+Davide> Creation data of map?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:06 <+Davide> Ok thx
11:06 <+Davide> Another thing deen
11:06 <+Davide> How i can do one "Random map" script?
11:06 <+Davide> "Random unfinished map" that interests me
11:15 <@deen> it works by having all the votes of maps in and taking a random one from them
11:16 <@deen> so just use "add_vote"s for the "change_map"s and have a vote with "random_map" too

12:00 <+Davide> (For the help)
12:06 <@deen> Thanks Davide!
12:07 <@deen> do you have a player profile that you want linked on the donor's page?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think i have a solution for the freeze wiggle.  what if the client automatically activates cl_predicion 1 when you enter freeze and as well deactivates it when you leave
13:42 <+Davide> (I've donated, i don't know if you've you answered my pc is crashed) @Deen
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Davide https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/2018-04-26.log
13:46 <+Davide> Oh, thanks ZombieToad
13:47 <+Davide> @Deen yes, you can add "Davide55" xD
15:32 <+Davide> Deen, how i can show points of map on motd? Example if the map get 10 points i want to see it on "MOTD" of server like "Points: 10"
15:33 <+Davide> I think i can do it with sql db but i don't know how to include it on motd
16:43 <@deen> nope, no real way to do that, Davide. On DDNet we use a bunch of shell and python scripts: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/create-votes.py
16:44 <@deen> But /mapinfo works with sql directly
18:50 <+Davide> How i can see irc history of past hours?
18:53 <@deen> wait 1 hour ;)
18:53 <@deen> or check discord
18:53 <@deen> i have a crontab to update the irc logs once an hour
18:54 <@deen> cron job*
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> *corn job
