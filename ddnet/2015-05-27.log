06:02 < Nazar> Sorry für alle die jetzt damit nichts zu tun haben, aber ich lasse mich nicht weiter verarschen... ich hab oft genug bescheid gegeben aber es passiert einfach nichts..  ich hab keine lust mehr, und jetzt ist das fass ein weiteres mal übergelaufen... Wir werden voneinander hören...
06:02 < Nazar> Sorry for all who now nothing to do, but I let myself not kidding ... I've often been modest but nothing happens .. I'm tired, and now is the last straw, another defected times. .. We will hear from each other ...
06:08 < eeeee> he what?
06:09 < eeeee> fstd: you know what that guy was talking about? ^
06:10 < eeeee> i'm really curious why he had such defected times for some reason
10:03 <@EastByte> eeeee: maybe nazar starts hating ddnet again
10:26 <@EastByte> deen: On Friday I'm going on a trip until the 7th June
10:27 <@EastByte> so in case you don't have any internet, we basically won't meet when you are out of country
14:00 <@deen> oh well, bad luck
14:01 <@deen> no idea what Nazar was talking about

14:53 < fstd> eeeee: seems mad, but didn't say anything specific.  he's had it, and he told you a lot of time but nothing ever happens, and you'll hear from him
14:53 < fstd> plural "you"
14:54 < Learath2> ooo ddos inbound
16:28 < o_be_one> hello
16:48 <@deen> hi
16:50 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/public/videos/karin.webm
16:50 <@EastByte> hellow
16:51 <@deen> ahahaha
16:51 <@deen> poor Karin
16:53 <@EastByte> when all players left Karin returned about 5 minutes later
16:54 <@EastByte> the people I played with were really nice
16:54 <@deen> =)
16:55 < savander> hahaha :D
19:23 < Learath2> deen: while you were away we had a little chat about how we thought accounts should be 
19:25 <@deen> yes?
19:51 < Learath2> back had to do smth 
19:51 < Learath2> anyways
19:52 < Learath2> we talked about using the timeoutcodes to uniquely identify people
19:52 < Learath2> and tie the records to them
19:52 < Learath2> so we can migrate them to a new account system
20:14 <@deen> yes, that was the initial plan
20:14 <@deen> the alternative would be to use the forum accounts
20:27 < Learath2> how can we tie the records to the forum accounts tho

21:10 < Savander> hi
21:18 <@deen> hi Savander =)
21:19 < Savander> =)
21:29 < Savander> Can you recommend me a good website/article/course about programming? In polish i don't have really much (good) resources about it.
21:30 < Learath2> Savander: what language are you going to learn ?
21:30 < Savander> c++/c
21:31 <@deen> Savander: http://hookrace.net/ :P
21:31 < Savander> deen: definitly!
21:31 <@deen> i don't know how to learn programming
21:34 <@deen> best thing is to read and write code i guess
21:34 <@deen> well-known projects, do you own stuff etc
21:34 <@deen> hm, not really well-known projects, good-code projects
21:37 < Savander> Very often i have a problem to do good query to google :PP.
21:37 < Savander> basic knowledge  ==  don't know where to start
21:38 < Savander> so that's why i asked about good website/article/course ^^.
21:39 < Learath2> Savander: well ill advise you what was adviced to me work through the second edition of K&R if you are willing to learn C 
21:39 < Learath2> advised*
21:39 < Learath2> though by work thru i mean really doing the exercises too 
21:40 < Savander> it's a book?
21:42 <@deen> yes, the best C book
21:52 < Savander> You read "Clean Code"?
21:53 <@deen> no
21:54 < Savander> http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882
21:54 < Savander> btw. i have pdf of it.
21:56 <@deen> ah, my friend read it
21:56 <@deen> I never liked the whole agile thing
21:57 <@deen> i don't even like object oriented programming
21:57 < Savander> :). 
22:05 <@heinrich5991> whatever that is, anyway
22:16 <@deen> agile?
22:17 <@deen> or OO?^^
22:17 <@heinrich5991> object oriented programming
22:17 <@heinrich5991> :)
22:17 <@deen> everything is an object
22:17 <@deen> the typical java programming style
22:18 <@heinrich5991> I guess it depends who you're talking to
22:18 <@deen> why?
22:19 <@deen> because of the smalltalk camp?
22:19 <@heinrich5991> (I don't know the smalltalk camp)
22:19 <@deen> they say java is not real OO, actually no language has real OO, only smalltalk
22:19 <@deen> their OO is more minimalistic, you just have objects and they can send messages to each other, that's all
22:23 <@heinrich5991> the point is, you have classes in every programming language
22:25 <@deen> you do?
22:25 <@deen> haskell? c?
22:25 <@deen> rust?
22:27 <@deen> not that I dislike classes, it's rather all the bloat that happens when you use them consistently
22:27 <@deen> had to read some unreadable code where you have to jump through 10 files to figure out what a function is actually doing
22:28 <@heinrich5991> deen: c: structs, haskell: you have full adt, rust: enums, structs
22:28 <@heinrich5991> maybe the jumping through ten files is just a different thing, code with many layers
22:28 <@deen> those are not classes in the oo way
22:29 <@deen> yeah, but hardcore oo is code with many layers
22:29 <@heinrich5991> what are classes in the oo way?
22:29 <@deen> classes are concepts for objects, which are collections of data and code
22:30 <@deen> in c, haskell, rust, nim data and code are separate
22:33  * Learath2 must conquer the photoelectric effect in 1 hour
22:34 <@EastByte> well in nim you can make it feel like code and data are together
22:34 <@EastByte> I actually used the oop macro
22:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: but you usually do it anyway, you mostly have groups of functions operating on specific structs
22:34 <@deen> EastByte: ah, i never did that
22:34 <@heinrich5991> same for haskell, rust, etc.
22:37 <@deen> but you don't do oop design patterns in haskell, rust, c
22:37 <@deen> (I hope)
22:38 <@deen> and I guess I'm grumpy about OOP because at university they often teach that OOP is the only real way to program and everything else is bad code^^
22:40 <@deen> not that I prefer pure FP either
22:40 <@deen> I think you need a language where you have the tools of imperative programming, FP and OOP
22:40 <@deen> or at least I want one
22:55 <@heinrich5991> but what are these "oop design patterns"? :)
23:07 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
23:07 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Design_patterns
23:08 <@deen> oh, i really like the criticisms in the last article
23:08 <@deen> that's what i wanted to say, but more eloquent
23:26 <@heinrich5991> mh ok :)
23:26 <@heinrich5991> thanks for that
23:31 < Savander> oh my god! Im so good
23:31 < Savander> i learned how to compile "C" program on windows.
23:32 < Savander> im the best
23:32 < Savander> trust me
23:32 < Savander> XD
23:33 < Savander> oh, i unintentionally clicked on your nick heinrich5991, and i saw "#DDRacemaX". It still exists?
23:33 <@heinrich5991> the channel, yes
23:33 <@heinrich5991> no idea about its contents
23:34 < Savander> which is official channel of teeworlds.com?
23:34 <@deen> teeworlds
23:34 < Savander> "teeworlds"?
23:36 < Savander> Thanks :)
23:36 <@heinrich5991> #teeworlds
23:36 <@heinrich5991> on quakenet (this network)
23:36 < Savander> yea, im there
23:37 < Savander> i should download IRC CLient
23:37 < Savander> because now im using webchat
23:37 < Savander> and it's uncomfortable
23:37 < Savander> to rejoin every time when i run computer.
23:39 < Savander> You use some?
23:39 <@deen> i use irssi + znc
23:39 < Savander> or nobody here is on windows?:D
23:42 < Teetime> On windows HexChat is pretty good
23:45 < Savander> i just installed XChat
23:47 < Savander_> :3
23:51 < Savander> .
23:53 < Savander> Ok, XChat is very small and very comfortable for windows users :3
