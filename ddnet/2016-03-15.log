20:16 < Henningstone> Somebody here who could help me with a little issue on sql? What am I doing wrong if the server completely ignores my config var "sv_sql_ip" and always tries to connect to "localhost"?
20:28 < Henningstone> nobody? :0
20:29 <+o_be_one> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/mysql.cfg
20:29 <+o_be_one> you did it like this i assume
20:29 <+o_be_one> we already seen some users with this kind of mysql issue :/
20:30 < Henningstone> yeah, and I changed "localhost" into the IP of my sqlserver
20:30 <+o_be_one> it seems to be a problem with the mysql driver
20:31 <+o_be_one> last time ive read deen answer this, he told to try the c++ mysql driver (idk how where etc.)
20:31 <+o_be_one> when ive tried to reproduce the bug it worked for me -_-
20:31 < Henningstone> huh, ok then I'll try it
20:41 < Henningstone> Yay it works :D "mysql.use_mysqlconfig" was set to false in my config.lua. Installing  libmysqlclient-dev and setting it to true did the trick!
20:50 <+o_be_one> nice ! :)
