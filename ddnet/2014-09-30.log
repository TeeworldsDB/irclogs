10:56 < heinrich5991> the servers are pretty flaky, huh?
11:21 < pause> It seems they're getting DDOSed
11:22 < laxa_work> not sure they are getting ddos when they are already empty.
11:22 < _KinG> hi all
11:25 < Nimda> DDNet USA went back online!
11:32 <@deen> hi _KinG 
11:32 < _KinG> deen:  is thee a problem with master server of tw?
11:33 <@deen> i don't see one
11:33 <@deen> is it not reachable from iran?
11:33 < _KinG> no not
11:33 < _KinG> for everyone
11:33 < _KinG> noone can see the intenet servers
11:33 <@deen> Hm, that's bad
11:33 < _KinG> but ddnet is visible
11:35 <@deen> can you ping 188.165.209.72?
11:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: all the servers going down in a row like that is pretty unusual
11:37 <@deen> don't know what's going on there, i hope noone is testing their ddos attacks
11:37 < _KinG> o_o
11:38 < _KinG> i ping 188.165.209.72 and it responds
11:38 <@deen> ok, that's one of the TW masterservers
11:38 <@deen> maybe UDP traffic or port 8303 is just blocked
11:38 < _KinG> for everyone?
11:39 <@deen> i had a problem like that with some ports around 8305 or something, so i had to switch to 730* for some servers
11:40 < _KinG> but noone in iran can see serverlist
11:40 < _KinG> except ones that have ddnet client they can just see the ddnet servers
11:40 <@deen> I think you should tell that in the teeworlds channel
11:41 <@deen> Maybe they know what's going on
11:42 < _KinG> i'll be back
11:42 <@deen> ok
11:43 <@deen> i hope they aren't blocking Teeworlds in Iran =/
11:46 <@deen> ah "the servers being flaky" may also just be DDNet FRA having routing problems, since "went down" means unreachable from FRA
11:46 <@deen> welcome back, KinG] 
11:46 < KinG]> hi
11:46 < KinG]> deen:  noone answers me ^^
11:47 <@deen> Yeah, maybe they're not here right now, I've seen
11:47 <@deen> But they'll definitely see it later
11:47 < KinG]> so u have problems on FRA ?
11:48 <@deen> no, why?
11:48 < KinG]> u just said somthing about it
11:49 <@deen> i'm just speculating, don't know^^

14:46 < pause> Your body uses energy to process food
14:50 < laxa_work> We are bornt at the wrong time, they'll have naptime at work in the future :(.
14:53 < pause> Either that or a thermonuclear war will destroy everything
14:53 < laxa_work> I really love your optimism pause !
14:54 < pause> It's called realism actually
14:54 < pause> It's only a question of time before someone launches one, and when that happens, it's party time !
14:54 < laxa_work> I don't think that'll ever happen.
14:55 < laxa_work> Or not for the next 100 years.
14:56 < laxa_work> We could think, that the judgment day will come one day or another !
14:56 < laxa_work> Then maybe all human race will be erased from nuclear launchs
14:58 < pause> Why do you think that ?
14:58 < laxa_work> Terminator =D
14:58 < pause> wtf
15:01 < laxa_work> This is awesome.

15:53 < pause> How could i come, i'm probably not invited since i'm not an employee ? 
15:53 < laxa_work> Buy your own entry and come with me ?
15:53 < pause> LOL
15:53 < pause> Well, buy it and maybe i'll reconsider
15:55 < laxa_work> Well, that means you are not interested to go to the circus xD
