18:46 <+SPYRES> Hi
18:47 <+SPYRES> Are people allowed to cheat their way through maps inorder to get within the top 5? In other words, are people allowed to use dummies and multiple clients to bypass sections inorder to finish the map as fast as possible?
19:12 <+laxadedi> Why not ?
19:14 <+SPYRES> you get people like dinner and maple who do a run and get top time because they actually deserve it. And then you get some people with multiple clients and cheat parts and then dinner and maples times get bumped up? tell me thats fair?
19:15 <+SPYRES> I understand that you may not have control over it but if you get the same group of people who go map after map and do it, they will have top times even though they dont deserve it
19:17 <+SPYRES> Maps are suppose to be done as a duo, or group - depending on the mode. Cheating parts and bypassing pasts defeats the purpose of a map.
19:17 <@EastByte> it's not possible to prevent such 'cheating' methods in team 0, one reason why there are teams
19:21 <+SPYRES> if i present a demo, can their times get removed?
19:24 <+laxadedi> I guess no
19:25 <+laxadedi> You have team rank
19:25 <+laxadedi> and team 0 rank
19:29 <@EastByte> I don't know, personally I think that team0 is more about casual playing, having fun and playing in big parties (not about the rank). So I wouldn't care about players abusing it to reach good times.
19:30 <+SPYRES> Yes i understand. So basically if you say i cant get their times removed. Whats the point of having /points. Then there should be /teampoints separate to /points
19:30 <+SPYRES> Cool. i catch ur drift Eastbyte. Then why not split into /points and /teampoints?
19:31 <+SPYRES> Have one for more casual and one for more competitive?
19:31 <@EastByte> I thought /points was only about finnishing maps, not the racing time
19:32 <+SPYRES> yes but doesnt finishing a map or racing a map still contribute to /points?
19:32 <+SPYRES> thats if the person has not gotten a time yet
19:33 <+SPYRES> So why not separate team 0 points to team <number> points?
19:34 <+SPYRES> wait... get me get my thoughts together
19:34 <+SPYRES> 1 sec
19:36 <@EastByte> in order to get points you only need to invest time finishing a map, it doesn't really matter if you do so on speed or not
19:36 <@EastByte> so I think team0 cheating doesn't have a negative impact on the points
20:12 <+SPYRES> Ill be back another to contest this matter! Cheers, Thanks for your time!
