10:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: you forgot to merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9096
13:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> explain more
14:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> aw
14:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki if you were to write a register allocator, what would you choose: graph coloring or linear scan register allocation? ðŸ˜¬
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> whathever llvm does
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh llvm allows to use different ones
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think pre llvm 3 used linear scan
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> and now graph coloring

16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shit they got me
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> hi devs
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and non devs
17:16 < bridge> <kppcn> hey everyone
17:17 < bridge> <kppcn> i just cant find any premade configs or manuals how to config F-DDRace for block
17:17 < bridge> <kppcn> i just cant find any premade configs or manuals how to config F-DDRace for block on copy love box
17:27 < bridge> <animepdf> Is ghost file format documented somewhere?
17:31 < bridge> <animepdf> ok, it's definition in code is pretty straightforward
17:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok hacker man @animepdf 
17:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who needs photoshop user guide when you can read the assembly of the executable
17:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kppcn ``sv_map "Copy Love Box"`` here you go
18:18 < bridge> <alw5> some fucked up looking dofs
18:18 < bridge> <alw5> some fucked up looking dogs
18:19 < bridge> <animepdf> there aren't any docs anyway :ss:
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Most importantly: sv_map "Copy Love Box"
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and sv_accounts 1
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I guess everything else, you have to read the descriptions of each command (in src/game/variables.h) and need to check what you want to change.
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> In the registration of configs in that file you'll see smth like 1, 0, 1 somewhere.
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> First number: default value
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Second number: Min value
18:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Third number: Max value

18:37 < bridge> <netsu_0741> we've decided to open it again but need some help..
18:41 < bridge> <zhn> u can visit chinese servers, im pretty sure they're still supporting it
18:41 < bridge> <nameless_me> i think he wants to run it himself
18:42 < bridge> <zhn> there's no sense in "re-opening" it since it's half done and you would not be able to expand any functionality without basic programming experience
18:42 < bridge> <Ewan> there are some in USA
18:42 < bridge> <Ewan> or, were
18:43 < bridge> <netsu_0741> we had our own mod, but its buggy and really ass
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> for the amount of time shinoa & broso56 were addicted
18:43 < bridge> <nameless_me> what he said is that he wants help reopening it, not asking if he should
18:43 < bridge> <netsu_0741> so yes there's point in using the old mod and adding funcionalities there.
18:44 < bridge> <zhn> you probably can ask @animepdf, he has plenty of experience in bootstraping old mrpg
18:56 < bridge> <netsu_0741> We need a permanent programmer, not an occasional one
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> get your wallet out then
18:58 < bridge> <Ewan> im not directing this towards you specifically but i don't understand how the fuck that sentiment develops in the first place. "i need to procure myself a dev to work long-term for free because i don't know how to do this"
18:59 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe the greedy or naive person's initial approach to open source software
18:59 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
19:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You might get lucky once in a while when developers find whatever you want developed fun to work on, but that's the only way you're going to get work done for free
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not long-term
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and if you're asking then it's probably never going to happen
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> because that's a major red flag
19:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, there's a chance if you already have a significant community and you ask if there are any willing developers hiding amongst them
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> the dev needs to be drawn to your project because it's actually cool and unique. they are not gonna be driven to work on it just because you ask them
19:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> deepseek:
19:02 < bridge> <louis> why so hostile
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i see it too much ig
19:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> i love u nouis
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> be ready to pay then idk, we worked on this project together in past but the all solid updates were done by kurosio himself
19:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but like, you need to have something that's capable of building that strong community in the first place
19:03 < bridge> <zhn> and he will not engage in any custom updates that he's forced to make
19:05 < bridge> <aegisub> what do you mean, I'm sure there are lots of developers here waiting to spend dozens of hours on a project they don't know because someone on the internet said please
19:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love doing unpaid work and then probably flamed when I don't work fast enough!
19:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love doing unpaid work and then probably getting flamed when I don't work fast enough!
19:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Programmers who don't know how to say no truly are one of the most exploited groups on the internet...
19:08 < bridge> <netsu_0741> Welcome to ddnet
19:09 < bridge> <louis> to be fair though you can't just ask for a developer for an old mod, you should give some incentive
19:09 < bridge> <louis> there are barely enough developers to maintain the main ddnet mod as it is
19:09 < bridge> <netsu_0741> Never asked for an old mod? We have our base. But currently no developers to make updates.
19:10 < bridge> <netsu_0741> We have our comunity
19:10 < bridge> <netsu_0741> We had our servers
19:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ask your community then
19:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> really the only way to make your niche ideas come true is to do it yourself
19:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> especially if theres no financial gain
19:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if your community doesn't attract developers then I'm afraid you're shit outta luck
19:11 < bridge> <netsu_0741> bad idea to ask such a question here in the first place
19:11 < bridge> <louis> sorry i meant the game mod itself is proabbly old and hard to get started on
19:12 < bridge> <netsu_0741> Exactly
19:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> idk what you expected tbh
19:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> literally who else plays teeworlds mmorpg
19:14 < bridge> <netsu_0741> no i meant that people flame others for no fucking reason
19:14 < bridge> <netsu_0741> my fault
19:15 < bridge> <hectavoxel> thats just the internet
19:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> stop trying to be dramatic
19:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you come asking for something unreasonable and people will point out that you're being unreasonable
19:16 < bridge> <netsu_0741> dramatic?
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i genuinely didn't mean to flame you, i'm sorry if i rubbed you the wrong way
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i got a little into it
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i will say i don't disagree with anything i said but it's also not a super absurd place to be mentally
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> im not mad w u or anything
19:17 < bridge> <netsu_0741> no i mean you had your point and yea it makes sense
19:17 < bridge> <netsu_0741> its just annoying seeing people this mentally uncapable of replying normally
19:17 < bridge> <netsu_0741> right @inv41idu53rn4m3 ?
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> see this is what I'm talking about
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and I'm sure you'd say the same thing back at me with a straight face
19:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (ok now I'm being dramatic sorry)
19:19 < bridge> <netsu_0741> Alright i did my question and got my reply thanks and have a grate day
19:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1337487946810658836/iu.png?ex=67a7a037&is=67a64eb7&hm=4e763740c1ca51cfe810205706d1e9bc1c6820bb3ae420de1200f9fcd2ee2513&
19:23 < bridge> <zhn> not really to be fair, but if you want someone to do all the work instead of you for no money at all, you have to be friends with this person or at least get any of their interest in your idea of mod
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i think a lot of the time, younger ppl just have a hard time gauging just how irrelevant whatever they're talking about is to everyone. not hard for them to believe this is a real opportunity for the dev & that there are that many devs sitting around bored enough for stuff like this
19:24 < bridge> <zhn> im sorry but didn't you call animepdf occasional programmer just because you asked for mod bootstrap first and actually wanted someone to fulfill your ideas in code on regular basis instead
19:45 < bridge> <netsu_0741> So since i was wrong about something this makes you assume im a child?
19:45 < bridge> <netsu_0741> do you see how problematic the ddnet comunity is
19:45 < bridge> <netsu_0741> or at least the developers
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> im no ddnet dev man this purple role is misleading and you should point fingers where they belong
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> your problem is with me and risu is just taking the piss
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> im not gonna assume you're a kid at this point
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i was more hoping that you were at the time that i said it because you seem reasonable
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:00 < bridge> <Assa> can we do anything against this bug? This is really aweful, I'd at least like a setting to turn this off ;_;
20:15 < bridge> <Solly> oh dear i read "mprg" as... well ya know
