10:38 <+bridge_> [16:18:10] [ddnet] <eeetadams> Player can take 2 flags
10:38 <+bridge_> [16:59:04] [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> This is DDNet. A selfstanding modification in an open source game. Everyone can take part in updating mods. For fng u may ask noby
10:38 <+bridge_> [17:00:17] [ddnet] <eeetadams> ok..
10:38 <+bridge_> [17:15:38] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based :BASED:
10:38 <+bridge_> [17:16:05] [ddnet] <Not Keks> already told ya 4 team fng exists xd
10:38 <+bridge_> [17:16:11] [ddnet] <Not Keks> it just sucks and nobody plays it
10:38 <+bridge_> [19:35:07] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i started making a "smart team specator" where it changes who you spec based on a scoring system e.g, if someone is frozen it gets -50 score so it prioritises others who arent
10:38 <+bridge_> [19:35:29] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and maybe its smart enough that u can leave it there and it spectates the most relevant players automatically
10:38 <+bridge_> [19:36:15] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (only for teams)
10:38 <+bridge_> [19:59:07] [ddnet] <louis> yeah or like players with most actions per second
10:38 <+bridge_> [19:59:44] [ddnet] <bencie> so botters :justatest:
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:00:40] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944307446774640650/unknown.png
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:00:45] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still happening @deen
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:07:27] [ddnet] <Voxel> will there be a cooldown for when it switches? because i can already think that two players are going to be just as active and the smart spec is going to constantly switch between the two without deciding who's doing more action
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:30:32] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:35:38] [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Make a spec that looks at the most average position. So on 2 player teams it's always between both tees. Also automated zooming so all tees are visible. Mix that with cinematic cam and U got a epic viewing experience
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:49:05] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye that would be cool
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:49:12] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Im 'corneum but in some parts players are simply too far
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:51:32] [ddnet] <louis> headshot already made that
10:38 <+bridge_> [20:53:06] [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> headbot

10:38 <+bridge_> [20:53:50] [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> another client already has that
10:38 <+bridge_> [21:00:27] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so if another client has it we cant do it
10:38 <+bridge_> [21:00:30] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pack it up boys
10:38 <+bridge_> [21:00:41] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
10:38 <+bridge_> [21:13:06] [ddnet] <louis> i dont think acqwerty meant that

19:08 <+ChillerDragon> Hmm sees like my client somehow got -42 in m_HookedPlayer -.- is it worth adding a >= 0 < MAX_CLIENTS check there in case the server sends some crap or did i mess up my client? :D https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/iZ 
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut ^ happend on F-DDrace 
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :/
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> snapshot validation should prevent that
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> at least on 0.7
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2688
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> appears to be missing on ddnet, but this looks like it might have effects on physics :monkaS:
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> or not, as the validation was never active, all values were allowed
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> @ZombieToad for u my dear

20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> thnx
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can the ping cause the client to be frozen for several seconds?

20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it happens to me on windows sometimes
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i dont think so
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont know
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i use windows
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might not happen to you but it may be the cause of it for me
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such thing happens when UB is involved
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> several seconds is always:
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> something on HDD
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> PSU doesnt deliver enough energy
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> windows doing weird shit
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> some insane loop
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> alien invasation
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> several seconds is always:
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> something on HDD
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> PSU doesnt deliver enough energy - or overheating
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> windows doing weird shit
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> some insane loop
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> alien invasation
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have ddnet on a SSD nvme that goes up to 1500mbs
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and other programs work while its frozen
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows sucks
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> i think that its caused by him joining :troll:
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cpu and gpu sitting at 50C
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i think its richard stallman telling me to not use windows
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> why do you even use it rn, dota? xd
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im playing some aaa games
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> my game sometimes freezes when windows antivirus is scanning stuff
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz im enjoying my gpu
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i c
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i can play dota in linux with vulkan
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but with my previous gpu it crashed my whole system
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> all games i play work on steam play lukely 😄
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its cuz the gpu was faulty
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i even opened a bug report https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1732
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to test if it happens with my current gpu
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> maybe shitty drivers
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> the thing i fear most
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks its most probably it
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> doesnt matter what you implement, you never know if its your shitty implementation or the drivers xD
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> validation layers on vulkan are alraedy gold
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> especially the extensions, synchronization validation, and the ones reported by the driver directly
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but since amdgpu sits in the kernel you really have to be careful with vulkan on linux xD
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> instant system crashes always
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i get
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> on windows it sits in the user space
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> at least "more", you cant bluescreen it so ezt
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> at least "more", you cant bluescreen it so ez
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> so we're still doing the SVG thingy, right?
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> well so far i have 3 map res sheets done, and 2 in progress
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/944692835729424394/unknown.png
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> we do until we have all SVGs we need, so yeah 😄
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> make place for ads on website ddnet
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so ddnet can Finance himself
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ww:
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> https://ddnet.tw/funding/
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> there isn't really a need as of right now for other methods of funding other than donations
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> and aslong there is no need, why should there be annoying stuff like ads on the website?
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> every 5 attempts on ddnet you have to sit through an ad /j
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet has no finance issues
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u bring it up when the answer is the same
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Why new donation increase 2022 funds instead of completing previous completd years? :kek:
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its always been like that
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Why new donation increase 2022 funds instead of completing previous  years? :kek:
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it doesnt even matter
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> "When the current year is fully covered, we still appreciate donations to cover the costs of the last years:"
22:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> This is really a cosmetic issue in fund page
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Actually this is just a cosmetic issue in fund page
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> people prefer to cover current servers. i cover the old ones, doesn‘t matter
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> add an option to donate without any of the money going to the overpriced brazil server that costs nearly 3 times more than any other server
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sure, just tell me a good hoster in brazil that won‘t kick us out after a few dos attacks
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and you can just say which server you want to fund in your donation and i only count it towards that one
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> chile is near by that should be good enough
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> routing in south america is horrible
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> each country only has routes to the US
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so chile to brazil can be ping 200
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> dafuck? there's not even a cable circumventing south america?
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i don‘t know. some players told me that a few yeaes ago, and some traceroutes confirmed it
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mefju> gives something ddnet co-financing?
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Can I force /pause command to only pause or only unpause?
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Current /pause command is a toggle request to server.
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What is /pause UDP packet got lost?
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <kiwq> You could do `/pause 0` or `/pause 1`
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> try /pause 1 maybe
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and /pause 0
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Apparently `/pause 1` works, but `/pause 0` doesn't 😄
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Just tried it
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how about /unpause
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it works
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't exist
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, ez fix i guess
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I was thinking the same
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's /unlock, so there should be /unpause
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> pause takes a player name, i don't remember that
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and /unspec as well
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ah, so with /pause you can watch someone with that name
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Admin can force pause on others?
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> `/pause deen` to watch deen
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, you pause and immediately watch that person I guess
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> yes
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 1 is the ID
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> it should be player name, not id
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> why do you need it anyway @Wohoo ?
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> afaik moderator cant force pause but force spec. we can do pausevoted
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok, I figured out a way
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Try feature server side, if your tee is moved it send youba trigger.
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Then client, if enable smart unpause, can automatically spam /unpause
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Try feature server side, if your tee is moved it send you a trigger.
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Then client, if enable smart unpause, can automatically spam /unpause
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Very useful if you get moved while in spect
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> To reliably pause: `/pause /` (since / is not a valid player name this always puts you in pause
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> To reliably unpause: `/mc;pause /;pause`
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Could you explain this command?
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Mc is new to me
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> mc is multicommand, so you can put multiple chat commands together, separated by ;
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> so why is it /;pause instead of ;/pause, is that a typo?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because we pass the player name `/` to the `pause` chat command
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (could use any other invalid player name instead of /, but that's the easiest
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I think it could be good, if mc is sent in one packet
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> it is
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> It's just a single chat message, the server then splits it up and runs all the command in a single tick
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so it should work instantly
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> This feature has been requested so many times.
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It just need a check box client side and a way to send trigger server -> client
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Perfect! 
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> No need for unpause.
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Just misuse the pause argument ❤️
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> At least for tests it good enough
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @deen doesn't tee position is already known by client when paused?
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It could be a client side feature only.
