13:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Shishigami> deen: I think the release dates for various maps in the server info are wrong: http://i.imgur.com/gusJqLv.png
14:03 <+test> Can someone tell me how to set dyncam permanently off? When I say cl_dyncam 1 it's off but when I restart ddnet it's on again :/
14:08 <+test> ok i found it in general settings ....
17:20 <@deen> @Shishigami: Thanks, fixing it
19:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: that was the other thing I wanted to ask about
19:20 <@heinrich5991> I doubt that there are any 32bit macs around anymore
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> ah
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so we don't need universal libs anymore?
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> i removed ppc already
19:21 <@heinrich5991> last mac produced was apparantly 2007
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so they stopped working?
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> my laptop is made in 2008 and I still regularly use it
19:21 <@heinrich5991> do you run macos on it?
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nope
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> but i know we still have quite a few winxp players with really old computers too
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so not sure if we can drop macosx 32bit
19:27 <@heinrich5991> deen: -mmacosx-version-min=10.7
19:28 <@heinrich5991> 10.6 is apparantly the last osx with 32bit support
19:28 <@heinrich5991> +SDL2_framerate.h

19:28 <@deen> heinrich5991: build fails after your change, not sure what to do: https://travis-ci.org/ddnet/ddnet/builds/257396075?utm_source=email&utm_medium=notification
19:28 <@heinrich5991> (ignore +SDL2_framerate.h)
19:29 <@heinrich5991> hm.. dunno why
19:29 <@heinrich5991> don't want to investigate right now, reverting is ok
19:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> Best addition to TW, fat skins. Tys guys
19:30 <@deen> :)
19:30 <@deen> nono, probably just need to fix the travis file
19:30 <@deen> local build works fine
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> DDCat is not beeing shown in the preview fyk
19:36 <@deen> yeah, i know. but i think it would not be so nice to implement that
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> k
20:05 <@Nimda_9885> SkyLand2 by Greeen & CrashtimeHD just released on Brutal at 2017-07-25 20:00
22:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/814
22:36 <@deen> heinrich5991: i wanted to test it, but brew installed old cmake version which didn't know the commands
22:36 <@deen> so i updated brew, now it doesn't run anymore
22:36 <@deen> great!
22:37 <@Learath2> osx best os
22:37 <@heinrich5991> deen: doesn't know which commands?
22:37 <@deen>   Unknown CMake command "target_compile_options".
22:38 <@deen> so dtruss (strace equivalent on osx) requires root to run, brew refuses to run as root
22:38 <@deen> great!
22:38 <@deen> I'm afraid of fucking up my vm, then I have to learn how to cross-compile to osx
22:39 <+eeeee> on osx even gdb requires root
22:39 <+eeeee> user aint supposed to bother with such things
22:39 <@Learath2> well it works for granny
22:39 <+eeeee> if something doesn't work just return it to appstore instead of debugging
22:40 <@Learath2> maybe we should just take it to a apple genius
22:40 <@Learath2> they'd know what to do
22:40 <@heinrich5991> even cmake 2.8 seems to support target_compile_options
22:40 <+eeeee> good idea too, they might replace your whole mac to see if that fixes it
22:40 <@heinrich5991> brew seems to do some serious software archeology
22:41 <@heinrich5991> lol
22:41 <@heinrich5991> debian oldoldstable has 2.8.9
22:41 <@Learath2> oldoldstable is what lenny?
22:42 <@heinrich5991> wheezy
22:42 <@heinrich5991> (there was a debian release recently)
22:42 <@Learath2> damn that's the first version of debian i used
22:43 <@deen> looks like my osx is already broken
22:43 <@deen> heinrich5991: nah, I just didn't update this VM in forever
22:43 <@deen> i only use it to compile ddnet
22:43 <@Learath2> deen: well might be time to get a new one going :)
22:43 <@deen> nooooo
22:44 <@deen> way too much work setting that up
22:44 <@Learath2> is it really that hard to set up?
22:45 <@Learath2> can one even cross compile to osx?
22:45 <@heinrich5991> I quickly googled it today
22:45 <@heinrich5991> the internet strongly suggested that the answer is no
22:45 <@heinrich5991> but it's probably possible.... somehow
22:46 <@Learath2> i love how they just had to be different
22:46 <@Learath2> frameworks, the fuck are frameworks
22:47 <@Learath2> can we maybe extract the results of a travis build?
22:47 <@Learath2> deen: you might not even have to bother building it yourself
22:49 <@deen> we have travis for macosx?
22:50 <@Learath2> i'll check if we can haz, there seems to be documentation on it
22:58 <@Learath2> it does seem possible but doesn't look like they have many build hosts available, takes way too long
23:05 <@deen> can I tell cmake to ignore pkg-config and use our bundled libs?
23:05 <@deen> need that to build the releases
23:06 <@Learath2> guessing heinrich would need to implement that as a switch somewhere
23:06 <@Learath2> don't think there is a default option
23:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: I wanted to implement travis next
23:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: -DPKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=NO
23:07 <@Learath2> well it's not the --recursive flag
23:08 <@Learath2> really interesting how circleci can do it just fine
23:24 <@heinrich5991> .
23:25 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: my guess is it's the shallow clone
23:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> I cant login as a MOD. It just ask mes for a password but even with my  password i wont login. Any help`
23:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> ?
23:25 <@Learath2> could you give that a try, can't really commit it from this computer
23:25 <@deen> Learath2: you broke that I guess ^
23:25 <@deen> what Rico is saying
23:25 <@Learath2> @Rico on official servers?
23:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> TEst
23:25 <@Learath2> You can't really login until the servers are all updated and advertise themselves correctly as username requiring servers
23:26 <@deen> Learath2: wtf?
23:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> hm... ok
23:26 <@deen> Learath2: you know lots of people run old servers and will never update them?
23:26 <@deen> so they can never log in again?
23:26 <@Learath2> deen: they don't require usernames anyways
23:26 <@deen> why not?
23:27 <@deen> we had username feature in old versions
23:27 <@Learath2> if they run old servers they don't support usernames anyways
23:27 <@deen> you should only have enabled the new stuff for sufficiently new server version
23:27 <@Learath2> we don't really advertise the server version
23:27  * MyStery_fox slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
23:27 <@heinrich5991> Rico: you should be able to log in with the rcon_login local console command
23:28 <@deen> I restarted the empty servers, try again
23:28 <@Learath2> now that i think about it we should have made that message a way to advertise server version instead
23:28 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: damn why didn't you suggest that :P
23:28 <@heinrich5991> I thought about that
23:28  * MyStery_fox slaps Learath2 around a bit with a large fishbot
23:28  * MyStery_fox slaps laxa around a bit with a large fishbot
23:28 <@heinrich5991> MyStery_fox: stop please
23:28  * MyStery_fox slaps Teetime around a bit with a large fishbot
23:28 <+MyStery_fox> NEIN
23:28 <+laxa> MyStery_fox: :)
23:28 <@Learath2> could have even put it in a serverinfo msg
23:28 <@Learath2> ouch
23:28 <@deen> Learath2: but we don't usually break stuff like logging into servers...
23:28 <@Learath2> poor mysteryfox
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> thx heinrich5991 it worked
23:29 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: the problem with server version is that it's not modular
23:29 <@Learath2> deen: it would have broken either way tho, really no way around it :/
23:29 <@heinrich5991> suppose you're a mod that wants to implement the password thing
23:29 <@heinrich5991> with the version thing, you'd have to support a whole lot of other ddnet features too
23:29 <@Learath2> new clients would identify the server as old incase of advertising the server version
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> @deen the restart helped aswell
23:30 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: true true
23:30 <+MyStery_fox> wow thats hars
23:30 <+MyStery_fox> h
23:30 <@heinrich5991> sorry, we had to fight with spammers recently
23:30 <+MyStery_fox> i was just slapping my friends around :o dont need to kick me PFF
23:30 <@heinrich5991> but please don't spam the chat :)
23:30  * MyStery_fox slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
23:30 <@Learath2> i think we did the right thing by just getting it over with
23:30 <+MyStery_fox> you kind of deserved that ;)
23:31 <@Learath2> yes heinrich5991 take that
23:31 <+MyStery_fox> â™¥
23:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: /var/root/ddnet-pr_ddnet_fix_cmake_mac/src/engine/client/text.cpp:13:10: fatal error: 'ft2build.h' file not found
23:43 <@deen> and -DPKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=NO doesn't seem to do anything
23:44 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you cleared your cache?
23:44 <@deen> how to do that?
23:44 <@heinrich5991> rm CMakeCache.txt
23:44 <@heinrich5991> in the build directory
23:45 <@heinrich5991> (otherwise it will remember the previously-discovered libs)
23:45 <@heinrich5991> *previously discovered
23:45 <@deen> same result
23:45 <@deen> it's not using the bundled libs at all
23:46 <@heinrich5991> ah
23:46 <@heinrich5991> the problem is that it's finding the libs regardless of whether it has pkg-config or not
23:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: where do you get that ft2build.h error? mac?
23:48 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: did i tell you to try removing the shallow from submodules?
23:48 <@Learath2> can't keep track of what i did and didn't do :P
23:48 <@deen> yes
23:48 <@heinrich5991> I told deen to do that :)
23:48 <@Learath2> deen: did it work? :P
23:48  * heinrich5991 lazy
23:49 <@deen> i should have done what?
23:49 <@heinrich5991> "should"
23:49  * Learath2 is buzzing around the house getting ready to leave for turkey :P
23:49 <@heinrich5991> I suggested that reverting my commit might fix travis
23:49 <@Learath2> deen: remove shallow from .gitmodules
23:49 <@deen> don't remember anyone telling me that
23:49 <@Learath2> could also sed it out in the travis script
23:49 <@deen> why do i have to do that instead of you guys directly?
23:50 <@Learath2> i don't have a clone on this computer
23:50 <@heinrich5991> cause /me lazy -- will do it later
23:50 <@deen> github has webinterface editing
23:50 <@Learath2> i'll do it w/e
23:50 <@deen> and didn't we just include the shallow?
23:50 <@deen> to save space?
23:50 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:50 <@heinrich5991> but travis seems to chokeo n it
23:51 <@deen> yeah, because old git versions can't update shallow clones
23:51 <@heinrich5991> ahh
23:51 <@deen> only new ones can
23:51 <@Learath2> want me to sed it out for travis or just revert heinrich5991's commit?
23:52 <@deen> it's already in, dunno where the github bot is
23:52 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: sed doesn't help probaby
23:52 <@heinrich5991> or wait, do we manually update submodules?
23:52 <@deen> yes
23:52 <@Learath2> deen: you normally don't you need to do the thing in my pr to disable travis's own submodule thing
23:58 <+MyStery_fox> deen do the right thing!
23:58 <@deen> MyStery_fox: kick you out as mod?
