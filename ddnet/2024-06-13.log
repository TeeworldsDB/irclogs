11:27 <+bridge> <learath2> How do you guys pronounce SQL? I like just spelling it but I met a couple people that say `sequel`
11:28 <+bridge> <avolicious> https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7231/how-is-sql-pronounced
11:28 <+bridge> <avolicious> so sequel sounds correct
11:30 <+bridge> <avolicious> > The official way to pronounce ‚ÄúMySQL‚Äù is ‚ÄúMy Ess Que Ell‚Äù (not ‚Äúmy sequel‚Äù), but we do not mind if you pronounce it as ‚Äúmy sequel‚Äù or in some other localized way.

11:31 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> my squeal
11:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> my teacher pronounces it that way too and it's kinda funny

12:12 <+bridge> <Peakies> S.Q.L maybe don't know which one is right I saw on yt that people say sequel but I think it's S.Q.L
12:15 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> How i can make a block server
12:15 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> I can make just ddrace servers

12:22 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> How i can use it
12:23 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> @fokkonaut
12:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> see this message
12:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> You can either compile it or download artifacts from GitHub actions
12:28 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> i can acces to this link
12:29 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> this
12:30 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> i cant acces to this link
12:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://discord.gg/qccRrtb
12:38 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> I go developer channel and i opened the F-DDrace link but i dont now what i should to do
12:39 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> @fokkonaut
12:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Try this link again
13:09 <+bridge> <psj_3> ik
13:37 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Yeah, mostly a Microsoft (Sequel) vs Linux (S.Q.L.) difference. I switched to Sequel at my first job üòÑ It also fits well in my mind with the QUEL language (https://www.holistics.io/blog/quel-vs-sql/)  that should have won out instead
13:37 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Then we'd still be using ingres and not postgres
14:10 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> @fokkonaut how i can compile f-ddrace github source
14:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> using cmake
14:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Or download the artifacts, its compiled already then
14:40 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> where i can download?
14:40 <+bridge> <arashnotfound> where i can download artifacts?
14:40 <+bridge> <jxsl13> on github
14:41 <+bridge> <jxsl13> try watching a tutorial about how to use github.
14:41 <+bridge> <jxsl13> usually under "releases" or you download the source code
14:41 <+bridge> <jxsl13> and compile the executable
14:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Or get a GitHub account and click on the green checkmark next to the commit then on the build job then on summary and at the bottom you can download the artifacts for that commit
14:43 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> hi chiller :owo:
14:43 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yo catto
14:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I was working on some tw code base every day for almost the entire year now. This week I tried quitting caffeine and I basically didn‚Äôt touch my laptop since last Friday lmao
14:45 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Life feels meaningless without coffee
14:49 <+bridge> <zhn> oh god your worst dream comes true
14:50 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Classic drug addict life
14:50 <+bridge> <zhn> chiller do you mind if i'll change structure of ddnet-insta a bit
14:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If it conflicts with ddnet yes I do mind
14:51 <+bridge> <zhn> current inheritance in gamemodes makes hard to implement vanilla mods
14:51 <+bridge> <learath2> If you are proper wired for coffee it takes a couple weeks
14:51 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> There is not supposed to be vanilla
14:51 <+bridge> <learath2> We need ddnet-skeleton
14:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @gerdoe: use ddnet-ctf for that
14:52 <+bridge> <zhn> did you really make another repo just for that
14:52 <+bridge> <zhn> da fak
14:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/JSaurusRex/ddnet/tree/vanilla
14:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I told saur to do it
14:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt have energy to do it
14:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But vanilla gameplay is intentionally out of scope that‚Äôs why it is called ddnet-insta
14:53 <+bridge> <zhn> i don't ask you to do it, im asking if i can propose it to ddnet-insta so current gctf servers could host bridged vanilla with the same mod
14:54 <+bridge> <zhn> its not though
14:54 <+bridge> <zhn> insta replaces damaging with instakill and thats it
14:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If it adds more conflict surface with ddnet I won‚Äôt merge it. I don‚Äôt think the complexity it adds is worth it.
14:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No there is also the shotgun and gun curvature and pickups
14:55 <+bridge> <zhn> its all going to be in src/game/server/gamemodes
14:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Doubt
14:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> But if you manage to do it there then it can be used
14:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Anyways I think ctf should be a separate project
14:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Which it already is btw
14:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It even has servers running
14:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 45.142.178.158:8709
14:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Also don‚Äôt Bridge vanilla just update your client
14:57 <+bridge> <zhn> can't connect
14:57 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/ddnet7-client/
14:57 <+bridge> <zhn> ye i don't really mind to play on 0.7 with 110 ping
14:58 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe jsaur is messing w the server idk
14:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Fuk.
15:04 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @jsaurusrex:
15:05 <+bridge> <jsaurusrex> i was, i restarted it to update config
15:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @gerdoe: if you want to change the gamemode inheritance you gotta pr that to ddnet not to ddnet-insta
15:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> if you dont want to bother with \#7777 then just join jsaurus
15:07 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> jsaurus just needs to get his branding done right its just some weird ass hidden branch. The project needs a real repo and name like ddnet-ctf and then you guys can use that
17:11 <+bridge> <louis> are the new youtube ads unblockable xd
17:16 <+bridge> <cipy29> i haven't seen an ad yet
17:17 <+bridge> <louis> looks like my account is part of their beta testing lmao
17:17 <+bridge> <louis> unskippable 2 minute ads is crazy
17:18 <+bridge> <cipy29> tradeoff of US always getting new stuff first
17:18 <+bridge> <cipy29> you can complain to chatgpt voice about your yt ads
17:28 <+bridge> <cauldron1> hello, is the 255 telelimit only in the map editor or is it the real limit? what would for example happen if you would open a map with binary editor and change tele to something above 255. or customize the map editor to allow higher numbers?
17:36 <+bridge> <learath2> I wonder if they ended up literally stitching the add onto the actual video stream
17:36 <+bridge> <learath2> I wonder if they ended up literally stitching the ad onto the actual video stream
17:37 <+bridge> <learath2> Iirc it's a real limit. We use a single byte for the teleno. But I'll have to confirm later
17:49 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Ah ok thanks. If it was possible someone would have done it already I guess.
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh 9000 series or wait for x3d versions
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16% IPC plus is not bad
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dunno, hoped for more
18:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> could have at least do 6GHZ xd

21:41 <+bridge> <totar> is this the practice exploit?
21:42 <+bridge> <totar> that seems very map specific
21:48 <+bridge> <totar> maybe practice makes it not map specific
21:54 <+bridge> <totar> ok I understand
23:27 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> TRUE!
