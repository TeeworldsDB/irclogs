07:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich send brain
07:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am starting to blame something ddnet and teeworlds do in the cmakelists that messes up my hot reloading
07:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so this one hot reloads perfectly https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/0470c1716f764ebe554ea2a6115e46bf8d75a2de/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L845-L909
07:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its a veeeeery slimmed down version of the teeworlds code base
07:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and this one does not work https://github.com/TeeworldsBotLib/teeworlds/blob/3cd2607c7d322014eb0dfa6f58a9bdcbd32b478b/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1276-L1340
07:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> neither in ddnet nor in teeworlds
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/koute/bytehound
09:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try debugging it beyond works/doesn't work, ChillerDragon
10:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well its the same doesn't work it used to be
10:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it seems to find the symbols that were statically linked unless i copy paste the code into my minimal example -.-
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you enable `-rdynamic` in both cases?
10:43 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
10:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (and you have verified that by looking at the raw build commands)
10:46 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
10:47 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i added rdynamic because without it says symbol not found and then the `file` command says "not stripped" so i am sure its applied
10:47 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> working one:
10:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `teeworlds_srv: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=0da68a5bc1557e6a4f79b811ca012eb174855643, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped`
10:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> non working one:
10:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `teeworlds_srv: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=6f05358423394232a821f8a952215a0f5f377bbe, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped`
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "not stripped" is unrelated to `-rdynamic`
10:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt rdynamic about exposing the symbols?
11:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `/usr/bin/c++ -g CMakeFiles/teeworlds_srv.dir/src/engine/server/server.cpp.o CMakeFiles/teeworlds_srv.dir/src/external/TeeworldsBotLib/src/bots/base.cpp.o CMakeFiles/teeworlds_srv.dir/src/external/TeeworldsBotLib/src/bots/sample.cpp.o CMakeFiles/teeworlds_srv.dir/src/external/TeeworldsBotLib/src/shared/hotreload.cpp.o "CMakeFiles/json.dir/src/engine/external/json-parser/json.c.o"

11:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looking at that seems like a good idea gimme a sec
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `-rdynamic` is about exposing the symbols of the executable to shared libraries
11:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and stripping is about hiding symbols
11:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea both make VERBOSE=1 show rdynamic on every target
11:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will try to minimize that further so i can reason easier about it
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only non-dynamic symbols
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but `-rdynamic` is only about dynamic symbols
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> TeeworldsBOTLib? <a:alarm:774780596731904032>
11:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon likes to be edgy, but it's server-side bots apparently
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, false <a:alarm:774780596731904032>
11:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea i somehow thought the stripping gave hints about that 
11:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye either way i now verified rdynamic is applied on both i still dont really know what the difference between the working and non working code base is
11:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but im losing focus so ill continue tomorrow :D
11:15 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> chillerdragon yo
11:16 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> still hot reloading problems mhh
11:16 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> just blame global variables and live the best life
12:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye but i am so close. I now know that everything i want is possible. I just can't get it to work in a real codebase :D 
12:15 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> sadly remote debugging is always hard
12:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this channel has been very helpful already
12:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur name backwards is so unintuitive xd
12:16 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> rats

12:36 <+ws-client> <ratspuJ> good that for saying "rust" u dont need to open your mouth <:lol:460429405328506900>

12:41 < bridge> <egyt> you fooled me! how dare are you!
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> Did they knock you out or did you get local?

15:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> do you need help with anything?
15:16 < sdsds> Hi, I read for days and weeks words of bigotry and hate against homo and black people in ddnet from RUS, UKR, and POL.
15:16 < sdsds> Names like Hitler, Adolf, 88 and so on.
15:16 < sdsds> All tolerated by their "tolerants" admins.
15:17 < sdsds> Yesterday a crazy and cringe psycho stalked me for hours asking about black and homosexual people.
15:17 < sdsds> Finally started like a fucking mad guy telling me he loves me and more words, i tried to ignore him, but every tim you disconnect, the ignore is forgoten.
15:18 < sdsds> So I decided to say who is and what he does.
15:18 < sdsds> Admin instead of helping banned me.
15:18 < sdsds> I am going to research who are the admins in ddnet, and show the world: NAMES, SURNAMES, PHOTOS of DDNET admins tolerating nazism, fascism, racism and homophobia.
15:18 < sdsds> To all the world. 
15:19 < sdsds> And belive me that is not going to be a good thing for them.
15:19 < bridge> <zhn> we have a good ticket system if you join discord server you'll be able to use it
15:19 < sdsds> It is what they deserves.
15:19 < sdsds> And I am starting collecting name, surname and photos of devels.
15:19 < sdsds> All of them.
15:19 < sdsds> Implicated in this bigotry and hateness full servers.
15:19 < bridge> <zhn> you are multiplying this hate yourself though
15:20 < sdsds> Believe me that I am going to do this. Indeed,I al ready started.
15:20 < sdsds> :)
15:20 < sdsds> Nah, I am going to create a web with names, surnames an dphotos, and what the admins tolerate: racism, fascism, nazism,. homophiobia.
15:21 < sdsds> But not a single one in the other team: democracy and human rights.
15:21 < sdsds> You all are a piece of shit because it is IMPOSIBLE to believe that you dont know what it is already happening there.
15:21 < bridge> <zhn> the bad part is that we have moderators that are trying to moderate ddnet servers and they do it on their free time
15:21 < bridge> <zhn> i have never heard an admin or moderator tolerating anything you pointed
15:22 < sdsds> That "moderators" are tolerating nazism, racism, and homophobia. Yesterday for 2 hours I was told that I am a nigga fucker faggot.
15:22 < sdsds> I am not black, and I am antifascist and I dont tolerate that.
15:22 < bridge> <zhn> so who did it?
15:22 < sdsds> Who?
15:22 < sdsds> Go to any server from rus and pol and tell me who DONT.
15:22 < sdsds> xD
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wazzup ddnets
15:23 < sdsds> I dont know what is happening in that countries, but that teenegers are full of hate.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and teeworlder
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> as i said ddnet has ticket system in discord server
15:23 < sdsds>  Iwill not change my username. I am proud of what I said.
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> its not moderators nor admins fault for not being able to modeeate something
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> its their free time and no one pays them
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's friday, it's weekend, it's freedom, it's FFR
15:23 < sdsds> Nah, you are responsible of what there happens.
15:23 < sdsds> So I will show, I made some videos.
15:23 < sdsds> And I am editing.
15:24 < sdsds> Name, surname, photos. And videos of what there happens.
15:24 < bridge> <zhn> oke go ahead weirdo
15:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> you're upset at the wrong people
15:24 < sdsds> That is not tolerated in the Europan Union.
15:24 < sdsds> That is ilegal. 100%
15:24 < sdsds> So you will have the problems you created.
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am the law
15:24 < sdsds> Tolerating that befaveiour for years.
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> obay me
15:24 < bridge> <zhn> :kek:
15:24 < sdsds> The law is what we created in european institutions, not you Freak.
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your behafier is quit gud
15:25 < sdsds> And believe me that I will put all the names and surnames and their photos with the videos.
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> heyho jupjop
15:25 < sdsds> Showing the world what toxic and bigotry ambient is there.
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> and hey big melony
15:25 < sdsds> DDNET = S H I T
15:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> gesundheit!
15:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> leak me aswell while you're at it

15:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> wtf hans, stop leak
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> finally ill see the happy father melony
15:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
15:26 < sdsds> You will get what you deserve.
15:26 < bridge> <zhn> ita kind of coincident

15:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> support him even harder so he can finish our new source tiihii
16:01 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I just managed to kill my fps in teeworlds  with animations
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time for binary search
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lazy devs knew it:
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```cpp
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> // TODO: make this smarter.. binary search
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ah, classic, leave a todo and never look at it again
16:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Do you think 200 fps are enough in teeworlds, when you own a GTX 3070 or will people start complaining about lag?
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd complain
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I fixed this by clipping each animated quad layer
16:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> lol, why is this like this?
16:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> an animation 1000 blocks away issues the gpu otherwise
16:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I fixed this by clipping each animated quad layer in it's own group
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> We do our best to moderate the servers, if you think a moderator has failed in that duty, feel free to report the moderator. 
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> 
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Under both US and EU law, best effort moderation is completely acceptable. (Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act in the US and Article 12 of the EU E-Commerce Directive, IANAL that's just how I understand them). Furthermore the sort of content you mentioned is under procedural accountability, so under current EU law, I believe our obligation is to only take down that sort of illegal content on notice. (Which I'm not even sure applies d
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> 
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Now that we have the law out of the way, let's talk more subjectively. I do agree that we have a moral obligation to keep the chat clean. Which is why moderators exist and have a mandate to mute/ban/kick players that engage in inflammatory speech. Since moderators are not omnipotent, omniscient nor moderate 24/7 it's unreasonable to expect the chat to be completely void of any speech that might offend others at all times.
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> 
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Finally, I'll speculate a bit. I think that you are just bitter because you got banned and are just using this very serious issue just as a crutch to get back at the people you blame for getting banned. If you were unjustly banned as you say, you'd simply appeal the ban and not use a random name to hide yourself. Thus I believe that you were banned for good reason, which makes it even more ironic that you'd complain about our handling of hate spee

16:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is this accurate
16:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> i wouldnt say so myself °-°
16:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> figured
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ~80% correct
16:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> do you guys think he'll leak his website when he's done?
16:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> i really wanna see what kind of picture he chooses of me
16:21 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, I never thought I can map so hard, that it causes FPS issues xD
16:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> some maps lower my fps down to 1500 - which is impressive given i can play at ~20K if i dont cap it
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> You are not staff, I'd guess you are safe
16:22 < bridge> <Bota> Discord analyzing chat Is more scary than lero beeing mad :justatest:

16:22 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I bet I can make teeworlds a slide show to you
16:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when did lero get mad
16:23 < bridge> <Bota> The long text?
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> I thought I was pretty neutral in tone
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> he's the sweetest sweetheart
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> Don't say that, you might get cancelled by association
16:24 < bridge> <Bota> :lol:
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you cancelled
16:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> !cancel Learath2
16:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> you're gone for

16:35 < bridge> <learath2> "I have failed to remove racism that I was not alerted to, and for that I'm deeply sorry. I should have done better and existed on all servers at the same time at all hours of the day. Going forward I'll become as god and be omnipotent and omniscient."

16:38 < bridge> <learath2> You don't want to be seen with a racism propagator
16:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In all recent times, I, as a former moderator have failed to accomplish my duty and restrict the use of a sort of negative activity called "Racism" which myself was not capable of noticing, thus for thee I, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to this community. If I would turn back time, I feel like I would've done better preparations for the mistakes I made, thus would've considered making several paralel universes which form a wormhole, th

16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Response from google Gemini:
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> 
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> I appreciate your sincerity and willingness to take responsibility. Here's a more realistic approach to tackling racism in your future moderation efforts:
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> 
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Self-Education: Racism can be subtle. Learn about racial bias and microaggressions. Read books and articles by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) authors who discuss their experiences.
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Community Guidelines: Create clear community guidelines that define racism and unacceptable behavior.
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Enforcement: Be consistent in enforcing the guidelines. Don't be afraid to remove racist comments or posts, even if it creates conflict.
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Open Communication: Encourage open communication where people can report racism.
16:53 < bridge> <Bota> Support for Targets: Have resources available for people who experience racism on the platform.
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> While creating parallel universes might be a creative thought, focusing on real-world solutions will be more effective.
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> 
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> As for forgiveness, focus on learning and doing better.  Here's how you can improve as a moderator:
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> 
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> Actively Listen: When someone reports racism, listen actively and believe their experience.
16:54 < bridge> <Bota> Learn from Mistakes: Every situation is a learning opportunity. Analyze what went wrong and how to improve.

16:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the first lol
16:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah educate yourself, good idea
16:56 < bridge> <Bota> Must be funny for the google employee reading the prompt text
16:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> he would also need to process what the fuck is that input

16:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This power is only mine I guess

16:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I can make everyone be quiet for a few minutes
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> Actually now that I think about it more, if we remove all moderation we'd be even more covered legally 🙃

17:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm going to bed
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the EU is trying to change that or has already done that, I think
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I'm unsure where that stands, but with the content he mentions iirc we are not liable either way. There is only voluntary self regulation in those things. Except for within germany, where I think you have to comply with notices to takedown
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> few weeks until next european parliament is elected
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> will we get another undemocratic elected leader
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> why do you think the european parliament is undemocratically elected?
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not the parliament
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the leader
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> but doesn't the parliament elect it's leader?
17:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the leader chooses now  which leader... oh, so how North Korea does it
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> I find it hard to believe that the leader of the eurpean parliament chooses the next leader 😄
17:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> we live in wild times, you never know
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> afaik MEPs elect the president of the european parliament, and europeans elect the MEPs, sooo I don't see why it would be undemocratic
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> it is perhaps less democratic
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say that is the problem, ursula was not part of any voting list
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> she was selected bcs nobody in europe liked manfred weber to become the leader
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> she was basically placed by the big countries, germany/france etc.
17:23 < bridge> <zhn> isn't it popular already :justatest:
17:25 < bridge> <zhn> no way this guy visited every conference with this talk
17:25 < bridge> <zhn> omagad
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah that one is a bit too far from the people's votes for my taste, but it's also very hard to fix. The European Commission is supposed to be bureaucrats, appointed, neutral. The European Council which proposes the candidate is just leaders of member countries (not neutral), so they can't propose one of their own. MEPs are not neutral either, (though perhaps they are the best idea). Maybe the commission can itself propose one of it's own as the p
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> but I do agree bringing in some complete unelected outsider is just not good
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, hard to judge what they discussed behind the doors, i am not sure if the eu council should exist at all.
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps, but as far as I understand it is the compromise that is used to make the deal of joining the EU less awful for states. EU law has supremacy, so it really strips a lot of power from the leaders of it's member states, especially smaller ones
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> (to be fair it's really hard to make the european commission in general more democratic, they are supposed to be neutral technocrats, the more you involve elections in the matter the more political and less neutral they will become)
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> god this hurts
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only wish this to rust haters
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:

17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can only stay in bed
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u have ur brain with u
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your whole life happens in ur head
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> the pain doesnt let me think
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> think of the pain
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> waiting 10 mins to take the med
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do it without med
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i believe in drug usage
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u talk about how strong u are every other day
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> need the drugs
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just enantyum
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just try to sleep, count an integer until it overflows and rust panics

18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> weed's legal in germany now, go go go quick
18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> before the illegalize it again!
18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> before they illegalize it again!
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ingot enantyum
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and paracetamor
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> Weed is legal in too many places now. It's not cool anymore
18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt that just placebo against inflammation?
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> Paracetamol and praying to god have similar efficacy
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> enantyum is effective
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i took it and now im fine
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> Enantyum is just regular old dexketoprofen, it's not placebo
18:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> i used to give my 4 y/o nephew a kind of spicy sweet once and told him "it hurts in your mouth but stops the pain everywhere else!" because he had a tummy ache, worked like a charm
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> The brain has a gating mechanism for pain and can only register the most severe injuries. Hit your own leg with a baseball bat and your toothache shall go away

19:54 < bridge> <RedRay32> Hello, while making my server, I wanted to add commands to rcon that have several values ​​like “command [value 1] [value 2]”, I used MACRO_CONFIG_INT but it can only take one value. I would also like to know how one could get each value separately for use in code
20:07 < bridge> <robyt3> The `MACRO_CONFIG_*` macros specifically declare config variables, they can only have one value/parameter. See for example the `CServer::RegisterCommands` function in `server.cpp` where commands like `kick` are registered that can have multiple parameters.
20:34 < bridge> <RedRay32> thanks, I figured it out
21:10 < bridge> <patiga> xd I recognize that comment
21:11 < bridge> <patiga> since those sequences are all very short, I'm relatively certain the linear search should beat binary search there
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why tho? since animations are repeating u always have the best and worst case.. so in the end u have smth in the mid or not? xd
21:19 < bridge> <patiga> afaik the operations binary search are slightly more costly for some reason, so its not worth it on tiny arrays
21:20 < bridge> <patiga> maybe the additional branching
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i rewrote it to use https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.partition_point now
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/data-structures/binary-search/
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but only bcs i tried to never use linear search anywhere
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not bcs i actually fear perf loss of these 5-key frame animations giving me bad perf :lol:
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://algorithmica.org/en/eytzinger
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u go sleep bra
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but ty for share 😬
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rust impl for binary search look rather simple tho
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```rs
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> // This control flow produces conditional moves, which results in
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             // fewer branches and instructions than if/else or matching on
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             // cmp::Ordering.
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             // This is x86 asm for u8: https://rust.godbolt.org/z/698eYffTx.
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             left = if cmp == Less { mid + 1 } else { left };
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             right = if cmp == Greater { mid } else { right };
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             if cmp == Equal {
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 // SAFETY: same as the `get_unchecked` above
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 unsafe { hint::assert_unchecked(mid < self.len()) };
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 return Ok(mid);
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             }
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah alright
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> standards are always funny to read
22:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> Im in such a downstate with coding right now, while realising i understand more each day it gets Harder and Harder for me to actually Code? I Used to spend 8hours a day coding and now i get demotivated the Second i Open um neovim.
22:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how da hell will you write the os for me with such a motivation??
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> need to do something new
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> go ride a bicycle
22:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its not like i dont do anything else :D - it just makes me sad i lost the fire i had for coding i guess
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> do something new
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its hard to find something new
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> How to grub loader looking ?
22:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1242887679880990882
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> how did u wanna make it
22:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted to make all options grey except selected one
22:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1243664308362285066/image.png?ex=66524c25&is=6650faa5&hm=11b6527563c96c09469858ac15865009c2ab6cef826c1192295e65ab59ce3730&
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but grub doesnt allow to choose place for the image
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it can be only a small icon on the left side
22:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> Time to rewrite grub
22:58 < bridge> <egyt> Back on track! 368 out of 607 strings translated (60%)! Thanks to meloƞ for the advice :heartw:

23:01 < bridge> <egyt> I won't promise that I'll finish it on my weekends, not even by June, but who knows!
23:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> People will be thankful when you're done! My language is sadly translated 100% already so i cant do any Translating :feelsbadman:
23:04 < bridge> <egyt> You can always learn another language :^)
23:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> learn Ukrainian and contribute to translations :poggers:
23:05 < bridge> <egyt> That's what I'm doing...
23:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> I might actually Pick Up a new language
23:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe properly learn Japanese ? I understand Like 40% But i cant write or speak properly
23:08 < bridge> <egyt> I wanted to learn Esperanto or Toki Pona, because I'm into conlangs, and I already know one of them
23:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> learning languages hard
23:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my noodle struggles to remember new words :feelsbadman:
