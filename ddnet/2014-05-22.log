17:16 < goo> hi
17:16 <@deen> hi
17:16 <@deen> Servers running fine?
17:16 < goo> i think so, last night they were lagging badly, then everyone timed except me and the lag was gone
17:17 <@deen> =/
17:17 < goo> also it gets top5 much quicker now
17:17 <@deen> Yes, I moved the databases to all servers
17:17 <@deen> finally
17:17 < goo> oh nice
17:17 <@deen> Because German server got another DDoS and was down for 2 hours
17:17 <@deen> and then ranks didn't work in SA and Iran
17:17 < goo> oh
17:19 < goo> could you change New servers in South Africa thanks to goo! All DDNet locations now: to something like New servers in South Africa thanks to lordtheuns! All DDNet locations now: or New servers in South Africa thanks to goo, lordtheuns,Lexy with hosting sponsored by Afrihost! All DDNet locations now:?
17:19 <@deen> Sure
17:19 <@deen> I just always talked to you, so I thought you're responsible ;)
17:19 < goo> because theuns was crucial in obtaining the vps from afrihost, and i dont him him feeling like credits were dished out to wrong peson
17:21 <@deen> Done
17:21 < goo> they kinda follow me around where i go, so leave the technical side to me, but theuns had contacts in Afrihost, and offered to have a chat there, so it is more thanks to him, but afrihost is giving it free, so its mainly thanks to afrihost
17:22 < goo> so i guess the port change worked?
17:22 <@deen> I just rebooted the server at some time in the morning when noone was online
17:22 <@deen> and then it worked
17:23 <@deen> Do we need more servers in SA?
17:23 <@deen> Would be no problem
17:24 <@deen> Just have to make sure there's always some free server I guess
17:25 < goo> dont worry about setting up servers that arent connected to database due to maps that wage had, will setup some, including openfng server soon
17:25 <@deen> Hm =/
17:25 <@deen> I would prefer to add the good maps wage had to ddnet
17:26 < goo> yes, there are some good ones, created by local community, but most were copies from ddracemax, and other random maps
17:26 < goo> one random map would be aip race, will setup a 24/7 aip-race server
17:26 <@deen> But with only 16 players?
17:26 <@deen> Hm
17:27 < goo> and the local map makers said they want to make a few fixes then will put maps forward to ddnet
17:27 <@deen> Why not try getting the really popular maps that you would rehost on ddnet?
17:29 < goo> many of the noob players are feeling resistant to the sudden changes and different servers/naming, will be using ddracenetwork binary, and host a few servers like this: Teeworlds South Africa: DDRace 1 - Novice
17:30 < goo> Teeworlds South Africa: DDRace 1 - Epic
17:30 < goo> Teeworlds South Africa: DDRace 1 - Nightmare
17:30 < goo> which is what the noobs are used to seeing
17:34 <@deen> Looks like noobs are already quite active on DDNet SA ;)
17:34 < goo> what is new ssh port?
17:34 <@deen> 6546
17:39 < goo> ok
17:46 <@deen> goo: I hope your guys don't start banning people =/
17:47 <@deen> Was just on server and someone started threatening it already for no reason at all
17:47 < goo> i havnt done any rcon stuff
17:47 < goo> only i have the rcon, and Lexy andlordtheuns dont have the password yet
17:48 <@deen> Yeah, I'm worried about the "yet" part ;)
17:48 < goo> do you use teamspeak?
17:48 <@deen> I don't possess a microphone
17:49 < goo> because Lexy just came onto ts, and she has been targeted by votekicks for no reason
17:49 <@deen> Well, apparently because she used to ban people before
17:49 < goo> she is saying a  guy threatened to ban/votekick here for ever
17:49 <@deen> I can give you the text
17:49 < goo> deen, admins mostly banned people for racism
17:50 < goo> as the company who sponsored the wage servers could be taken to court for racism
17:50 <@deen> now too?
17:50 < goo> no
17:51 <@deen> [14-05-22 17:38:18][chat]: wessel1150: Lexy: lol why dont u ban me?
17:51 <@deen> [14-05-22 17:38:47][chat]: wessel1150: Lexy: aaaah this is so nice i can kick a wage now
17:51 < goo> as, ddnetwork is an organisation overseas
17:51 <@deen> ddnet is not an organisation at all^^
17:51 < goo> exactly
17:52 < goo> its community driven
17:52 <@deen> Haven't seen any racism yet on SA server
17:52 <@deen> Just sometimes kids hear that I have rcon and they start saying shit to see if I kick them
17:53 < goo> ok, but Lexy is ssaying because she is being threatened, that she will stay off servers and take community elsewhere
17:53 < goo> she has a large following of the local community
17:54 <@deen> What threat?
17:54 < goo> about being kicked from ddnet
17:55 < goo> i mean votekicked by trolls
17:55 <@deen> Trollvotes happen all the time to everyone
17:56 <@deen> People have threatened to kill. I thought that kind of threat
17:57 < goo> hm, she is feeling upset about being votekicked simply because she was admin on wage
17:57 < goo> im talking to her now to diffuse situtaion
17:58 <@deen> Sounds difficult
17:58 <@deen> The general idea on DDNet is to talk to people instead of banning them
18:00 <@deen> We also have some people in Europe who easily get insulted
18:01 <@deen> You can always mute individual players in your client
18:01 <@deen> And mute people on server if they don
18:01 <@deen> 't stop being racist
18:02 <@deen> If someone doesn't stop shit even after telling him multiple times, I usually vote for a kick
18:02 <@deen> and other players F3, so it's fine
18:36 < goo> deen: the thing is, admins on wage are being made to sound like complete dicks, the thing is, there were rules laid down, and they were cycled through. admins mostly warned for language
18:38 < goo> admins followed warn, kick, ban. there was no tolerance to sexual harassment, and racism, that were offences that got bans straight away
18:43 < goo> i also didnt tolerate admins abusing rcon, but never had a problem when i was the top guy for tw wage until i quit 2 start 2012. when i rejoined wage there were one or 2 admins that were allot stricter. but i rejoined wage not as top tw guy
18:46 <@deen> Yeah, they had rules on ddmax too and banned me forever for making a joke
18:46 <@deen> I'm kind of not a friend of that kind of rules
18:48 < goo> so you dont mind sexual harassment?
18:51 < goo> btw, is it really hard to put hosting sponsored by Afrihost in the motd?
18:53 <@deen> As I said, I talk to people instead of kicking them
18:54 <@deen> and if someone should be kicked, then other players should decide, not me
18:58 < goo> ok, so if a group goes onto a server, and votekicks any who join immeadiately, what do you do in such a scenario?
18:59 < goo> and another scenario, someone calls another player a kaffer(can be jailed here for that), and the offended player wants to take legal action, what would you do? its easier to just ban in both cases. 
19:00 <@deen> First scenario sometimes happened (allegedly)
19:00 <@deen> I take a fake name and join the server
19:00 <@deen> and see what happens
19:00 < goo> the first case wont happen much, but the second case happens almost on daily basis
19:00 <@deen> If they actually try to kick me, I talk to them
19:00 <@deen> Only happened twice so far
19:00 <@deen> these groups are still playing, but never kicked anyone again like that
19:00 < goo> if you have a logfile set for our servers, do a search for the word kaffer, and i guarentee you will find it
19:01 <@deen> If I had kicked them, they would just join another of our 100 servers and kick people there
19:01 <@deen> and I can't follow people around all day
19:01 < goo> that is understandable, but what do you say for case 2?
19:02 <@deen> only one guy said "kaffer" so far
19:02 < goo> in second case the offended player has always been satisfied with a ban for the racist offense
19:03 <@deen> In Germany you can also get into legal trouble for insulting people, but noone ever asked me anything about that
19:03 <@deen> If someone insults you, why don't you mute him?
19:04 <@deen> You also get jailed here for saying nazi stuff
19:04 <@deen> and when someone named "Hitler" joins the server
19:05 <@deen> players usually kick him immediately
19:05 <@deen> so it's no problem
19:05 < goo> im talking about racist insults, even if the player it was directed at mutes, other players could feel offended, even if those mute, that is already after the insult. 
19:06 <@deen> I must honestly say I don't know much about the situation in SA and don't understand it. So all I can do is compare it to how it's here in Europe
19:07 < goo> you can find videos of locals savagely beating a person to death, i mean, its like people here have become barbarians. with this what point im making is, if you say something wrong you can be killed for it
19:07 <@deen> And people write racist insults here too, which they usually get kicked for by other players
19:07 < goo> and in this one video, it was schoolkids, the other schoolkids watched on, some cheered on the group
19:08 <@deen> Btw, about "kaffer". How would you even now the skin color of someone else on the server?
19:09 < goo> regulars seem to know the ethnicity of other regulars
19:10 <@deen> So you suggest to kick people for insults?
19:10 <@deen> even if these insults are more jokes among friends?
19:10 < goo> we sometimes had the community votekick players who had used racism, but most of the time the offended player would still seek out an admin and ask for the player to be banned
19:11 <@deen> That would be so much work and what good does it do? He can just come back and do the same again, no?
19:13 < goo> deen: i always checked a situation before banning, even i didnt know it, but when i had been there and known the situation, i would talk them through why what they did was wrong, and they almost accepted it as a given that they would get a ban if it was racism, i never banned anyone for insults if it was a joke among friends
19:13 <@deen> That would probably take more than 24 hours / day for all the servers DDNet has
19:14 <@deen> Well, it's up to you
19:14 < goo> if a player was persuing a ban for something like racism, i would read through the logfile to see the chats, and very often the complainant had also broken rule, and so i just talked to both
19:14 <@deen> hm, we don't have rules^^
19:15 < goo> ok, but i forgot to tell you, one condition from afrihost's sponsoring was that there will be no tolerance to racism and sexual harassment, im not making these up because of our discussion now
19:16 <@deen> Oh, I think I asked about that before
19:21 <@deen> Yeah, last time you said you are not sure about whether to have admins or not
19:21 <@deen> So I assumed you didn't have restrictions like that
19:23 < goo> well, when decisions are made, me, lordtheuns, and lexy meet, but when we were given vps, we had to draft a rules thingy, 
19:23 <@deen> Oh?
19:23 <@deen> Never heard of the rules either
19:23 <@deen> I told everyone there are no rules on ddnet SA
19:24 < goo> they wanted to know what kind of rules we had at wage, and how we enforced, in the end it came down to no racism and no sexual harassment and they were happy with whatever other rules we added on
19:24 <@deen> And what rules did you add?
19:24 <@deen> I'd like to see them
19:29 < goo> well, none, we letting you have it as no admins, it will also be a nice break for us, since now we wont need to monitor every chat 24/7
19:29 <@deen> What about Afrihost? Are they fine like this?
19:29 < goo> well, the no racism and no sexual harassment still counts
19:29 <@deen> Ah, ok
19:33 < goo> but its funny, because you have not put Afrihost name anywhere, no one knows where to put such complaints
19:35 <@deen> Ah right
19:35 <@deen> About putting that somewhere
19:35 <@deen> You want in the motd at any cost?
19:35 <@deen> I'd prefer servername, it even has more visibility
19:35 < goo> yes
19:35 <@deen> because you can just search for afrihost
19:37 < goo> what about in announcements? or is announcements file written from database?
19:38 <@deen> Right now it's the same announcements for every server
19:38 <@deen> and with 14 announces, one every 30 minutes
19:38 <@deen> you have to wait 7 hours to read about afrihost
19:39 < goo> well, announcements are set to random select
19:39 <@deen> average 7 hours*
19:39 < goo> so it could be first, or take days
19:39 <@deen> Noone reads announces and motd in my experience :P
19:39 <@deen> So, what's your decision?
19:44 < goo> if possible make it in motd
19:44 <@deen> Everything is possible
19:49 < goo> some just take longer to figure out
19:49 < goo> but this one wont
19:54 <@deen> Done
19:55 <@deen> Will automatically appear on servers on a map change
20:06 < Zyther> Hi
20:06 < Zyther> can someone maybe help me out

20:10 <@deen> imp_: nope, registered names can't be taken by anyone else
20:10 < Zyther> for some reason it just says connecting
20:10 <@deen> Zyther: that's usually a firewall somewhere misfiring, because it thinks something bad is running on that port
20:10 < imp_> it works for me
20:11 < imp_> deen is it anyhow able to add a copy/paste function in TW?
20:11 < Zyther> so i have to portforward all the servers ???
20:11 < imp_> so you can copy server IP or chat

20:21 < imp_> why, bad server there?
20:21 < imp_> in china
20:21 <@deen> Bad internet connections I guess
20:22 < imp_> or the nuclear radiation of fukushima shows it effects :p
20:22 < imp_> its*
20:23 < imp_> but, when you consider what an avrg chinese earns a month, then i dont think that they can afford best inet and so on
20:23 <@deen> No, I mean the server has a bad connection
20:23 < imp_> k :D
20:23 < imp_> but
20:23 < imp_> bad conenction of user might be a problem too
