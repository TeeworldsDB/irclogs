00:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh
00:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe blog. neat idea
00:23 <+bridge> <meloƞ> oh isnt blogpost the english name for it? just googled it.. seems to be called `blog entry` ?
00:23 <+bridge> <meloƞ> basically you writing some stuff either about what you do, what you did or what you want to do - or just trashtalk something :kek:
00:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> tor what? xd
00:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah. a blog
00:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> for what? xd
00:23 <+bridge> <zhn> time to bring up gerdoe.su :troll:
00:24 <+bridge> <zhn> also hookrace.net
00:24 <+bridge> <meloƞ> zhn.furry.ru
00:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> ive owned domains
00:24 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ~~zhn.furry.ru~~
00:24 <+bridge> <zhn> sounds like some echo server domain
00:24 <+bridge> <meloƞ> lol
00:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> ewangreen05.net, ewan.horse, cavestorymoddingcommunity.org
00:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> dont ask ab the last one
00:24 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i remember i owned a domain once.. good times
00:25 <+bridge> <zhn> femboyposting.me is mine btw
00:25 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i dont even remember the name properly, something with razexx in its name iirc
00:25 <+bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
00:26 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ah gg
00:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> ive also had this very mysterious 2fa key sitting around. it came w one of my monitors from ebay
00:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i did a little research on it based on its usb info and i was only able to determine that it was manufactured by google
00:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> but apparently it's fido-compliant
00:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i set it up w pam and now instead of entering my pw for sudo & login, i just touch the usb 😃
00:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> and may have temporarily bricked my system by inserting `\` instead of backspace and not proofreading in the pam config
00:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> all appropriate reactions
00:28 <+bridge> <meloƞ> @.alexander_ look at me, doing stuff in solidworks!

00:30 <+bridge> <meloƞ> no trust :(
00:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> but yea free 2fa key from hasty liquidation. fuck yeah
00:30 <+bridge> <Alexander> Fix ur firewall
00:31 <+bridge> <Alexander> That's where i got the trust issues from
00:31 <+bridge> <zhn> looks like KOMPAS3D

00:31 <+bridge> <Alexander> Excuses!
00:32 <+bridge> <meloƞ> does it even work rn?
00:32 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i cba to ssh into that thing, it scares me
00:32 <+bridge> <Alexander> Portscan says closed
00:32 <+bridge> <meloƞ> yeah well most CAD software looks similar
00:33 <+bridge> <Alexander> Even after you whitelisted my ip

00:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> why is ur browser anal but not mine
00:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe it's cuz cloudflare doesn't support load-balanncing dns
00:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i added a record for each ip instead of att IPs in one

01:11 <+bridge> <reitw> u failed ur web server config
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> im configuring rn
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> hater
01:12 <+bridge> <reitw> nginx or apache2?
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> github pages
01:12 <+bridge> <reitw> ha
01:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's free, cdn backed and has better uptime than my closet pc
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> so im not bothered
01:13 <+bridge> <reitw> did u add a CNAME
01:13 <+bridge> <reitw> file
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> i did A/AAAA records
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> may ar well try cname
01:13 <+bridge> <reitw> I mean in ur ewan.github.io project
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> i forgot u can do that
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> you have to
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> add a file named CNAME
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> & just put ewan.green inside
01:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> then u add a cname as a record
01:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> u point ot to ewan.github.io (idk the name)
01:14 <+bridge> <reitw> & should work
01:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> instructions have changed over the years
01:15 <+bridge> <reitw> u point it to ewan.github.io (idk the name)
01:17 <+bridge> <reitw> u can remove the A records u did
01:19 <+bridge> <reitw> then idk if u can sort of "reload" github pages to update
01:20 <+bridge> <reitw> (ig u push it does)
01:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> ya it does automatically
01:20 <+bridge> <reitw> that's how I did then
01:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> smth broken
01:21 <+bridge> <reitw> apparently u have to use a ANAME and not a CNAME
01:22 <+bridge> <reitw> tf
01:22 <+bridge> <reitw> how did I make it work then, i have a cname
01:22 <+bridge> <reitw> did it propagate already ur changes
01:22 <+bridge> <reitw> (dns)
01:23 <+bridge> <reitw> cf doesn't have ALIAS or ANAME records, strange
01:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1256752059705724979/image.png?ex=6681e910&is=66809790&hm=3da48cfe3aeaa8395280e0ee23294e432759525500b39551c9d2a68021aa3aa7&
01:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> ya should be applied
01:25 <+bridge> <reitw> strange
01:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> i  may do a rewrite of my website
01:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think the design is neat but i just want a simple site
01:26 <+bridge> <reitw> try to see if u have to stop/start back the github pages
01:26 <+bridge> <reitw> prob u can do that in the menus
01:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think i can manually trigger the workflow
01:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh this is new
01:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1256752885451198464/image.png?ex=6681e9d5&is=66809855&hm=0cdf87186bb05f7f32c730943e19bc68326d9a8d15a426ef1a197345926acb7d&
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> wait looks like cname isn't the way to go
01:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea ghp docs said nothing ab it but i'd also seen it in the past
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> yea do A records pointing to 
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> ```
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> 185.199.108.153
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> 185.199.109.153
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> 185.199.110.153
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> 185.199.111.153
01:27 <+bridge> <reitw> ```
01:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
01:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> can only do 1 at a time on CF sadly
01:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> dupe records fuck up the ssl
01:29 <+bridge> <reitw> u can add multiple A records
01:29 <+bridge> <reitw> just do it, u prob forgot the CNAME file
01:29 <+bridge> <reitw> as it is mentioned in the doc
01:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/ewancg/ewancg.github.io/blob/master/CNAME
01:30 <+bridge> <reitw> also don't proxy it to cf, it's useless
01:30 <+bridge> <reitw> & prob why
01:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> naw
01:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> wfll
01:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> well
01:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> i was gonna just use github's provisioned cert
01:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is fine
01:31 <+bridge> <reitw> proxying behind cf isn't as useful tho
01:32 <+bridge> <reitw> only if github is down, cf can provide you the website lmao
01:32 <+bridge> <reitw> only if github is down, cf can provide you the website lmao (web archive)
01:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> useless if it's already got functional https
01:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u do dynamic dns
01:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> which client should i use
01:33 <+bridge> <reitw> I don't
01:34 <+bridge> <reitw> now ur page works
01:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> ty
01:34 <+bridge> <reitw> np
01:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think this is the exact same config as when melon went to sleep
01:34 <+bridge> <reitw> u didn't have the CNAME file no ?
01:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> true
01:35 <+bridge> <reitw> & prob u were proxying to cf
01:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> u right
01:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> ddclient is most popular but it's perl
01:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> inadyn is C but idk if it's as mature
01:36 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> ive been fucking around a bit and this bug doesnt happen if i stream on discord ????????????
03:10 <+bridge> <APFFF> still cant see the debug messages :/

06:28 <+bridge> <louis> try changing it and see what happens
06:29 <+bridge> <louis> friction in general+in ddnet code is almost always how quickly the movement of an entity slows down

07:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Can someone help with the pipeline? :D
07:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Wanna make a new client release and need the builds
07:47 <+bridge> <sedonya> i can
07:47 <+bridge> <sedonya> maybe
07:47 <+bridge> <sedonya> windows 10
08:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Im not an expert but I think you can either set dis line https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-Client/blob/69a6038430a43802d3090f89716f62517747c5d0/CMakeLists.txt#L99 to something from here https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0148.html or just write
08:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> if(POLICY CMP0148) cmake_policy(SET CMP0148 OLD) endif()
08:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe not :justatest:
09:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://memorycorruption.net/posts/rce-lua-factorio/
09:55 <+bridge> <totar> I read that post earlier, the author is actually crazy to spend that much work on such a niche exploit.
09:55 <+bridge> <totar> I hope Lua has not damaged their psyche
10:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tldr, use rust kek
12:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> what would that help
12:35 <+bridge> <APFFF> I did change it but couldnt really notice anything. also building every time 😦
12:42 <+bridge> <robyt3> What did you change it to? If you set it to `1.0f` then particle's velocity should never decrease, which should be noticeable. You should only need to rebuild one file and the executable instead of rebuilding everything though, if you only changed a value in `effects.cpp`.
12:43 <+bridge> <robyt3> The velocity is multiplied by the friction value roughly every 0.05 seconds
12:43 <+bridge> <APFFF> How can you only rebuild specific file? Im really bad with cmake
12:43 <+bridge> <APFFF> I have tried 1.0f but didnt notice anything :justatest:
12:43 <+bridge> <APFFF> I have tried `1.0f` but didnt notice anything :justatest:
12:43 <+bridge> <robyt3> What command are you running to build? If you generated a Makefile, `make` should only rebuild the changed files
12:44 <+bridge> <APFFF> `cmake --build . -j`
12:45 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think `-j8` (with the number of CPU cores to use) is preferred over `-j`, which spawns as many processes as it can. But this should only build the files you modified. Maybe you also changed another files though.

12:47 <+bridge> <APFFF> ls
12:49 <+bridge> <APFFF> I was also wondering, why `./DDNet.exe `and `./steam_api.dll` get build in `/build/Debug` while everything else is in `/build`
12:51 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think that a MSVC issue
12:51 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think that an MSVC issue
12:52 <+bridge> <robyt3> When I use VS I use the executables built in the `pack_DDNet-18.3-win64_zip` folder
12:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> chiller writing a json parser. commit messages are gold.
12:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> would recommend
13:00 <+bridge> <APFFF> cant even find that folder
13:04 <+bridge> <robyt3> Maybe you set `DEV=ON` in the cmake configuration. It will generate more files each time with `DEV=OFF` but at least you get a build folder that's immediately usable
13:04 <+bridge> <louis> is friction applidd every 2 ticks?
13:04 <+bridge> <robyt3> Alternatively, use MSYS2 and GCC instead of MSVC
13:05 <+bridge> <robyt3> Friction for particles is applies every 0.05s locally
13:05 <+bridge> <louis> ah
13:06 <+bridge> <louis> @apfff if youre on windows are you using visual studio?
13:06 <+bridge> <APFFF> Yes
13:18 <+bridge> <louis> @apfff ah i think since the bullet trails have no velocity friction does nothing here
13:19 <+bridge> <APFFF> Actually, I was trying to understand where the frequency of particles is determined
13:20 <+bridge> <louis> add `p.m_Vel = random_direction() * (std::pow(random_float(), 3) * 600.0f);` inside BulletTrail() and you'll see that if you change friction then the behavior changes
13:20 <+bridge> <louis> but ig since m_Vel isn't defined, it gets set to 0 somewhere so friction has no effect
13:20 <+bridge> <APFFF> but I guess `BulletTrail()` doesnt even set the frequency?
13:20 <+bridge> <louis> (actually probably m_Vel is already defined as 0)
13:21 <+bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the `p.m_Friction = 0.7f;` for `BulletTrail` is misleading, since it has no effect
13:21 <+bridge> <louis> I think the frequency is set in items.cpp at line 647 onwards @apfff
13:21 <+bridge> <APFFF> I tried `friction` on different particles
13:22 <+bridge> <louis> err or maybe line 125, i didn't read it too much
13:22 <+bridge> <APFFF> Is there like model being used or are things just .. coded?
13:25 <+bridge> <louis> although i think @robyt3 knows more on how to accomplish whatever you're trying to accomplish @apfff
13:25 <+bridge> <APFFF> ATM im just trying to understand things
13:25 <+bridge> <louis> im not really sure if those lines in items.cpp simply add the particles to some queue which gets handled elsewhere
13:25 <+bridge> <APFFF> I thought particles might be an easy entry
13:26 <+bridge> <louis> but line 125 is initially where the bullet trail particle gets added
13:26 <+bridge> <APFFF> How does the timing work in general, is there some kind of delta_time?
13:26 <+bridge> <robyt3> Some effects are on different timers (5, 50, 100 Hz), see `CEffects::OnRender` function
13:27 <+bridge> <patiga> for the frequency, you need to have a look at `effects.cpp`, there you have the member variables `m_Add5hz`, `m_Add50hz` and `m_Add100hz`
13:27 <+bridge> <APFFF> `OnRender()` gets called for every component "active" on every tick?
13:27 <+bridge> <patiga> those are updated every frame, each going `true` with a different frequency
13:28 <+bridge> <patiga> (I recently reimplemented all the particles for twgpu)
13:40 <+bridge> <APFFF> @patiga thx, now i got it
13:47 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> why the servers allow 4 player from the same ip but  the client can only connect 1 dummy?
13:47 <+bridge> <reitw> ddnet client is limited to a single dummy
13:47 <+bridge> <reitw> it's in the code
13:48 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> make a dummy list
13:48 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> Dummy[] dummys = new Dummy[]; or smoething
13:51 <+bridge> <APFFF> you can join with 2 clients per IP
14:01 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> it would be easier to use with one client ngl
14:02 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> and im the customer and the customer is always right
14:02 <+bridge> <APFFF> Dummy controls would go nuts
14:02 <+bridge> <APFFF> I mean its open source
14:07 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> program them ai control
14:07 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> they follow you, unfreeze you...
14:16 <+bridge> <louis> good idea
14:16 <+bridge> <louis> u should go implement it
14:18 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> sorry im the customer
14:21 <+bridge> <louis> the game is open source so you're the worker too unfortunately
14:22 <+bridge> <APFFF> customers pay usually, dont they?

15:29 <+bridge> <APFFF> Can someone tell me where the bullet projectile texture is set? (As in rotation, position, size, etc.)
15:29 <+bridge> <APFFF> Does someone know where the bullet projectile texture is set? (As in rotation, position, size, etc.)
15:37 <+bridge> <jxsl13> probably here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2ed17ac8b379eb786bda995d573632463c38509a/src/game/client/components/items.cpp#L26
15:38 <+bridge> <jxsl13> haven't touched client code at all but that looks to be the location, at least one of them.
16:37 <+bridge> <timakro> does someone know how to disable projectiles hitting other players in old vanilla teeworlds servers? i managed to disable player collisions and player hooking with tunes but can't figure out how to disable projectiles hitting other players

17:34 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What are old vanilla teeworlds servers? and what are you working on?
17:39 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t know if there is even an option without touching the code. I doubt it.

22:36 <+bridge> <APFFF> Does anyone know why the particle generation is different in game than on replays? How do the replays work?
22:46 <+bridge> <robyt3> The particles are always random, the server/demo only specifies for example "explosion" and the center position and this creates the explosion sprite and random smoke particles
22:47 <+bridge> <APFFF> I changed `BulletTrail()` to spawn particles more frequently, though that change is not visible in replays
22:49 <+bridge> <robyt3> Does it work for other effects? I think bullet trails might be special because the demo player tries to reconstruct them somehow
22:51 <+bridge> <APFFF> Sorry I was wrong. In the replay its shown "correctly", through when you render the video it doesnt
22:54 <+bridge> <APFFF> Same question tho
22:55 <+bridge> <robyt3> Looks like a bug. If you render a demo it breaks bullet trails during normal demo playback until you restart the client
22:56 <+bridge> <APFFF> 😦
23:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think it looks differently during demo rendering because demos are always rendered at `cl_video_recorder_fps` (default 60 FPS)
23:04 <+bridge> <APFFF> Do you know what File/Method does that particular rendering?
23:04 <+bridge> <robyt3> Demo rendering is in `video.cpp/h` if you mean that
23:05 <+bridge> <APFFF> ty
23:05 <+bridge> <APFFF> yes ty
23:06 <+bridge> <robyt3> And there is `CItems::ReconstructSmokeTrail` in `items.cpp` which seems to reconstruct a matching smoke trail for predicted projectiles I guess
23:12 <+bridge> <APFFF> Another thing, is it normal that the "local" client has worse perfomance (fps), or is it my code?
23:15 <+bridge> <robyt3> If you compiled in debug mode then it's expected to be slower than in release mode
23:21 <+bridge> <APFFF> One last thing: when are methods like `CGameClient::OnNewSnapshot()` being "triggered"? For example: Damage Indicator for `rocket` only "triggers" the method once, while Damage Indicator for `gun `"triggers" it 10 times (where can I influence that?)
23:24 <+bridge> <robyt3> `CGameClient::OnNewSnapshot` is called in `client.cpp` whenever a new snapshot has been received, you can't really influence that. What problem are you trying to solve?
23:25 <+bridge> <APFFF> Im trying to only spawn 1 particle on wall collision (damage indication) with gun projectiles instead of 10
23:26 <+bridge> <robyt3> The 10 damage indicators are created by the server
23:26 <+bridge> <APFFF> `if(Item.m_Type == NETEVENTTYPE_DAMAGEIND)` passes 10 times, `else if(Item.m_Type == NETEVENTTYPE_EXPLOSION)` only once
23:27 <+bridge> <APFFF> https://tenor.com/view/%E7%9A%849-gif-27299608
23:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> In `projectile.cpp` there's a call to `CreateDamageInd` with argument `10`
23:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> So you get 10 individual damage indicator particles on the client side
23:27 <+bridge> <APFFF> Ah man, I hoped it was client side
23:28 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think 0.7 changed this so the number of particles is inside the damage indicator effect
23:28 <+bridge> <APFFF> I guess there are only "ugly" workaround then
23:28 <+bridge> <APFFF> I guess there are only "ugly" workarounds then
23:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> You could remember the positions of all damage indicators in each snapshot to ignore the damage indicators with identical position
23:30 <+bridge> <robyt3> Since all 10 damage indicators should start at the same position
23:30 <+bridge> <APFFF> But i guess there is no way to distinguish betwenn "shots" without timing/counting, right?
23:31 <+bridge> <APFFF> But i guess there is no way to distinguish between "shots" without timing/counting, right?
23:32 <+bridge> <robyt3> No, I don't think you can easily find out which projectile the effect belonged
23:34 <+bridge> <APFFF> Is the code asynchronous ?
23:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> I don't know what you mean with "asynchronous ". Gameplay is basically all single-threaded
23:36 <+bridge> <APFFF> Ah nice
23:37 <+bridge> <APFFF> Guess I used the wrong term, mb
23:41 <+bridge> <APFFF> @robyt3 thanks for all the help, got exactly what I was trying to do. Just getting to know the project atm, so I really appreciate your help (even though some questions might be a little stupid)
