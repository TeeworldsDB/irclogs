05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ggrevez> @everyone
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not without accounts
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hussain saddam joined github xd
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why accounts i'ts like points
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> !! wow in 10 mins (6):f4:
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what does improve this addition
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> yea sorry, that idea seems just weird. i do not understand your reasoning in the "results" paragraph
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> better than points
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like ok we have exp instead of pointa
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> points
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok we have points and what?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this what you say
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> what do i get with levels?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> exactly, try to elaborate on why it would be any better...
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ? we have already points-system, why should we redone it and just change name to level-exp-system
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no shit in here
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> more awesome  XD
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no, just weird
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> you say "level up be harder after every level" so the higher you get, the bigger the gaps between seemingly equally rated players get. that is a huge downside for me
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why weird a lots game have levels
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> :justatest:
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> here you can see the EXP
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mean this game doesnt have accounts, thia game has name-based points system that works like whole ddnet-life
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and we just rename it to levels
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> there is already a pointlist, we can already compare players
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no sense
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> my internet is slow today wtf
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> + levels you can write the lvls in (TAB)
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> tab is used for time show
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and lvls üôÇ
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also you could ask for showing points in tabs
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> how
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> now place for this
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> no place for this
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and we will have more space for levels?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wtf man
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i said 12320 or something like this ugly
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just ask devs to make command /showpoints
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's 2 numnbers just
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> we could also say "cock length in cm" instead of levels, that would be hilarious
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and it will show points of players in tab instead of time/clan/whatever rlse
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or send you cool chat message with nickname: x points idk
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> nah ugly and the points system from the stone age
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no one will do this anyway
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so nvm
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's just throw numbers
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway i see it  pretty and would be more fun and ppl would care about lvls more than points and would be like big update but it's just Conversion
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no, ppl will not care about levels much than about points, some people doesn't even care about it, carrying your friends is much funnier than looking into tab with coolface thinking "holy shit im best player ever, i have 20 points"
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no, ppl will not care about levels more than about points, some people doesn't even care about it, carrying your friends is much funnier than looking into tab with coolface thinking "holy shit im best player ever, i have 20 points"
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you looks not care even about points so your opinion not matter üòõ joke
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> +already there is system to say im best player ever so we have to make it better if we would not delete
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> last thing
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can ask anyone how many points he have
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  nobody will be sure. 
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> system points helpful just for know the rank this why need change it
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> why can nobody be sure?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> becsaue always number in the thousands
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> when you type /points you get a rank and a number of points
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> right, simple arithmetics and inequalitiers dont work in the thousand, forgot about that :nouis:
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> right, simple arithmetics and inequalities dont work in the thousand, forgot about that :nouis:
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok how many you have?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> also points aren't really good to compare skill levels
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> who is better, the one who finished 15 1* novice maps or the one who finished one map for 15 points
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> 0
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> it's not really the same
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> GutZuFuss collected at least 10 points yesterday
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> ah yes, i have 10.
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this not the point but usually after finished 15map novice you will be can finish map moderate and after you finished 100 map  moderate  you will be finish brutal ....
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> thats not how it works lol
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so it's not Flour but you can know if you play with person have 100 points impossible win with him brutal
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so it's not Accuracy but you can know if you play with person have 100 points impossible win with him brutal
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> translate stupid XD
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway like what i always saying points not help you to know if you play with pro or no
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but you know if you play with noob
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> some noobs have alot of points, some pros dont have many points
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> back to Main topic. nobody know how many points he have system points useless or not helpful to know skill levels all this things not matter .we talking about make  system points  better not delete
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but if you join server and see player you not know him and see he have 200 points you will not play with him in brutal mod
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it could be someone with fakename
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> stop juding others by points
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i not but you will be play every day with ppl have under 1k points to know he noob or not?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> no you will not so you juding not me
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have 5k+ points on my name does that mean im good?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> yesterday i played with players with less than 1k points

19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> can you try to learn how to write in english? sometimes it's hard to understand you.
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> jkjk is trolling again
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> i'm serious, it's hard for me to understand
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u could say that then
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> instead of telling him to try to learn english
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> i said that?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> in my 2nd message i only said "i'm serious" and i repeated a part of my first message. i seriously don't know what you want
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/863835751077904435/Bild_2021-07-11_193433.png
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> stop the drama-machine
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> sry i have stop using transalte
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> have to üôÇ
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Question guys, I hope it's ok to ask this here but I have a strange bug.
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> My connection is usually fine for some minutes and then I't will freeze up for a few minutes, input won't work and tees will be floating around the screen BUT get this, when I test my connection it's fine, nobody else is lagging and I can see the chat working fine but I can't send messages myself. Then suddenly the connection will be perfect again for some minutes... any ideas?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe cause of packets loss
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> somebody is using the same network?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <David*¬∞Villa> Actually Nameless Tee was a Pro player some years ago.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion :ddnet: 
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add some thing like
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> points name:
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> wait
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion :ddnet: 
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add some thing like
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> points name:
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> showing name
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> to can play with anyname you want but points going for your really name
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then everyone will fake each other lmao
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> wdym? now can't fake name others?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can play with any name you want without worry about your points looks so helpful to me
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then describe it better, now i see only possibility to fake each other and collecting for your nickname
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Yeah but not intensively. It's only the ddnet client that lags periodically like this for me.
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> it also happens when nobody else is using the network
