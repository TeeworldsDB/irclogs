01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why isn't it reasonable? üòÆ
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> wait, is Zoom being involved as well?
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I meant it in a moral sense, as in Discord Staff members and it's developers have no intention to be (as) corrupt as other well known social media companies.
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Those aren't at fault perhaps
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK discord does data handling quite badly and collects lots of unnecessary data, like every interaction with discord, e.g. which images you click on, etc.

09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Goodd morning
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You have no way to know their intentions. Perhaps they are the exception to the rule or perhaps they sell bulk data to the highest bidder like every single other tech company their size
09:25 <+ChillerDragon> o/
09:26 <+ChillerDragon> discord has big chinese investors they want to spy on the west and steal our coding skills to rebuild tw china!
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either way, that only changes whether they deserve is morally or not. Legally it has been decided, they mishandled user data, end of story
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ignorance of the law is not a defence. We didn't intend to mishandle data is not a defence
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> lawyer lerato
09:28 <+ChillerDragon> yo bak in da university rokin da ipad?
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> high level languages have so funny features :D like iterating over all method names in a class and turn them into strings
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> like wat xd
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> omg im procrastinating again. I think i have a irc addiction problem :(
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes you do
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> :c
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> AddictDragon
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> is there irc rehab?
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> download Discord
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> withdrawl
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> cold turkey
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only way that works anyways
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for problematic use of ic
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for problematic use of irc
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> i might die from withdrawl symptoms
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but u have discord then
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> might lower the symptoms
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or increase them
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> you also suggest heroin to someone who wants to get off alcohol huh? xd
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> i mean it works .. xd
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont tell them how i got you off alcohol
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the only way to fix people from munich
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or bavaria in general√∂
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> lul
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heroin ftw
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> hi kids reading irc logs
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> stay in school drugs bad
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At home today. I don't really feel so good
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> F
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> leak pic of your home then :p
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> do you have plants?
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> OMG OK I CLOSE IRC NOW BYE
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> marihuana
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No plants house too smol for plants, I'd probably die of hypoxia
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How? Plants produce o2
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only when they can do photosynthesis. They need o2 at other times
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In a smol house a green plant might end up being a net negative
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> open a window
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> gotta love refactoring code :) one step forward 3 steps back .-.

10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf xd
10:54 <+Ryozuki> ill start to hate huffman
10:54 <+Ryozuki> im comparing my bits table to the libtw2
10:54 <+Ryozuki> and some dont match
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> papa @heinrich5991 look i actually managed to build my own snap dissector :)
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668765692.png
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> type 11 is not supported yet ... duh 
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> libtw2 docs so good :)
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are you building it in? C?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm afraid of that. you can't turn it off

12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Are u planing to contribute?^^
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, no, not really
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's interesting to read about
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C strings being null terminated actually make sub string operations less optimal than if not right
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In rust strings keep track of the size separately
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This allows to make slices without allocating
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To make a substring i c u need to allocate iirc
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To add the null byte
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or modify it in-place
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But yhe Cstr type they will use doesnt have these efficient slices/substrings
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz they need the null
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> f
12:50 <+Ryozuki> `SELECT r.Map as map, r.Name as name, Min(r.Time) as time, r.Timestamp as timestamp, COUNT(r.Name) as finishes, r.Server as server FROM race r WHERE r.Map = ? GROUP BY Name ORDER BY time ASC;`
12:50 <+Ryozuki> i have this query to get the ranks for a map
12:50 <+Ryozuki> i was wondering if its possible to get the rank number within the query itself
12:51 <+Ryozuki> accounting for the possiblity of same time ranks where the rank would be e.g 1 for both
12:51 <+Ryozuki> which happens when u finish in a team
12:51 <+Ryozuki> iirc the current python code calculates this in-code
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/56088cb4b090e2354206e6239cfd63727a97686d/src/game/server/scoreworker.cpp#L789-L799
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh nice
14:53 <+Ryozuki> i prefer DENSE_RANK
14:54 <+Ryozuki> over RANK
14:54 <+Ryozuki> maybe ddnet should use it too?
14:54 <+Ryozuki> if 3 people have rank 1
14:54 <+Ryozuki> the next rank shown is 4
14:54 <+Ryozuki> it should be 2
14:54 <+Ryozuki> DENSE_RANK does that
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used RANK() in a job interview once, thanks (I think) @Zwelf for using window functions in DDNet's code and introducing me to them üòÑ
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I disagree, I prefer RANK over DENSE_RANK.
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Player 1 has 1 second time, player 2 2 second, player 3 3 second. Player 3 is now on rank 3. If player 2 improves their time to 1 second, this should not change the ranking of Player 3, since he is still worse than 2 other players
14:58 <+Ryozuki> hmm i think its fine
14:58 <+Ryozuki> i prefer no gaps
15:00 <+Ryozuki> but anyway since u dont like it
15:00 <+Ryozuki> lucky i read this as i was just doing a pr
15:00 <+Ryozuki> for it
15:00 <+Ryozuki> xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knowing window functions is how I lost an entire point off a 5p question on my introduction to db exam
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently the "correct" answer is using a subquery and a join there
16:43 <+Ryozuki> xD
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki: do you know some competion or anything that uses DENSE_RANK instead of RANK?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see RANK pretty much everywhere, board games, sport events, ‚Ä¶
17:15 <+Ryozuki> hmm idk
17:16 <+Ryozuki> i never rly checked leaderboards where its common to have same-ranks
17:16 <+Ryozuki> e.g in trackmania its incredibly rare to see same times
17:16 <+Ryozuki> i guess cuz they use a more precise lcock
17:16 <+Ryozuki> clock
17:16 <+Ryozuki> oops
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> anyone know where DemoPlayer() is defined?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> src/game/client/gameclient.h
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can use https://ddnet.org/codebrowser/ to find things like that easily
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.org/codebrowser/DDNet/game/client/gameclient.h.html#_ZNK11CGameClient10DemoPlayerEv
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh nice
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or use an IDE
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah visual studio was taking a while for each of my searches
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah üò¶
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm used to ctrl-leftclicking in rust code when I use intellij with rust extension
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's <500ms there, sometimes instant
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Indo that with vin
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Vim
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gd
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I do*
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupid mobile
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Vim gang
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I miss how fast ctags was
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> why people ask how to exit vim, it WANTS you to exit
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1043214681910825040/image.png
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that hasn't always been there IIRC
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, if you make the mistake of opening vi instead of vim, you'lll get the authentic experience
