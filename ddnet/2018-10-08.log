01:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1337: Ignore DNSBL on "empty" servers. (master...dd_pr_dnsblempty) https://git.io/fxsNp
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b the error message should be improved. I think most players' "you're on the dnsbl list" actually means "the server hasn't received an dnsbl answer yet"
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b the error message should be improved. I think most players' "you're on the dnsbl list" actually means "the server hasn't received a dnsbl answer yet"
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lmao
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im going to guess never based on how ping works but would be cool if there was an actual patch for this
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/498786476545277972/Screen_Shot_2018-10-08_at_2.02.13_AM_2.png
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we could change how ping works
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wouldnt it require people to use a new client
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen i fucking needed to change the whole configuration of my router to have like max 80ms in GER
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Cellegen ok, so?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hmmm
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but you see
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> am i wrong that changing how ping is reportd would also require the client to be changed
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i cant manage to bring myself less than 80ms ;-;
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby I'd be interested if there is a way to do it without client changes
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well the way i do pingfake is by changing the ackgametick thats sent along with inputs
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't that have adverse side effects?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like potential packet loss
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im not sure how a server would be able to tell whether a player actually takes a long time to acknowledge the inputs or is faking
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> mm
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it might make it a little laggier but not really i think
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it isnt precise  afaik u can only get precision of Â±1 tick so ~20ms?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if ur ping goes "below 0" it causes problems
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, feels so
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everyone has 8, 24-28, 40-48 ping etc
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah so given this im not sure if theres any way to detect fakeping without making everyone use an updated client unlss im missing something
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> if ackgametick is based on the real game tick it would be probably impossible to fix without changing the client, but if it is based on the last packet received by the server, it might be possible to do something about it
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> why is the spoof protection on password protected servers turned off?
15:01 <@deen> doesn't work I think
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok just tried it, your right ^^
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe somebody else could have a look at this and state his opinion https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1320
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah need a tiebreaker on that one ðŸ˜ƒ

16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Dev im on ddnet++ (based on 9.0.2) linux server. my score (finishtime) is only getting displayed after i renamed, how can i fix it so its like on ddnet or kog where the time is there on client connect? i already had a look into the code but didnt find why it shouldnt be working.
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have no idea. it could be a billion things. What is a ddnet++ and why do you need it?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/DDNetPP
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hadn't seen this yet. I'd suggest upgrading the ddnet version but I doubt that's an option after this many patches. Soooo just debug it? ðŸ˜›
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd start from looking at how the client decides when to display a time.
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good point
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 could you help me a bit?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tomorrow maybe, kinda busy today
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
17:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1340: Editor fixes (master...dd_pr_editorsearch) https://git.io/fxZJM
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 are you the one with AppVeyor access? If so when you have a moment can you rebuild my PR and/or set-up access so all members can rebuild
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think for some reason, both deen and I have an appveyor build
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see if it's mine that's failing
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait, it's travis that's failing
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> appveyor was also failing but it suddenly succeeded
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, then it's the race condition between deen's and my appveyor
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whoever finishes last sets the status, I think
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is nice, because a failing build probably finishes first ðŸ˜„
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 maybe you remember the drop weapon code from me (press f3 to drop the current weapon). Is it possible to remove that weapon if its falling into a shield?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean I cant get it to work :D
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember your code, does it spawn a CPickup?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it spawns a CWeapon, made by me
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/DDNetPP/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/weapon.cpp
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be possible huh?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is possible but I must say that looks very, uuhhm dirty
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik :D
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need to check that like IsCharacterNear()
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but how xd
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i couldnt do it for shields :(
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You look for nearby `ENTTYPE_PICKUPS` and check that their type is `POWERUP_ARMOR`
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i check the type of it?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nvm xD
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do i have to use for the MAX size?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who/what is a max size?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> MAX_CLIENTS?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean does it even matter? Think about it
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need one armor to make it disappear
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So i'd just look for 1 ðŸ˜›
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oo
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd add a new function to `CPickup` `int Type();` that returns `m_Type` rather then making `m_Type` public btw
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ye
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you mean like for example GetActiveWeapon from Character?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, but you need to stop thinking this way
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a very simple thing I said, just trust your instincts instead of trying to make it "like" something
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay :)
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> CPickup *apEnt[1];
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     int Num = GameWorld()->FindEntities(m_Pos, 20.0f, (CEntity**)apEnt, 1, CGameWorld::ENTTYPE_PICKUP);
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     for (int i = 0; i < Num; i++)
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     {
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         CPickup *pShield = apEnt[i];
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         if (pShield->GetType() == POWERUP_ARMOR)
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         {
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             return true;
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         }
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     }
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is not working, but if i make it with a 2 its working
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean apEnt[2] and in FindEntities replace the 1 with a 2
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> what's the masterserver of ddnet?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bool CWeapon::IsShieldNear()
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> {
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     CPickup *apEnts[2];
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     int Num = GameWorld()->FindEntities(m_Pos, 20.0f, (CEntity**)apEnts, 2, CGameWorld::ENTTYPE_PICKUP);
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>

19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     {
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         CPickup *pShield = apEnts[i];
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         if (pShield->GetType() == POWERUP_ARMOR)
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         {
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             return true;
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         }
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     }
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     return false;
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> }
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 this works, is it right?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I'd do `CPickup *pEnt;` and pass `(CEntity **)&pEnt` instead
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how to pass it?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and replace that 2 with a 1 obv
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I told you how to pass it in that sentence
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it didnt work then
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tryed that already
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me see
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually in this case you don't even need a pointer to the entity
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually you do nvm
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways ðŸ˜„
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That should still work
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cannot convert 'CPickup' to 'CPickup*' in initialization
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>    CPickup *pShield = pEnt[i];
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well DUH
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sory
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDD
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im blind
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I'm stupid
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need more then 2 though
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need 9 to be sure
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With 2 if the weapon is falling between 2 hearts and has an armor below it, it is possible that the 2 hearts get found and the armor doesn't get found
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ahh
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So to be safe look for 9 pickups, one you could be on and 8 could be around you
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok^^
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uhm @heinrich5991 I think I broke something as I pushed right after you bors r+'d
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, awesome, you also did that thing ðŸ™‚
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you eye over it to make sure I didn't introduce any bugs
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mhk
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you changed behavior in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1337/files#diff-f60b98c9084662cc2855d8c1a78e458bR390, previously the port wasn't recorded. probably won't break anything. wanna change it to the old behavior or do you think it's ok?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, that function used to *modify* the pointer that looks read-onlyâ€¦
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good job, function
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah those functions look horrible
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes a pResult it never uses aswell
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> VoteMute and Mute I mean
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll restore the old behaviour just in case
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe don't modify the pointer that's passed in
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds outright horrible
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would you prefer it like it is or if I reverted to the old behaviour?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it makes any difference though, as _noport is also used to check the ban itself
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'll just clean up those functions and make sure
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> awesome
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> inb4 #1337 expands to refactor the whole ddnet code base
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do stop though (with refactoring these functions) if it becomes too much work
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 not that bad apparently, cleaned it up and made sure the behaviour doesn't change
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also is bors k? ðŸ˜„
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 fixed the score on client enter thing myslef ðŸ˜ƒ
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What was it?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just added this line `m_apPlayers[ClientID]->m_Score = (Score()->PlayerData(ClientID)->m_BestTime) ? Score()->PlayerData(ClientID)->m_BestTime : -9999;` from changeinfo to OnClientEnter()

21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nice job (iguess):feelsgoodman:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I can't really follow the map items thing, here to give me a hand? ðŸ˜›
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I guess
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So, what is an external item type and what is an internal item type?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, so we have item kinds and external item kinds
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, so we have item kinds and extended item kinds
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> non-extended item kinds are referred to by a small integer, both in code and in the actual datafile
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> code is "external" (because it's the API the datafile exposes) and the actual file is "internal" (because only the datafile class has to concern itself with how it saves stuff in there=
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> code is "external" (because it's the API the datafile exposes) and the actual file is "internal" (because only the datafile class has to concern itself with how it saves stuff in there)
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> UUIDs also happen to be referred to by integers, although bigger ones, I think starting from 2**16
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so when the datafile class gets a item kind > 2**16, it sees that it's an extended item kind that is associated with a UUID
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has to store that some way in the datafile, which only supports item kinds < 2**16, and certainly no UUIDs
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I reserve the item kind (2**16 - 1) to provide a mapping from internal item kind IDs (in the datafile) to external ones (referred to by UUIDs, to be translated to the corresponding integers by the datafile reader)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so when you read a item kind that's likely to be extended (>=2**15 I think)
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you use 2**16 - 1 like we used NETMSG_NULL for the protocol extension?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you check whether we have an item with type ID 2**16-1, and the type ID you're looking for as item ID
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because 0 was already taken
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> type ID 2**16-1 only provides the mapping of internal (in the datafile) type IDs to UUIDs
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. if I add one item with extended type, it'll get type ID 2**16-2
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> next one will get 2**16-3
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but to know what it's actually dealing with 2**16-2 doesn't map to a type, the reading code has to check the type map
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sooo 2**16 - 1 actually is a type-map?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I probably should have written all that into the commit messageâ€¦
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 questions?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm trying to give it a re-read with my newly acquired knowledge ðŸ™‚
22:16 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: do asserts still kill the client/server in release builds?
22:16 <@heinrich5991> I fear they do not
22:16 <@heinrich5991> yup, they don't :(
22:17 <+Learath2> Well assert in `CDataFileWriter::GetExtendedItemTypeIndex` could allow an attqcker to craft a map that crashes the client.
22:17 <@heinrich5991> lol
22:17 <+Learath2> Not a particularly useful crash but still
22:18 <@heinrich5991> have you read the datafile code? :P
22:18 <@heinrich5991> it's full of crashes
22:18 <@heinrich5991> but you're right, I shouldn't make it worse
22:18 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: no, that's a datafile writer
22:18 <+Learath2> Oh yep mb
22:24 <+Learath2> I can't seem to read this at all :/
22:30 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: did you have a document on datafiles and their structure?
22:30 <@heinrich5991> yes, but only little
22:30 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/baf355f8f07ce0b58818598930e769121fcaa3c1/doc/datafile.md
22:30 <+Learath2> Well an overview would be enough
22:31 <@heinrich5991> might very well be that this doesn't help
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> hm, blockers/stoppers don't work when flipped. Known bug?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hum. no, not known I think
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they should stop in the direction you can see in the editor
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> known
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜—
23:06 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: updated the PR
23:08 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: how do datafiles handle endianness issues? do we save them all little endian and swap based on architecture?
23:09 <@heinrich5991> yes, something like that
23:09 <@heinrich5991> in the real world, the implementation for big endian is broken, and no one seems to have noticed in years
23:09 <+Learath2> :D
23:09 <+Learath2> Well not many big endian machines around
23:09 <@heinrich5991> but for the PR you just have to know that integers get saved correctly
23:10 <@heinrich5991> (because they work in other map items=
23:10 <@heinrich5991> and I serialize the UUIDs into integers, in a native-independent way
23:10 <@heinrich5991> *endian-independent
23:10 <@heinrich5991> so it doesn't matter how we save them, as long as integers work
23:11 <+Learath2> Great, I'm merging then
23:11 <+Learath2> than*
23:12 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: doesn't sizeof(CUuid) / 4 assume sizeof (int) == 4?
23:12 <+Learath2> Is that a fair assumption to make?
23:13 <+Learath2> I guess it is given sizeof (int) is guaranteed to be >= 4
23:14 <@heinrich5991> if it's not 4, the whole serialization code breaks
23:14 <@heinrich5991> like
23:14 <@heinrich5991> the datafile code
23:15 <@heinrich5991> hm
23:15 <@heinrich5991> if one were to refactor the datafile code, one would replace all ints with int32_ts
23:16 <@heinrich5991> (obvious spot for rust promotion) you know that in rust, you usually know the integer sizes you work with? :P
23:16 <@heinrich5991> hm
23:17 <+Learath2> One last thing before I r+, should you maybe test for the uuid being saved correctly aswell in your testcase?
23:20 <@heinrich5991> hm. I considered that private to the datafile classes
23:21 <@heinrich5991> should I add a test regardless? I don't really have the structures for that around, because they're in the .cpp file
23:22 <+Learath2> I guess it's not really mandatory under the assumptions that storing ints work and that sizeof(int) >= 4
23:23 <+Learath2> first one is true because, well things work :D and the second one is guaranteed by the standard so I guess we are golden :)
23:25 <@heinrich5991> do you feel that I'm being more strict with you on PRs than you are with me?
23:25 <@heinrich5991> because I currently have that feeling
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well with this one it's not really my area so I can't really be sure if the things I worry about are superficial or not
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also you've always been more strict then me anyways :D
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night
