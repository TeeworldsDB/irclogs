07:54 < bridge> <Ewan> True
07:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ccache is pog and all but i still wanted to go faster so i tried out distcc and hooked up 8 additional build threads from 2 of my vps into my local build sadly that feels slower than before
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but setting up distcc was suprsingly simple so if you have some fast internet and a garbage intel pentium 0.5ghz laptop and also access to some threadripper via ssh i can recommend it
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/distcc/distcc
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> start the deamon on all your vps set one environment variable locally which ips you want to connect to and you are done. 
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> distcc is great
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i use it on window
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> just have my other pc hooked up tho
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> no threadripper
09:40 < bridge> <Ewan> imagine i started a build and someone on unique usa loses their pb run cuz lag spike
09:40 < bridge> <Ewan> :troll:
09:40 < bridge> <Ewan> vps separate
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/edlang/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha.1
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> automatic artifacts release pog
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan axaxax rip users in that case. Gotta limit it to less jobs than the vps has cores to give it space to breathe
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also wats a "pb run"
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Fridays for edlang
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i just dont run it on the vps
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i run it on my other pc
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> personal best

10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> it's worse than my tests from last january
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> season based
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> typing skills
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send ulr
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> url
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i fuk u
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> monkeytype.com
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u pro
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it mark stuff as wrong even when its correct sometimes?
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> if u go fix typo it’s still a mistake
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah it just doesnt show the letter i typed
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats confusing xd
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> a bit
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> what's urs
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its bad
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> but how bad
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707472624.png

10:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :gigachad:
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> not so bad
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats my best
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> u drop off hard
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> the key is to stop thinking
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> just sound out the word and then it flows to ur fingers...
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i rarely type 135 in real world cuz im not in testing conditions
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i also have a reading skill problem xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> fair
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> esl moment i guess
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> my main keyboard is a fair amount slower but it has a tenkey and it's harder to accidentally press the wrong key cuz they're taller
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> the mx mechanical is such a smooth keyboard to type on though. thats my other one that i take with me
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> when i take pc
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it really depends on what words i get there are some english words i never bothered to learn on how to type i just type something usually
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> also depends on the word set
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gimme ddnet code xd
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> true
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon u can practice typing code there xd
11:00 < bridge> <teero777> 130 tokens per second coding
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also when i really wann go fast i sometimes look at my keyboard. Which does not work while reading

11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> what for
11:16 < bridge> <cyberFighter> they thought i was a ddoser or something
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
11:17 < bridge> <cyberFighter> Not my loss at all though, kog sux
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i really have a hard time enjoying kog
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> the only time i have even a little fun is when i'm getting carried by a group good enough that i can goof off in
11:18 < bridge> <cyberFighter> that discord server is like this server, but if you would even dare say that ddnet sucks you would get banned
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> few things worse than an over-moderated discord server...
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like one time i tried to swear when submitting a ticket and it wouldn't let me
11:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> its mid
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> who the fuck has a swear filter
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> why
11:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> swear filter for tw server?
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah...
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> discord server has it but not in game chat
11:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> Lmao
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i just think it's funny that they can be the guys
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> separating kids from swear words
11:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i would understand slurs but no basic swear words

11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> unfamiliar
11:23 < bridge> <teero777> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knAv9q0gIQM
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks home depot
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> sin
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> just scrub ryo with a little sandpaper
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> then some acid and the rust is gone!
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfTdzrtGKuY
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft its a dead rapper
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldn't use sandpaper
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> like lofi-style rap
11:25 < bridge> <teero777> maybe sand-gun?
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of shops use sandblasters for rust removal
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nujabes
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's usually not alongside chemical treatment
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz it would be pointless
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> strong acid + something like a scotch brite pad
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> gentler abrasive
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In 2010, Seba died in a traffic collision at the age of 36.[2] Although relatively niche during his lifetime, Seba has since achieved posthumous acclaim and been referred as the "godfather" of lo-fi hip hop. Seba's production techniques and career have also been compared favorably with J Dilla, who was born on the same day

11:28 < bridge> <teero777> we need cure ryo
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> very cool
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i like this sound
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but i dont ever seek it out
11:45 < bridge> <teero777> btw what do people think about a 2d game about torpedos?
11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> about torpedos
11:46 < bridge> <teero777> yes
11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
11:47 < bridge> <teero777> idk the idea just popped into my head. like exploring underwater caves as a remote controlled torpedo
11:47 < bridge> <teero777> roguelike
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds cool but if 3d
11:48 < bridge> <teero777> 3d?
11:49 < bridge> <teero777> you know intospace 2?
11:49 < bridge> <teero777> an old flash game
11:49 < bridge> <teero777> what kind of artstyle would fit for 3d?
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> realistic
11:50 < bridge> <teero777> kinda hard for single person C SDL project :justatest:
11:50 < bridge> <teero777> but sure
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> oh u are saying u want to make it lol
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> yea
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be cool either way
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> any game better than no game
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> opensource ofc
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pog
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> free software
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> use gpl
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> like edlang
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> you're fired
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> it's sleepy time
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but i can't stop listening to this song
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> what happened
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> someone deleted something :justatest:
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> tip put ur integration tests in a module with a single entry point
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u dont want to explore ur disk usage
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> did this at work
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> from 48gb debug build to 16gb debug build
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> debug folder*
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz otherwise each test is its own executable
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and rust statically links
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and has a shitload of debug info
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> rust L
13:15 < bridge> <deen> I'm not a Rust pro, how did you do this?
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> hi deen
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> wanna play minecraft
13:17 < bridge> <deen> No, I'm just here for Rust tips for work 😄
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have ur tests/ folder right
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u probs have like multiple .rs files
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i made another subfolder in tests/, lets call it tests/my_tests, but it can be called tests/tests/ too (i want to avoid confusion in the explanation)
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the tests/my_tests i added a mod.rs
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has 
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> `mod file;` entries of all tests
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> then i have a tests/entry.rs and there i have `mod my_tests`
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> only entry will be made into an exec
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it will run all tests
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> furthermore
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i run tests in opt level 3 so they faster
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also added this
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```toml
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> [profile.ci]
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> inherits = "dev"
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> opt-level = 3
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> debug = "line-tables-only"
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> line-tables-only is enough debug info for panics to show meaningful stuff
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> without the debug change its like 23gb
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> on my case
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> with it its 16gb
13:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like u should only run tests in o3 if it will be running in o3
13:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the same thing with tests was done in book "Zero To Production In Rust"
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has 
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> mod file;
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> mod file2;
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki>  entries of all tests
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean everything will run in o3 in rust at the end
13:26 < bridge> <Ewan> good
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> opt-level 3 is the --release level
13:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen also if u not doing it already, change the linker to mold or lld
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```toml
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> linker = "clang"
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/bin/mold", "-C", "target-cpu=native"]
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is my global entry xd
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> enabling lto for tests may reduce size too
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u dont want to explode ur disk usage
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its only a L in the integration tests but ucan fix it like i said
13:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw llvm debug build is like 100gb
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> just sayin
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen i continually struggled with hd space in github ci so im doing stuff like this xd
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also remove things
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```bash
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           echo "Listing 20 largest packages"
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           dpkg-query -Wf '${Installed-Size}\t${Package}\n' | sort -n | tail -n 20
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           df -h
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get update
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get remove -y '^llvm-.*'
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get remove -y 'php.*'
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get remove -y '^dotnet-.*'
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get remove -y '^temurin-.*'
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get remove -y azure-cli google-cloud-cli microsoft-edge-stable google-chrome-stable firefox powershell mono-devel
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get autoremove -y
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo apt-get clean
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           df -h
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           echo "Removing large directories"
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           # deleting 15GB
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet/
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/android
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>           df -h
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend this
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> it frees like 24gb~ from the ci container
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> why did i start this stupid spider grinder ishould be in bed
13:32 < bridge> <Ewan> what a world we live in
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> where github lets you chew up their disks for free
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft wdym
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> its just funny that this image running in some docker instance will deliberately install and then uninstall packages
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> well the runners they provide
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> have stuff preinstalled
13:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> to make it faster
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> like android which is like 15gb
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> also running a  single executabl e is probs faster
13:49 < bridge> <deen> Nope, we have tests inline in the same files with the source code. I guess we have modules already, but still > 70 GB :/
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> but those are unit tests right
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i meant integration tests
13:50 < bridge> <deen> mold was slower than lld for me in my benchmarks
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests
13:50 < bridge> <deen> Yes, I assume you meant unit tests
13:50 < bridge> <deen> Integration tests we do in Python
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen try with this
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> the debug
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2024/02/08/whats-new-in-postgres-16-query-planner-optimizer/
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur sql pro right
14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> stability 🙂 not much new features. I like it
14:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, that's edlang 😄
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, also felt really different to me. I used to like meditative strip mining 😄 https://xkcd.com/1172/
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try old.reddit.com 😉
14:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's illegal
14:34 < bridge> <teero777> 😂
14:35 < bridge> <Ewan> agreed
14:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's also this: https://github.com/jlumbroso/free-disk-space
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> poi-son actually followed up on it :o
14:39 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
14:39 < bridge> <Ewan> my spider grinder is complete.
14:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i found 5 spawners in a ~20 block radius
14:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but mine only uses 2
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i could expand to use another 2 if i have my alt stand over there
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> since u need to be within radius to generate mobs
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao 1million indians spamming express on github https://youtu.be/o2CSJYXJBpc?si=Wic-h8O2GUoEyH51&t=203
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not expect that to exist

14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude wtf
15:00 < bridge> <bencie.> holy
15:00 < bridge> <bencie.> theres so many lmao
15:00 < bridge> <bencie.> some still open aswell
15:03 < bridge> <bencie.> insane
15:03 < bridge> <bencie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1205514237343174666/jYZJsky.png?ex=65d8a59f&is=65c6309f&hm=914f6a287bcfc3cb06f074a267c583f1c9471a27ff326df62ceaf9372c9c8d20&
15:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> LGTM
15:04 < bridge> <bencie.> is it spelled opne source or opan source?
15:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> opne source*
15:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> opne source
15:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> everybody knows that
15:04 < bridge> <bencie.> thank you
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: do you not use ur gaming pc as general purpose pc too?
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is my pc then a NASA pc rather than gaming
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i also buy it to have the fastest computing power
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I do use it for more than gaming. But people keep telling me to put all shit into tax declaration I just think it’s bs. Yes I did work stuff on my pc sometimes. But I could tie almost all belongs I have to work somehow.
15:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean where does it stop? All clothes I buy I wear at work… and naked is not an option.
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's how our system works xd
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that it's bs is obvious
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No way
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Financial advisor jopsit
15:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Put gucci underwear on tax declaration as work expense
15:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I doubt that that's okay
15:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye that’s what I think too
15:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you *might* be allowed to put the percentage of the price that you use the PC for work as an expense
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is not okay?
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can say u need good pc for work
15:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the clothing
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clothers are ok if you need specific clothers
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be okay if you need work-specific clothing
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but chillerdragon suggested underwear
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that has to be paid by the employer
15:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because you already have clothing anyways right?
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I'm not familiar tax law to tell you that it's actually okay with the percentage thing for the computer
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but what if  he is a model
15:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But that’s my point I did not buy a top of the line gaming pc for work
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that's not how it works
15:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Broken
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "I use the top of the line gaming pc for my work"
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need that power to do my work well
15:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hmm
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you feel bad doing it, don't do it
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u gotta accept ppl are doing it, and even worse than just a pc
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah aren’t they scared?
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im scared
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tell that Uli Hoeneß xddd
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yeah fuck it I’m not doing it. Stay safe. My papers are clean Bitches
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :D
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and if they get caught, I don't feel bad
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's funny how, if you are rich, u can steal
15:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the excuse "other people are doing it" is lame in my book anyway
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how long did he sit? 1-2 years?
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for million of dollars
15:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I’m not going to jail -.-
15:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's also an excuse people working in concentration camps used
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well to be clear it's not illegal to do the computer thing
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u just have to explain why u need it
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not if u need it
15:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's illegal to do 100% of the price if you don't exclusively use it for work
15:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heard this sentence twice this week lmao
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can't do 100% of the price
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's only for mehrwertsteuer
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the VAT for 100% of the price
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also income tax for the price, no?
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also write u donated to some organizations without any proof and get money back
15:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So if I do gaming on my laptop the company bought me I have to refund their tax? Xd
15:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're not allowed to do gaming on your corporate laptop, yes, I think so
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on your employer
15:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Usually no. Maybe it is because of that very tax reason lmao
15:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it's a result of tax law and the employer used the tax benefits (likely), then no, not dependent on the employer
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what taxes are we talking about?
15:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So gaming is tax fraud then?
15:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Taxes the company is not paying because they declared your laptop as an expense
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> VAT and geldwerter vorteil which has to be taxed as income
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: laws are too subjective and have too many holes in them
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can always find a way to get out if u have the money to pay lawyers xdd
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else uli wouldn't be a free man today
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think that's the case
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the trick is having the lawyer before you get fined
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the trick is having the lawyer before you get caught
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so they advise you to stay on the line
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> instead of committing blatantly obvious tax fraud
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sure
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> works so well
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u mean like every major company?
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> enabled by governments, yes
15:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I got jopsti he keeps me save
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the irish government sued the EU so that they wouldn't have to collect taxes from apple
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> iagine that
15:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> imagine that
15:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye classic
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u rich, u can do what u want
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's our government style as of today
15:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I *think*, we're doing pretty okayish on that front, compared to other times/places
15:42 < bridge> <Ewan> open sores
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or we are just soo rich, that we don't have to care
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u rich
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
17:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ehem

22:50 < bridge> <Ewan> @ryozuki i think i finally got the mobile redesign

22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i see what you mean now @fokkonaut

23:31 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks is there some sort of shader static analyser which tells me an estimate of clock cycles for each shader stage?
23:31 < bridge> <patiga> that would help greatly with learning how to optimize what
23:34 < bridge> <patiga> I mean I guess I could look at the disassembled instructions, but I'm not sure if those give a clear picture
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think I once showed you some tools from render doc. But I never used any of those.. You could look for tools from gpuopen
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They r from and. But might only work on windows
23:48 < bridge> <patiga> the gpuopen tools seem cool 😮
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> seems dope
23:53 < bridge> <patiga> huh? why are these tools neither in pacman nor aur?
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> they are probably in sone *-tools pkg
23:55 < bridge> <patiga> the keyword gpuopen has no results 🤷
