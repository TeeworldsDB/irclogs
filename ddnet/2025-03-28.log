08:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki look at dis, looks pretty good imo: 
08:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
08:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let mut ctx = Context::new();
08:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let struct_ty = ctx.ty_storage.add_ty(Ty::Struct(vec![
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i8_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i16_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i32_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     ]));
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let struct_ty = ctx.ty_storage.add_ty(Ty::Struct(vec![
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i8_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i16_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         ctx.ty_storage.i32_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         struct_ty,
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     ]));
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let void_ty = ctx.ty_storage.void_ty;
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let module_idx = ctx.create_module();
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let mut module = ctx.get_module(module_idx);
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let fn_idx = module.create_fn("main".into(), vec![], void_ty);
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let mut func = module.get_fn(fn_idx);
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let block_idx = func.create_block("0".into(), Terminator::Return(None));
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let mut block = func.get_block(block_idx);
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let local = block.create_alloca(struct_ty);
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> it looks like mine xd
08:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> BUT
08:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i don't need to pass `TypeStorage` when calling `instr_load` and others
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because in my code `get_*` methods return not the things itself but a `Wrapper<&mut T>` where `Wrapper` is:
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub struct Wrapper<'ctx, T> {
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub ty_storage: &'ctx mut ty::Storage,
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     inner: T,
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
08:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i implement `Deref` trait for it which returns inner
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki in the end I didn't use that crate, here's my type storage xd
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub type TyIdx = usize;
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub struct Storage {
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub void_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub i8_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub i16_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub i32_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub i64_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub ptr_ty: TyIdx,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     types: Vec<Ty>,
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats fine xd
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i yoink that idea
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :owo:
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u test how it works out with multiple functions and for loops?
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> it helps to make a smol language to see if the pattern works i guess xd
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im testing by doing
08:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i thought it's a cool solution, i did it, ill see if it's bad in the future :justatest:
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
08:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ay, at least it's not `Rc<RefCell<T>>`
08:54 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, my summoning didn't work, _drinks mana potion and sacrifices goat_, @hectavoxel do you have better ideas for the pulley? üòõ I am not so fond of the current design
08:56 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> c++ 11
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> These look so much better :owo: 
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place do you like them? Also thanks @cellegenrih

11:37 < bridge> <Assa> I removed the middle now when it does not grab you, which is also great :3
11:37 < bridge> <Assa> I removed the middle now when it does not grab you, which is better for existing maps :3
13:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> make the lines thicken when you move towards them and make them get narrower when you move away from them, to make them look all springy and rubbery
13:31 < bridge> <Assa> I thought about the exact same üòÑ I'll try
13:32 < bridge> <louis> i like that design
13:33 < bridge> <louis> and i guess rotation speed could work as a differentiator but the difference between each strength should be pretty large for ppl to tell without a side by side
13:33 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I need to send a new video, I adjusted that and it's now VERY clear

14:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> looks good :owo:
14:42 < bridge> <chairn> maybe change the size depending on strength ?
14:47 < bridge> <chairn> I mean, not the line thickness, but the fixed laser position (like bigger star or bigger spinning thingie you added)
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> agree, you cant tell which laser it is on screenshot
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> and guessing how fast is spins is defiently slower than knowing it based on some graphic design
15:30 < bridge> <Assa> While I was thinking about that, and also think this idea would also be cool, and also would like to implement it, we have maps where the grabber is "hidden" in the wall and not supposed to stick out. So I am limited to the size of 1 tile üò¶
15:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but udp filtered is the scenario no one has, when they get this error... its wrong
15:30 < bridge> <kebscs> tag him in the pr, he doesnt read discord
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Yes, that's because it hasn't received a response from the STUN and then assumes that UDP is filtered. If it got a response from STUN it would say No answer from server yet. instead.
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Anyway, I think this PR seems to be based on wrong assumptions, I'll close it. If you want it reopened, just say so, someone can reopen it then.
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> make up your mind (tbf 2 dif people said these)
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> "Thanks, that appears to be the problem. I replaced the IP addresses with a working STUN server. The issue should be fixed now."
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> whats fixed exactly
15:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> que?
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> .
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> does this make "udp filtered" not show on ddos?
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> if not then its not fixed
15:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont want to change any behvaiour, i want to make the error message better for what it covers now
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> yes but im quoting heinrich comment
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> from that pr
15:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh right
15:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres still different things that can cause that error
15:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah "appears to be filtered" is a bit of a strong statement when it's clearly not the truth in the majority of cases
15:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> just say that the servers in question aren't reachable
15:35 < bridge> <kebscs> yea that was the point of the pr
15:36 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why its closed
15:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki btw fix code formatting when a new project is created üò¨
15:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355188816671019209/image.png?ex=67e80570&is=67e6b3f0&hm=ae5224f9546005ac47870f8b4fc770da87422f36c53e7b8a2e9bdb7ff152fb2a&
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would prefer a list of reasons, one of which is udp filtered
15:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> one of the reasons in my commit is no longer valid
15:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and there are more eg no ipv6
15:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and that does deserve a different error msg
16:00 < bridge> <chairn> obviously, it would always be one tile max, but the current sprite is like 20% of a tile i think
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet 19.1 tag was made 5 mins ago

16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr beat me next time
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now make it so that gentoo automatically chooses best kernel config for my hardware
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki i want this:

16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:05 < bridge> <Assa> not with the rotating orbs rn
16:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki did you finish your traits pr?
16:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> that was really damn fast
16:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> i didnt even merge 19.0 iirc
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> no, its half done
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> the syntax works and impl too

17:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A russian fella, like you
17:10 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
17:10 < bridge> <kebscs> is there no rate limit for rejoins?
17:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hmmm, like force delay join for each ip that is not timeouted but disconnected from any DDNet server?
17:11 < bridge> <s0ftix> there is, but if you successfully log in to the server, it resets like

18:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> According to these recent events, this is going to be rampant and more violent
18:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is no dev or admin going to look at this and somehow deal with it?
18:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> One suggestion I could make is creating a flag on logins with quick succession, so mods can react to it and investigate it
18:41 < bridge> <swarfey> if someone with access to the antibot wants to take a look at this, shoot me a dm
18:42 < bridge> <swarfey> they are most likely using my library to flood the servers. i already wrote a lil script to block them on my & some ruski servers
18:42 < bridge> <kebscs> happens on ddnet too

21:39 < bridge> <learath2> @tsfreddie how on earth did you come up with that sepia trick for your tee renderer in ddrecap?
21:39 < bridge> <TsFrediman> google color to filter
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> How on earth did the guy who came up with that come up with that wtf
21:41 < bridge> <TsFrediman> You know how filter applies to color
21:42 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Run a iterative approximation where you randomly move towards the result
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> I'm unsure whether you can do the same thing without sepia
21:44 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I mean you could just remove the sepia filter and run it and see. I'm in bed tho
21:46 < bridge> <learath2> Without sepia it seems you shouldn't be able to escape black and white, no matter what other filters you use
21:47 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I see
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355282068770259107/image.png?ex=67e85c49&is=67e70ac9&hm=3386c95a394227a1c76aca2a441306289faf5bd9a2ea6bfbd06d7bb55e372fe7&
21:47 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Then probably
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. rotate the hue all you want, you are stuck at the points of the hexcone
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ops wrong channel
21:47 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Didn't give it too much thought tho
21:48 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Why are you looking into it anyway
21:48 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I got flamed for not being able to 100% reproduce colors on ddrecap:justatest:
21:49 < bridge> <learath2> I was also rendering tees, was curious how other people did it. Most other solutions do it exactly as we do it in teeworlds by working on the actual image, you were the only one doing filters
21:50 < bridge> <learath2> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42966641/how-to-transform-black-into-any-given-color-using-only-css-filters found the people who investigated this initially, but the first guy already seems to know sepia lets you escape the grey line
21:50 < bridge> <TsFrediman> i only did it to avoid canvases
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> I thought divs would be easy (which they were until I decided I wanted to color them too)
21:51 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Well ye
21:52 < bridge> <TsFrediman> :nouis:
21:52 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I was using the renderer for twcn browser where one of the page would have too many tees and too many canvases kinda blocks the browser rendering and it stutters
21:53 < bridge> <TsFrediman> So I just googled my way out
21:57 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I should just do this in svg hm
21:59 < bridge> <learath2> There I can have a full color matrix which should be strong enough to tint my image to whatever color without running a numerical approximation through sepia and hue rotations
21:59 < bridge> <TsFrediman> sounds pog
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> I found an even better solution
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355288413586067536/image.png?ex=67e86231&is=67e710b1&hm=a0071dd7442757aeb5bc49e5fff0cd34b7087a1ced57a43068fb284cdb1cb0e5&
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> You can apparently use external filters from any svg file
22:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> I immediately saw a butt on that one
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> Now just need to generate the correct colors
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355289917562818643/image.png?ex=67e86398&is=67e71218&hm=e90aa15ecfddfa423670c97616b583f3c46149707ffdb91ca7e9fe49313aadc3&
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'll be stealing your positioning for the eyes @tsfreddie
22:19 < bridge> <TsFrediman> need code after you've done
22:19 < bridge> <TsFrediman> mine is eyeballed btw
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> ```
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>   <filter id="red">
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>     <feColorMatrix type="saturate" values="0.10" />
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>     <feComponentTransfer>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>         <feFuncR type="table" tableValues="0 1"></feFuncR>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>         <feFuncG type="table" tableValues="0 0"></feFuncG>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>         <feFuncB type="table" tableValues="0 0"></feFuncB>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>     </feComponentTransfer>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2>   </filter>
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> ```
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> I thought I'd have to compute the entire matrix but apparently svg has more primitive filters  that you can compose with
22:21 < bridge> <learath2> 0.1 probably needs playing with, but other than that this just maps blacks to black, whites to whatever color you want üòÑ
22:21 < bridge> <TsFrediman> epic
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> Now, why am I wasting time with this? idk
22:22 < bridge> <TsFrediman> was wondering why you are doing this
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> Just felt like putting the tees to display them for the lulz, this project definitely has 0 need for the tees to be displayed
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> nor does it need to be accurate
22:23 < bridge> <TsFrediman> what project is it anyway
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> It's internal tooling to keep track of what mods are doing
22:23 < bridge> <TsFrediman> ok
22:24 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I'll appear more silent than ever. Great
22:24 < bridge> <learath2> It'll be open source but I don't see it being useful to anyone else
22:28 < bridge> <learath2> You know what I forgot? We don't even keep track of a players most used skin
22:30 < bridge> <TsFrediman> Ye that happens
22:30 < bridge> <TsFrediman> That's exactly why I'm wondering why you are doing tee renders
22:30 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I can add that to the ddnet website too
22:31 < bridge> <TsFrediman> any other guy I would be like oh they are just doing a tracker
22:31 < bridge> <TsFrediman> so are we getting an official tracker now
22:31 < bridge> <learath2> Only if I feel like it after eating my pizza
22:32 < bridge> <TsFrediman> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
22:32 < bridge> <learath2> We already parse the master server records to get the hours played graph
22:32 < bridge> <TsFrediman> fair
22:33 < bridge> <learath2> Actually not pizza, mcdonalds seems to have added a new burger, I'll try that
22:33 < bridge> <TsFrediman> my tracker only does most recent cuz some CHN player changes skins too frequently that some of them says the skin was stuck.
22:33 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I don't know if there is a good way to actually track skins
22:34 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, maybe most recent is better now that you say it
22:34 < bridge> <TsFrediman> I did track recent per region tho
22:38 < bridge> <ljpb> chillerdragon i love y
22:39 < bridge> <ljpb> chillerdragon i love you
