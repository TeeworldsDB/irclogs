00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Best decision the developers could make tho
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???'
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> did they sell out
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> dead game anyway
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/Geal/nom> im reimplementing my teestatus rust library using nom, a "a parser combinators library",
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks kinda cool :monkalaugh:
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816594770193285140/unknown.png
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we look into a language filter as an input to the spam filter?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> language filter means a filter for bad words?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or a filter for x language
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki I mean they had their hype with fallguys and made ton of sales, now its pretty much a dead game and probably sold it for couple of mil $ to epic games. This guy can now chill for the rest of his life. Similar story to minecraft
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he could already chill with the steam sales alone
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki I mean they had their hype with fallguys and made ton of sales, now its pretty much a dead game and probably sold it for couple of mil $ to epic games. This guy can now chill for the rest of his life. Similar story with minecraft
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Depending on his standards he wants to live. But maybe he just doesnt want to work anymore
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Depending on his standards he wants to live. But maybe he just doesnt want to work anymore on this game
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u understimate how much he sold on steam
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the game costs 20€
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he sold atleast 7M on steam
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> cringe not even 1b
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 140M€ without the cut
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 98M€ with the cut
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its prob more cuz the cut lowers when u sell over x money
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yeah idk, I mean he will never get a deal like epic games again. But if he actually made so much I dont know why he sold
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its not like its a big studio
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 3 ppl iirc
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ik
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> its a guy who starded in his moms basement lul
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> its a guy who started in his moms basement lul
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk, dick means just somebody's weight is a bit higher than usual in german for example
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> without context there will always be false positives
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Filter for bad words that just adds to a score. So maybe mods could deal with the spam by lowering the threshold for muting
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why I don't propose we act on the information but just collect it as a datapoint
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> my name is Dick
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are proposing to restrict travel for unvaccinated people in europe. Isn't that an insane violation of freedom of movement especially when you cant even vaccinate everyone?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> They can probably hide everything behind the infection protection laws
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would even be okay with it if they could provide vaccination to anyone who asked
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds very draconian to me as is :P
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i mean most countries apply a lockdown where u cant even move to an other "sub region"
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or whathever it is called
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But there are exemptions to that
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the royal family in spain got vaccinated ignoring completly the order rules of ppl who get vaccinated
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> From what I understand these vaccine passports will be a firm requirement except for people returning to their residences
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> talk about justice
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn’t they get a lot of shit for that?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they just did it today
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they went to the arab emirates
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hm. I distinctly remember someone in spain getting a lot of trouble for vaccinating early
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.elespanol.com/espana/20210302/infantas-pusieron-vacuna-abu-dabi-zarzuela-emerito/562945053_0.html
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its in spanish
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i guess the president
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They really should have pressured these private companies to license out their vaccines to local producers
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://covidvax.live/
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we are in 2021
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stupid capitalism delaying normalization again
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we cant even vacunate the world in a month
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> talk about shit
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > At this rate, 70% of the population could be vaccinated (2 doses) in 1,699 days (or by Oct 27, 2025).
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > At this rate, Spain could have 70% of people vaccinated (2 doses) in 588 days (or by Oct 12, 2022).
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well poor countries will never reach 70% probs
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is like a crisis of proportions we won’t see again in a century and we hadn’t seen in a century. Yet we still couldn’t come together and get a public solution
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they should have made all current vaccine research public
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure it would have been even faster
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, I’d be completely fine with it if they would meet their production deadlines
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and idk why europe countries only vaccinate 100k ppl per day
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not more???
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> EU subsidized these companies HEAVILY. Yet they can’t deliver
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> our money
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> human greed sadge
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In italy our new technocrat govt says we are going to get to the general population only in early q3 and thats a big maybe
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First shot in q3 means we are getting to be mostly immune by 2022. Which is an absolute failure imo
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 are you ok if i port libtw2 docs to the wiki, also do i need to mention you somewhere?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i can add a reference like any wiki
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look at this magic
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816659181154598972/unknown.png
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works :monkalaugh:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816659228147974174/unknown.png
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im using this technique <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator>
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🧙‍♂️
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, which parsers does this combine?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cute
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Geal/nom
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> <a:NoM:638795319324180489> nom nom
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i can actually make it parse the info doing 0 copy
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well copy for parsing would be silly 😛
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess it’d be in spirit for most new languages
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i put the data in the struct
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> representing a sv
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt even need to copy there
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a huge huge problem
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about rust?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats it
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> More a logistical issue
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See I made almost 7 liters of chicken stock
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I remembered why I don't make so much anymore. It's because I dont have a second pot large enough to strain it into...
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get a pot from amazon
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wtf do I do even?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, no amazon 1 hour delivery in turin
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats milan only for now
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any supermarket should sell that
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess I can go out and look for a pot. Thanks for the advice
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just had an idea. Do you think maybe we should fuzz demos and maps? Maps crashing either the server or the client sounds rather bad
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fuzzing the client is harder but we can atleast do the server
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I did that before, everything crashes hard
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> especially out of bounds reads
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well they are things to be fixed, no?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, but not such high priority as out of bounds writes
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean not extremely important yeah
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did you fuzz with? Afl?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think so
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/teestatus/blob/master/src/server_v2.rs> :monkaS:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should look into some intelligent spam detection, maybe we could try a neural net? Sounds like a decent use for it
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or even a dumb system that keeps a circular buffer of messages past a certain length and gives more spam points depending on the levenshtein distance to past messages
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 capital letters = more score, longer msg = more score, the same word repeated more than 3 times = more score
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont need fancy bruteforce maths
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, let me create an issue for this. I’m sure we can figure out some heuristics
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think for it to be effective it should probably also be across all servers
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we can make the variables be conf vars
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so trolls dont know the equation
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exactly
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the scores*
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we  can also add a score if u use unicode chars past x point or smth
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that nobody rly uses
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔱 𝔯𝔬𝔠𝔨𝔰!
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 𝖘𝖔𝖒𝖊 𝖙𝖗𝖔𝖑𝖑 𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖘𝖆𝖌𝖊 𝖍𝖊𝖗𝖊
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ᦓꪮꪑꫀ ꪻ᥅ꪮꪶꪶ ꪑꫀᦓᦓꪖᧁꫀ ꫝꫀ᥅ꫀ

17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I already added that in the issue, characters outside of the BMP shouldn’t occur much
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 shared server communication
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds like that would need another issue?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds like a big project
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t mean cross server messaging. I mean a backend software that messages run through to get a spam score
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the server submits messages to the backend to learn their scores
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rust service to detect spam? :monkalaugh:
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could be written in any language ;P
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 that should be opt out
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or opt in
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Decided a single issue is better
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could be, I doubt many would bother opting out but I guess it’s better to let people see the garbage if they want
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it could be abused by otherservers
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it could be used for censorship
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love gmail blocking a zip attachment saying it has a virus
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bitch im at linux
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Inb4 linux rootkit in zip
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or zipbomb ;D
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw if u want to circumvent gmail not letting u download it, you can make it display the original and then download it, open it in thunderbird and get the attachtment
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im such a hacker
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, they really don’t let you download it at all?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816710654974230588/unknown.png
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isn’t there some advanced option somewhere to disable it?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816710764802605106/unknown.png
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just because it is a zip
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw I’ve been looking to host my own mail for a while now, I just don’t know how to keep my smtp not marked as spam by gmail ;/
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have my emailt setup
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did various htings
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> things
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think gmail blocks me
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They blocked my last server and they don’t even have support for it, so I’ve been kinda demotivated for a while about it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have dkim setup
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn’t the last time around
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait what are benefits of hosting ur own mail
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Google not snooping thru your mail is a huge one 😛
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cool, ur not bound to a corporation and u own ur data
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my github mail is git@edgarluque.com
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> might be too late for me :feelsbadman:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But honestly, everyone knows my gmail. It’s impossible for me to change to a new mail. I’ll have to forward the gmail one, which means google still gets to snoop my mail
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u tell me ur mail, i want to know if they block me
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it probs will go to spam tho
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Google is soooo clever about this btw, they integrated gmail so well into their entire product space I’ll miss a lot of features when I switch
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what features
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Calendar integration is one I use alot
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i sent it
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I have a flight or a reservation it’s automatically added to my calendar when I get the mail about it
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can get my public pgp there too btw :greenthing:
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Marked as spam 😛
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> expected
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As with all non google senders nowadays...
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ppl used their own mail server
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this wouldnt happen
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn’t get mine unmarked either, they don’t provide support for it on purpose btw
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They want to force you to atleast use gmails smtp servers to send your mail
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fucking dataminers...
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw if u ever want crontab to send u the emails encrypted
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816712429235863592/unknown.png
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found this way
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have sfp dkim and dmarc?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dkim and dmarc yes
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember what sfp is
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A record you can add to your zone
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816712913846272042/unknown.png
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See even with all that you got marked as spam
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They make it as annoying as possible so you just say fuck it and use gmail
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so how do twitter and others
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont get marked
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u need to be big?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if you contact them about it they won’t tell you what’s wrong. They will tell you to look at their recommendations which are spf dkim dmarc
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its probs cuz google knows nothing about this mail
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah lolo my google account is connected to so many other accs guess ill just have to accept it
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Twitter literally has millions of users, they probably have backroom deals for senders of this size
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well they probs use a mail provider
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its kinda messed up, wish there were some non-boomers in the government so technology laws could be passed
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which has deals
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with google
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is also entirely possible that twitter uses googles mail servers to send mail to gmail users
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis everyone should use a self hosted mail server + encrypt mails with gpg
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + linux
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge the world isnt perfect
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They explicitly say they have no allowlists, but thats a huge fucking lie. If I had a company the size of twitter they would put me on an allowlist easily
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> f4 not everyone should use linux
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl cant use self hosted mail, they're not tech-knowledgeable enough
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah some ppl should use openbsd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Slowly but surely europe is making progress in tech legislation. Hopefully in a decade or so more dinosaurs will die and we’ll get even more
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could sell rpi preconfigured to be a smtp server
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The right to repair stuff is great and apparently they are planning to expand it to all consumer electronics soon
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They also made Tesla fold with their proprietary charging port for their cars
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same with apple with lightning. GDPR is probably the most comprehensive legislation on privacy to date. So there is some hope
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be cool if big things like email and such would be self-hosted from the start
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they were
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in early days of internet
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye but the smarter ppl took advantage of things while everyone else was figuring out
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> nouis
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you actually take a look at the designs of these early internet protocols they were all designed with federation and decentralization in mind
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Anyone else having discord connectivity issues? Wondering how widespread it is.
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> omg gun sounds with full bass sound like trash :D
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why did you even tried to bass-boost it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why did you even try to bass-boost it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> gun sounds sound like trash even without full bass
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> i just installed my "sound system" and it worked fine whit the music test but then i booted teewoods client and it sounded so weird ;D
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> either max bass is bad idea anyways or im not used to it or the tw sounds have bad bass support idk how sound works in general
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> so i have to choose between flat music and fuzzy teewoods sounds
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ja all teeworlds soudns bad except a few nice effects and the main menu theme
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> twlom > standard menu music
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :feelsamazingman:
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> yea menu music is very nice with bass
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually most of the common sounds are good quality imo so at least thats good
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i dont like how the gun sound is so loud
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should try to get used to a bassy tw sound 
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> but then it would sound weird on laptop
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> idk
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> anyone having a big ass bass here? no flex mine is older than time it self that might be the issue too ;:D

21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> read #general plz xd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> tl;dr :justatest:
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> server broke map dont work
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> something is very broken about tune_zones :/
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> @Learath2 we fix it for now with normal tiles
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> if u want to see the bug, join doomworld 2 at test server
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi you can deploy the fix with normal tiles on all the servers and I'll try to generate saves for the people on the locked server
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> If you have the map, send it to me
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Apologies if I am missing something obvious here, but is there a reason the README download is missing the record_points table? Is it because record_points is a cache of some sort generated off the other tables?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Apologies if I am missing something obvious here, but is there a reason the README download is missing the record_points table? Is it because record_points is acting as a cache generated off the other tables?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's UB whatever it is, interrupting the code with gdb at a couple points to check values fixed it
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Cøke does it always happen on doomworld 2?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac correct, record_points is just calculated from record_maps + record_race
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Hey is there an easy way to update ddnet without using the built in update button because it wont let me update
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, just download it again from website
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> settings are stored elsewhere
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oh okay
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> thanks
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> <3
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or use Steam, it has a more reliable updater
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Thanks @deen - makes sense. Would it be an significant issue if I were to create another temporary table. The alternative would be to modify the existing but that feels like it would have a number of knock-on effects.
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah i dont like having to open steam every time i want to play a game
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I'm trying to pull through the server association that you have in the points and use in map ranks to do the same with points.
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac what for?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, record_points but per server?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> yeah, was thinking record_serverpoints
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I have the script based off your existing one. Adds another grouping by server so you get the per region points
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816792466803523614/unknown.png
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think you can sum points from reach region together to get global points
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah thats why if it was to go ahead it would probably be easier as another table
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Keep record_points to cache points stats and record_serverpoints for per region stats
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, that's probably the least chance of breaking anything.
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the term server is way too overloaded, but I started that, so it's ok 😄
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> record_regionpoints might be clearer
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> haha yeah region is probably better
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I can write the script and everything, but I understand it is an infrastructure change. I don't want to go down this path if it would be an issue (cost wise etc)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nah, no need for you to write a script or anything
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we create the record_points from https://ddnet.tw/ranks/ creation already, and I can probably add the same for record_regionpoints
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you'll just have to update them when a new rank is done
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Thanks! The reason I want it is for a rather small feature. But I got it implemented for the other commands so hoping to extend it to points as well.
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3669
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but maybe wait for more opinions about using the regional ranks? don't want you to waste effort if others don't like it
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, based on this I might go ahead without extending it to points. See how it is received on the easier implementation first.
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah, based on this I might go ahead for now without extending it to points. See how it is received on the easier implementation first.
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> anyone know any good substitute to mysql
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> that is similar to it
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> the query system
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> doesnt matter
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mariadb
