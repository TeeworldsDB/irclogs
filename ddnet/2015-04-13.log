00:03 < Lady> deen is there a site to search mappers names?
00:03 < Lady> like player search
00:06 < Lady> deen so I should just write a list which maps are on ddnet?
00:06 < Lady> and send you these maps in .zip with all maps?
00:08 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/mappers
00:08 <@deen> yep, list will be fine
00:08 <@deen> and zip too
00:08 < Lady> ok
00:09 < Lady> I mean you should use maps from zip then deen 
00:09 < Lady> because they will be probably fixed, not always the same as released version
00:27 < Lady> deen I think that's the hardest work
00:27 <@deen> ok
14:15 <@EastByte> deen: I got a short nim question, are you there? :)
14:20 <@deen> EastByte: yes?
14:21 <@EastByte> why is there a `$` proc for every raw object but not for references?
14:21 <@EastByte> can't simply echo a referenced obj for example
14:22 <@deen> echo foo[]
14:22 <@deen> [] dereferences
14:22 <@EastByte> yea, but if foo contains references aswell, dosn't work
14:22 <@deen> oh, right
14:22 <@deen> hmmm
14:22 <@EastByte> I did this: proc `$`(t: Token) : string = $t[]
14:22 <@deen> maybe because refs can have cycles?
14:22 <@EastByte> oh, maybe
14:23 <@deen> non-ref objects are always easy to print, acyclic
14:23 <@deen> ref objects may be more complicated
14:23 <@EastByte> okay then I should add $ procs manually if needed
14:23 <@deen> you should still be able to use repr for debugging purposes
14:24 <@EastByte> ref 0x7f4d2d6a1050 --> [tNumbernumber = 5.0,
14:24 <@EastByte> offs = 0]
14:24 <@EastByte> kinda not readable ^^
14:25 <@EastByte> but yes, works thanks
14:35 < o_be_one> hi friends :)

18:26 < Spyker> hi deen, im back with news!
18:27 < Spyker> fixed all bugs i saw, playing the map lecit
18:27 < Spyker> and finished trailer, sunday 26
18:27 < Spyker> at 20.00
18:33 <@deen> Spyker: I need to hear that from testers
18:45 < Spyker> yes its ok, i know that
18:46 < Spyker> welf dont want to test brutal maps...
18:46 < Spyker> i asked kayumi :D
18:46 < Spyker> now i have to go, see ya
18:46 < Lady> deen you wrote Kintaro instead of Kintaro* everywhere?
18:47 < Lady> as mapper
18:48 <@deen> yes
18:48 < Lady> will you change it?
18:49 <@deen> why should I?
18:49 < Lady> because he's Kintaro*
18:49 <@deen> did he complain?
18:50 < Lady> no
18:50 <@deen> Players often have random characters aroun their names, like "gB. | " or ":3", I just remove them
18:50 < Lady> omg so it's Knight and not Knight :3?
18:50 < Lady> and not Scratchy <3?
18:50 < Lady> are you kidding me?
18:50 < Lady> I have to remove it now?
18:50 < Lady> but you copied whole index name
18:51 <@deen> well, mostly i orient on how they write their own name on their map
18:51 < Lady> so change it into Kintaro*
18:51 <@deen> I would say, try to make it the same as with the existing names
18:51 < Lady> yes dennis I'm looking in 10 plaec who is the mapper, how are they named here
18:51 < Lady> etc
18:52 < Lady> deen*
18:52 <@deen> but he calls himself Kintaro without the * on half the maps
18:52 <@deen> i don't think he minds much
18:52 < Lady> I'm trying to find out how to write it
18:52 < Lady> so change it
18:52 < Lady> I'm telling you...
18:53 < Lady> on most maps he wrote Kintaro* in logo
18:55 < Lady> nevermind
20:02 < Spyker> hi all, deen? you online?
