00:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lol this is a feature xd
00:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how should Konsti cheat maps without it?
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> this is not a feature ðŸ™‚. there should be safeguards in the code against this
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> oh
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hmm
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> this bug has been there for a long time
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> feels weird to fix it
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> dont u think?
00:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> blockers  are supposed to be unskippable like collision
00:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yes ikr
00:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and like all other tiles
00:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> technically it is a bug
00:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> is there any map that uses that?
00:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I mean like really, up until today I assumed that we fixed that bug years ago
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> are you sure that this isn't a problem that resurfaced?
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> no
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im not sure
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but for me it feels like it has been there forever hehe
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and it is a part of ddrace
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but ye probably we should fix it
00:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how would we even go about fixing this?
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Dont think we check collision regularly enough
00:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vdzcS
00:58 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 1b0ab87 Learath: Get rid of unnecessary queue in CFetcher
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> predict where you are in the next step, check every tile between now and then
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> btw there are maps where its required that you (partially) skip into one-way blockers
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, partial thing won't get modified
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> as I said, I think we fixed that already
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or rather, Greyfox did
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> GreYFoX ðŸ™‚
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we just have to do it sanely, in a way similar to how collision works
01:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and collision does work ^^
14:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> There are maps that use that
14:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i'm 100% sure
15:41 <+FlushA> Hello
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> olleh
15:56 <+FlushA> I have a problem with auth manager
15:56 <+FlushA> in autoexec_server.cfg sv_rcon_password "123456"
15:57 <+FlushA> but when i try in f2 say to me is wrong password
15:57 <+FlushA> why ?
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what line is it?
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> in the autoexec
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i recognized the new ddnet client somtimes ignores the first line of the autoexec
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> does the server log say somthing?
18:01 <+Learath2> he left
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> oh ._.
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> does some1 know this super crazy emoticon bug? I saw it once some years ago on my macbook. I forgot about it already. But i expirenced it 2 mins ago on my win10 machine agian.
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> The emoticon gets like 10x20 tiles big and spins like crazy envlopes of a failed sun
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and the demo looks totally clean
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wat? ðŸ˜„
23:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye no shit
23:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> crazy af
