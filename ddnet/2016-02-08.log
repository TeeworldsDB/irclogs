11:02 < derp> Hi
13:02 <@deen> hi derp
13:43 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: you here?
13:58 < F1rSt> hi all
14:22 <@heinrich5991> hi
20:45 <@EastByte> laxa: u there?
21:02 < laxa> EastByte: yes ?
21:02 <@EastByte> you are using startssl right?
21:06 < laxa> yes
21:07 <@EastByte> mind telling us how you are setting it up? seems like we will switch to startssl (for win xp compatibility)
21:09 < laxa> hu ?
21:09 < laxa> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-with-a-free-signed-ssl-certificate-on-a-vps
21:09 < laxa> followed this tutorial
21:10 <@EastByte> does openssl generate the private key?
21:10 <@EastByte> startssl I mean
21:10 < laxa> you can choose whether you generate it or not
21:11 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: maybe you hit the wrong option?
21:11 < laxa> maybe they changed it
21:12 <@heinrich5991> perhaps I hit the wrong option
21:13 <@heinrich5991> but the tutorial also shows a generated private key
21:34 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I don't really see an option for using my own certificate
21:34 <@EastByte> well, maybe they changed that like laxa said
21:35 <@EastByte> that would be pretty stupid though
21:36 < laxa> their website has changed
