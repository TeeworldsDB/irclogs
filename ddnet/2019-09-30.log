00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also consoles arent for gamers xD
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could invalidate older ranks
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ you dont need to use the ddnet client for the fix
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It definitely isn't a cheat as it's explicitly added by the developers of the game
00:00 <+Konsti> its a cheat
00:00 <+Konsti> for all maps
00:01 <+Konsti> because u make them easier
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so when ddnet adds a full aim assist u wouldnt call it a cheat?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its official
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's intended by the game, like e.g. the one overwatch character
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ it wouldn't be a cheat, but we'd never add it, because it'd remove all skill from the game
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure, it's not a cheat
00:01 <+Ryozuki> konsti dont be stupid, u now say this dummy is a cheat but when u abuse shit on a minecraft server its legit added by devs?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this change is quite similar actually, it's just that the skill it removes is muuuch smaller then an aimbot
00:02 <+Konsti> minecraft is a completely different game and for technical crafters its based on bugs
00:02 <+Ryozuki> blablabla
00:02 <+Ryozuki> invalid point
00:02 <+Ryozuki> and vanilla client sucks
00:02 <+Ryozuki> nobody should use it
00:02 <+Ryozuki> for ddnet specially
00:02 <+Ryozuki> so u talking shit
00:02 <+Konsti> be serious please
00:02 <+Ryozuki> i am very serious
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process" wikipedia
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and thats the problem
00:03 <+Ryozuki> ddnet developes the client and the server, therefore ddnet decides whats cheating and what not
00:03 <+Ryozuki> simple
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if tour de france allows dopping its still cheating
00:03 <+Konsti> its not about the definition
00:03 <+Konsti> its just unfair
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it officially allows doping
00:03 <+Konsti> also heinrich is not admin
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's not cheating anymore
00:03 <+Ryozuki> you are the one who thinks dummy is unfair
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's by definition not cheating
00:03 <+Ryozuki> first time i hear it
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it is, bcs its still a question of ethics
00:04 <+Konsti> ryozuki watch my player page and say that again
00:04 <+Ryozuki> i say it 100 times
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why does ethics come into the discussion even?
00:04 <+Ryozuki> 2^64 times
00:04 <+Ryozuki> ye
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs u say u want to relay on the definition of cheating
00:04 <+Ryozuki> why ethics
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and thats what i gave u
00:04 <+Ryozuki> ethics only regulate poor minds
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could say I feel it's unethical to only let pro's recover from failed hammerflies
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus recovering from a failed hammerfly is cheating
00:05 <+Konsti> wtf+#
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus we must remove that aswell
00:05 <+Konsti> its unethical that only pros can finish insane maps
00:05 <+Konsti> lmaooo
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see now u are argumenting against ur own facts
00:05 <+Ryozuki> Konsti hooking throught a corner is cheating in vanilla, since it is a vanilla bug
00:05 <+Ryozuki> it is the foundation of ddnet tho
00:05 <+Ryozuki> what do u say here
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's unfair that 0.001% of the players get to always survive failed flies
00:05 <+Konsti> ryozuki thats my argument
00:05 <+Ryozuki> no
00:05 <+Ryozuki> u dont have any argument
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ You are the one that wants to argue on ethics
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm saying if it doesn't break an explicit rule, it's not cheating
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you are the one that said, u want to stick to the definition of cheating
00:06 <+Konsti> learath u just said that it is a skill 
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i stayed with it and gave u the contra argument
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now u say weird stuff
00:06 <+Ryozuki> what contra argument
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> apparently there was a rate limit for inputs, but it was removed to make hammer-fly out of freeze possible (by spamming I suppose): 6735dce1af
00:06 <+Ryozuki> cheating is defined by the server owner
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My definition of cheating doesn't rely on any subjective morality
00:06 <+Ryozuki> i think its pretty simple to understand
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the sanest and simplest definition of cheating is "breaking a rule"
00:07 <+Konsti> neither heinrich nor learath are server owners
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well who makes the rule in a community driven game?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just pointed out that if you bring in subjective reasoning and morality into it, then I could similarly argue that this being possible at all is unfair to anyone that can't have it due to bad internet
00:08 <+Ryozuki> oh noes i used dummy on ddnet, lets post it on twitter so that people that are moraly sided with me can report it to :DDD
00:08 <+Konsti> why not just ask the community when trying to apply a change against their wantings
00:08 <+Konsti> ryozuki i dont say dummy is a cheat but yeah keep going on that
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti you aren't the community
00:09 <+Ryozuki> of it improves the gameplay by not depending on network stability im sure most people will agree
00:09 <+Ryozuki> if*
00:09 <+Konsti> aim assist too improves gameplay
00:09 <+Konsti> this change is unfair
00:09 <+Ryozuki> for you
00:09 <+Konsti> for all who trained skill
00:10 <+Ryozuki> let the poor people with poor internet play in peace
00:10 <+Ryozuki> stop being selfish
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's not unfair that people that don't live in europe?
00:10 <+Konsti> yeah its not
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's not unfair to people that don't live in europe?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why bringing subjective things like "fairness" that is not well-defined into arguments is stupid
00:10 <+Konsti> i cant play on chile server, thats unfair
00:11 <+Ryozuki> ur lucky u live in germany
00:11 <+Ryozuki> and u have a server there
00:11 <+Ryozuki> some ppl dont live near one
00:11 <+Ryozuki> have u ever considered it
00:11 <+Konsti> everyone can advertise for a community
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You decide what's fair using your own moral compass
00:11 <+Ryozuki> no
00:11 <+Ryozuki> not everyone can donate 500€ like you
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fact is u are changing the "rules" to make things easier, u are cheating on the pros xD
00:11 <+Ryozuki> u rly live in a bubble
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No rules are being changed @Jupstar ✪
00:11 <+Konsti> ur living in spain
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well then its cheating
00:11 <+Ryozuki> i have no problems with my internet
00:11 <+Ryozuki> but im thinking about other people
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs currently u can't just press hammer
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can we pls go back to moves that get affected by this change and discuss them?
00:12 <+Ryozuki> im lucky to have a good internet now, but i know the struggles of 1mb/s
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ yes you can if you are fast and lucky enough
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats something different tho
00:12 <+Konsti> yeah lucky
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga anything involving a frozen tee getting hammered
00:12 <+Konsti> or just get the feeling for the timing
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> to be honest there is no point discussing this at all before fixing the deepfly issue
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, newest test results:
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deepfly is also possible with scrollwheel
00:13 <+Konsti> i see more and more peopling getting this hammer fine within the normal run
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'll objectively make most all deepfly parts cheatable
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I can do deepfly with a non-dummy
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on ddnet
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> right now
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I guess what they want is some way to stop that instead of letting everyone do it
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact we don't know that they haven't been cheated, although we could try to get teehistorian involved for that
00:14 <+Konsti> pretty much yeah
00:15 <+Konsti> lmao
00:15 <+Konsti> u always think teehistorian would exist since 2013 right
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really see what the argument is except that we are "cheating" the pro's out of a move exclusive to them
00:15 <+Ryozuki> test
00:15 <+Konsti> luckily not, otherwise u could have find all my cheated ranks
00:15 <+Ryozuki> ur so cool konsti
00:16 <+Konsti> thx
00:16 <+Ryozuki> Konsti we could also find u edating some tw egirls right
00:16 <+Konsti> lmao no
00:16 <+Konsti> u wont
00:16 <+Ryozuki> e.e
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga it also kinda makes all deepfly parts cheatable
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can't ddnet just make a test server with that change
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're "cheatable" like that today
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that would be the easiest way to get a feeling for the change
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yes but it requires hardware or software mods
00:17 <+Ryozuki> whats wrong with being cheatable now, people will just make new ranks
00:17 <+Ryozuki> and it will settle on that
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unlocked scroll wheels are not a hardware mod
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're common
00:17 <+Ryozuki> its like when on mario they find a super weird bug and they improve time
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or at least not rare
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it's special hardware required
00:17 <+Ryozuki> everyone else doesi t then
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:17 <+Ryozuki> ppls could just auto hot key
00:18 <+Ryozuki> or whathever
00:18  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, but that can go into cheating territory
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not all gaming communities approve of that
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> however I have not heard of people calling scroll wheel cheating methods
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if every pro has to cheat to get a better time right now, why not just implement it in the client in a sane way?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not even the client, the server
00:19 <+Ryozuki> Konsti xd
00:19 <+Konsti> mechanics =| cheat
00:19 <+Ryozuki> =|
00:19 <+Ryozuki> so u want to OR equal
00:19 <+Konsti> xd
00:19 <+Ryozuki> xd
00:19 <+Konsti> u
00:19 <+Ryozuki> u
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 maybe you can even get it just with a standard scrollwheel, it's enough for bunnyhopping in cs which I think is also a couple frames at most
00:20 <+Ryozuki> !help
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can try it without unlocking, let's check
00:20 <+Ryozuki> !ddnetpeak
00:20 <@Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 129
00:20 <@Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 1854 users online at 2018-08-15 21:58:02
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> OMG
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> xd
00:21 <+Ryozuki> wtf
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it even works without unlocked scroll wheel
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
00:21 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991 saying omg
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can, can't you? 😄
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah guessed that
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> xd
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean in the end we can also say some mouse manifacturers have macros in their drivers to allow fast clicking one button, and you could also build a mouse to have it, so yes, u can say nothing is cheating
00:21 <+Ryozuki> Konsti whats going on
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at this point
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just merge it
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😛
00:21 <+Ryozuki> u got overexcited
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> merge it
00:21 <+Ryozuki> lets think it better
00:21 <+Ryozuki> xD
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not immediately merge it obv
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> test it first
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it's officially possible for anyone to cheat any deepfreeze part, just by doing `bind mwheelup +fire;`
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to see you aiming and moving the mouse wheel
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the whole time
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw heinrich, i didnt find any answer to my question: Are all bugs with the new stoppers fixed? Could you add them to 0.7?
00:22 <+Konsti> new stoppers mwat
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ you can at the very least fly directly up
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `bind mousewheelup +fire;`
00:23 <+Ryozuki> !botstats
00:23 <@Nimda> Uptime: 6 hours, 44 minutes and 42 seconds. Memory: 2.39 MB (2.54 MB max). SQL: 1694 queries total (0.07 q/s). Jobs: 0 (0 max). Timers: 7. Servers: 2, Channels: 3, Users: 24.
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so no need to merge it right
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it already is possible 😄
00:23  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
00:23  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it'll be possible in sane way
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 another feasible change would be to drop some input if people are spamming it?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see, same argument
00:23 <+Ryozuki> Konsti whats the cmd for that
00:23 <+Ryozuki> i forgot
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as merging it
00:24 <+Konsti> !slap
00:24 <+Ryozuki> !slap Konsti 
00:24 <+Konsti> xD
00:24 <+Ryozuki> oh
00:24 <+Ryozuki> u got hexchat
00:24 <+Ryozuki> nobo
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 ?
00:24 <+Ryozuki> weechat best
00:24 <+Konsti> u
00:24 <+Ryozuki> let me search my scripts
00:24 <+Konsti> just click on my name
00:24 <+Konsti> and press slap
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ weren't you the one that said it allows cheating because we are changing the rules?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it still does
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out we aren't even changing anything from the status quo
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> currently u cant just hold mouse click
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so whats ur arugment again?
00:25 <+Ryozuki> Konsti slap me
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ boi i dont want a game where everyone kills their mousewheels, thats no fun at all o.o
00:25  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
00:25  * Ryozuki gives Konsti a clout round the head with a fresh copy of WeeChat
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I'm not sure if I have fun porting every change to 0.7 tbh 😛
00:25 <+Konsti> HAX
00:25 <+Ryozuki> im not using hexchat i told u
00:25 <+Ryozuki> ez
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still no arugment @Patiga
00:25  * Ryozuki gives Konsti a hearty slap
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ???
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't fell like replying to this circular argument anymore
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where is that an argument?
00:26  * Ryozuki would slap Konsti, but is not being violent today
00:26  * Ryozuki slaps Konsti's bottom and grins cheekily
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bring objective arguments
00:26  * Ryozuki slaps Konsti with a large smelly trout
00:26 <+Ryozuki> Konsti hehe mine is better
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> instead of your subjective ones
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 at least this one, its a quite big one, dont wanna mess it up. Could you do it?
00:26 <+Konsti> slap harder
00:26  * Ryozuki slaps Konsti a few times
00:26  * Ryozuki gives Konsti a clout round the head with a fresh copy of WeeChat
00:26  * Ryozuki dusts off a kitchen towel and slaps it at Konsti
00:26  * Ryozuki likes slapping people and randomly picks Konsti to slap
00:26 <+Konsti> :troll:
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut have you tried whether a simple cherry-pick works?
00:26 <+Ryozuki> :konsti:
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not at home
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cant do that right now
00:27 <+Ryozuki> lets forget about 0.7
00:27 <+Ryozuki> lets release on steam
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw @Learath2 i never said im against it, i just want to clearify what is changing, and that its not a simple change
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lets forget about ryozuki
00:27 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: I'd be in for that
00:27 <+Ryozuki> yes
00:27 <+Ryozuki> it would bring new players
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> release ddnet?
00:27 <+Ryozuki> more joy
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this change allows cheating -> I say it's not cheating -> you bring up some subjective "cheating" -> I point out that subjectively the entire thing even being possible could be classified as cheating -> you say changing the rules itself is cheating -> I say it doesn't even change the status quo -> back to the beginning
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was just ur arugment with cheating
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this won't end and I hope to sleep tonight
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i even said its a question of what the community accepts
00:28 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 sleep 4 the weak
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interested in me rephrasing the argument, @Jupstar ✪ ?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> go ahead
00:29 <+Ryozuki> Konsti ah u using webchat
00:29 <+Ryozuki> arent you on linux? use a proper client like a real gnu/linux user
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet Konsti is a mirc user
00:30 <+Ryozuki> he is using web irc
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ so the argument goes like this: it is currently possible to do this mechanic on a normal scroll wheel. even I can do that. as konsti attested, I'm not a particular pro player. the thing the change does is allowing this with something else than a scroll wheel
00:30  * Ryozuki slaps Konsti's bottom and grins cheekily
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the game mechanics aren't affected by that, only whether the player uses the scroll wheel or another key to do the input
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and still u need ur mouse wheel
00:31 <+Ryozuki> we the devil for expecting u to have a mouse wheel
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just a question of if we want to make it so much easier
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. allowing "jump" to be bound to your "mike mute" button, wouldn't be a gameplay change either
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not hard
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try it
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wanna go on a server?
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i believe u
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u cant just press the key
00:31  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
00:31  * Ryozuki gives Konsti a clout round the head with a fresh copy of WeeChat
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so there is a difference
00:31 <+Ryozuki> :p
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but we call it so small that it doesn't matter. like binding "jump" to the "mute mike" button
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's also a difference
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides I got baited by "[1:22 AM] Jupstar ✪: i want to see you aiming and moving the mouse wheel", just like with bunny hopping you only need to turn the mouse wheel for a small interval of time
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but a very small one
00:32 <+Konsti> nah, i think ill get away from debian again
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but for ur argument u dont need to change the server
00:32 <+Ryozuki> go to arch
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the difference
00:32 <+Konsti> yeah, i had arch some months ago
00:32 <+Ryozuki> Konsti i maintain ddnet on arch xD
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its no gameplay changer
00:32 <+Konsti> was good
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ I can do this chagne client side as well if you want
00:32 <+Konsti> i mean amazing
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it also works
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's coded more nicely on the server
00:32 <+Ryozuki> i got arch on lvm2 on luks
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the same thing actually
00:33 <+Ryozuki> so nsa can only get into my pc beating me to death
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its curretnly also possible without changing the client
00:33 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: do you have your root encrypted?
00:33 <+Ryozuki> everything less boot
00:33 <+Ryozuki> i was 2 lazy for that
00:33 <+Ryozuki> but its possible
00:33 <+Ryozuki> its not like it leaks anything
00:34 <+Konsti> i have a 64 char crypt key, so if police steal my SSD they gonna get nothing
00:34 <+Ryozuki> Konsti they can beat u
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really. you have to have some kind of unencrypted boot stu b
00:34 <+Ryozuki> and im sure u would tell
00:34 <+Konsti> im living in germany
00:34 <+Ryozuki> there is a xkcd
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said, im not against it, idc about ddrace so much since i mostly play gores
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its a change that makes things easier, and you should accept getting positive and negative feedback, bcs it deffs removes some kind of skill
00:34 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: I guess they could always knock you out and dip your entire computer in liquid nitrogen before taking it away
00:34 <+Ryozuki> Konsti im sure if what u had is of national security they wouldnt care
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it doesn't
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can do it easily
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without training
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not "skill" you're talking about
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but do that in mid race while aiming
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no problem
00:34 <+Ryozuki> https://www.xkcd.com/538/ Konsti 
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ whats your ingame name?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see learath2's response
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bunny hoppers need to do that
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut keks
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know they do that too, but that doesnt mean that valve just makes it easy
00:35 <+Ryozuki> Konsti u should use a proper irc client and OTR
00:35 <+Konsti> lmao xD
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> valve limited the speed gained by bunnyhopping
00:36 <+Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging
00:36 <+Konsti> i would just talk myself out of it
00:36 <+Ryozuki> xd
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 yeah but why dont they just make the first hopp easy as fuck
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and they added a ridiculous amount of quadratic drag
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so not only pros can do it xD
00:36 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 not rly
00:36 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 people now speedrun half life 2 on new engine backwards
00:36 <+Ryozuki> cuz its not limited backwards
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah I saw that
00:37 <+Ryozuki> and half life 2 is broken anyway
00:37 <+Ryozuki> out of bounds stuff
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it was not only limited, each jump you gained your own speed on top since that was supposed to fix it (well that attempt worked for forwards hopping), tho backwards hopping was fixed a long time ago
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ they made sure being even amazing at bunny hopping doesn't matter anymore
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even from the very beginning I admitted this can be fixed with punishing the player
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i cant say how hard it is aiming and mouse wheeling todo that jump bcs i rarely play that game, tho its probs harder then holding space while aiming xD
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't have to roll the mousewheel around like crazy
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you only need to roll it during contact time
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but then they could just implement a "rejump" function if all this doesnt matter
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they could and it wouldn't matter too much as everyone would be given the same function
00:41 <+Ryozuki> Traceback (most recent call last):

00:41 <+Ryozuki> [4, 9, 16, 25]
00:41 <+Ryozuki> ez
00:41 <+Learath2> Why would you do this to us?
00:41 <+Ryozuki> im bored
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well and there comes my sentence into play, where the real question is, does the community want it, bcs u will obtain negative and positive feedback
00:42 <+Ryozuki> and u knwo this convo wont end anywere
00:42 <+Learath2> map(lambda x: x**2, [2, 3, 4, 5]) better
00:42 <+Ryozuki> what no
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if all pro players from csgo would shittalk it, valve probs would rethink it xD
00:42 <+Ryozuki> list comprenhension is beutiful
00:42 <+Ryozuki> and u should use it
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess a similar vocal amount of people wanted the bunnyhop back in cs:go ^^
00:43 <+Learath2> I wonder why python stream functions are implemented in such an ugly way :(
00:43 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991 bunnyhop on csgo affects competitive matchmaking i think
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 yeah i agree, but that again is a physic change
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like the nade thing
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> one is input other the game itself
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:43 <+Learath2> [2, 3, 4, 5].map would look so much more beautiful
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know this topic is too subjective too discuss
00:44 <+Learath2> also the same thing with len()...
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like with your definitions, it would be too hard to discuss whether 1 + 1 = 2
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😛
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what axioms are we talking about?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is 1, +, =, 2?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> about what should stay skill and what not
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the other thing is deterministic things
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc i can program a bot helping me with everything
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt change some axioms
00:45 <+Learath2> this change is by my (and I think heinrich's) definition of physics not something about the physics of the game
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never said that
00:45  * Ryozuki would slap Learath2, but is not being violent today
00:46 <+Ryozuki> good u come to irc side, discord bad
00:46 <+Ryozuki> totally not related with me being banned
00:46 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: have you tried being nice to people?
00:46 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 its tough
00:46 <+Ryozuki> :p
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `[12:53 AM] Jupstar ✪: but how can u discover new things if it doesnt change the physic ;D`
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see the sentence above
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u wont discover new things in that terms
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u will just make it more easy
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even konsti said that xD
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its possible so its just a matter of tryhard
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ wanna make a bet?
00:47 <+Ryozuki> why not make it easier
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 wait
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont say anything
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my bet is most dont care
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 5€ we will discover a new gameplay mechanic after this change
00:48 <+Ryozuki> only crybabies like Konsti complain cuz they want to be special
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> winner donates 5€ to ddnet
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *loser
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 but what is a new gameplay mechanic?
00:48 <+Ryozuki> ddnet is not accepting donations right now :p
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its possible right now already
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's not that hard to imagine a new part that could use this mechanic
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ something that's not known today
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like kintafly was discovered
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the hammer through freeze
00:49 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 lot of tees in freeze, one outside hammers the first in the row the other hammers the other
00:49 <+Ryozuki> this in one line
00:49 <+Ryozuki> like a domino
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in what time frame
00:49 <+Ryozuki> i can see it
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ one month after the fix
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs in the end i could say someone would have discovered anyway xD
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
00:49 <+Ryozuki> if thats how i understood it
00:49 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: and that's the most obvious
00:49 <+Ryozuki> ez
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the question is, are u now actively searching for it xD
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I won't search for it or encourage others except by them having read our conversation
00:50 <+Ryozuki> hello others
00:50 <+Ryozuki> i encourage you
00:50 <+Ryozuki> to search
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and how can we know noone has discovered it yet? XD
00:50 <+Ryozuki> good lurker on irc logs i know ur there
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it gets popularized
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like kinta
00:50 <+Learath2> I'm more concerned about all the current deepfreeze parts thoaugh
00:50 <+Learath2> though*
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so u mean a useful new mechanic?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> useful for finishing maps
00:51 <+Ryozuki> even if not useful
00:51 <+Ryozuki> like towers
00:51 <+Learath2> how will the knowledge of the mousewheel thing affect those maps?
00:51 <+Ryozuki> it gets popular
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah well t0 tricks are obvious
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so no, i wont bet heinrich
00:51 <+Learath2> we need to decide whether this thing is allowed at all or not, fast before people start making ranks with them
00:51 <+Ryozuki> most stuff comes from t0
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 5 players on a tower
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ so you agree that new tricks will be discovered?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and u can easily skip any freeze size
00:51 <+Learath2> well I guess we could look for them in teehistorian
00:51 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 konsti complainig a lot now but im sure he will be the first to search for new stuff
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 i agree that u can easily make a 64 player tower to skip a 62 tile freeze
00:52 <+Ryozuki> like a excited little kid
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or something like that
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, let's say except for spamming tees
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that fine by you?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like having a regular amount of tees, 2-4
00:52 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: I think he'll genuinely be a little saddened
00:52 <+Ryozuki> nah
00:52 <+Ryozuki> he will ofc speak u did wrong omg
00:52 <+Ryozuki> but he continues to play
00:53 <+Learath2> If we leave this in without merging the patch tho, I'm expecting konsti to use his mousewheel a lot :P
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 the problem is, even with 4 tees that are able to hammer simmultaniously is already a huge difference, ofc it will change the game by alot
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you agree
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i agree that it makes these things easier
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not that its impossible now
00:54 <+Learath2> they are only possible in the light of the mousewheel trick
00:55 <+Learath2> even though the hammer from freeze is possible, it's very hard to time
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> has the hammer no cooldown at all?
00:55 <+Learath2> I haven't really seen anyone pull it off with any level of consistency except for situations involving hammerflies
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i honsetly wonder if that mouse wheel technique is a 100% garantuee
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we tried it
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well yeah makes sense
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since the cooldown of hammer probs always short enough
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> hammer only cools down after it hits
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't get cooldown on hammer while you're frozen
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, that's not true
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> not?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hammer only gets a longer cooldown if you hit
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you can hammer instant whole time?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you still get small cooldown if you don't hit
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, I meant to write if it fired, not if it hit
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you get a longer cooldown if you actually hit btw 😉
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ah, nice to know 😛
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the only real question that remains is whether we want to allow this behaviour or not. Knowing it changes a lot of deepfreeze parts currently ingame
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we allow it I think we should merge this patch, if we don't then we should create a patch that drops/rate-limits this kind of input
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> along with me not wanting to fix it, I have a feeling that fixing it would probably be hard and need heuristics, possibly leading to valid input being dropped
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a client-side fix would be the most likely one, i.e. not allowing `+fire` on mousewheel
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only enforcing the rate limit for older clients
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really see a nice way to know what input is disallowed and what exactly to drop
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. do we drop the entire block? do we drop every other one? do we drop them randomly?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we could only allow the hammer input to be in a small window which wouldn't completely remove the skill requirement, but it'd still allow the deepfly without dummy
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like people would still bind it to the scroll wheel
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla people actually do that btw
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to fire the gun as fast as possible
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fuck those people
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it'll be the first thing I do when I get home
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 or we could just leave it as is, the mouse wheel will make this much more consistent for everyone if not a 100%
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but I'd prefer it on a non-mousewheel
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like having to have special binds to play the game
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (e.g. I was very annoyed by the deepfly bind)
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I thought we should patch that thing out the second I heard about it
01:36 <+Konsti> lmao jao contructive af
01:36 <+Konsti> constructive*
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in vanilla this shit is only tolerated because magnet does it
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i would love to see this discussion in vanilla
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had it
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> heinrich pr to allow rapid fire hammer/pistol to cope with scrollwheel spam
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did u actually?
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had the discussion of banning +fire on scrollwheel
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a couple of years back
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why was it turned down
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "pros use it"
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found that a non-convincing argument
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why not the other way then
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did not propose that back then
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s the same argument
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but I'd like it the other way for vanilla
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet is known for quirky, "fun" gameplay
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla is not so quirky
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can u do something against it server side
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can try
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't think it'll be easy
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Theres way too much you want...
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> It is not about what you want, maybe you should ask the community more often @heinrich5991
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/628043350427041800/unknown.png
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is what I did there?
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't quite seem to understand what it means to block this server-side
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the heuristic we decide to use could end up eating your input, is that preferable to losing some bragging rights?
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also you don't always know that someone is spamming the hammer at the time, what if we know after the hammer hits? Do we ban them for cheating?
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway if we don't merge this we might aswell disallow the hammer spam. I'd love to see how you feel about it when konsti starts cheating all the deepfreeze parts smashing records
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut you force-pushed to ddnet7, apparently also killing teehistorian

09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no teehistorian.cpp
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 does removing the commit fix it?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> removing what commit?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what you did
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you probably did `git reset` followed by a forced `git push`
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as a rule of thumb, never do forced pushes to public branches like master
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what to do now? can you fix it? :/
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did you do after merging my PR?
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could have a look at your local `git reflog
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could have a look at your local `git reflog`
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should be able to see the last state after you reset it
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did you do, anyway? `git reset`? ^^
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just edited without a pull i guess
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, something worse happened there
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might also be caused by someone else with write access to the repo, but I doubt anyone else did something(?)
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @heinrich5991 if you have the (a?) previous state on your machine, you could restore it as well 🙂
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a previous version of it
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know if it's the newest one
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> also, according to GitHub, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/commit/95a4b6579433ca3205c31aab79ba009985455cb6 was pushed by its author, as were the previous and next commits
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> are you sure that teehistorian.cpp was actually commited?
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> also, according to GitHub, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/commit/95a4b6579433ca3205c31aab79ba009985455cb6 was pushed by its author, as were the previous and next commits (AFAIK)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/pull/10
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you know what commit was pushed by whom?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> ah, that PR was somehow nuked, indeed
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think GH would sometimes show "xx committed and yy pushed"
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> not sure if it does it on branches or only on PRs though
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, that's just "authored and committed"
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not pushed
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> authored = written the code, commited = cherry-picked or rebased the commits, pushes aren't seen in git
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (they might be seen somewhere on github, I don't know)
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> your commit is in the staging branch though
13:00  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
13:00  * Ryozuki gives Konsti a clout round the head with a fresh copy of WeeChat
13:01 <+Ryozuki> Konsti what
14:13 <+Konsti> Ryozoozki
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 idk why but your commits arent there anymore
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try using `git reflog` on your local repo to find the last version before the break
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 lets run a test server with your patch
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure
19:08  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
19:24 <+Ryozuki> Konsti: hi
19:24 <+Ryozuki> Konsti: why u slap me
19:43 <+Konsti> isnt it ur fetish ryozoozki
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> Is/was there a reason why we have this awkward combination of record_race and record_teamrace in our database with all the redundancy but still no way to clearly match stuff from record_race with a teamrace?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one did it properly I guess?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's still lots of race conditions in there as well 😛
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> I got a little time the last days and in light of ddnet7 did some experiments to implement an rpc-service that is used to communicate with a database. Things are mostly working already but now i am creating a python script to do the actual sql-queries and it is not so nice. To clarify how it works right now: DDNet-Server calls my pythonscript or whatever implements the rpc-servic <message clipped>
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> About the db-scheme: I was thinking of a table for finishes storing map, time, gameuuid etc. but not the playernames or checkpoints with an uuid and another table linked via this uuid with the players and their checkpoints.
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> Maybe checkpoints should even be another table, so we keep only the best.
