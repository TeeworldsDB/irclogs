22:20 < Muttley> are those infection servers using the ddnet base ?
22:20 < coffee> yep
22:20 < Muttley> coffee, thanks for the reply. do you know where i can find the config setup ?
22:21 < Muttley> howto
22:22 < coffee> mm
22:22 < coffee> this mod is based on ddnet
22:22 < coffee> but ddnet itself is not enough to make your own infection server
22:22 < coffee> you have to take the infectionz/blockz source code
22:23 < Muttley> hmm ok, i found a teetime git repo which i cloned and build
22:23 < Muttley> but that thing doesnt seem ok
22:23 < coffee> I made infectionZ i can give you the source code
22:23 < coffee> if you wanna host a new server based on infectionz
22:23 < coffee> it's not really the classic infection mod
22:23 < Muttley> ok cool, is it still working ?
22:23 < coffee> and it's not popular
22:23 < Muttley> why not xD
22:24 < coffee> in this mod, there is no hammer laser walls
22:24 < coffee> because ddrace provides a lot of features.. like switchers and more
22:24 < Muttley> ah ok, well i think the hammer wall is to messy
22:24 < Muttley> it kills the gameplay
22:24 < Muttley> but thats just me
22:24 < coffee> yes me too
22:25 < coffee> but we are alone against the whole community
22:25 < coffee> lol
22:25 < Muttley> well i have the space
22:25 < Muttley> so i'd run it
22:25 < Muttley> if i find the accurate infection server i will run it to
22:25 < Muttley> only need to find someone that can provide me with the source of the newly ones
22:29 < Muttley> coffee, if you can send me the link to the infectionz source that would be cool
22:35 < coffee> sure
23:29 < Muttley> coffee, did you see my pm ?
23:32 < coffee> yes
23:32 < coffee> oh wait
23:33 < coffee> coffee-morning.net/infectZ_configuration.zip
23:34 < coffee> ^ serv files only (autoexec.cfg, etc)
23:34 < coffee> you should transpose for your case
23:34 < coffee> it's like a blockers serv
23:36 < coffee> coffee-morning.net/Iris.7z
23:36 < coffee> ^ the source code.. CFLAGS=-DINFECTZ bam server_release
23:37 < coffee> you should make your own maps, if you find the time
23:37 < coffee> coffee-morning.net/infzTheCaveMainVersion.map
23:37 < coffee> ^ the map unlocked for the editor Muttley
23:59 < Muttley> ty
23:59 < Muttley> hmm need to look into map maping
23:59 < Muttley> i dont have alot spare time ;-)
