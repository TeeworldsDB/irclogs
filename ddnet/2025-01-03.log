00:17 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Oh wow. Who said TeeUniverse? Its client and server code does not really exists but the editor is used for Infclass maps. I maintain a fork at https://github.com/infclass/teeuniverse and last year added a few video tutorials.
00:18 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Meh, I somehow misread teeverse. nvm then
00:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want the teeuniverse org xd
00:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> perfect space to host mods
00:29 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Yeah, and it was supposed to be something like that. But then the author had lost their energy and disappeared.
00:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I wish we could at least contact him for the name <.<
00:32 < bridge> <Kaffeine> BTW do you know if there is a place for teeworlds shared knowledge base? DDNet wiki is focused on ddnet (what a surprice). Teeworlds forum is dead, various fandom wiki, etc are dead.
00:32 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I could not find a resource with e.g. list of all known clients.
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am sure ddnet wiki would accept teeworlds content too, but not really, chilllerdragon probs has some repos where list of mods etc. are
00:33 < bridge> <Kaffeine> They do not respond. It seems that they registered the account (https://github.com/necropotame, and the same @gmail.com) exactly for this project.
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah alright
00:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Too bad üòÑ
00:33 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Yeah but those are focused on server mods.
00:57 < bridge> <headshotnoby> tee cinematic universe
01:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @0xdeen dunno if u saw, but really would like to add merge queue so i can just spam prs xd
01:25 < bridge> <zwelf2> Just because it is all content that exist right now. Feel free to use ddnet wiki for any teeworlds related content.
01:43 < bridge> <chairn> wait what ? you aren't in the ddnet group on github ?
01:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can change everything in ddnet repo
01:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not on new ones xD
01:46 < bridge> <chairn> wdym new ones ? like ddnet-web ?
01:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like ddnet-rs
01:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not even robyte can xD
01:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only owners of ddnet can
04:40 < bridge> <louis> 45 degree angle bind using 2 mouse distance -> just snapping in client
04:40 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324583173467799572/Screencast_From_2025-01-03_12-37-33_trimmed.mp4?ex=6778adb6&is=67775c36&hm=664104de0dff6cec0a63705aa74f0add104911027755d1db979176045b8ab298&
04:40 < bridge> <louis> someone tell me why it's a bad idea üòÖ
05:16 < bridge> <totar> what are you asking?
05:23 < bridge> <louis> i want a better solution to the 45 angle degree bind inside the client versus the hacky current bind
05:25 < bridge> <louis> the video shows smth like "snap your weapon fires to 45* when cl_snap_aim_45 1"
05:25 < bridge> <totar> it would be a little OP in gores if just rounded your mouse to the nearest 45 instead of the janky way it is now but maybe we don't care
05:26 < bridge> <louis> it would be easy to put in settings instead of having a custom bind for players' mousesens, but yeah it's a lot stronger than the current bind
05:27 < bridge> <totar> if it didn't have a chance of randomly giving you the wrong angle and it didn't reset your mouse position to the middle of your screen it would be really good for up down saves
05:27 < bridge> <totar> but ddnet is not gores so perhaps not a concern idk
05:29 < bridge> <louis> it would make some shotgun and laser inputs a lot easier in ddnet
05:30 < bridge> <totar> I think I lean towards make it an official feature and remove the jank even if it makes some stuff easier
05:30 < bridge> <totar> and then we don't have to maintain effectively a bug in the mouse cursor system
05:30 < bridge> <louis> im for removing the jank but also think it's very powerful
05:32 < bridge> <totar> as long as it doesn't remove some aspect of gameplay by trivializing it then I don't think it matters that it's powerful because everyone will have it
05:32 < bridge> <totar> dummy is a thing that exists
05:33 < bridge> <totar> this is like 1% as powerful
05:33 < bridge> <totar> dummy is a thing that exists, which we added
05:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i woke up
06:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @louis.place done, it's unintended.
06:55 < bridge> <louis> ah nice, i dont remember reporting it though üòÖ \
06:58 < bridge> <louis> also this pr will conflict with yours üò¨
07:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can safely remove all code in `src/game/client/components/players.cpp`
07:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> your settings really shouldn't touch visual code, visual code not matching control is a bug, and should make it match instead of patching visual for special cases. if you remove your changes in players.cpp we don't conflict and the angle will snap with both pr
07:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can safely remove all changes in `src/game/client/components/players.cpp`
07:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i count this as you reporting it https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1324583174197481606. cuz it is very related to the input rollback
07:21 < bridge> <louis> hm but i only snapped the input x/y instead of mousePos. if I snap mousePos won't the cursor ingame also snap? im not too sure
07:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i don't understand
07:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you don't need to snap mousepos
07:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oh i get it now
07:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> let me think
07:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can make it happen without special handling.
07:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @louis.place mind if i just take over the PR? for 19.0 i'm assuming, cuz i'm still fixing 18.9's bugs
07:24 < bridge> <louis> yeah i dont mind
07:25 < bridge> <louis> my thing was just a proof of concept thing. should probably get some approval on it though
07:25 < bridge> <louis> it really makes the angle bind a lot stronger
07:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye
07:44 < bridge> <0xdeen> @realfail Thank you!
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I personally capture with tcpdump and then open the pcap file with wireshark
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice told you the dissector is op

08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-headless-clients
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Kaffeine: teeworlds.com forum posts is the way to go imo. It‚Äôs still a thing.
09:01 < bridge> <alw5> i am not a fan with this  must be a bug or something
09:01 < bridge> <alw5> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324648932097134644/DDNet_7Bzr7P0g2P.png?ex=6778eaf4&is=67779974&hm=9a44e28b073216719c6ff466608551bda00802dcc4c89f5d32cb2494843874a3&
09:03 < bridge> <alw5> i actually hate this
09:03 < bridge> <alw5> Please remove or add a way to remove it
09:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> have you tried adjusting the zoom by pressing plus or minus
09:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think the problem would be the layout being always there xd
09:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> like, maybe it can fade out a few seconds later
09:27 < bridge> <alw5> yeah
09:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i don't know why you would care but sure i can do that
09:28 < bridge> <alw5> and a way to hide it fully
09:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the indicator?
09:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> or the feature
09:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for better visibility + rather would watch the gameplay more
09:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> many games do that cuz players don't like to watch UI all the time!
09:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> removing the indicator better means the feature is gone
09:28 < bridge> <alw5> what are you guys talking about
09:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> removing the indicator AFTER you show them for a few seconds, helps.
09:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the auto indicator means you are currently watching other players camera settings (zoom + dyncam)
09:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and showing the indicator again AFTER a change in zoom changes, helps too
09:29 < bridge> <alw5> i see
09:29 < bridge> <alw5> but i dont want to know that
09:29 < bridge> <alw5> well i dont wanna see the indicator
09:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you zoom out it will turn off, i can hide the indicator after you turn it off
09:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @tsfreddie is there a command to disable visibility on that UI specificaly?
09:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @tsfreddie is there a command to disable visibility on that UI specifically?
09:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no
09:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bad
09:30 < bridge> <alw5> in rocket league there is a "ballcam indicator" that tells you you are in ballcam
09:30 < bridge> <alw5> i turn that off
09:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> config is usually heavy restricted to add
09:30 < bridge> <alw5> i just wanna hide it
09:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, you could usually use a command in F1 manually, or inside the options, if there would be any implementation of it
09:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or even with a hotkey bind, like the debug UI with CTRL SHIFT D
09:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> As a fellow designer, this is bad to not allow users to toggle visibility on new UI, if they don't like it, that is why feedback is appreciated in that matter
09:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can add that but i need an essay to get it approved
09:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> please do, even if not the fade-out thing I recommended, but at least a way to toggle visibility on that if players don't want it to see. üôè
09:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A what? Not feedback?
09:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i need to write an detailed explaination or heinrich usually vetos any config
09:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the ball cam thing i get, but you are literally not playing the game during spectating so i really don't see why you would care.
09:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i can do that
09:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> for you
09:35 < bridge> <louis> there's a command to hide HUD, does that not include the auto sign?
09:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> should be
09:35 < bridge> <louis> just use that then
09:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @heinrich5991 Can we make the new UI's visibility toggleable with a command, since other different UIs, like the debug UI and detailed movement UI (on the right side) can be toggled?
09:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @tsfreddie idk why are you afraid to ask him here
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm not
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i said i will try to do that
09:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :owo:
09:37 < bridge> <louis> how do i even activate auto spec
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it usually happens in PR
09:37 < bridge> <alw5> just spec someone
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> idk why heinrich would care if it is not in code
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> reset zoom while spectating. or right click
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i am in the middle of adding a button to the esc menu
09:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so that might be more obvious
09:38 < bridge> <louis> i cant get it to work
09:38 < bridge> <louis> do i need to eb in spectators or just in /pause?
09:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if heinrich doesn't care on what the users, in this case Players want, or he wouldn't care on the consistency on how different UIs worked in the client, then... eh
09:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oh, if you don't have the indicator is it not available
09:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it is only available for 18.9 players
09:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I might as well just try developing my own client faster
09:39 < bridge> <louis> hm, if i can see their cursor does that mean i should be able to get the auto spec?
09:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> cursor is older
09:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> 18.x has cursor info already
09:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> way before
09:39 < bridge> <louis> ah
09:40 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it was just shown in 18.9
09:41 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw if you can code why not just PR yourself. i am still working on others things so it might take awhile
09:42 < bridge> <alw5> i feel like if you can hide other stuff you should be able to hide htis
09:42 < bridge> <alw5> i feel like if you can hide other stuff you should be able to hide this
09:42 < bridge> <alw5> in a perfect world every element should be toggleable in  the console
09:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> more like, every category of visible elements should be, like different UIs which are overlapping the basic UI or camera
09:48 < ChillerDragon> @0xfaulty @fokkonaut where do you store state of minigames? i am currently implementing block 1vs1 and wonder where i store the current score.
09:49 < ChillerDragon> i currently went with allocating a state struct and letting all participants point to it but only the first participant frees it but it feels super messy.
09:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well, store it where it's being used, by the minigame
09:50 < ChillerDragon> but if multiple minigames of the same type run how do i match it to the players
09:51 < ChillerDragon> i have one minigame instance that handles all 1vs1's 
09:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> structs and arrays and saving participant ids?
09:51 < ChillerDragon> do you create multiple minigame instances? hmm i see
09:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no
09:52 < ChillerDragon> where do you store participant ids?
09:52 < bridge> <louis> oh, it's part of the following box, i thought it was on its own somewhere
09:52 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324661776649818152/391256347-6a03219b-ceec-4cb3-92af-8737969e1457.png?ex=6778f6ea&is=6777a56a&hm=b408211583c6a605a59333bb2b76f219b7308b8efc3b681f04d73ee4e89463ab&
09:53 < bridge> <louis> you want to hide the tiny orange box?
09:53 < bridge> <alw5> mhm
09:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> sometimes i dont understand you xd how is this difficult to you right now xD
09:53 < bridge> <alw5> idk it feels so out of place
09:53 < bridge> <alw5> its orange
09:53 < bridge> <alw5> distracting
09:54 < ChillerDragon> i just cant envison your code right now 
09:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i have a Minigame component which has hooks for events and basically does everything inside that component
09:55 < ChillerDragon> the structs hold the participant ids and their game state and then you push a new struct into the array if a new game starts? and then to process a tick you iterate all sructs and read/write the state?
09:55 < ChillerDragon> ye i have the same :)
09:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that component has arrays of structs for multi rooms
09:55 < bridge> <louis> yeah, maybe it can be reduced to a single icon or a less contrasting color, but in no world should there be a config variable to enable or disable it being there
09:55 < ChillerDragon> and in every hook you iterate all rooms?
09:55 < bridge> <alw5> why not
09:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why push? just a static array works aswell
09:56 < ChillerDragon> idk i just assume all of your code is vectors at all times :D
09:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> config variables for config variables when?
09:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> basically, but especially with a static array size you can save the index in the character maybe
09:56 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat wdym?
09:56 < bridge> <louis> cus then there's no indicator of whether you're in auto spec or not, and sometimes it may get confusing as to if you have the icon enabled or not, or if you're just spectating someone with the same zoom configuration as you
09:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
09:56 < ChillerDragon> which character in a 1v1 @fokkonaut
09:56 < ChillerDragon> there are two
09:56 < bridge> <louis> if you want to spectate without any interruptions just disable the entire hud
09:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk wym
09:57 < ChillerDragon> ah red it wrong xd
09:57 < ChillerDragon> ye save the index in the character is what i do conceptually right now but i malloc and free not static hmm
09:58 < ChillerDragon> maybe i should just go stack allocated like i always have been
09:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i do iterate always btw
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> true
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> maybe its just how it look
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> maybe its just how it looks
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> if it was just white
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> it stands out
09:58 < ChillerDragon> cool thanks @fokkonaut 
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> it wouldnt stand out
09:58 < bridge> <alw5> and wouldnt distract me
09:59 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i would like enum likes config vars with string values the user can choose from a set list
09:59 < ChillerDragon> i use so many magic numbers in my configs its horrible
09:59 < ChillerDragon> and free form string vars are a mess 
10:00 < bridge> <totar> if you make the config a string enum you can never change the strings in the enum
10:00 < ChillerDragon> not sure what you mean
10:01 < bridge> <totar> it makes it more difficult to modify the functionality of the config because it will reset saved settings
10:01 < ChillerDragon> i would for example like to have sv_gametype only accept the strings "ddnet" and "mod" and autocomplete it for the user
10:02 < bridge> <totar> but it's probably not that bad of an idea
10:02 < bridge> <totar> I guess users can just deal with it
10:02 < ChillerDragon> i mean you can always use a string and then have a conchain yelling at the user
10:03 < ChillerDragon> but i dont like strcmp to check config values i prefer == 
10:03 < ChillerDragon> iterating every character in strcmp of the 1000 configs on tick sounds expensive
10:04 < ChillerDragon> so user facing its a strictly restricted list and also in the code its represented as a enum class
10:33 < bridge> <0xfaulty> In mini game instance, I have abstract class for all mini games with all needed

11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @syrinok
11:32 < bridge> <syrinok> I can see people thinking that's a screenshot button lol
11:33 < bridge> <syrinok> But the mouseover tooltip explains it, so maybe a non-issue
11:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> fml
11:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> as soon as they click it and it goes red slashy they'll know
11:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> please test as soon as the artifact is available tho, it is a pretty big change and RC doesn't last long
11:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw why can't github just allow you to upload a bigger video, 10m is like nothing.
11:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> also i forgot to eat
11:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it's 6:30pm
11:41 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @learath2 curious how the http reg is going
11:43 < bridge> <eidderFsT> I just found out momentcap's cancel logic is too strict. if you are almost done we can maybe do another server update?
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> I transplanted the modern http module in there. Got it compiling. I also replaced CRegister but didn't get it registering yet. Hopefully tonight ü§û
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> Had to leave to see a relative
12:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no worries
12:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> just wondering if we can avoid restarting the server twice
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not, is there a harm in restarts?
12:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the map is pretty huge and the secret takes time to get, we might kill their progress
12:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> there are like always people in there too since we only host one server for the entire globe lol
12:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Could set a password 30-60 minutes before planning to restart
12:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> right
12:15 < bridge> <zaer1n> @blaiszephyr how can I use the new tclient version until the new one merges to nixpkgs?
12:15 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, getting to jetpack is probably annoying for most people in the playerbase, restart would hurt
12:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i haven't tried to get it myself is it like really hard
12:16 < bridge> <zaer1n> Always get 404 not found error for src overlays
12:16 < bridge> <8_9z> there is one blocl race in v3
12:16 < bridge> <8_9z> i have demo
12:17 < bridge> <8_9z> ..
12:17 < bridge> <syrinok> You mostly just need to know how to do it, I would rate getting to jetpack a medium / low moderate part
12:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm fairly sure i mentioned that before :kek:
12:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> overlays! final and pre
12:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that's hard for me

12:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @0xdeen I changed how canceling capture works in momentcap, the previous condition is a bit too strict, if you got time could you set password and schedule a restart after like 60 minutes?
12:19 < bridge> <zaer1n> ```nix

12:26 < bridge> <0xdeen> if i set password no one can join for 60 min and lots of people will complain on discord. I'll just restart it

13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cmake .. -DSTEAM=ON
13:14 < bridge> <totar> it doesn't work
13:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> if i compiled with 
13:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
13:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> cmake -DSTEAM=ON .. 
13:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> is it a problem ?
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
13:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like the two ".."
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, ask cmake dev xd
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but props no
13:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Basically I'm not on Linux, that's why....
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that has nothing todo with linux
13:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but I think it worked
13:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I have never compiled things in C++ *
13:16 < bridge> <totar> my question had nothing to do with whatever you're doing you can ignore it
13:18 < bridge> <totar> have you tested this? It seems to do nothing but add -steam to the client version
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I haven't dunno any better then tbh
13:20 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ```

13:21 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> hum ':) can someone pls explain me how can i resolve this ':)
13:22 < bridge> <zhn> probably you are trying to GetFloat when a row member has another type
13:22 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh
13:22 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> imma check
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> maybe the date ?
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i put the date on float
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i think
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> because some date need texts

13:27 < bridge> <zhn> wait you are working with unmodified ddnet sources/db, right?
13:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> wdym
13:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i recompiled ddnet with SQL = ON or something
13:29 < bridge> <zhn> i mean you didn't add anything from you in code
13:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> no
13:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> only in "gamemode" maybe
13:31 < bridge> <zhn> did you make any function call to db from yours part
13:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nope
13:32 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> only thing i edited is the database

17:10 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> mariadb from 11.4.3-MariaDB, client 15.2 for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
17:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and latest code from ddnet repo?
17:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
17:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
17:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can you send server commands you used to make ddnet use your sql server(remove ur ip and other personal stuff)
17:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver r ddnet_db record ddnet "" 
17:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> add_sqlserver w ddnet_db record ddnet ""
17:18 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> when sql is on i can't connect dummy and vote map and only one person can join or else server crash
17:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why these bugs never happen to me :feelsbadman:
17:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> lool lucky
17:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe because I don't try to host gores servers
17:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> or maybe smarter
17:19 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> idk i think it would be same for me
17:20 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like sv game type isn't working too

17:21 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh
17:22 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i have an idea why
17:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ```
17:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 2025-01-03 16:23:11 I server: ClientId=0 rcon='dump_sqlservers w'

17:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> in rcon
17:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> idk
17:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> fishy
17:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i have no idea ':)
17:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm not a sql expert but i can check where the connection is created
17:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
17:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw are you intended to use sqlite for backup
17:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nope
17:25 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> on my cfg i don't have "sv_sqlite_file"
17:25 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> idk  why there is a backup file
17:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvUseSql, sv_use_sql, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Enables MySQL backend instead of SQLite backend (sv_sqlite_file is still used as fallback write server when no MySQL server is reachable)")`
17:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> maybe sqlite is required, but eitherway, that statement running off mysql instead of sqlite is weird
17:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> idk
17:27 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> what should i check
17:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> nothing. i'm just talking to myself and maybe other devs so we could figure it out
17:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sounds like a code bug really
17:28 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh
17:28 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> so i can't do anything right
17:28 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> or maybe i did a dumb error somewhere
17:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> should've used mongodb, it's webscale
17:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> maybe. but i've never setup mysql servers so i can't really help config wise
17:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> everyone said mariadb ':)
17:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the mongodb comment is a joke btw
17:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey
17:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ugh ok
17:29 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ':)
17:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> should've used SurrealDB
17:30 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ..
17:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> has anyone build mysql support on windows :justatest:
17:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> or should I not even try
17:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i am on linux btw
17:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, but i'm on windows and i'm trying to debug it
17:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and this seems to be working
17:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324777114825920522/image.png?ex=67796255&is=677810d5&hm=eb17ed45d18729bb1edf2ea434a27959aa94215eccdc5bbf3dd19d5816264b79&
17:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> oh thx
17:32 < bridge> <woidless> Which file contains the function responsible for creating the console command?
17:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> any file really
17:33 < bridge> <teero777> on the client?
17:33 < bridge> <teero777> dafuq are u talking about xD
17:33 < bridge> <teero777> wait
17:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you should probably just do a search for `Console()->Register("`
17:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that's what i'm talking about
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> classic wavpack error when was trying to compile server üò¨

17:34 < bridge> <teero777> its declared in some file thats how i understood his question
17:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest: now i'm confused
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Try to reconfigure cmake, the close function is only available when `CONF_WAVPACK_CLOSE_FILE` which depends on which wavpack version you have, I think
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Try to reconfigure cmake, the close function is only available when `CONF_WAVPACK_CLOSE_FILE` is defined which depends on which wavpack version you have, I think
17:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill try it later, for now i just disabled client compilation xd
17:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you maybe talking about `void CGameContext::OnConsoleInit()`  in src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp maybe?
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> changing these files can make a crash
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src/game/server/gamemodes
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ?
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like i changed one of these files
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but i don't think it can cause the crash
17:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you mean the sql crash?
17:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> probably not
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
17:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey
17:50 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> then imma wait
18:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what's `Prefix` in `add_sqlserver    s['r'|'w'] s[Database] s[Prefix] s[User] s[Password] s[IP] i[Port] ?i[SetUpDatabase ?]`
18:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> like `record` in record_race table name
18:08 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> recor
18:08 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> d
18:08 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have some serious skill issues. I can connect using mariadb client, like so `mariadb -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -proot ddnet`, but 
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> add_sqlserver r ddnet record root 'root' 127.0.0.1 3306
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> add_sqlserver w ddnet record root 'root' 127.0.0.1 3306 1
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> doesn't work xd
18:10 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> without the ' i think
18:10 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> try with "
18:10 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like for me it work like that
18:10 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> try without
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it worked xdd
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks
18:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> hehe
18:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> <3
18:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it works for me
18:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> without crashing -.-
18:12 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> what is your mariadb version ?
18:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we can literally reverse engineer this to improve our antibot!
18:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 11.4.3
18:13 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah same
18:13 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ..
18:13 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but it doesn't work with me :c
18:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
18:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i have this thing
18:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> did you need to trigger it or it just crashes on launch?
18:14 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> trigger it
18:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> by doing what?
18:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> joining dummy
18:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> someone else joining the server
18:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> changing map by voting
18:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> finishing a map
18:15 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and sometimes it pop out while playing
18:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> could you ad for game layer possibility to ctrl+scroll blocks ?
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> example from 35 to 59 , or even all posibilitys ?
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> like in teleports !?
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> could you ad for game layer possibility to ctrl+scroll blocks ?
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> example from 35 to 59 , or even all posibilitys ? (time cp's blocks )
18:16 < bridge> <texnonik> like in teleports !?
18:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye it was fine on my machine too
18:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
18:30 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ah
18:30 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> maybe i am the problem
18:30 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> :pepeW:
18:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> did you try to login to your mariadb server using a mariadb client or some other tools
18:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> to see if the table is created
18:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> mysql -u ddnet -p
18:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and that worked?
18:31 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
18:32 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and it's not on local i think
18:32 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324792487130300579/image.png?ex=677970a6&is=67781f26&hm=342f274e5934576d2d0c69354e71e08a672d73b0b3d62f63badca9682972ea0b&
18:32 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like i changed it
18:33 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> to 0.0.0.0
18:33 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> somewhere but i forgot name
18:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is this on the same machine as the database?
18:33 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
18:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> have you tried to connect it remotely using a mysql client too
18:34 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nope
18:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> try that maybe
18:34 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ok
18:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest: but even then the server really shouldn't crash tho
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah idk
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> it only crashes when sql is activated
18:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like even if you have a connection problem or something
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Yes
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> it's weird
18:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it's 1:35am for me, i should sleep tho.
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okay
18:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> good luck i guess lol
18:35 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Good night

18:39 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I think that's where the problem comes from

23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought other sounds like it's not related to ddnet xD
23:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh god, dont tell chillerdragon :justatest:  - so it's fine if i do that?
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am ok with that yeah
23:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> perfect, i'll get on it then
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but note that i dont _really_ want to lock the rust version
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think rustup is quite cool because it makes it easy to install latest rust
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as easy as installing it over a pkg manager
23:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> i could just not ship a .lock file then, so everyone evaluates to the latest nixpkgs version when using it
