05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @uwu
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm you can communicate a lot of things with these numbers
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1312
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we kinda did
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its growing out of control
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Omagawd can someone explain ddnet UI code to me? Is there some beginner docs on it? Can we switch to html and CSS \:troll\:
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i always mess up things real good

10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im down to choose a time to go through them together, or just prioritize things
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> actually if someone will read my close requests xd
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> <a🆒773232479191957524>
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is already hook blockers
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boi> wow @Learath2 you are the greatest developer ever!
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: How does oauth based sso stop the end site from "mitm"ing the authentication site? E.g. malicioussite.com lets you authenticate with google, how do you know the new site it opens is google?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw most sites like google, you are alreayd logged in
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its only a matter of allowing
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i have to enter credentials
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should check the url
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how else to prevent this
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is why when u login with steam on 3rd party sites, its recommended u login on steam first
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see this recommended always
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, sounds rather janky. Such an undetectable attack too
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> once google chrome warned me about redirecting to not oauth2 thingie of some service
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oath2 requires ssl too
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I never liked the idea of SSO anyway
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oauth also requires all tokens be associated to ips and only be valid for very short durations. How many people do you think enforce this? :P
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :p
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u login against some service dont u always get a short lived token?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess in this case the best way to do oauth2 inside a game is to open a native browser
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i never tried oauth itself
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only do jwt for myself
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got a rather long lived token from stackexchange, e.g.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/873584346722885673/authorization-code.png
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from google
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That arrow from the user is controlled by your app is where I fail to see any protection against
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess as you said your best bet would be to only allow already logged in accounts
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> @Learath2 are you still on vacation?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Omw back, did something break again? :WoJak:
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> ofc
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats that emote
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah me seeing c++ code :monkalaugh:
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok joke joke
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524847485487939585/865261452577996800/image0.gif
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> can move maps with commands, and old maps still there.. should be already in the archive
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 haver u ever made something only using c++20 modules?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> cant move maps with commands, and old maps still there.. should be already in the archive
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Perfect. Nothing better to ruin my day after a vacation, messing around with the stupid discord bot
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i can help with the bot
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was all relaxed too, got some sun, got to enjoy the sea
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho im not familiar with the codebase
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then BAM, python
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> submit working
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> but the commands and archive yes
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> submit and create new channels working
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> but the commands and archive 😄
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will be back in 2.5h, then I can take a look at logs
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> ok
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> maps should be after 1 week in the archive
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/321058698023796736/873225651623198740
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> commands from patiga still working ($optimize etc)
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only got to toy around with C++20 for now. Maybe if a project comes up I might give it a go
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porling> does anyone know what value the in-game timer has?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porling> does anyone know what address the in-game timer has?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Address? Like an offset? What are you even making?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porling> yeah i mean an offset
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doubt anyone'd have any idea, you'll need to figure it out yourself. Since you have access to the source it should be trivial, just print it out on the console
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga do you have a minute? 🙂
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea :)
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you help me test again? I need you to remove your testing role and react green check on a map or two
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's quite annoying to test with the admin role
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sure, sec
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh god, it's broken again
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I can only successfully check the most recent map (orange_2)
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here I go again need to inject mitmproxy in there to figure out what damn permission is causing the issue
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :/
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga can you try adding a reaction again on one that didn't work
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they still don't work
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's supposed to be adding a singular overwrite, and I can add it manually
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I view the server as that role
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah okay, can't avoid injecting the proxy
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shame
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :c
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga can you give it another go please?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> still the same
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't mind the testing at all :)
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so silly, it's making the request I think it should be making yet something is causing missing permissions
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga which map did you try?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I am trying the most recent one and the three above it
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you try just carebear?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> eh, same behavior sorta?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it popped up once, but only after I tried it, was that your doing?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (also disappeared again)
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that was me trying with the bots permissions to grant the same override
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I think this is a discord bug
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ouch
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> did you also see the log btw? those errors looked like the most generic thing ever
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> from https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes:
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > 5xx (SERVER ERROR)    The server had an error processing your request (these are rare).0    General error (such as a malformed request body, amongst other things)
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> meh formatted badly
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> imagine a line break before the 0
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T> the 500s I didn't check yet
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T> where did you get a 500?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `discord.errors.DiscordServerError: 500 Internal Server Error (error code: 0): 500: Internal Server Error`
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> after some exceptions on commands
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the bot.log
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay gave the bot broader permissions, can you try the checkmarks again?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently if the bot doesn't have "View channels" on the broader category it can't grant permissions on the subchannels even if it has "View channel" on them
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> works perfectly now, nice! 👍
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 bug down 50 to go 😄
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, next up the 5xxs
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what a mess
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it was the waiting command that caused a 500
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think a $reset also caused it at least once
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> waiting seems to be also fixed by the permission thing
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there any that needs a reset where I can try that one?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you can play with #🎉caterpillar2
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (but first decline it)
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nice
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, that's also fixed, I guess discord had a backend change, these companies and their undocumented changes...
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I guess that leaves the archiving thing
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i guess those `Websocket closed with 1006, attempting a reconnect.` are also fixed then? ^^
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only god knows that one 😛
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's actually rather complicated to resume a bot, so if there is a bug in that I really don't think I have the energy to dig into discord.py
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we could maybe watch the log for the bot getting stuck and just restarting it
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sounds fair 👌
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh, is there any good way to install ubuntu from ssd on this same ssd without pain in ass
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's quite annoying to do
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually it's so annoying to do that I'd suggest you go dig for a usb 😄
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's literally 130 km ahead
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, the key is the `toram` parameter if you want to try it, you need to unpack the iso properly into a partition, edit some magic config things I no longer remember and boot to that partition using the toram flag
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which will load the entire image into the ram so you can then overwrite the ssd safely
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh good
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> need to lurk a bit more
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks 👍
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i did another partition with unpacked iso and booted it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and now it's formatting new partitions after boot one
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> aaand
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it stuck
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uh oh is it good to hard reload my machine to reformat everything
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without the toram flag it will break
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so if you booted without `toram` you just bricked your computer 😛
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no way
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (well not bricked per se, but no way to fix it without a usb)
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> toram loads the entire image into ram when booting, so it's fine to overwrite the ssd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> without it when you overwrite the partition table badthings(tm) happen :/
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks again xd
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or maybe you got very lucky and it only sort of broke) 😛
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you gimme an example? Seems the bot checks for 60 days not 1 week
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's for waiting
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Archive = 1 week
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ah sorry I mean 1 week no aktivity = archive
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ah sorry I mean 1 week no activity = archive
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ah sorry I mean 1 week no activity = archive @Learath2
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, do you have an example of a map that should be archived? @Cøke
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't send a message in it so it doesn't get active again
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks @Learath2! 
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's:
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> faster
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> easier
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no need at another drive
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> new warrior of home servers is ready to use
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> @Learath2 #🆙🏁run_jellyfish_fields
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> And much more
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thank jesus, figured it out
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> more missing folders entirely breaking the bot without a single error in sight...
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it will take a bit to catch up to the backlog though so give it a minute
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> 👍
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like it caught up
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> somewhy this (in `CCharacter::HandleTiles`)  does nothing
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/873672680568668250/unknown.png
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> look up references to m_TileIndex
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```cpp
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> int MapIndex = Index;
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> m_TileIndex = GameServer()->Collision()->GetTileIndex(MapIndex);```
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bcs no one sends tile_air to this function
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now take a look at GetTileIndex
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> only -1, >0
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, actually I don't remember filtering `TILE_AIR`
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> look up TileExists
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it checks every range of tiles
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> unless 0
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, we double check the index, I see
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @uwu come here our little prince
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> have you pushed your quad tree onto them yet
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i messed up whole codebase and started to doing 2xp again
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
