09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> ddnet 12.9 best
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @triki missing permissions to update/open files? Just try downloading a fresh client
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my client doesnt start anymore after the latest update, error:
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> DDNet: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (`ddnet` package from the aur)
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you rebuilt the package?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> not sure
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try doing that (for packages from the AUR)
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> > @triki missing permissions to update/open files? Just try downloading a fresh client
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @deen ye i did it  and it is helped for me.
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i usually just skip the dialogs given by yay
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you might need a rebuild even if there was no update to ddnet itself, but to the libraries
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah wait i think i remember cancelling the update
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 1 sec
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> <food>
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so when asked
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > Packages to cleanBuild?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i should answer ye?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> eh after updating normally everything works again üëç
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga this is expected with the aur since you won't get an automatic rebuild once a lib was updated
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah thanks, didnt know that :)
22:57 <+ChillerDragon> Uhm where are mapfiles ignored in the repo? Or how are they not tracked in my build/ directoryy https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1588884950.png
22:59 <@deen> ChillerDragon: do you have build in your .git/info/exclude file?
23:01 <+ChillerDragon> oh what is this magic?
23:02 <@deen> like a .gitignore file but local for your repo
23:02 <+ChillerDragon> nah its empty
23:02 <+ChillerDragon> i assume its the !/data line 
23:02 <+ChillerDragon> but i have the same line in my repo and maps still get tracked
23:03 <@deen> well you can still force add it
23:03 <@deen> actually it's the data/ line
23:03 <@deen> which says to ignore every data directory
23:03 <@deen> and !/data/ then says to NOT ignore the one in the root
23:04 <+ChillerDragon> yea but i also have the data line
23:05 <@deen> you can still force add a data directory and then everything in it is tracked
23:05 <+ChillerDragon> Ah ok im stoopid my maps are in build/maps not build/data/maps
