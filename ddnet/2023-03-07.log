00:44 < bridge> <Avolicious> Agreed with TU München & ETH Zürich
08:58 <+ChillerDragon> @Avolicious wot do you live in munich? o.O
09:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ZIEHT DEN BAYERN DIE LEDERHOSEN AUS

09:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> No, but I was 1 semester at TU München, due to erasmus 😄
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> did you use the slides?
10:54 < bridge> <Avolicious> No 😦 it was during the pandemic...
10:54 < bridge> <Avolicious> No 😦 it was during the peak pandemic...
10:58 < bridge> <Avolicious> No 😦 it was during the peak pandemic... ( so zoom/ms teams and bbb only ). One thing I'd have to mention is that Big Blue Button is crap, please never use it
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bbb lmai
10:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> worst shir
10:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You are the only person in this conference
11:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> yo vim pros wat i do if vim syntax highlight breaks on basic bash script :(
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1678183246.png
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> try :e
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> didnt help wat it do
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> ok it works in neovim :D guess ill use neovim just for this file then lmao
11:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Is it weird that I miss null-terminated strings in rust?
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> wow exiting visual mode is hard in neovim its soooo different than vanilla vim
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> no null terminated strings are awesome
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> rust strings are bloat
11:46 < bridge> <Learath2> It's quite useful to be able to iterate one past the end of a string, makes tokenizers and stuff so pretty
11:47 < bridge> <Learath2> e.g. with null terminated strings treating the null as a whitespace is enough
11:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its weird
11:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> strings with a length u know before are way way better
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tokenizers in rust are easy too, slices are so powerfull
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> check this out
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't want to generate lexers, I'm talking about making them from scratch
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Yes, I know your fancy space age technology is faster than what I can write by hand
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can u give an example for an iteration
11:58 < bridge> <Learath2> Not really, I was working on it a couple days ago, just thought about it now. I already remade it in terms of iterators
12:00 < bridge> <Learath2> It just needs special handling for getting a None out of `Iterator::next` not too complicated. Just made me think of iterating past the end and null termination
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can't really think of a real use case. Maybe saving strings to binary or network to save a few bytes
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> good that u know
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :WinkWink:

13:20 < bridge> <Ninjed> Try to set your headphones in windows sound mixer first, then start the game, should help
13:20 < bridge> <nothing> already did
13:21 < bridge> <Ninjed> Idk, try to restart pc lol
13:22 < bridge> <nothing> ^
13:22 < bridge> <Ninjed> Then it's unrepairable :gigachad:
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anything in the logs?
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe anti virus running that blocks it?
13:24 < bridge> <nothing> lemme find logs
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But the headset works?:lol:
13:26 < bridge> <nothing> uhm where do i find them
13:26 < bridge> <nothing> yeah headset works everywhere except ddnet
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> F1
13:26 < bridge> <nothing> 200iq
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else i guess we need to improve the error logging for sound failure, i didn't see this very often yet

13:28 < bridge> <nothing> logitech g pro x
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then I can only assume some app is disallowing ddnet actively

13:29 < bridge> <nothing> yeah
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anti virus?
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe one of these
13:30 < bridge> <nothing> nope
13:30 < bridge> <nothing> turned both off still doesnt work
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I assume a setting in Logitech app
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is saved inside the headset
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else search in the internet, you can't be the only one
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or call Logitech support
13:31 < bridge> <nothing> ill look around
13:33 < bridge> <nothing> hmm might be dac issue
13:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> switch to linux and use pipewire
13:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
13:50 < bridge> <Ravie> the broken popups have been annoying me for a while since I always close the ui when working on stuff so I was hoping it would get fixed properly in the next update, but why remove them completely? this got broken in one of the recent updates and worked fine before, and even vanilla (0.6 and 0.7) has this functionality
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Write in github
14:06 < bridge> <Ravie> under the pr or new issue?
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess as a staring point in the pr. Since u want to veto it if I got u right
14:11 < bridge> <Ravie> well I want the popups to work again and not get removed at all because they broke recently
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah I read that as a veto to remove them
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And if robyte won't fix it in the pr create new issue for ur real issue
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can also create an issue and link it in the pr. Doesn't matter xd
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But u guess write smth in pr so it didn't get merged
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But i guess write smth in pr so it didn't get merged
14:18 < bridge> <Ravie> it already has xd
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh mb
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then create an issue
19:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> X-Speed bleibt positiv, aber position ändert sich nicht, hmm
19:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082726128843755582/screenshot_2023-03-07_19-06-28.png
19:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> okay, x-speed ist so klein, dass das weggerundet wird 😮
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry i dont speak german
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pls dont use german in this chat
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> #off-topic
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its highly rude
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> based
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> GERMANY
19:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> saying speakin german is highly rude is rude, sorry usually i only speak english, i have a problem with context switching sometimew
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is rude to the others
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> who dont understand german
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont think only about urself
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so no, saying speaking german is rude is not rude on itself
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and idc if u dont usually speak english
19:47 < bridge> <Chairn> i believe it happens when you got long lines that are truncated by the viewport
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think you miss understood him.
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Usually he speaks english, but he has a problem with context switching and even apologized :/
20:56 <+ChillerDragon> ofc the german jopstar stepping in for fello germans
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i am ausruhender Drache fan
20:57 <+ChillerDragon> xd
21:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah germans smh
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems that you were against being called rude. AssassinTee probably also felt that way, especially given that it was a mistake
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> the dude that made homebrew is now building a blockchain package manager to make it even slower than brew :D
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> somehow its still interesting im not sure tho what to think about this https://github.com/teaxyz/cli#teacli-0249
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> it installs commands it does not know automatically
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> its like the ubuntu/mac way of "mimimi git is not installed but you can run this command to install it" in more intense.
22:05 < bridge> <AssassinTee> sometimes i speak english to germans for hours in chat 🙃
22:34 < bridge> <Chairn> meanwhile in France, we speak french even when there are non french speakers at the table 😄
22:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I just noticed a bug with the new zoom feature, I managed to slow down the editor into freezing
22:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> use this values (just a high zoom value) and zoom out of the editor (mousewheel), remember to press the Zoom button above
22:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082782694565498880/screenshot_2023-03-07_22-51-04.png
22:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> If you set it even higher your game might crash
22:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> Can confirm. Can you open an issue?
22:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes
