02:45 <+bridge> <spur> who coded the ddnet bot?
02:45 <+bridge> <spur> the discord one
02:57 <+bridge> <Iza> i think murpi
07:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I think jao
07:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> original jao
07:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> A browser \:p
07:48 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
07:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a browser is harder than anything
07:52 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ikr
07:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> U know serenityOS ? There is a lot on yt about it and those madlads do it all from scratch. OS, libc, JavaScript, css, browser, terminal, shell, gimp etc
07:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> what does this os has to offer that others dont
07:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> like in terms of other linux os systems
08:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> it’s more of a statement & proof of concept
08:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> it’s a very immature os
08:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel many things arent done for something
08:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel programming is art
08:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
08:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> so true
08:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its more beautiful when done with rust too :justatest:
08:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> such detail in memory safety :brownbear:
08:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nahhhh nothing will ever beat the natural beauty of =[](){}
08:49 <+bridge> <Voxel> 10000 updoots
08:49 <+bridge> <Voxel> [ Everyone liked that ]
08:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur obsessed with leddit lately
08:49 <+bridge> <Voxel> no u
08:50 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats besides the point
08:50 <+bridge> <Voxel> when whats the use
08:50 <+bridge> <Voxel> then whats the use
08:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dude
08:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u make art for a "use"?
08:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> its use is to get rather someone else or myself feel better
08:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> something and use are similar in this context
08:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> but again barely anyone cares and i hate my art
08:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> then expect the author the same
08:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> except im sure they proud
08:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
08:53 <+bridge> <Voxel> of course they are, they're dedicated linux users
08:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nothing more chad than saying i made my own os
08:53 <+bridge> <Voxel> templeos
08:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think u misunderstood
08:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> serenityos is not linux
08:54 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats surprising
08:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its a self made os
08:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> yea i understand now
08:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not a linux distro
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller u know about redox?
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> these madlads do it all from scratch
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> instead of libc there is a standard rust library
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz the os is made with rust
08:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> and im gonna try and sleep now
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Rust programs implicitly or explicitly call functions in the Rust standard library (libstd).
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>     The Rust libstd now includes an implementation of its system-dependent parts (such as file access and setting environment variables) for Redox, in src/libstd/sys/redox. Most of libstd works in Redox, so many command-line Rust programs can be compiled for Redox.
08:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> i read that as the Rust libtard
08:59 <+bridge> <Voxel> wait i dont think i can say that here
08:59 <+bridge> <Voxel> whstever
08:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> sweet
08:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> do they have libc emulation
09:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> or maybe they will just implement it alongside if/when they want/need it for other program compat…
09:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
09:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Redox includes a Rust implementation of the Standard C library called relibc. This is how programs such as Git can run on Redox. relibc has some POSIX compatibility.
09:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😃
09:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch06-00-programs-libraries.html
09:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1448820/Hydrofoil_Generation/
09:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this game is made in rust
09:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XD
09:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Even if redox is a cool project and a system library with rust mangling would be cool. I still don't see it as a future os
09:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least not for desktop or high performance
09:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you know what engine it uses?
09:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Looks rather mature already
09:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> custom
09:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so inhouse
09:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> reviews say it has excelent perf
09:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 400+fos
09:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fps xd
09:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
09:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> mimimimi
09:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> imagine a world where choosing ur os is not limited by program availability
09:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we not ready for that future
09:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The future is about high performance software^^
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well if u trade performance u could say that emulators and virtual machines already offer this
09:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yes, rust
10:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> bored at work
10:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> True
10:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Fanboy tho😂
10:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In ddnet discord it's never boring
10:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> that's why i'm here now
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can always trigger a 5h discussion with an eye blink xd
10:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I wanna make a game of rock paper scissors with just three buttons but you can see the other player's cursor for 5 seconds before the playfield was covered for another few seconds
10:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Interesting psycho game xd
10:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> tournament / battle royal style matchmaking, win X in a row to get a "victory royal"
10:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> already bought an appid on steam for it
10:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101057774047215636/image.png
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It costs money?
10:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 100usd
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> One game?
10:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> per game ye
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh wow
10:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i believe deen paid for it too
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well that's not cheap xd
10:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's actually better than greenlight tho
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hope for u it will pay out
10:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> the old greenlight system you can spend 100usd to buy a greenlight pass and let people vote for your game to be on steam
10:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> so you spend 100usd with no guarantee to be on steam
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Uff
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I only released stuff on Google play yet
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They give a shit xddd
10:13 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also i believe they return you the 100usd if you made 1000usd revenue
10:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> google play banned my free app without ads and gave me a strike so i don't know about that
10:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> be like me i have today and tomorrow off
10:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and monday is workers day so off too
10:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
10:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its only 100 once
10:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not per game
10:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> unless they changed it
10:22 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm pretty sure it's per game
10:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> greenlight was 100usd once with no garantee
10:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess its cuz ppl uploaded too much shit xd
10:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> steam direct is 100usd per game
10:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> deen paid greenlight
10:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh right probably
10:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna release myo wn game on steam too
10:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i forgot ddnet was greenlit
10:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so i have the badge too
10:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> either way greenlight is dead
10:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u are lit
10:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also I paid my greenlight too, and they didn't even give me a free steam direct ID when they killed greenlight
10:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16)
10:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>    nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu updated - rustc 1.71.0-nightly (1c42cb4ef 2023-04-26) (from rustc 1.71.0-nightly (f5559e338 2023-04-24))
10:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nothing better than my daily rust nightly update
10:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> they probably would if I just asked, valve seems to be generally nice if you talk to them
10:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think the 100usd from greenlight went to charity maybe
10:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont remember
10:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no one does
10:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was history
10:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> should i make the rock paper scissors game using teeworlds as a theme
10:28 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek: technically it's the only style I know how to make
10:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Make it a teeworlds mod
10:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but i want money
10:29 <+bridge> <bencie> rock paper scissors < bot noby nouis
10:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also ddnet exists
10:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> kinda wanna make the most pay to win rock paper scissors
10:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but not really pay to win
10:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> like maybe you can buy markers and draw on the play field
10:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
10:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur now following ur fellow chinese devs
10:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> lootboxes and microtransactions
10:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> gotta love them
10:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also we did steal them from the japanese too be fair
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> contract a artist and make waifu paper rocks and scissors
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> then sell skins
10:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also we did steal them from the japanese to be fair
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> of the waifus
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in lootboxes
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u know who invented the battlepass?
10:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> valve
10:31 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but battlepass is not lootboxes
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well valve  invented those too kinda
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> csgo cases
10:32 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think gotcha exists before csgo
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also valve battlepass is not a battlepass u can easily level
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe to lvl 100 tryharding
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but u gotta spend the $$
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and im all for it
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for those juicy skins
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i got to lvl 900
10:32 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> well obviously if Ti's price money is that high
10:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but valve has smth special idk
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> csgo cases is what went crazy
10:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> half of the player base with double the money than lol
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> atleast in the west
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the modern world kek
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> true
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is also a arab
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and a chinese
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> extremely rich
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they compete
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they get to lvl 30.000
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> once 100.000
10:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i wish i was rich
10:33 <+bridge> <ReiTW> bruh teacher asking to use chatgpt for homework
10:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/4314-alleged-saudi-prince-levels-up-dota-2-battle-pass-to-over-50k
10:33 <+bridge> <ReiTW> but chatgpt's login system sucks so much
10:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> use bing
10:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's free and it's just bing
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101063768114475058/image.png
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://stratz.com/battle-pass/leaderboards?eventId=36
10:34 <+bridge> <ReiTW> bing sucks
10:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> or you can just use mine https://tsfreddie-chat.fly.dev/
10:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Some people have way too muxh money
10:35 <+bridge> <ReiTW> locked content
10:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
10:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz it's mine
10:35 <+bridge> <ReiTW> unlock it
10:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not yours :troll:
10:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> can u self host chatgpt
10:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Do you use chatgpt or do you have one of those other models running locally?
10:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't wanna post the password here tho
10:35 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> openai's api
10:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maaan
10:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how can nodejs take fcking 13 mins to compile
10:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> when deno is nothing
10:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and faster
10:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you're just a hater
10:36 <+bridge> <ReiTW> deno > nodejs
10:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what about bun
10:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ew
10:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont talk about zig here
10:37 <+bridge> <ReiTW> well security wise it's worse
10:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:cleanchat:708898337457176646>
10:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yep i use it ad my svelte adapter
10:37 <+bridge> <ReiTW> but actually bun is faster
10:37 <+bridge> <ReiTW> well can handle more requests for eg
10:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it probs has more memory issues
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but benchmarks are hard
10:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ok let me guess
10:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> deno is in rust
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> zig is not memory safe
10:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is the compiler written in js or what xd
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its the new c hipster lang
10:38 <+bridge> <ReiTW> deno is only slower cuz it uses v8 engine
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yes, and its made by the nodejs author
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses v8
10:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> v8 is ok
10:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> V8 = java?
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> v8 is like the js engine
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> madeb y google
10:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh ok
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://v8.dev/
10:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/tree/main/Source/JavaScriptCore
10:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> bun uses that, also why it is faster
10:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So they write a compiler in js and u need a js runtime to compile it?
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how hard is it to make a js engine
10:40 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i read that v8 does too many predictions when running code and it is getting slower because it tries to go too fast
10:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probably insanely hard with all the bloat
10:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> guys do u know if i have a jack aux splitter it reduces audio quality?
10:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this
10:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101065648559362048/71zLhAg-rSL.png
10:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i still use v8 in unity tho. javascript core is probably too hard to integrate so none of the unity js runtime use i
10:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i still use v8 in unity tho. javascript core is probably too hard to integrate so none of the unity js runtime use it
10:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> do you have one?
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not yet
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i may wanna buy one
10:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably fine
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have my good speakers, and my headphones
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> right now i simply disconnect and connect from a large wire like this
10:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> buy a mixer if you have "good" stuff i would say
10:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i think connecting and disconnecting is bad
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm never thought about it
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont they cost shitload
10:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> well ye
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u know any
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 100-200
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> €
10:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean if your audio equipment's aren't costing shitloads anyway, you should be fine using a splitter
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> if they already did
10:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think im in the high end
10:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my speakers costed 100€
10:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> a mixer won't hurt
10:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no
10:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm cheap
10:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also I use airpods so i probably doesn't care about audio quality
10:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also I use airpods so i probably don't care about audio quality
10:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> when i get  my own apartment
10:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill for sure get some good shit
10:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and play weeb bangers kek
10:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> Dont you make a gorillion €? Just get one quicc
10:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a combination of me being lazy and barcelona costing shitload if u live alone
10:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill probs go live with a friend
10:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you also use js for your personal projects?
10:47 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i only use js for personal projects
10:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And unity
10:47 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> well ye
10:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also while living with parents i can save  quite a lot xd
10:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see
10:47 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> usually unity aren't my personal projects tho
10:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur rly the opposite of me
10:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i would just use godot if I need something small, and something doesn't bite
10:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> godot 4 is out
10:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Who needs bash if u have rust
10:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i know
10:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but godot 4 is so slow at cold launching right now. plus i only need 2d so godot 3 is fine
10:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I doubt it's possible in Barcelona nowadays but if you have a good salary, boomer wisdom is to buy the house instead of renting. Your mortgage would be close enough to rent in sane cities
10:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> if you can dump all your rust knowledge into my brain in seconds, i would gladly just use rust in godot
10:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
10:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but i think i really hate rust
10:51 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> because it makes me feel really dumb lol
10:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah but im also young, i dont know if i wanna stay where i buy, and i hear banks dont like to give until 25y old
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my sister got a house tho xd
10:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I would buy a house but i still don't know where I want to live yet
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and will have it paid in 5 years
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or less
10:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also chinese real estate is going insane
10:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> well, at least it feels like it
10:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> I have absolutely no clue where I'll be either
10:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i think most chinese parent would buy a house for they kid
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lets make a ddnet house
10:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> I also have no clue what I'll do after uni. I sorta don't feel like doing anything 😄
10:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but my parent dump all their money for US/UK tuitions and cost of livings lol
10:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and now technically i'm still owe my parent like 2,000,000cny
10:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and now technically i  still owe my parent like 2,000,000cny
10:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> how long have you been in uni
10:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it feels like forever
10:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> 6 years I think
10:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oof
10:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I stayed at home for a year after uni i think
10:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's funny that I never really looked for a job
10:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I still don't know how
10:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
10:56 <+bridge> <ReiTW> damn wtf are u doing a thesis or wut
10:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but I seem to have some extreme dumb luck
10:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> Noo, I'm just an awful student 😄
10:56 <+bridge> <ReiTW> lmaoo
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Still better than me
10:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> And covid happened. I did nothing for 2 years
10:57 <+bridge> <ReiTW> this year is my last year, almost 5 years as a student & employee at my Uni
10:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> If I wasn't too proud to cheat in exams during covid I'd be done
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> University is simply too boring. No real challenges. Boring homework tasks
10:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I died by borigness
10:58 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> work is still boring tho
10:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes personal projects are best
10:58 <+bridge> <ReiTW> apprenticeship helps
10:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> The only challenging part of uni is the part that I don't give a shit about. Why would I want to learn multivariable calculus and electromagnetism?
10:59 <+bridge> <Learath2> I would like to live like that one dude who is getting crowdfunded to reverse engineer M1 macbooks to port linux onto them
10:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this
10:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i only lasted 1y in uni xd
10:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's also that even if they might be partially useful for some stuff. U cannot take some courses without them
10:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh, right, working for a "big" company sometime has some really funny things happen.
10:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I prefer to learn it when I need it
10:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> IT noticed us we are getting C&D from postman
11:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> This one million %
11:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we are not using postman for collaborate projects. I can't find terms on postman's pricing about local usage
11:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe I'll start a masters then drop out after a year or two without getting a degree
11:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek: but we still can't just deal with them so we have to switch
11:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we also got C&D from fiddler, but that's just someone using a pirated version of fiddler
11:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's kinda weird that they just knows exactly which team is using fiddler
11:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Y u no mitmproxy?
11:02 <+bridge> <ReiTW> C&D?
11:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cease and desist
11:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it wasn't me using it so idk
11:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
11:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm curious how do you detect pirated software being used in a company
11:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> or do they just send letters everywhere and hope a IT department do the detective job for them
11:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> Snitches? Phone home telemetry?
11:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i doubt chinese crackers can't remove some telemetry if they can crack it.
11:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> They may have missed it. Old adobe products had some phonehome trigger only after 30 minutes
11:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye maybe
11:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> We used to block it in the hosts file so it couldn't resolve the telemetry server 😄
11:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean my friends used to. I would never engage in any piracy
11:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> > I would never engage in any piracy
11:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> at least not in a publicly available chatlog

11:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> floating terminal inside neovim too
11:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i still use mouse
11:16 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> why does it feel hard for me to make amultiplayer game while teeworlds is multiplayer already
11:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
11:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also why does teeworlds has better prediction than most of the unity networking libraries
11:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> pff, I paid 100 USD
11:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> :p
11:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
11:20 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> epic
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> yikes github pipeline running since 30 minutes ddnet became such a bloatware
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> i also have the feeling my vscode intellisense can not keep up anymore
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6533
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> trying to reproduce this
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk how tho
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> all my autocompletions and hints seemed to lag beind anyone else?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> watf how could this crash?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> ``Kill.m_KillerRenderInfo = m_pClient->m_aClients[Kill.m_KillerID].m_RenderInfo;``
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> ``if(Kill.m_KillerID >= 0 && Kill.m_KillerID < MAX_CLIENTS)``
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> seems bound checked
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> cant be a nullptr since its not a pointer
11:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> TIL chiller uses vscode
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so beautiful
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101076527296303154/image.png
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie xd
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> ok ryo where can i buy ur neovim rc?
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i was lazy
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its this but changed/fixed
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ntk148v/neovim-config
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ez to reproduce
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rly modern neovim tho
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >0.8
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it installs lsp servers rly ez
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> NVIM v0.9.0
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> i use arch btw
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i got 0.9 too
11:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> fixed might be a keyword
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u need to createa custom.lua here and there
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its where ur supposed to put ur custom config
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but without the file it will give u annoying warnings
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and yeah modern neovim config is in lua
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101077037545955408/image.png
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses lazy.nvim
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like work
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a new package manager
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it isnt
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its 2 mins xd
11:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> unlike setting ur setup
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> wot
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> i click c++ extension

11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> press i to install
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> done
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> u says 2mins and configs
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just said u need to create a file
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> as in touch
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway idk why i try to convince u
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just use ur vscode
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> lel this touch is so trol
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> also fak why i missing fonts again ._. i thought i got em all now
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u need a nerd font
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> ye saw that
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> got it now
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> still borked ffs

12:14 <+ChillerDragon> bra 36 stars no issues xd
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> which file do i even have to touch i tried lua/custom.lua and lua/custom/init.lua both still throw warnings
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its nice anyway as a base config
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u should edit it to ur liking
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanted to know how modern vim worked so this is a nice point to start
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i changed the space ff to control p
12:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im so used to control p to find files
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> i was also about to do that
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but the nicest part is the setup already done for LSP
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> i tihink ill just delete the line in the init.lua then xd
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just remap it
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> edit
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> vim lua/config/keymaps.lua
12:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> .config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> i https://github.com/ntk148v/neovim-config/blob/5dad4f81417ac875e95ba8b4b4807e6dc38e4541/nvim/lua/config/init.lua#L26
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> i deleted this line xd
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> fk
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> it broke more
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont delete it
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> because it throws warnings at me idk
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> is ur fork open src? xd
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just do touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/custom.lua
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> that still warned
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/custom.lua
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this one too
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in this one u have to add this tho
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ❯ cat plugins/custom.lua
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> return {{
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> }}
12:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with this u get no warnings
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> nice ty
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> and this is clear how? xd
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wdym
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk the guy probs missed to document this
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> how do u know that
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i figured it myself
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> how to fix
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> how
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like a good linux user
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> how
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> reading the warnings bruv
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its just lua
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> warnings didnt mention plugins folder
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it mentioned the lua import
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> warning made me create custom.lua
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lua imports are like files
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and folders
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u nobo
12:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just learn lua
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> i lua pro
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> everything is a table
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> put ur config
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in custom
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> config/custom.lua
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> u made ctrl the leader?
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
12:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i only changed control-p for that binding
12:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> under keymaps.lua
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> i se
12:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-P>", builtin.find_files, {})
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> hax
12:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> did u end up using it chiller
12:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this nvim
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> yea im kinda busy rn but im still on it kinda
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> how do i add plugins with pressing "i" ? xd
13:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the i thing is for lsp servers
13:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its :mason or smth
13:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not home rn sey
13:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sry
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> omg i just hacked ryo!
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> here proof i took a screenshot on his system:
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682594828.png
13:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:31 <+bridge> <Patiga> ChillerDragon: fake thats not Rust
13:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like much transparency on my term
13:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have 0.97
13:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> gotta show the UwU bg
14:27 <+bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101122454581149816/IMG_20230427_132923_082.png
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm home
16:39 <+bridge> <Voxel> chiller wtf is that background
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> so the rewrite in rust is going well ...
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=tw_in_rust.mp4&u=chiller
17:55 <+bridge> <Chairn> to be excel in all disciplines
17:56 <+bridge> <Voxel> this looks like a scratch game LOL
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> ikr xd
17:56 <+bridge> <Chairn> the way you solve these can probably help you in some other problems as well
17:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> omg epic, chillerdragonball
17:57 <+bridge> <Chairn> can be corrupt stack
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> imagine not gaming with asan on
17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🙃
17:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'd rather be challenged by a problem that I care about which in turn forces me to learn these. Just randomly learning them with "trust me bro it'll be useful" is quite demotivating for me
17:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> to xcel in all disciplines
17:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> to excel in all disciplines
17:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> well, it's part of the cursus
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682611111.png
17:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> so the diploma encompass these
17:59 <+bridge> <Chairn> if you get the diploma without being able to accomplish these problesm, the diploma loses value
18:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm finally have a master degree recognized by china
18:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> learath value comes from knowing c
18:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not the diploma
18:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
18:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what diploma
18:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh, you guys were talking about diploma apparently
18:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i paid 400cny for china to accept my diploma
18:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
18:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what a great system
18:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> imagine having a diploma
18:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> just spend 2 million of your family's money, put your family in poverty. ez
18:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> finally someone who understands
18:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> Chairn is too academic to understand the struggles of us mere mortals
18:28 <+bridge> <I.K.U> can someone check showroom: i think i crashed a server with /swap
18:30 <+bridge> <Chairn> i started with C too though 😄
18:30 <+bridge> <Chairn> as a self learner
18:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> I bet you are a pseudocode enjoyer now
18:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there are 2 types of dev: those who end up coding in their job and those who dont
18:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Does look like a crash, we can check the core dump later
18:33 <+bridge> <I.K.U> that cts map is just giga cursed
18:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually ur real value lies in the job u can get most paid at (in a capitalistic sense) because u will pay more taxes
18:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> well value is trivial to measure in the capitalistic sense, you are worth exactly the amount of capital you have. your time is worth however much the market is willing to pay for it
18:36 <+bridge> <Ianukito> hey
18:36 <+bridge> <Ianukito> why there's a development chat here?
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why not?
18:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> it's so we can chat about development
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what kind of question is that
18:36 <+bridge> <Ianukito> is there any way i can code or develop stuff on ddnet?
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet is  free  software
18:36 <+bridge> <Ianukito> makes sense
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its not a company
18:36 <+bridge> <Ianukito> i mean, the maps
18:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> read https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
18:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
18:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what?
18:37 <+bridge> <Ianukito> aight
18:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u want to be a mapper?
18:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> go to #📌info
18:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> you need to add lots of ***
18:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> or #mapping, though we don't really have a tutorial per se, people are pretty helpful
18:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> well that's it's primary purpose, so it is technically correct
18:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> * development may involve the discussion of phisolosophical, metaphysical or political subjects
18:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ** rust
18:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> *** hating on c
18:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> how do i check for nulls in c++
18:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> im trying to fix the thing i fucked up on
18:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> For testing you should probably try using ASAN and UBSAN
18:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if its a pointer u add a if
18:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if pp != nullptr
18:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The crash log that we have doesn't make sense to me
18:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he is probs on windows
18:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and probs doesnt know asan or ubsan
18:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure its pain
18:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think ASAN at least is possible with Visual Studio
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust?
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats the countdown for
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> With rust it would not have happened
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but true
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬😬
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u check how to check in code
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its the if i sent
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u mean how to check in code
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ancient times u would use NULL
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but we are modern here
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so nullptr
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-steve-buscemi-30rock-fellow-kids-one-of-us-gif-21904018
18:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> ok jupstar
18:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> why not solve it yourself then
18:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> write your funny rust code and fix the bug yourself
18:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> someone is mad
18:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :blobwhistle:
18:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u didnt get the joke
18:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryo was about to say it
18:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i made the countdown
18:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here the clear indication xD
18:53 <+bridge> <Voxel> ok then ryoz do it
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel actually tried it this morning
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i couldnt reproduce the crash
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i went to a solo server
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
18:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if we knew how to reproduce it robyt would have fixed it anyway
18:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
18:54 <+bridge> <Voxel> true
18:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say the crash log indeed makes no sense
18:54 <+bridge> <Voxel> but ngl i feel inclined to fixed this myself anyways, even if its mentally painful
18:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dont know how but i was the one who broke ddnet again
18:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> always breaking ddnet smh
18:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 🤦
18:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Voxel whatever caused the bug, its not the lines mentioned here
18:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
18:56 <+bridge> <Voxel> I dunno, it just feels very likely
18:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the commit i tried with was 1 minute before the symbols were uploaded
18:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so that's probably the reason
18:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest: i don't feel like doing academic stuff but graduating did got me 3000cny bonus per month from local gov
18:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> i think im going to lay down
18:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> im too stressed to code right now
18:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok but no code changes in these components
18:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, but it makes a different
18:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> It's killmessages.cpp:135 with the symbols from the previous day
18:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i know, c++ can be stressful
18:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> `Kill.m_VictimID = vStrongWeakSorted[0].first;`
18:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi can u send more crash logs?
19:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> So the vector is empty I guess
19:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i see
19:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so murpi didnt update his game for a day
19:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> quite possible
19:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
19:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so its fixed?
19:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> lemme guess, rust **isnt**?
19:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> as for values of going there. i think it was purely for better position and benefits in china, otherwise it didn't do much i guess. although I do enjoy the engineering courses that at least started me to work in a team.
19:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i used latest master and  couldnt reproduce
19:00 <+bridge> <murpi> I only had one
19:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it only explains why the crash log was wrong
19:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u are learning
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is the call stack fine?
19:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was too damn expensive for regular chinese people tho
19:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u remember the context
19:01 <+bridge> <murpi> bencie has sent crash logs here somewhere as well, maybe they are related
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. do previous calls make sense
19:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how many players
19:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> did they die
19:01 <+bridge> <murpi> Solo server, around 30 players
19:01 <+bridge> <Voxel> that was sarcasm you one trick pony
19:01 <+bridge> <Voxel> god
19:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lol i know, there are layers to this
19:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my was sarcasm on ur sarcasm
19:01 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah
19:01 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ```

19:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i feel like discord is starting to copy features from chinese discord clones
19:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese people are definitely no used to the discord styled channels
19:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we have 4000+ members in our channels rn, but people rarely talk in channels. they still like the old chat group
19:08 <+bridge> <Ianukito> yeah
19:08 <+bridge> <Ianukito> but as a hobby
19:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wanna be the very best
19:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like no one ever was
19:09 <+bridge> <Ianukito> k
19:09 <+bridge> <Ianukito> good luck
19:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you can just learn the map editor
19:09 <+bridge> <Ianukito> yeah but
19:09 <+bridge> <Ianukito> i'm not a scratch programmer
19:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ask in #mapping, we got mappers to help
19:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> mapping does not require coding
19:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> like at all
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds mapping is easy than using paint
19:10 <+bridge> <Ianukito> ik
19:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i wouldn't say it is easier than using paint
19:10 <+bridge> <Ianukito> it's a bit harder
19:10 <+bridge> <Ianukito> but almost the same
19:10 <+bridge> <Ianukito> anyway
19:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSh-amJVdXc
19:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> either way, just ask #mapping on how to get started.
19:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the trick is, just start
19:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also that
19:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Mapping
19:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean first map will suck anyway
19:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> here's almost everything you need
19:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i used to make maps for fng
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then
19:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and i ruined chinese fng
19:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sad
19:13 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> they are still playing solofng5ez
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lol this page is great
19:13 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> why
19:13 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I didn't read it
19:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it looks like an artist made it
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok wait
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> upon further read
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u compare it to ugly trouble shooting pages xD
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think this was translated from chinese
19:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> lol what
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zwelf translated some stuff back xD
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> by accident
19:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but the chinese version is not even translated
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz it was not ported
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so he translated it to chinese, just to translate it back
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its archived
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Archive:Mapping/zh
19:15 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
19:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can i ask why this even happened?
19:15 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> now that looks very familar
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we ididnt use the extension before because it lacked visual editor support
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and now it has to some extend
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the translate extension is nice because it makes translating easier
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but did it make all sites to break compability?
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it made the translated sites break compatiblity ye
19:16 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nvm the twcn wiki is worse
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz what we did initially was a monkey patch
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we "emulated" a translated page xd
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is one chinese tryhard wiki contributor xD
19:16 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101195267157540874/image.png
19:16 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i know that
19:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
19:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is https not allowed in 🇨🇳 ?
19:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no, the cert expired
19:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok xD
19:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I didn't host our wiki
19:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> so i don't know who's in charge with it
19:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not that we need it anyway. ddnet got it better
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do ur work in the ddnet wiki pls
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> better
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im the one hosting the wiki btw
19:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ours existed since 15 tho
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :poggers2:
19:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ours existed since 2014 tho
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this one technically since 2015
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oo
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but it was dead long time
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tsfreddie was ahead of chinas time
19:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was mostly just mod showcase at first

19:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye i got our forums and everything
19:18 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and i threw everything away before I went to US for college
19:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> twcn is a dead page rn
19:19 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> although I did get contacted by gov to fix my registration for teeworlds.cn
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try to register teeworlds.tw from china xd
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mainland.tw
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD

19:22 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I totally forgot
19:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yes
19:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what happened to it
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i deleted it because hetzner nullrouted my server  cuz someone used a phish link
19:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
19:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> epic
19:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without taiwan my life has no sense anymore 🥹
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no fun
19:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> do you still want the domain tho
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i lost access to mail
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> during that  time
19:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I still got it until aug this year
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm sure
19:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but what i can i put there
19:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh wait
19:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i still owns ddrace.cn and ddrace.net.cn for some reason
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think hetzner knew it was mine cuz i didnt us cloudflare
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> behind cloudflare it should be safe?
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xds
19:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> they're just sitting there
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> setup a cloudflare and i can tell u the ip
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what was it
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tee.ink?
19:25 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> teel.ink
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how much does it cost
19:25 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> tee.ink probably worth a lot more
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i forgot
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> probably like 20cny
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it probably was free
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 2.62 Euro
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> from buy vps
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> from buying vps
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 55cny
19:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> for 1 year
19:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's pretty cheap
19:28 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> btw has anyone tried to add steam networking to ddnet
19:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest: i mean it's technically free relay.
19:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> can probably host some steam only servers without ever worry about exposing IPs. but they can only be played on steam tho.
20:02 <+bridge> <ReiTW> there was a discussion about it if I remember
20:03 <+bridge> <ReiTW> but thing is steam's stuff is kinda closed
20:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we are already using steamworks sdk for getting names i think
20:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101214410309107732/RDT_20230427_2032468683531025809997234.jpg
20:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @ReiTW
20:39 <+bridge> <ReiTW> LMAO
20:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese will always be superior for numbers
21:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🇮🇳
21:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> For reading numbers i guess
21:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> One syllable per digit is really comfortable compared to english
21:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one digit per digit is even more confortable
21:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Not until you say it?
21:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i communicate in binary
21:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> One billion five hundred and forty-six hundred and forty-five thousand three hundred and seventy-four = 十五亿四千六百三十四万五千三百七十四
21:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> telepathy
21:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
21:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff
21:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but which is easier to read?
21:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> If you can read chinese it's probably the same
21:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Asian languages group numbers in 4 and you guys groups them in 3s
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only see, 
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DEAD random random Window with curtain, power pole, tent random random dead window with curtain random random power pole random random random dead, window with power pole
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only see, 
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DEAD random random Window with curtain, power pole, tent random random dead window with curtain random random power pole random random random dead, window  with curtain
21:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :brownbear:
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 四 could also be a bed
21:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Also just write arabic numbers.
21:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't deny that
21:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> But when you read it out loud, chinese is definitely better
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> latin numbers 😬
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> MXXXVI
21:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not even Japanese has one syllable per digit
21:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chinese is cool bcs it has blocks
21:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> much easier to render xD
21:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I do hate that we group numbers differently tho
21:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Making translating numbers unnecessarily hard
21:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> the simple numbers trips me up too
21:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Like a million
21:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tsfreddie很酷，因为他能看懂中文。他可能是地球上唯一一个能够做到这一点的人。我是他的粉丝。
21:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> You guys have million = 1,000,000, and we have 万 = 1,0000. So 1 million = 100万 which always trip me up
21:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> i wonder where that come from
21:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> why europe uses 3 digit group?
21:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> and why china uses 4 digit group?
21:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
21:12 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Who knows
21:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the use of 4-digit groupings in China can be traced back to the traditional Chinese counting system, which is based on units of 10,000 rather than 1,000. This system was already in use before the introduction of Arabic numerals to China, and it continued to be used alongside them. As a result, it became customary to group numbers in sets of four digits, rather than three.
21:13 <+bridge> <Chairn> okay, now why 3?
21:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In Europe, the use of 3-digit groupings dates back to the 15th century, when Arabic numerals were introduced to the region. At that time, it became customary to separate large numbers with spaces to make them easier to read. The spaces were typically placed every three digits, which eventually became the standard in Europe.
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> please link :
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> please link 😛
21:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://chat.openai.com
21:14 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I think i'm more amazed that we came up with numbers separately yet both got based 10 and based 12 system
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> okay...
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> do you have reliable source?
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> 8-10-12 are good bases
21:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is reliable
21:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> reliably wrong
21:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> 12 being the best
21:15 <+bridge> <Chairn> the more divider a base, the better it is
21:15 <+bridge> <Chairn> it eases all computing
21:15 <+bridge> <Chairn> the more divider a base has, the better it is
21:15 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese did use base-16 for weight before
21:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> base 20 lying somewhere in middle age France 😄
21:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yhea its a bit better in many cases ^^
21:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> and base 60 in Mesopotamia
21:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> We still use base-12 for... emmm.. time i guess but that's just how time works i think
21:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Idk what I'm talking about
21:17 <+bridge> <Chairn> good thing that 60 is a multiple of 12 then, conversion is easier i guess
21:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> what symbols do they even use there wtf
21:19 <+bridge> <Chairn> it wasnt a positioning system
21:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal#Origin
21:20 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> base65536 master race
21:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> obv ternary number system is best
21:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just as triangles are best
21:22 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
21:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Can we just make up a base-anynumber encoding and claim to be the first library for it
21:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> hexagons are the bestagons
21:23 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Flood npm with base-n packages
21:43 <+bridge> <Chairn> base 1 master race
21:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh? i thought std::vector will throw an exception with clear message like "hey dum there's nothing in me"
21:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not in release
23:41 <+bridge> <Voxel> damn robyt already fixed it
23:41 <+bridge> <Voxel> #1 coder
