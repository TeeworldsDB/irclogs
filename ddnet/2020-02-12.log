00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im here now
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so what should i do build d7 server and test chat commands with latest vanilla client?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what am i looking for exactly?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/676935389230923776/unknown.png
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh cmn
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we pls keep same binary names for master and d7
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 d7 is very unstable i can hardly get it runnign longer than 10 sec
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/rg
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did i mess something up? Because for me it only shows vanilla commands ._.
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its not d7
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its a new branch
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GitHub - ddnet/ddnet7 at d7_pr_chatcom
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/tree/d7_pr_chatcom
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon ^^
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh ah
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but did you know that selfkill caused a crash on d7?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought d7 is the super clean super stable branch?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> D7 is a constant work in progress
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/676940802353791007/unknown.png
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> men why cant branch switching be clean
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ever
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It currently requires a huge vanilla restructuring to get working, so I‚Äôm doing that
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That submodule pissed me off so much too
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> same here
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sorry for that
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem with kill in d7 is that the gameworld pointer is invalid at that point üòõ
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm rewriting gamecontroller in a way that we no longer need to inherit from the vanilla controller when writing our own controllers
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks good to me @Learath2
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so what is this branch now?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a fork of d7?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks more like master
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No its a branch off of master
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is it called d7 then
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> clickbait
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wanted to give fokkonaut a hand with the new chat commands thing
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i wasnt thinking while creating the branch
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why /me <text> <text> and not /me <text> ? is this some irc thing i do not get?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, its probably a bug in the code that reads the argument list
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how the new system works but it looks fine
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess most important is that binds like say /pause still work
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems functional to me
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooh, didnt think about the binds
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should add a way to bind chat commands
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is working tho
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so all fine i guess
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well its a janky way to keep them working
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well so before you remove it
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Master supports both old and new style of sending commands
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> keep in mind its a important thing
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would it be fine if you had to change binds?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its a good idea to support old clients anways
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes @Learath2
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like how?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yet another reason not to update to 0.7?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> loosing all binds
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bind q ccom pause
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I know a less janky way to keep old style chat commands
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ‚ù§Ô∏è
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Strip the /, get the command name, find the command, go through OnCommand
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but binding is probably better
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and redoing
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> binds
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> otherwise we will never detach from the chat commands...
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1997 can you take another look?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen nothing i can do
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see a huge difference between 2.0.10 and 2.0.8 from
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://libsdl.org/release/
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so even if its not on software side, they seem to compile without optimazations or something
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also, if they gpu is their limiting factor they might not notice the difference so much(obviously)
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> their tmp release also has bad performance
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ no chance to build sdl2 with visual studio? then we'd get the debugging info
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see the same difference, but apparently they can't repro it
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but as i said sdl has dynamic api and vs cant debug it @deen
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/677122500475355139/unknown.png
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if u can disable that or smth
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs need a static sdl build
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen see github
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant do more, bcs i am not really into sdl
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you have the problem too the guys in the mailing list lie for some reason
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks a lot. too bad there isn't anymore information
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen see github
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can see the line numbers in the last screens
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it only @Jupstar ‚ú™ that has the issue?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 well deen said he noticed it too on wine, but these guys from sdl are all like "YO I GET 700FPS, SO NO BUG" instead of actually checking a difference
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/commits-libsdl.org/2018-August/002913.html
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this was the commit probably, and it also feels wrong
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it updates something every frame, instead of only if "it has been stolen"
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but hopefully a real sdl coder sees it, else it never gets fixed xD
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ you could try with and without that commit and report the difference
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i should, but don't want to switch to windows all the time, but if no SDL coder answers i'll do it probably üòÑ
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it only @Jupstar ‚ú™ that has the issue?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i see it in wine, 800 instead of 900 fps
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hope we get some 0.7 servers this time o.O
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ouch
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they crash, so i can't update
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and no players, so not motivated much
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont get the thing about the crashes
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could you tell me how to reproduce it?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just seen it on all official servers
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i guess id have to import official db and runs some servers?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you have a simple script that sets the servers up so i can try to reproduce?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it seems to happen on map load
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so probably trying to load every official map once should trigger it
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/issues/62
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this one?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> could do that in a loop
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea sounds like a good idea
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks i will try
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> whats the best way to get official maps? downloading the maps github repo i guess?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for i in *.map; do ./DDNet-Server "sv_map $i; quit"; done or sth like that
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy i know some basic bash üôÇ
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://maps.ddnet.tw/compilations/maps7.zip
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh thats nice
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks a lot
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> [2020-02-12 17:48:20][server]: failed to load map. mapname='blmapDT-UPTU'
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i guess that is not the issue since main servers do not have blockmaps huh?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still it seems to be broken and make trouble on block servers
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> weird that your gdb output shows optimized variables
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/677211985691279361/unknown.png
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt that not happen in debug builds?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm i iterated over all maps 2 times and never got a non zero exit code. Also i iterated over Bullets 1000 times and even joined manually because it seemed to be crazy shotgun killing it.
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
20:00 <@deen> too bad
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't have debug builds
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet uses relwithdebinfo
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen does it happen to you, when a tourn map os loaded it errors and you have to reconnect? It happened me all the time i has the 4 client stream, might be becausd of that? I stream on windows btw
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is* had*
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think its cuz my 4 clients download at the same time
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe you dont get the error cuz u have the map beforehand if thats the case?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki that happens because the map download happens multiple times at once and they all write to the same file
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> multiple clients don't synchronize at all
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guessed that
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u have a workaround?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ looks like they got a fix: https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4897
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki like sending you the tournament map beforehand? üòÑ
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every process should write the map to map.$PID.tmp and then move it into the correct location atomically
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least that 's what i do with my shell/python scripts when I have this problem
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then the map is always in a correct state, either it doesn't exist or it's finished
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me see if I can implement that
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hey, the server does it that way already, see pid() in gamecontext.cpp
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill check
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> str_format(aTemp, sizeof(aTemp), "%s.temp.%d", pNewMapName, pid());
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you want to implement it?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If i do it will be tomorrow
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, actually it's super simple, I'll just do it now
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> btw, is the cursor supposed to spin like crazy? üòÑ
