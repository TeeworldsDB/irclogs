11:45 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: it's a header followed by a stream of messages
11:45 <@heinrich5991> the header is a zero-terminated string containing json in a self-explanatory format
11:46 <@heinrich5991> each message starts with a teeworlds variable-width integer, which is the message ID
11:46 <@heinrich5991> the rest of the message depends on the message ID:
11:49 <@heinrich5991> PLAYER_DIFF(0-63): dx(int) dy(int) records that player with the message ID as cid (client ID) has changed position in a way that adds dx to the x coordinate and y to the y coordinate
11:49 <@heinrich5991> FINISH(-1): records the end of the teehistorian file
11:51 <@heinrich5991> TICK_SKIP(-2): dt(int) records that there were dt ticks in which nothing happened, i.e. the next tick is the last tick + dt + 1
11:52 <@heinrich5991> PLAYER_NEW(-3): cid(int) x(int) y(int) records that a new player character with cid appeared at (x, y)
11:52 <@heinrich5991> PLAYER_OLD(-4): cid(int) records that the player character with cid disappeared
11:54 <@heinrich5991> INPUT_DIFF(-5): cid(int) input(int[10]) records that a player with cid sent an input packet for the first time, containing input
11:54 <@heinrich5991> correction
11:55 <@heinrich5991> INPUT_DIFF(-5): cid(int) dinput(int[10]) records that a player with cid sent an input packet but has sent one before, add dinput to the previous input component-wise to obtain the new one
11:55 <@heinrich5991> INPUT_NEW(-6): cid(int) input(int[10]) records that a player with cid sent an input packet for the first time, containing input
11:56 <@heinrich5991> MESSAGE(-7): cid(int) msgsize(int) msg(raw[msgsize]) records that a player with cid sent a game-related packet msg
11:57 <@heinrich5991> JOIN(-8): cid(int) records that a player with cid joined, on the engine level
11:57 <@heinrich5991> DROP(-9): cid(int) records that a player with cid left/was kicked/was dropped, on the engine level
11:59 <@heinrich5991> CONSOLE_COMMAND(-10): cid(int) flags(int) cmd(str) num_args(str) args(str[num_args]) records that a console command cmd was executed by client id cid (not necessarily a player, might be a vote as well), with flags (distinguishes chat commands, etc.) with parameters args
12:00 <@heinrich5991> EX(-11): uuid(uuid) size(int) data(raw[size]) records an extension message, identified by uuid and containing data
12:01 <@heinrich5991> the following extra messages are known right now:
12:03 <@heinrich5991> TEST(teehistorian-test@ddnet.tw): is just a test message
12:05 <@heinrich5991> AUTH_INIT(teehistorian-auth-init@ddnet.tw): cid(int) level(int) auth_name(str) records that a player with cid got rcon access with level under the account name auth_name since the start of the map (because they had it before the map change as well)
12:06 <@heinrich5991> AUTH_LOGIN(teehistorian-auth-login@ddnet.tw): cid(int) level(int) auth_name(str) records that a player with cid just logged into rcon with level under the account name auth_name
12:06 <@heinrich5991> AUTH_LOGOUT(teehistorian-auth-logout@ddnet.tw): cid(int) records that a player with cid just logged out of rcon
12:31 <@heinrich5991> int is a teeworlds variable-width integer
12:32 <@heinrich5991> str is a null-terminated string
12:32 <@heinrich5991> raw[size] is simply size bytes
12:32 <@heinrich5991> str[num_args] is num_args null-terminated strings
12:33 <@heinrich5991> uuid is 16 bytes of a UUID
12:35 <@heinrich5991> the UUIDs are version 3 UUIDs, with the teeworlds namespace e05ddaaa-c4e6-4cfb-b642-5d48e80c0029
12:39 <@heinrich5991> a tick is implicit in these messages when a player with lower cid is recorded using any of PLAYER_DIFF, PLAYER_NEW, PLAYER_OLD
12:39 <@heinrich5991> e.g.
12:39 <@heinrich5991> PLAYER_DIFF cid=0 â€¦ PLAYER_NEW cid=5 â€¦ PLAYER_OLD cid=3 has an implicit tick between the cid=5 and the cid=3 message
12:40 <@heinrich5991> another correction:
12:41 <@heinrich5991> the header is the teehistorian uuid followed by a zero-terminated string containing json in a self-explanatory format

16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Admin @Dev @Moderator sorry for the HL, please have a look at the issue & tell me your input?
16:34 <+Gabee> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1141 people
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I don't wanna post anything on the general channel yet I wanna know what you think of it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> don't ping mod for that
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> literally the channel description and #welcome tells you to ping dev..
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> merge ddnet into vanilla? lol
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you know there is a guy called oy @Gabbo
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oy said that ddnet is antiteeworlds
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> oy blocks everything and doesnt do anything himself :thonkery:  RIP
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> even vanilla community is unhappy xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think he would never accept merging a mod
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is anti modifications
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> he doesnt accept any changes i think
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12115
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at this issue: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1489 closed without any response from oy
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how oy works
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> censorship everywhere ðŸ‘€
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :thonkery:
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its another level
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :danAmazing:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Guys
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> No matter what
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Please let him respond
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> If he doesn't respond it means he's not open for dialog
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> And therefore you can break away from Teeworlds
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Gabbo no srsly first we have to change the oy situation before anything happens
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and we need broadcasts bgack o.O
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think ddnet already broke away from tw
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u mean tw compatibility?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u mean tw backwards compatibility?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I'm just confronting the guy to the reality: he's all alone, I show a screenshot of what teeworlds is today: only mods
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> tw backwards compatibility
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I still use the vanilla client
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I tried DDNet and while it's nice, it has too many stuff in here
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤·
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like ddnet client, i dont use teeworlds client since long time
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can u even run vanilla on mac?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for me it doidnt work sicn eages
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for me it didnt work sicne ages
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well im assuming ur using mace becauae of the screenshots in the issue
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Gabbo "DDNet is bloated as fuck, full of useless features, ugly" ???
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i disagree
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     It is ugly (colors, in text, in the interface)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     It has too many functions (you can change the font in game, the red laser, you have two server listsâ€¦)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     It doesn't make sense, at all
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     And I am personally forced to play full screen, it doesn't support the small window I'm used to play with
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> many functions that you can use default values, such as the laser color and wont be diferent yet you enable other people with other opinions to use the cusotmization they like more
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its bad thing
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the colored texts i find them lot nicer
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> colors are good to distinguish things, it's not like they are just there to make it look fancy
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you want to merge ddnet but kill it at same time?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo>

17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> This category should not be there
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use vanilla
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and let us have our nice customization
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> So what you're saying
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> It sucks because oy is kicking us away from the project and doesn't want to fix or try and fix things
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> But you just did the exact same thing @Ryozuki
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what sucks? i don't care at all about teeworlds, i like ddnet and want it to remain a mod or even be standalone
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao Okay then but the "HUD" is just too much :/
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where do you change font btw
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> never knew about that
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why changing font is a bad thing?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont understand
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao that's what I'm talking about, the HUD
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let people customize the way they want
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Gabbo oy already kinda answered to your problematic in ryozuki's link :
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> `When I started playing Teeworlds, there were usually just 2 servers with people playing - that was fine. If it goes back to that - still fine. It was never the aim to get a lot of players, it's a niche product, even though it attracted lots of players during time. People start and stop playing games, that's life. Games die and people move on.
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> The current development status is a combination of things: lack of time, people become inactive, stuff Magnet mentions here and that the game is pretty much perfect the way it is.
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> Teeworlds always has been about simplicity and minimalism and that's not going to change. It's not turning into an anti-Teeworlds like ddnt or become mod-friendly etc.. If someone isn't happy with what Teeworlds is.

17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ``test``
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @snail I was totally unaware of that
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> changing font shoulnt be a problem
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the hud might be blown and issnt needed in offical teeworlds client thats ture
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon changing font is not a problem because you can't I'm talking about the colors
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `The source is open-source, use it, make your own thing, fulfil your dreams. No hard feelings, that's part of the game.` thats what ddnet did
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and our dreams are fulfilled
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Yes, in the game it's white for text, yellow for server, and there should be more colors
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Depending on the announcement etc
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didn't you say colors are bad
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i thought
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> maybe he means logo etc
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao yes because you set them
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao the HUD is too much in the interface
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> and the ping color too
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Not necessary imo
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is it bad?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My proposal for DDNet:
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     Clean DDNet so it looks exactly like Teeworlds``` this is a big no from me
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and complete nonsense since oy will fully block it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its really good to be able to customize everything, maybe just hide it behind an "advanced settings" button but removing it would suck
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is ping color bad? you can see on a glance whether the server has a good ping or not instead of having to actually read the ping
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Gabbo what do you even mean by merge? do u want to add freeze to vanilla gametype?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon yes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats not going to happen
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the vanilla communitee dislikes it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon and I wanna see the DDNet admins in charge of the teeworlds project because teeworlds is stalling
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and oy wont do that
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Even if the vanilla community is 1% of the teeworlds/ddnet community?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so before you are going to start this wild plan you should fix the oy problem
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as oy said, games die, he wants teeworlds to die and so it will be
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ddnet admins are overwhelmed with ddnet already, how should they find time to maintain even more
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki he wants it to die?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he doesnt care
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u read snail quote
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> So I'm gonna remove my shitty proposal
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its not "shitty" but just unrealistic given oy's mindset
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ur simply skipping an important step
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (and dont worry, vanilla players are also annoyed by oy)
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt merge ddnet but rather implement things that ddnet has into teeworlds
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and keep ddnet as it is, a mod
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @snail That was the point: having a teeworlds vanilla wouldn't affect the gameplay, so there would not be any "but it's ugly, but there's too many this and that" etc, it would be good looking, no excuse possible
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of games do thaty
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of games do that
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they can start by adding the N players feature
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> If he says no to basically DDNet being the new teeworlds looking exactly like teeworldsâ€¦ well. I tried?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> cuz I know he will say no
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the solution would probably be to take the code and create a teeworlds 2.0 with new master servers, active devs etc
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> totally parting away with the current ones
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but that would split players anyway
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teewars.com
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @snail Should I remove my issue?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> do as u wish
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but ur gonna talk to a wall anyway xd
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if he even answers
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> but your idea of a teeworlds 2.0
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> or ddnet 2.0
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> is a good thing
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Because it will finally improve teeworlds
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> As in, the features, the gameplay
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon thanks for the answer but now I realize it was dumb to post this
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao I know they are, that's why I'm willing to help..?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I could make some time to help the project, I have some ressources to share as well (like, if you need a good build server, or hosting website etc.
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no a fork is bad
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> loosing all the players that go to teeworlds.com or get it on steam
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we just have to fix the official situation
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we have to show that the whole communitee is agianst oy then something has to happen
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but oy has to make it happen
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt ther eany inactive magnus behind him who could do something if he sees his whole game community is agianst the guy he selected to maintain it
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don't think so
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon that's exactly why I provided the second screenshot, to make him realize no one plays the official games that much
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon heinrich is in favor of the merge
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then we have to show even more community power to convince oy himself
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I play more vanilla than ddrace
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao yes but you still play ddrace or you played once
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> without ddnet this wouldn't be possible but now you can realize pretty easily that ddnet is huge
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i sometimes have the feeling jao is ddnet xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what wouldn't be possible without ddnet?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @jao https://ddnet.tw/ranks/ all these people playing and having fun
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have fun in the ddnet mod
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not in teeworlds
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet is part of teeworlds
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would like it to be standalone
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its fully based on the pure and awesome vanilla physics
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that would be wrong
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddrace only added freeze
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the most fun is pure teeworlds physics
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that freeze turned the game into a coop mode
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is diferent than teeworlds
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it changed a lot
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like counter strike was a mod of half life
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it went its own game
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ddnet would be shit without teeworlds
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also had the things half life had
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imagine a 2d game with hook and freze
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think it would be shit
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would suck without teeworlds core
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> When I say teeworlds
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I include everything
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> DDnet is teeworlds
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon i dont mean to delete teeworlds physicis lol
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stop spllitting ddnet
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> whole teeworlds is nice
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet source would stay as it is
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it would be its own game
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what  i mean with standalone
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> even the name "teeworlds" is better than ddnet, no offense guys
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so you can break backwards compatibility with the original game
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and because teeworlds physics are gold the best part is stolen from teeworlds if u take it away and claim it as your own standalone work
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your opinion
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see no problem
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds is open source
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do that
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even oy said to do that
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and breaking compatibility is even worse
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the heart of open source
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh we have a oy fanboi here
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me? no
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not only ddnet is nice
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not saying that..
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im necking you because im mad that you want to go away with ddnet
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fine
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would destroy the playerbase even more if we split into multiple games
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> currently the playerbase is ddnet
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it wouldnt destroy anything
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just make it more obvius
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no its not
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there are other mods
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that teeworlds dont have lot ofp layers
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these mods could adapt to ddnet
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and these other mods are pretty good too
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like they did with teeworlds
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and alsp break compatiblity?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these mods? idk idc
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is this even a feature
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they could show in the ddnet masterserver
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> breaking things
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think u get what i mean
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> compatibility is nice
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @Ryozuki if I play on vanilla and ddnet didn't work, I wouldn't get the ddnet client.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fine
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no not fine
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we would loose a tee then
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> please add multiple server dummy like in k client xD
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> maybe make a lighter ddnet client for teeworlds merging and keep a full functionnality ddnet client. But yeah I agree on something has to be done to make teeworlds great again
18:16  * bridge [ddnet] <Gabbo> gives a cookie to @Amu~Cookie
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> double work
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just tested out the dummy feature from k client and i think its cool, maybe only 2 tees per server so if youre on server 1 with tee 1 you can toggle dummy like always using your toggle dummy key to tee2 on server 1 xd. in esc menu you can switch to the other server and there the same
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> much work i guess but would be extremely cool
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what for
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> swag
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just like that feature^^
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is very usefull @Im 'corneum starting multiple clients all the time and tabbing so so annyoing if you play on multiple servers
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2 tees per server is enough i think
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we dont need that 64p support xd
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would love to see the double dummy boundle
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with 2x2 dummys on one server
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that doesnt make any sense
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it does
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok a bit
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u still have the old dummytoggle bnd
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for 2 tees
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but what about multi server and then connect to the same server again? hmm
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and a new bind for toggeling the two dummy pairs
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it would be like i said
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> mods could moderate 2 servers at once ðŸ˜®
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> see
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everyone is happy with that
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> devs!! ðŸ˜„
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @ChillerDragon on OSX you cannot open teeworlds twice
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Gabo inc
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> blown feature xd
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh he is also pro this feature
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and you can Gabbo xd
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Well
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> I don't know how
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you need multiple apps
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> f3 too tab between them in fullscreen
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but this is super annoying

18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so is there any dev who can code that?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it would be lot of work
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk

19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Brew is a package manager with its repository
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Have you ever used GNU/Linux?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i also use brew a lot
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Or even the app store on osx
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> the idea is: never download from outside
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Only get it through brew
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but how do the packages get thee
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> by default brew doesn't have much but cask is a nice extension
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did some1 register teeworlds there and it got accepted?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> yes

19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> yep
