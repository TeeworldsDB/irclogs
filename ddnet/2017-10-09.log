17:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what does it for?
17:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah, that's from IRC
17:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it means that the moderators have to approve everyone before they can send messages
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on IRC?
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like voice rang ?
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like voice rank
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like voice rang
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> rank was right ðŸ˜›
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like voice rank
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> D
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `+m` is a mode for a channel
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it means that the channel is moderated
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> each user need `+v` before they can talk
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okaay, i understand. And you want to make it in teeworlds
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or? it's just irc related ðŸ˜„
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> omg, i hate that emoticon ":D"
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> looks stupid
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> omg, i hate that emoticone ":D"
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> omg, i hate that emoticon ":D"
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> emoticon was right ... ðŸ˜„
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tsiii1! .
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hahahah
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, for teeworlds
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> \ðŸ˜„
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I made such thing on vanilla tournament mod
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i guess
17:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Or no, something simillar. Sorry ðŸ˜›
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I made 3 options, like everyone can talk, only players in-game can talk (then spectators could talk only on team chat)
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and Only moderators
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sound simillar, but without +v option :/
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yep
17:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sounds simillar, but without +v option :/
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Where it would be used for?
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Where it would be used for? That feature
17:40 <+Henningstone> Savander: are you aware that the discord-bot re-posts your whole message again and again every time you edit it...? :D
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol, really?
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜ƒ
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> o.O! Sorry!!
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> shouldn't be a problem
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> for a situation when a specific server is targeted while a mod is present
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Can't imagine, hmm
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> suppose you're on a server to ban someone
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but instead of staying away for some time, they immediately come back using various IPs
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's a situation where that could help
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay, so it's fighting against spammers and dicks
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Cool stuff, should be implemented
17:55 <+ochristi> keep in mind there are not so many players around who can baby sit jerks or are they? :)
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it helps that they can do it if they keep coming back, I think
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Baaaah why has this failed now? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/880
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hmm.
