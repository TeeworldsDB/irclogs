02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 are you going to do advent of code?
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (starting after sleeping two more times)
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I missed all the previous ones, maybe I might
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> was the hook roll sound added back in?
03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nvm i was just on a troll custom server
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> was it headbot server
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea
04:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> lmao
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol

08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Is this the only difference between 0.6 and 0.7 Maps?
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> + The datafile structure did not change?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Hi , i think i'm too much ambitious  did someone know if it's possible to transform a Python array in .map file ?
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Hi , i think i'm too much ambitious but did someone know if it's possible to transform a Python array in .map file ?
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Hi , i think i'm too much ambitious but did someone know if it's possible to transform a Python array in .map file or some edit map file ?
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> `.map` files are structured binary files -> you can read/write files like this in any language -> yep it's possible in python
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Az2Poivron https://github.com/ddnet/tml is in python and kind of works, but not 100%. heinrich5991's libtw2 works better
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should've linked here, this probably works better and @timakro  can help you if there are problems: https://github.com/timakro/tml
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Ok thank , and did you think it could be interesting to create a program that generate Gores template with drawing ?
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Like we give this draw and my program with generate the base of the map
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/782884527865200660/unknown.png
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds like a fun project, but I don't know Gores enough to know if the maps would end up being fun ðŸ˜„
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Like we give this draw and my program will generate the base of the map
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/782884527865200660/unknown.png
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Ok , i will try to make it in the future week
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Ok , i will try to make it in the next week
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Ok , i will try to make it in the next weeks
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> @onbgy send hlp some1 suggested client side bots for vanilla client :D
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Az2Poivron cool project but I know that a similar project got rejected by QshaR on KoG (if I remember well)
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> someone tried to send some maps that were auto-generated and QshaR just said no
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet also hosts some Gores maps, maybe our @Tester s have an opinion ^
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> Oh ok , it's not for generating a finish map but just the structure
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> @Az2Poivron when coming from a python array as pointed out already the python lib tml is probably good but it is also easy to convert an array to json and then convert the json to a map using https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion:ddnet: 
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> allow a dummy to play with the same name and points
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :poggers:
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://adventofcode.com/
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tomorrow
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> https://i.imgur.com/8Ta9gi7.png
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Is this the only difference between 0.6 and 0.7 Maps?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> + The datafile structure did not change?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Create a Teeworlds/DDNet leaderboard and send code
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> join the private ddnet/tw leaderboard with this code: `677828-82ec4df2`
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (u need to be authed)
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @stnwtr ^
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis :poggers:
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :feelsamazingman: idk how to code
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/783027004311732224/unknown.png
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe someone can fetch every 15 mins this and display it on this discord https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private/view/677828.json
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would be cool
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cc @jao <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont have enough time to do it this year sadly :justatest:
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> join anyway
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Sadge:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I'm in (stnwtr)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what even is this
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is it like those coding puzzles
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's going to be a task
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on the first day it's going to be something like "sum up all the odd numbers in this list"
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you'll send your result to the website
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also puzzles have more than 1 part, usually from easy to harder
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> always 2 parts
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> completing a part gives stars
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> second part is unlocked if you do the first one
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_OmgMask:
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/783039538800230440/unknown.png
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> already 1st
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw u have to make the program locally, the website gives u some input i think and u get the result locally
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u put the result there
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> In the first part it's often some algorithm which you have to use in a more complex context for part 2
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> You can see the tasks of the previous years btw
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_OmgMask:
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/783047965584785438/unknown.png
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will try to play this year, but I'm a little lacking in motivation nowadays, so only if I feel like it ðŸ˜›
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ‘€
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do it in rust
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> py only language for global leaderboards
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I think)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 wdym
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont submit any code
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only answers
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but how are you going to add all odd numbers in a list in rust in 30s?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah speed matters?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> for the leaderboards, ye
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for global leaderboard, 1st place gets 100pts, 100th place gets 1pt I think
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 js is also blazing fast for these kinds of things
