16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ddnet seems to crash when i tabbed out for longer times. i have to kill it with task manager
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> If I often step out of the map editor (desktop) my mouse cursor disappears. Is this already fixed? (I  think im on ver. 11.5)
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> what happened with the new sdl exe? If i try to copy it to ath client, i dont have sound anymore xd.

18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> what happened with the new sdl file? If i try to copy it to ath client, i dont have sound anymore xd.
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, we had to change something for sound in the code: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/d9d3ed783ee70cbd5afa05d1d09411f330b23b39
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get a completely black screen on mac os :/
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> there's a recently closed issue about that, related to borderless
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they should just starting fixing their mess. SDL has to be as simple as that you want borderless and it's borderless, if you don't care about DPI scaling, no DPI scaling, and not makros in our code that split code for the different OSs.
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the backend_sdl.cpp contains too much makros if you ask me
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> @deen and can I somehow change that? im noob developer xd
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> @Shyzo | Alex you download your client's source code, you add those 3 lines at the same exact place and you compile it, ath has the instructions for that part on github
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> eh ok. ill look into that and im going pro developer mode then °!°
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> btw, is antiping from ddnet and ath different? I notice differences. I notice differences in the client too though. so probably isnt an antiping thing. still wanna ask though^^
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ath sucks
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> no idea i don't user ath and i don't use antiping ^^
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he only asks, because he wants to use DDNet and doesnt believe me that it runs just as smooth xD
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> use ddnet version 10
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> best of both worlds
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 11 5-6k FPS best
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not laggy like ddnet 10, not a shjtty cheat client like ath
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not laggy like ddnet 11, not a shjtty cheat client like ath
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 11**8
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 11 = perfect frame times no laggs, no tearing nothing
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not for me
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what kind of lags tho @onby 
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more input delay or just spikes?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fps lag
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> noticeably lower fps
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont remember exactly when but even deen confirmed that he noticed the difference
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> in this discord
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when ddnet was in debug mode
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> user experience is the most important thing so i'd like to sort that out
