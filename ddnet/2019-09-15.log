13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh btw @fokkonaut regarding your filescore problem do you get
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dbg_msg("filescore", "opening '%s' for writing failed", pSelf->SaveFile().c_str());
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in the beginning of your logs? (sowwy irc peeps)
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did not investigate at all but i get this error in latest ddnet and it also kills /rank obviously.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am not sure, will check later
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I am glad I am not the only one. Can this be fixed? 🙏
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> If this is the problem we have a point to start looking at 🙂 but as i said didnt investigate just an idea
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is this even?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean your pr
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, i dont get that message btw
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was trying to split out voting in a testable subclass, but voting is just way too entangled with gamecontext, if anyone has an idea to abstract it out lmk
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut hm sad so its probably me having a fucked up setup. Well my pr was just about if you provid a more complex map path like sv_map "foo/bar/baz.map" it wont search for baz_records.dtb but for something messed up like foo-bar-baz_records.dtb it is a edge case because most people have no subfolders in their map directorys
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I just added a little bit stability test for ddnet++ circleci. Its a client that parses cmdlist and then spams chat commands with randomly generated arguemnts and does some random movements and reconnects. Then it authenticates and shutsdown the server with rcon after 40 seconds. The server runs with gdb and shows a backtrace.
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So in case a commit messes up basic functionality as chat/join/cmds player or player movement circleci would catch that. I was wondering if this is somethig that would be usefull for ddnet as well?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like a great idea
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ok I will try an pr when I find time.
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The risk is getting a failed or timeouted circleci when my buggy client dies even when ddnet master is stable
