08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think this actually had me debug some shit once because it didnt crash on different args but i was just not getting the return value i expected since i was not calling the method i was expecting to call :D 
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C is the clear winner here

10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe if too many sign up and something goes out of hand ill change it to rustrocks
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for now i used it because deen is pro nim contributor and its the ddnet test server pw
10:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nim rocks but not in ddnet code base? ü§®
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no but nim was used to build hookrace

10:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do i have to paste password each time i reload the page? ._.
10:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no it uses cookies to store the password
10:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it not work for you?
10:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
10:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watfak
10:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> doesnt work
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you have cookies off or something?
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any errors in the console?

10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep thats the problem
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks
10:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u have it on github?
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/discord-irc
10:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can i pull request some things? üòÑ
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sure thatd be cool
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think you can even connect to the official backend i host for testing
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> otherwise hosting the backend is also just one ``npm run start``
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feel free to spam in #off-topic its just bridged to irc
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So are you going to debug the cookie issue? otherwise i would look into it now @MilkeeyCat 
10:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill start looking at the code rn :owo:
10:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can fix it xd
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok how do i reproduce? wat os? wat browser? 
10:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> gentoo btw üòè and firefox
10:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what does ``document.cookie`` look like?
10:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and password xd
10:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198200448134422538/image.png?ex=65be0a20&is=65ab9520&hm=da7ad3d62c54671b6b71a144594e3b719375f03c58e5d034395cb21fb9c9d7eb&
10:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm i also use firefox. Is mine too old?
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``"user_settings={\"active_plugins\":[\"alert_popup\",\"infinite_scroll\",\"typing\",\"tenor\",\"emoji_picker\"]}; username=ChillerDragon; password=xx``
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> interesting i got backslashes
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what firefox version u have?
10:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe i need some devel version to reproduce it on debian
10:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198200990189506580/image.png?ex=65be0aa1&is=65ab95a1&hm=7ee04aaaddde3760641d6f054418fc04fbc24f7ebce338c1689c406869ef1362&
10:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705743823.png
10:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> debian moment
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait i think backslashes dont matter since your browser just uses fancy backtick strings and mine double quotes
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea idk wat the issue is
10:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> eeeh, is it ok that i modified a file and git says nothing changed ;-;
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which file u mod?
10:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> with passwords üòÑ
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> check the .gitignore
10:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont even have it
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat? xd
10:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have readme and file with passwords
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah that thing
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``git check-ignore -v passwordfile.txt``
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nothing printed
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok then it should show changes
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and nothing changed
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a gg
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk wat u do bro sounds sus
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i added password for ur website xd
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah makes sense
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm did the ``sha1sum`` of the file change?
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you really save it?
10:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
10:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i loaded it 5 times to check that it has ur password
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bruv idk how that could not be tracked in git
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i track all kinds of files including binary since 2019 in git and never had somethig untracked
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless i edited the wrong file/forgot to save. Or it was gitignored
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got catalan rocks

10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> nothing is more chad than making ur own language
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe u run in a sha1sum collision and broke git
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> and making ur own os
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> and all is urs made
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> its my objective as a programmer
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill be a trevor but ill be sane mentally
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> both files have the smae sha1sum
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> same*
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat about ``sha256sum``
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or ``hexdiff``
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill be a davis but ill be sane mentally
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought git can handle check sum collsions
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> since holyc exists
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> bruh
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198203616197099540/image.png?ex=65be0d13&is=65ab9813&hm=6cc96673f9e787475835cf7c27383513a2ab654c5cbc4754897e23265ccefee0&
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill name it holyrust
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> milkeey dats the same file bruv
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> NO ITS NOT
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless hexdiff shows diff
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> *going to check again*
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if u dont have hexdiff installed i think u can write ur own in 1 line of bash ```diff <(xxd uwu.kdbx) <(/tmp/anime/uwu.kdbx)``
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aa
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``diff <(xxd uwu.kdbx) <(xxd /tmp/anime/uwu.kdbx)``
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> editing messages be like
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if that cmd shows no output its the same fakin file
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> Is the output good even?
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> if sha says same hash
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its probs same file
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless ur extremely lucky and found a colision
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> If only care about same file just hash it yeah
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is probs not the case
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we checked hash 
10:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> its not ;-'
10:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> its not ;-;
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not printing?
10:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i opened both one have new password and one doesnt xd
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ur fault for naming files uwu and owo
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then its the same file
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> Unless a malicious party is involved even md5 is fine to check
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do u open them in?
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> keepassxc
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato hash collisions are a thing
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe ur keepassxc caches or shit
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs not if he saved
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its file based
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> database
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> encrypted
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> Wild hash collisions aren't really a thing
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude watafak then happend
10:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: `diff <(xxd uwu.kdbx) <(/tmp/anime/uwu.kdbx)` whats `xxd` in the command
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> do man xxd
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send 2nd i sent
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> bruv ur gentoo user right
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> read the man
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> Md5 you can craft collisions, but they won't look natural at all
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> man up
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg first cmd i sent was bugged
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> NAME
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>        xxd - make a hex dump or do the reverse.

10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh wait
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> why i have xxd
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not emerged
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it some core utils
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``echo AAA | xxd``
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``00000000: 4141 410a                                AAA.``
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> Xxd comes with vim
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur output colorized chiller
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i assume that helps with diffing a binary file
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i came up with it on the spot
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> u diff binaries with hash
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use neovim üòè
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is not much to diff
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> as a human
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> Unless you are reverse engineering polish trains
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> non program binaries
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> has collision is the last idea i have other than user error
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> *

11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so bigger @diariesvexar ?
11:07 < bridge> <diariesvexar> yes
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> otherwise same?
11:08 < bridge> <diariesvexar> to be able press enter for next line or see whole text with width limitation
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure there is some height property anywhere. But line wrapping would probably require some adjustments
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i see no output aaaaand one still have new password xd
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat that means not a single byte i different
11:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198207566904295435/image.png?ex=65be10c1&is=65ab9bc1&hm=e70282495d6208e7862d8560f5b9f08973caaea9e463ca618d53c8de9b7dea66&
11:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i moved it and renames
11:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i moved it and renamed
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send the file so i can check
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510> 
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait isnt it public anyways? :D 
11:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im gonna send u 2 files and say the master password u dont thing that  im crazy
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also need your master key
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono im trustworthy
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we just tell the others to look away real quick
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> master key is not enough tho
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you also have kdbx 2fa?
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with sms? xd
11:10 < bridge> <diariesvexar> @chillerdragon can I send you a short video and ask you a question ?
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar sure
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: u need an image
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i might not know the answer
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robsti and jopsti are better with inputs
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and tsfred
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ws-client
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi wazzup
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat like a png?
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> exactly .png
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you do some img master key shenanigans like we talked about a few weeks ago?
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i found an image i like
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats so cool
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> downloaded it
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it nsfw?
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lame
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you download it again if you loose it?
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :santatrollet:
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how stable?
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it already got removed
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> LMAO
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u gonna lose all ur passwords
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it was on the same place for fukcing 3 years
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hahaha
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and when i decided to use it
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> its gone
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rip
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ive sent it to my friends
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so its still oneline
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do they know what it is?
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> online
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> üòÑ
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and have you seen robstis meme about it?
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yeye
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> have you sent it on whatsapp and it got compressed?
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use telegram üòè
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it doesnt compress?
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and will never?
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can send it as a file
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> not as an img
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe sending it zipped is safer
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> against compression
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte shared a meme?
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how did i miss that
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> about image compression
11:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so if u decide to change the image or save it again it wont be the same :santatrollet:
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> back when i was meeting 17 y olds in bulgaria
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which u didnt
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is good for the kid
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc my lawyer says i didnt
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks lawyer jopsti for saving my ass
11:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks https://xkcd.com/1683/ thats what robyt sent
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ u remember when we recommended to use base64 encoded ddnet logo as master pw for milkeeys public kbdxdxeepass file?
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then robsti sent this epic meme which points out some dark and real threat in this situation
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how can it be the same fukcing file and still have new data in it
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> black magic
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like ur pw file compresses really good
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 100% compression rate
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds web scale
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how the hell can it upload it then? Xd
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u dont have to 
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the same file
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on download you just have to uncompress it correctly
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:trollchungus:1010641652920098887> 
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok so
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have 2 files
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if i open one
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have new data
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if i open the other one it doesnt have xd
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gentoo issue
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah i remeber that... didnt know it was robyte sending it xd
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc robsti memelord
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> secret skill
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone dropped a bathing suite on my door step 
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok watfak i feel like i wasted the whole day on irc again
11:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> aaaand new password is gone
11:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> great
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds like progress to me
11:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
11:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now it makes sense at least
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont worry i have your password stored in plaintext
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can just ask me :D 
11:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have it in my cookies as plain text xd
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> true that too :D
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jospti
11:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> jopsti
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let's assume you the richest person on earth in every time, in which time would you like to live:
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a. 1700
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> b. 1800
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> c. 1900
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> d. 2000
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e. 2100
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> f. antique
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 2100
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yolo
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk if world is fakin apocalypse but i full gamble
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u rich then anyway üòè
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> world can get real fucked so that being rich doesnt safe too much
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> Easily 2000
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is it a trick question and the answer is d. 2000?
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato gets it because thats the only time frame we are alive
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no trick question, philosophical
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no use in being rich when you are not born yet or dead already
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u are time traveling to that point ofc
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with ur current age
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you dont care about moni it might be just that as a factor then
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> newer is always better
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 why 2000
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> 2000 is perfect time to have the most money. Even 2000s normal workers have better living conditions than kings of the past
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they might have better stuff in 2100
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> 2100 is unknown, no need to gamble
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i see you play it safe
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u'd die 24 years earlier
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but otherwise you would agree that so far the later the more cool stuff rich ppl could do right?
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs 24 years already passed
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak jopsti keeps making stuff up
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd probably choose between antique and 2100
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> What if a worker revolution happened and the richest in that time is just 2 bread loaves richer than the normal person?
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in 2100 im 24 older? and in antique i am how old?
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> antique is cool, bcs u have insane knowledge + money 2000 years ago
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude u need to explain more
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and 2100 is cool bcs u in a world where u know absolutely nothing
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i assume i time travel 
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u basically the stone age person there xD
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or get born there
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> Antique is fun for a bit, but even with all the knowledge of semiconductors you can't make any
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no it's 2024, if u travel to 2000 u lost 24 years
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already know 2000 yeras
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true but u could accelerate thinking by an insane amount xD
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah as in you repeat stuff so its boring?
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you can make internal combustion engine powered vehicles for some king and conquer the world together, assuming he doesnt burn you for being a witch
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xxdd
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think repeating from 2000 while being rich is any boring
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can end slavery
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with ur overpowered machine guns
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you will life a totally different life 
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> live a life i guess
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> english hard
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not what i mean chiller
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why lose then?
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > Maybe you can make internal combustion engine powered vehicles
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let's say u get 100 years.. then u'll see the year 2100
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if u now travel back 24 years, u'll defs not see it
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah 
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> Sadly a lot of things require precision machining. The bootstrapping problem kinda forces you to start inventing stuff from the very start of the tech tree even if you know the end of the tree
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well if you are richest person
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and u focus on surviving you might see it
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but i guess guns are rather ez
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean machine guns are probably hard
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but guns are already OP xD
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> You can do muskets without unlocking precision machining
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe bolt action rifles too
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd defs be a funny experiment
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> remember u are the richest
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so nothing changes?
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u can put lot of effort into it
11:34 < bridge> <learath2> It'd definitely be fun. But I'd rather experience the most prosperous time in human history as the modern ruler of the world
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would buy drugs and hookers and die on day 1
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in any time 
11:34 < bridge> <learath2> LOL
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> getting so rich so quick fucks with your head
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i trust u in that statement
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> I'd also invent facebook and start an electric vehicle company. Just so I can block zuckerberg and musk from becoming rich
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> most lottery winners were broke and or dead few years later (source some creepy pasta yt video)
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say 2024
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 mark will steal your invention either way
11:36 < bridge> <learath2> Oh and amazon so I can stop bezos
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's 20. january, so u basically just want to work 20 days longer
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustup doc is a thing btw
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> offline docs ftw
11:37 < bridge> <learath2> I'm the richest man on earth, I'll make him disappear if he tries
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> also cargo vendor
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> im prepared to program rust above 10km
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the air
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its 10km idk rn
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak lerato casual death threats
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510> 
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> learath knows the game
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> Not a death threat, just a nice permanent vacation to siberia
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> with putin
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and  his opponent
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think his political opponent is in siberia
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok enuff shittalk for today
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good thought experiment jopsti
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u live for shittalk
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or just send him 100 wifes.. bcs that was his main motivation as lone nerd without any contact to female beings
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bye
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe he looses interest
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and to play ddnet on the mountains
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: cya bae
11:38 < bridge> <learath2> Not the worst idea
12:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do u not have rebuild on save in discord-irc?
12:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> idk I don‚Äôt like using such stuff. If it‚Äôs not there it should be like 1 line change in package.json to set it up. Webpack is for sure capable of doing so.
12:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do u run `npm start` after every save? xd
12:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I run build yes
12:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> -.-
12:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Add ‚Äîwatch to webpack
12:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you want that
12:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i already did it üòè
12:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pro and it works?
12:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just need to reload the page
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i fixed the bug üòè
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now im trying to make a pull request :pepeW:
13:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pro
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> amazing thanks @MilkeeyCat rolled out your change to production
13:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :owo:
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did it work? maybe you need to relogin i guess
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does it have to show a login form with data in it?
13:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> whoopsie daisy
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i get this when reload

13:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and does it work?
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i press login and all works
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:1008007455936094328> 
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to add custom emotes? xd
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think there is some emotes.ts
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i added ids and names to array
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you also need css
13:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> check some commit that added some
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh
13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so some emotes only need an id and others need more
13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a bit of an mess xd
13:51 < ws-client> <MilkeeyCat> <:owo:1154794204871008397>

13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that looks broken
13:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do i need other size? :thonk:
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> probably the discord api accepts a size arg
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also btw there is download_emotes.sh
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just realized xd
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think it parses the js and then does a download for you
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198262265976197160/RDT_20240120_1446165079903008390550011.jpg?ex=65be43b2&is=65abceb2&hm=c3153aa62835f3a2ee1892295d0cd2e418243c82c8b7ee99bb3299a234c0e3f6&
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why does rust suck so insanely hard?
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like it's worse than java & python

15:27 < bridge> <zhn> @heinrich5991 i messed up set-rescue workflow, what can i do? delete existing pr and repropose i in new onet?
15:27 < bridge> <zhn> @heinrich5991 i messed up set-rescue workflow, what can i do? delete existing pr and repropose it in new one?
16:26 < bridge> <learath2> Wym messed up workflow
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 recommend me nice tech talks like the polish train
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> sadly the one im fan of doesnt make more talks
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0nh-TdpVg
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe ill rewatch it anyway
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> Is C++ interesting to you?
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its about advanced c++ techniques not rly
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its about programming in general yes
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> smth i could replicate with rust
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> or assembly stuff
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> multithreading
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know good ghidra and RE long tutorials that are good?
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> No, RE is something I found mostly requires on hand practice
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got ghidra on my mac ill probs tinker with it
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Liveoverflow's channel is nice to watch, and stacksmashing
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> again
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i was about to download current anime but i think the person by my side would look at me weird
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is some weird anime this season :justatest:
16:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> look him deep in the eyes while turning the volume up slowly up until 100%
16:36 < bridge> <zhn> git reset --soft HEAD~7 lead to soft reset of master merges
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> a animeabout magical girl but the MC girl is a evil magical girl into bdsm :justatest:
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> a anime about magical girls but the MC girl is a evil magical girl into bdsm :justatest:
16:36 < bridge> <zhn> led*
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> If the remote branch pointer is still at the correct place, you can just reset hard to that
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> Frieren is a nice and publicly watchable
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i got the last ep to watch
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> im keeping up with it so only 1 ep to see
16:38 < bridge> <zhn> for some reason i have ddnet/ddnet origin instead of gerdoe-jr/ddnet
16:38 < bridge> <zhn> cloned second one tho
16:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> git remote -v shows ddnet/ddnet?
16:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> weird
16:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> `git remote -v` shows ddnet/ddnet?
16:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> `git remote -v` shows ddnet/ddnet? you would need to change origin for that to happen no?
16:39 < bridge> <zhn> wtf
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Thay sounds impossible, you had to have manually changed it, or maybe you used some tool that isn't git to clone it
16:39 < bridge> <zhn> it showed me ddnet/ddnet last time
16:39 < bridge> <zhn> now its gerdoe-jr xddddd
16:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
16:39 < bridge> <zhn> no, i used git bash on windows kekw
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you checked the remote in a dream, happened to me once
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> I fixed an entire bug, woke up, had breakfast, checked my pc and i hadn't fixed it
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> Just dreamt of fixing it
16:40 < bridge> <zhn> happened to me once xd
16:40 < bridge> <zhn> strange feeling
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i get inspired when shitting
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> or before sleep
16:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: nice edlang syntax highlight support xD

16:41 < bridge> <zhn> thanks for letting us know ryo xd
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd epic
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw edlang compiles basic stuff rn
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it uses MLIR
16:41 < bridge> <zhn> wait for its superiour

16:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> .txt - `REEEEEE`
16:43 < bridge> <zhn> i was cooking for dinner one time and was thinking about how to implement some shit i did whole week and it ended up like this too xd
16:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> haha its horrible
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if without `()` :feelsbadman:
16:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `if` without `()` :feelsbadman:
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye its better
16:44 < bridge> <zhn> optionable
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> Sometimes in shower I'll come up with wrong solutions to coding problems
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> Like I'll be sure I solved it, get out, program it, it has a glaring flaw üòÑ
16:49 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i dont need to be in the shower for that to happen :pepeW:
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> If I came up with it outside shower it's usually correct, something about showers makes me not notice some flaws
16:54 < ws-client> <MilkeeyCat> ```rs let foo = "http://localhost:42069";```
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> You know when I can never find the solution? When I'm in front of the computer
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:owo:1154794204871008397> 
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks @MilkeeyCat 
17:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i got an achievement :owo:
17:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198297384967487590/image.png?ex=65be6467&is=65abef67&hm=f2f9c8286b955b48fb4a9bb4c2c887d2f6c636596aef34c60b970b7e49a21a0f&
17:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it didnt ping btw
17:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt ping u
17:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i pinged @MilkeeyCat 
17:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh, oke
17:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the bridged pings are case sensitive
17:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somehow it seems like the webchat does not autocomplete discord names if there is an irc name in another casing already
17:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feature
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat ah lmao u found edlang support xd
17:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> regexes are so fun :pepeW:
17:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i always thought pepeW is more happy :D
17:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> W as in worried?
17:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xd
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
17:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there a way to add replies to ur chat chiller?
17:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a open issue
17:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which way you mean?
17:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> write or read?
17:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> read is out of scope for this repo
17:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> like can ws-client know when someone replies
17:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> has to be done in matterbridge
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dis boi does not send the reply info from discord to irc
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it has to be fixed there
17:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do it
17:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :gigachad:
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ._.
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i rather add write only replies
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that i can do in the web frontend
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> by just pining people and resending the message :D 
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pinging*
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> having a threadripper probably also requires u to have 256gb ram
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> because if u are able to use the 128 threads u will use a lot of memory
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> specially at link time
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u buy me 1?
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want one
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> its for llvm dev
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> :Kapp:
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want one, i get one.. from you
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> give
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198304155878559835/image.png?ex=65be6ab6&is=65abf5b6&hm=8fbe2b3b290419fc9a693f69ddee9484533c1c1ddc40228a2426c5656a9f4368&
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> oh my year consumption in one motherboard
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> xd
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> okey its a lie clearly
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> onle 10 months consumption
17:33 < bridge> <zhn> only*
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198312384272539811/GES9V6fWgAATtuZ.png?ex=65be725f&is=65abfd5f&hm=8abbf0fab067fe693f8b78f908d57373c8e4ccc2d406c3b5890038cc5019a4ad&
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> lol did i really make two identical issues with 3 year gap
18:16 < bridge> <robyt3> If I understand the old issue correctly, yes :kek:
18:16 < bridge> <zhn> we had no 'name plate' category in 2020 xd
18:16 < bridge> <zhn> it was in 'general' instead of hud
18:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Makes sense, but the old issue is solved now, right?
18:42 < bridge> <zhn> yeah
19:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> *cries in ryzen 5 3600x*
19:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> out of curiousity - would you guys rather choose:
19:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
19:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> `AMD Ryzen 9 7900X 12C/24T 4.7-5.6Ghz`
19:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
19:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> or the `AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D, 12C/24T 4.4-5.6ghz`
19:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
19:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i dont quite understand why the latter is 100$ more, is it just because of the increased L3-Cache ? 64MB VS 128MB
19:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what kind of use would more memory have?
19:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> what kind of use would more memory storage(?) have?
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes more cache, and thus better efficiency.
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's generally a bit faster
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> better energy consumption?
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> found this one
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1198336703862157493/DB2ppt3.webp?ex=65be8906&is=65ac1406&hm=616b6b23edad4991db8c27c2084085fa2b6d1eebe53013b567658af96fd4f76a&
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno which i'd recommend tho.
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so that chart agrees i guess? xd
19:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh damn, aight i guess 100 more bucks wont hurt ¬∞-¬∞
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well your decision xd
19:45 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> XD
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not that much worth it
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i'd probably also do it, bcs i like more cache, even if i dont notice it
19:45 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i just want a PC that can handle heavy workload for a couple of years, so im not that scared of spending a bit more
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> greed
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could buy 16 cores instead
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for same price
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on the other hand side.. maybe u prefer gaming
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ryzen 7000 to me generally feels overpriced over earlier generations
19:47 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> weii i was thinking about getting the ryzen 9 7950X3D - but that would've been 250 more ¬∞-¬∞
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> intel is as similary good in price/perf
19:47 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> not a big fan of intel
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't be fan of anything
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hardware = benchmarks
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for GPUs ofc driver support would also matter
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for CPUs
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just go after benches
19:53 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> fair
19:53 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> im currently on nvidia, and i hate it with my guts
19:53 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i want my hyprland so bad
19:53 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but i cba to setup wayland with nvidia, to much of a hussle
20:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: how does all this chat thing work. your frontend sends data thru websockets to backend and it uses irc lib to send a message to irc. i cant find in irc-websockets where it receives new messages from irc or how does it have to work? :thonk:
