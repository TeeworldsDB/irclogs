00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> f10 (screenshot) doesn't work when holding alt, ctrl etc.
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it did work before
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> because alt is "show chat" for me and I wanted to screenshot it
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik what is "before"? We added support for combined key binds and it probably stopped working intentionally since then.
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> idk some time ago
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If it's just about screenshotting the chat, you can use cl_showchat 2.
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> nobies
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 not easy to avoid a dynamic allocation when replacing items in a snapshot
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> will have to wait until I'm back to having more time to spend on this
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah a ringbuffer would work
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When SNAP_PREV changes can reuse the space left from it's replacements
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure how well it'd work with the deltas though
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would having two reusable buffers for SNAP_CURRENT and SNAP_PREV work?
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would require copying between the buffers whenever we move cur to prev
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one could keep an index
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> each time we swap it we invert the index
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no copying around needed
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> One question
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> If dd will be on steam its possible to normally custom own client? I meant skins entities etc.
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> you can customize your teeworlds client for now too xd
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> Hey, I made some rules for a tileset but many of them get cut off at the top of the screen. Is it possible to not have the rules window get cut off at the top when there is still plenty of room (about half of my screen) under it?

21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> But i ment after updates
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> But i meant after updates
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> teeworlds dont update each day xd
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @mind not sure I understand. Could you show a screenshot?
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckartal-Radweg#/media/Datei:Neckar_river_watershed.png
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Dragere nice, I like the parts of that route I cycled so far
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> Sorry, had the wrong chat open :justatest: 
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> Should i delete it?
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> No, it's a good cycling route ðŸ˜„
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Are you planning to cycle it all?
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> yeah, it's nice weather, but i don't have a good bike :sendhelp:
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I cycled a small part of it today actually
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> good luck!
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> Nice, thank you
