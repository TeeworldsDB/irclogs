00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also harder to scroll through if the clan has special characters
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i put an issue on my fork, next life its done xd
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i put an issue on my fork, next life its done xd
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> .
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> what fork
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ðŸ˜‚
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> good questio
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is some drama at nim
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32021299
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> who actually added ninja animation to fng? is it server? it was not so before i think, when you were frozen in fng and pressed shoot, that the ninja animation played (without you moving). can others see it? (fng)
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nice change
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> wait maybe it's just antiping
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> not working anymore, weird
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> with hammer it works
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks a little uninspired to me ngl. More descriptive commit messages and some refactoring? I have a feeling it's more just a dramafork
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A shame, not many people with that skillset interested in working with niche languages like nim. Splitting them up leaves even less for both projects
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> i am planning on having some projects on gitlab in addition to github. Anyone ever did that? Two git hosters? Any advice on how to keep it in sync and not messy
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have a self hosted gitlab server xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, i dont see any problem
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i dunno if you can automatically sync if u mean that
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but generally, git allows u to set any remote havent had any problems with that
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> go leak ur setup?
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> how did you name your remotes whats your workflow?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git remote add origin git@...
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git remote add backup git@...
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> one is gitlab from home server one is a simple vps
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> do you do like `git pull origin master` `git push backup master`  ? 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah basically
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho tbf i dont use these repos very often
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> i see
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just some educational projects i did during my lifetime ðŸ˜„
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> im just wondering if i can get my self in trouble if mix something up
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stuff i dont want to loose but also dont care lot about
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> i assume i should always pull and push both 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u dont force push its relativly saFE
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean one is always before the other right?
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> but if i commit two different commits two the two remotes
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh ok
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> i can get it incompatible without forcepush
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> thats the trap
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well thats already more confusing xD
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> have one be the primary and push not too often to the lthe
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> because i work from multiple devices
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best is u use different branches
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> have one be the primary and push not too often to the other
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> eww different branches
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> yea picking a primary is probably wise
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah bcs when the branch doesnt exists in either one u cannot simply push
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> like allowing new commits to be only pushed to one and then the other only mirrow
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> MIRROR
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but have to do git push --set-... remote branch
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> -u
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> no -u
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> lez see how good my gitlab ci skills are hehe
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> wish me luck
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> or send ddnet gitlab cis if you got any
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with self hosted github its really ez
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs u can run your CI without any virtual mashine or smth
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so no need to install packages etc
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> SELFHOFTSED GITHUB
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> watefek
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its like normal compile on your computer
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gitlab* XD
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i leaked github
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> leak gh code
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hehee
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> omg ur the reason gh is always down
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> stop hax them
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hardest part bout self hosting is config, bcs gitlab is preconfigured to handle like 3000 users xD
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> uses like 8gb RAM default ez
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> woot
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like java
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> ik it isnt
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> javascript bro
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> roby on rails
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the defintion of wasting ram xd
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah true
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ruby is used lot too
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> gitlab is js?
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> gitlab is ruby on rails
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> ROBY
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gitlab uses different workers
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its more a collection of tools + the web thing  itself
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> config file is 3k lines xd
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller use this https://man.sr.ht/installation.md
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> self hosted
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and abandon github and gitlab
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> why would you use this over gitlab
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs its made in rust
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I plan in replacing the cgit i have on git.edgarluque.com to use sourcehut
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lightweight better
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sourehut is rly nice
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can flex on the kids
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like using vim
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also comes with a paste service
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a builds service
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> ðŸ˜†
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a man page service
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> builds.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     dispatch.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     git.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     hg.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     lists.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     man.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     meta.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     paste.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     todo.sr.ht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can self host all
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > sr.ht is a distributed system in which each service (e.g., git.sr.ht, builds.sr.ht) runs independently with its own database and resources, communicates with other services through their respective APIs and webhooks, and is highly tolerant to the temporary or permanent absence of its peers. This type of design allows you to choose and deploy any subset of services depending on your needs, making it ideal for both large-scale deployments a
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can just tell you. nothing is as ez as setting up a gitlab instance
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (as long u dont run other stuff that can conflict with it)
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gitlab also likes ur ram a lot
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ram is there to be used
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but on small vps u dont wanna waste
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is not ur local pc
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and gitlab recognizes there is a problem itself
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u just need to strip down some config
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> puma uses too much resource for example
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk bro
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ima try sourcehut
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> wait, you didnt use it already?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> wait, you dont use it already?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no im using cgit
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is probs the most lightweight shit u can use
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and super fast
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its bare C
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there is no pull requests
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i jut use it to mirror my github repos
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in case microsoft decides to cut the world
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> well if its used privat do you even need a pr
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im happy freedesktop moved away from that to gitlab xd
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> xD
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://git.edgarluque.com/
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> for me i would rather use gitlab and spend the time configuring it for my needs. got a nice GUI and shit
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice teeworlds projects
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who needs gui
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but sourcehut has a gui
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and cgit kinda too
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh any kind of selfhosting is overkill xD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Yeah, pretty nice ðŸ˜†
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just bcs we want to flex
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like how simple cgit is
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who knows
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is until it isnt
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when github ceases to exist
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> I mean, simplicity is good, but when managing projects i prefer having something that alot of people can work with.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing is
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> self hosted needs a way to improve discoverability
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github is what it is cuz u can easy discover projects
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> I think gitlab is more known than sourcehut and cgit but i could be terribly wrong
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sourcehut is used by really big nerds
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the hacker news crowd
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which btw hackernews is down rn
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> xD

17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> issues
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> You never know, better have backup systems for everythingðŸ‘½
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good thing is
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in sourcehut u dont even need to register
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can just send a mail
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://musicforprogramming.net
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some music is dope

17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```My first somewhat working prototype of gitlab pipeline in case anyone ever needs a .gitlab-ci.yml for ddnetIf i continue making this nicer i might try PRing against ddnet eventho its on github
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> & how fast is gitlab CI compared to github?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when benchmarks
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> it takes 5min to register your own local device as runner so it can run the NASA speeds you are used from home
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> or you create dedeicated raspi4 runner machines. Then the pipeline might finish even before you commited
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> this pipeline took 7 minutes to run but its poorly optimized because most of the time is spend installing deps. You can simply pre build a docker image with the deps and upload that and run the pipeline in there.
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah self hosted runner is fast ofc, but is at least kinda risk for the person hosting it, even with a VM
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but true, we also update the deps in our CI, why arent the CI images just always up to date
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be much easier
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> apt is also not the quickest packet manager xd rip
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> My CI uses arch btw
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> My CI is built in rust
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @heinrich5991 i squashed
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Learath's CI runs in electron
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah, i forgot to remove easter egg ðŸ™‚
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax electron
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, rebase finished
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Whats the purpose of docker
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> I don't think docker has any purpose
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> Its the most useless tech
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> but if you HAVE to use it. Make sure to not get any bloat docker version. Just use this simple 100 lines of docker implementation https://github.com/p8952/bocker
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Okay but what does it do thi
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> tho*
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> docker is literally a scam. Someone could think docker helps with security or reproducibility. Because everyone can spin up a containered environment which is seperate from the host and the same for every person running it.
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> .. until it isnt
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Ye, thats what i've heard
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> on linux its using the namespaces feature if i remember correctly to seperate contexts. On mac it just eats disk space. And on windows it does not work at all
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> actually not sure bout windows
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> i think it might work if you buy some docker desktop app :D 
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> just use WSL on windows :shrug:
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> docker could be cool if it would work as everyone wants it to work :)
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Docker actually makes it ez to mass deploy stuff i guess
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is that a common issue u had when switching from idk.x to 16.2?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995006860165922826/unknown.png
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (update button)
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, that should not happen. What was your old version?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> otherwise the dll is in the 16.2 download on https://ddnet.tw/downloads
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do we want this?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I assume it only compiles bcs MAX_NAME_LENGTH was included in a different header that was included before hud.h was included
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995011930370609242/unknown.png
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but hud.h itself cannot find it(on its own)
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Robyt3 maybe ur include fixup? ^
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I never added all the includes that would be necessary to make every file standalone, so if you remove one include you might have to add others that were previously included by it
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> that would be a large change and also likely have a negative effect on the compile time again
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how much compile time did we save?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i prefer to have a working IDE tbh
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> hm, thinking about it it's probably minimal because the `#pragma once` / header guards would prevent duplicate includes / macro expansion anyway
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I think deen made the headers compile standalone at some point so the include fixup must have broken that
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMnOEgbm2fE
