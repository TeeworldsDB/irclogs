11:50 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 975fbf3 def: libwinpthread for new mingw
12:07 <@deen> Finally I have a script to fully automatically make the DDNet builds on all platforms for releases: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release
12:08 <@deen> i guess I can use that for nightly builds now
12:15 < fstd> why are you nice-ing $PPID rather than $$?
12:16 <@deen> oops
12:16 <@deen> my bad
12:23 <@EastByte> deen: so mingw cross-compile works fine?
12:23 <@deen> EastByte: not sure, the win32 works in wine, the win64 not, but that may be my wine being broken
12:24 <@deen> Nightlies should be done in 15 minutes
12:24 <@deen> significantly faster without VMs
12:24 <@deen> only Mac I can't cross-compiler of course
12:25 <@EastByte> I only know that 64 binaries require a win64 wine prefix
12:25 <@EastByte> nice
12:25 <@deen> Oh, there actually is cross-compiling for OS X, but haven't tested: https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross
12:27 <@deen> and the linux part is done in a debian 6 chroot
12:34 < fstd> BTW in case you care, the only thing that prevents that script from working in any POSIX shell is the use of $SECONDS, as far as i can tell
12:34 < fstd> $(date +%s) would be a drop-in replacement
12:34 <@deen> thanks
12:35 <@deen> wasn't sure about that, i'll change it =)
12:35 < fstd> cool:)  i'm surprised to see that dash understands $SECONDS, though.  probably too many init scripts and the like used it when they migrated from bash to dash
12:36 < fstd> (the real almquist shell doesn't know it)
12:36 <@deen> well, i'm not a shell expert, happy enough when it works in bash and zsh...
12:37 <@deen> and i think anyone who'll execute that script will have quite a few other problems
12:37 < fstd> if it runs in a debian chroot, it's probably executed by neither bash nor zsh, but dash (which is a good choice)
12:37 < fstd> oh, never mind
12:37 < fstd> the script itself of course doesn't run in the chroot
12:37 <@deen> yeah, but that part in the chroot is more simple
12:37 <@deen> a part of it does ;)
12:38 <@deen> line 24
12:39 < fstd> oh, wow.  i didn't know that was even possible
12:39 < fstd> especially since the build function (due to using {} instead of ()) doesn't even run in a subshell
12:40 < fstd> okay then again, if chroot forks..
12:40 < fstd> but does it? :O
12:40 <@deen> I believe so
12:44 < fstd> ah, i misread it anyway
12:44 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/downloads/#nightly-builds
12:44 < fstd> it doesn't really run a part of it in a chroot, it just runs a shell to execute the bam stuff in a chroot
12:44 < fstd> s/it/itself/
12:45 < fstd> (i first mistook it for doing  chroot ... a_shell_function)
13:21 < dhkmt> that is a nightly build, deen?
13:22 <@deen> dhkmt: "that"?
13:22 < dhkmt> what* sorry
13:23 <@deen> a new build of the software, made ever night
13:23 <@deen> so you have all the changes that haven't been released yet and can test them
14:23 < sdfsdf> what for is "sleep 1m" between "mv" and and killing qemu's process?
14:27 < dhkmt> deen: well, and why do i know which changes are new?
14:29 <@deen> sdfsdf: for os x to shut down!
14:29 <@deen> dhkmt: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits
14:30 < dhkmt> ah
14:30 < dhkmt> ok thank you
14:30 < dhkmt> C:
14:48 < o_be_one> hello :)
14:49 <@deen> hi
15:17 < o_be_one> deen: why you choosed QNet for irc and not FreeNode ?
15:18 < dhkmt> because official teeworlds channel is on qnet too
15:19 < o_be_one> ah, good point
15:42 <@EastByte> I still got matriculated, yay!
15:43 <@EastByte> o_be_one: so what have you learned at "DDoS training"?
16:10 < o_be_one> EastByte: i'll take the flight on Tuesday
16:11 < o_be_one> so during september i'll learn
16:14 <@EastByte> ah, I expected you started already
16:19 < o_be_one> ^^
16:43 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: so whatsup about your mc32?
17:33 <@EastByte> o_be_one: we are currently waiting for a ticket response
17:33 <@EastByte> moving failover ips doesn't work
17:34 < o_be_one> oh :/
17:49 < WolfAlex> EastByte: seems to work now, i've tested it just a minute ago, but they did not respond to the tiket ? ._. dunno why
17:55 < o_be_one> overbooked 
17:55 < o_be_one> it could happens sometime, got it too as customer :/
17:56 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: :/
19:33 < Nimda> himmel by -Sani- just released on Oldschool at 2015-09-03 19:27
20:25 < o_be_one> i cant rmeember the api EastByte to get server info ?
20:26 <@EastByte> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/server/95.172.92.151/8303/
20:26 < o_be_one> awesome ty i write it
20:28 < o_be_one> ok all players are back to my server
20:28 < o_be_one> they leave maybe cause of spoof stuff -_-
20:28 < o_be_one> i'll get update this weekend :/
22:21 < o_be_one> what about ddnet.tw redesign ?
22:26 <@deen> o_be_one: dunno, haven't seen anything new
22:38 < o_be_one> oh ok, cause you already worked on something, deen 
22:39 < o_be_one> so wanted to know if you'll keep it or if you want something else ? And if i wanted to help, photoshop files are all you need or you are waiting for CSS/HTML too (cause i'm ok to think something, to draw something, but i'm really too noob to dev)
22:44 <@deen> o_be_one: i like the current design, i wouldn't change it. some other people were redesigning it, if they come up with a better design and do all the work, i guess i could switch to it
