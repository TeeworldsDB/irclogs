14:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Cool!
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜„
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> gl enabled ? ðŸ˜®
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> maybe it causes it
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <DanilBest> thx
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> m * dv/dt = mg - c_1 * r * v
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> @heinrich5991 ITS WORKING FINALLY. (Linux MATE)
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> \o/
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> What's that
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> what's what?
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> equation
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> it's the differential equation I need to solve after I get back from shop
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> xD ?
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> wanted to write it down somewhere before going so I don't forget ðŸ˜›
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> best place 10/10
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> better then forgetting ðŸ˜›
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> has the added benefit of someone getting curious and solving it for me aswell
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> diary on android
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ?
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> phone
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> diaries don't solve equations
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> we do? ðŸ˜„
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> you might
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> the diary is most definitely not ðŸ˜„
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I'm curious, but can't!
15:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Kyosuke> xD
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> What that equation is used for ?
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> in real world
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> drag on a spherical object in the viscous domain
15:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> whaaa
17:28 <+Learath2> in a domain where the viscous term is dominating*
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Justafish> hey, I got a suggestion. When zooming out, can we automatically activate "show all" at some zoom level? then perhaps deactivate it when zooming in?
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @Justafish Well, you can auto-activate it with "bind minus "zoom-; say /showall 1"
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Justafish> oh yeah, true, I can do that. thx man
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> and deactive with bind backslash "zoom; say /showall 0"
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> why do you even want to deactivate /showall and why is it deactivated serverside?
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> you want to deactivate it because it causes all player informations to be sent to you from the server
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> thus causing higher bandwidth for both player and server, and higher chance for lags
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> 40 players on server: showall off: 40kbit/s recv, on: 300 kbit/s recv
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ah ye save the server
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i dont feel something clientside
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> if your connection and cpu are fast it's ok for you
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> hmkay i understand
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> for recording demos showall on is VERY cool
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> because in ddnet demos you can spectate anyone on the map
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> yes!
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but its annoying to type /showall on main and dummy agian and agian .-.
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> and i dont want to bind it
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> yeah, it should be something that's just enabled in client
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i decativated it dafault on my server and it works fine because nobody plays there hehe
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> like "show others"
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> not through chat
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> would be great
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> could be both
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> if this option is enabeld the client sends it on connect in chat without you even recognizing it
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> like timeout
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> ah, that used to be my old trick
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> you could inject further commands in the timeout code
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> but i think that's not possible anymore
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> .-.
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> why
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> so my timeout code was "TIMEOUTCODE;showall 1"
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> which caused the client to send /timeout TIMEOUTCODE; showall 1 on connect
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oh lol
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ah i understand
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> like ur personal trick
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> you can try if it still works, dunno
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i thought u used this trick to implement stuff like /showothers xd
18:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> @heinrich5991 Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but for some reason the game is going very slowly, it has a long response to my mouse clicks
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Guys
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> I can't install the Nvidia driver
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> good to know
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Skyrx why not? what happens when you try?
