01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> Oh ok there is a doc?
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> Hey patiga hi XD
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh cool if you want to use it I will try to release a new version, I improved the documentation a lot on the dev branch :)
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> in general, call `help` on everything you get from the library, there should be some docs already
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> Oh okk
03:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> is the server capable of processing out of order input packets?
04:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> from what I can see it looks like if the server gets your input packets out of order it has no idea what's happening
06:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 3h straight rocketfly map xd
06:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I really doubt this can bring any good maps to tw
06:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think ddrace maps are too complex to be made by an algorithm (not saying its impossible, but compared to Silex maps)
06:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> afair someone had done it already
06:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it was gores generator :troll:
06:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I don't think they were using wave function collapse unless you're talking about something different
06:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> also I can't figure out why it's called "wave function" collapse, it seems like there's no wave functions
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do you have to change the diff view to split on github every time or is the setting saved?
08:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> saved i think
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://codeflower.la/?name=ddnet&owner=ddnet
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> pretty cool tho
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969131292144853022/Capture_decran_2022-04-28_090134.png
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah for single file diffs it default uses unified view ðŸ˜¦
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> issue cleanup?
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks !!!!
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> github didn't close them automatically when bors merged the PR
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stop the count!!!
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969242002740887582/unknown.png
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> working hypothesis: github now ignores "fixes #abc" in PR titles and commit headers
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would they change that
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, they already didn't link it, it only closed issues before
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so maybe they now unified the behavior
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4902>
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u go hear
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the commit message
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hover on fixes
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it says it triggers an action
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u gotta look it fast cuz i get 2 tooltips xd
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hear -> here
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only went through all the PRs and commented/merged
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> an hour ago or so
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should push for this
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4728
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like this change
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the graphics are nice
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969243210260054126/unknown.png
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also like my PR about logging ðŸ˜›
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well looks like its waiting on deen to fix the conflict
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 yeah i like it too
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but urs is biggest and i think requires more careful revieiw
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bigger*
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk whats up with my typing today
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its prob my keyboard is getting old, cuz it double types sometimes
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what do u think about changing the gameworld to use, e.g https://github.com/skypjack/entt and try to make it more concurrent
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just noticed this library is used by minecraft lol
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably hard to retrofit our stuff onto libraries in a way that doesn't change physics
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm skeptical that it'd make things easier, unfortunately ðŸ˜¦
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea ðŸ˜¦
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 have u tried bevy btw?
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it rly looks like magic
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have not
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you built something that I could look at? ðŸ™‚
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how they analyze the function to know which components to pass
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, I'll be gone in a few mins
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not yet
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is not new iirc

18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> you forgot to define a destructor or a constructor to a virtual class
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> and where should I put these things, because I did it with a class and everything worked now I created a new file and I'm mistaken> ðŸ˜¦
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> and where should I put these things, because I did it with a class and everything worked now I created a new file and I'm mistaken  ðŸ˜¦
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> the same place you defined the class
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> idk i restarted the pc and now work xd
20:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> teach your cat rust
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Broso56> id have to learn rust myself first :justatest:
