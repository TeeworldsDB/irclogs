01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> u know how hook works when your mate is in solo but has super on? had that in normal play somehow. Could fix it with showothers. did u change anything?
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn I don't really know how most of the prediction and antiping code works at all, but shouldn't it work perfectly with a dummy?
04:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just info: Sooth was just skipped by ScreeNy & Jesus Christ, to finish in 7 & 9 sec. They quite tell how they did it in chat right now on 95.172.92.151:8324 (call me a snitch, but I always preferred true ranks that create competition)
04:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just info: Sooth was just skipped by ScreeNy & Jesus Christ, to finish in 7 & 9 sec. They kinda explain how they did it in chat right now - 95.172.92.151:8324 (call me a snitch, but I always preferred true ranks that create competition)

07:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu Thanks for info. It looks like they just used checkpoints and the map has ways to circumvent the checkpoints and go back to start. So they touched the last checkpoint in map, went back to start to reset their time (only works in team 0, one of the reasons we have team ranks), and finally teleport immediately to finish. This can be fixed in the map with having unskippable c <message clipped>

07:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> > Cendren: this funny af haha I would love to see jao's reaction

07:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :kek:
10:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Or just don't fix it it's very fun
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Or just don't fix it it's very fun. Competitive Players dont care about team0 ranks anyways. It also takes a lot of planning and preparation for each map to execute skips like that. Overall it took us like 6h. Its not abusing any bug etc its just smart gameplay.
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we can probably go through the teehistorian files to see if anyone used tele cp to a cp > 0 after hitting the start tile
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ScReeNy it's an unbeatable rank at the top of the leaderboard
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Didnt the team said we dont have to abandon each new mechanic we find? Also this has been done earlier on solo maps like nullptr solo together with starttile hitbox bug and probably on more maps but not to this extend. And its only unbeatable until there comes somebody with a new idea or better execution, thats how speedrunning works. We even asked for the rules of when a rank ge <message clipped>
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, weird mechanics are fine. But basically skipping the entire map is not.
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> So until which checkpoint can i go? can i skip 50% 75% 90%?
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> depends on every map. this is clearly too much
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> You just make people wait at finish to make it look legit, better be aware of what players do to your maps. Each month we do some iq skips but mods change the map while we play and reload or now change the game this game is just depressing
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> i know how i use my other bugs
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> You could also report it as a bug, then you don't have to worry about your rank being deleted later on when someone else discovers it.
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Every speedrun leaderboard has rules
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> that isnt a bug for me
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> you are changing the rules constantly
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> how u like
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, every complex system needs to be able to adapt rules, since the rules at the start will have edge cases and holes
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You and konsti literally make my blood boil, so I'll just stay out of it and cook some breakfast instead
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 enjoy
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I can understand your frustration tbh, since I did the same things back on DDmaX, abusing bugs to get top ranks
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides, we've always been deleting ranks in a very consistent manner, we delete them if the rank is no longer possible/significantly easier after a bug fix or a map change and we delete them if they are botted. I wonder who you asked the rules
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> jao himself
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should write these down and make sure staff only ever copy and paste it, with people going around trying to find loopholes
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did jao say the rule is?
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> ``Jesus Christ28.10.2019
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> @jao what is official statement about fixing and deleting cheated ranks? u always fix startline skips, and u dont fix oldschool maps right
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> what about brutals and others not startline skips, u fix like, over 90% skip or something?
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> is therre any rule? or is is situational and depends on a map
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy>  
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> jao28.10.2019
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> im fixing cheats only on new maps
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy>  
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Jesus Christ28.10.2019
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> soo +1year is considered as an old map already?
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy>  
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> jao28.10.2019
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> yea
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy>  
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Jesus Christ28.10.2019
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> cool``
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> You could consider this as fixing bugs instead of fixing the map
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> So since the rank became unbeatable this should also be deleted ofcourse
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> U can beat it, just think about it like solo map where even split seconds matter
13:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I still dont believe you should call it a Bug, thats just how maps ever worked and were intended to work. It was just unpopular, because team 0 ranks dont matter competitive. Things like placing a tee in the whole map and dragging one tee through was always a way to have a better time in t0. Also its not like the Team ever cared if they create unbeatable ranks.
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> this should be fixed in the map
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> not with a setting
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> also this is more like a startline skip than a cheat
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> (you didnt play any part of the map for the rank as far as i understood)
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> (ie you didnt play any part of the map for the rank as far as i understood)
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> does ranked even matter besides getting a ranked status?
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> well we finished the map a few times to get those ranks, so thats not quite true
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> im talking about the run with that you did the 0s finish
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> other runs obviously dont count towards that
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nerf all 0s finishes
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> else you could justify startline skips as well
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> well the 2 tees did play all parts. And what counts is honor cellegen
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> no that logic doesnt work
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> honor or even care for doing that
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean for prizes touraments would be intended to require a status and above
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and if somebody donates to that, it would be a good idea to make it a reality
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean tomorrow i'll go for my first job interview and if anything good happens, i can spare money to donate here
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> But i agree to the Point that this is more of a map fix. Since i dont think its a bug of game. One funny thing, while figuring the way out i started to belive to mapper planned on that everything was just too close fitting.
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> dude cellegen what are you talking xd
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> about making a competitive tourament with money prizes
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :v
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so ranked status has at least a meaning to it,
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I think ranked especially teamrank has a meaning for a lot.
13:47 <@heinrich5991> @jao would fixing it without a setting be possible?
13:47 <@heinrich5991> (would e.g. make maps easier to test)
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think the current behavior should be changed
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> to fix it without a setting, all what would have to be done is simply putting CP2 on startline
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> in case of that specific map ofc
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> XDDD
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> yea please do that great idea
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smvrf.> how to include teeworlds sensitivite mouse to league of legends
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> before startline
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> lol u smart
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> lol
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> btw 4 tees per ip limit will stay forever?
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess thats likley. Two people with one ip and dummys is kinda good limit imo. Or do you want less?
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> i wanna more
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u could block whole servers easily then
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if that would be removed
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Having the startline be cp0 might be a nice idea, why not @jao?
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> imo its unnecessary to change this everywhere if only specific maps need it, and then it will probably also have unwanted side effects on other maps
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so youâll end up special casing maps or remapping them
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> would make many unbeatable ranks
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> (if you even notice that they need to be fixed)
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> always when u wanna fix some physics there is justice 2 screaming it would break the map
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how it's always "would make many unbeatable ranks" but your unbeatable rank is okay
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ð
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fix it however you prefer @jao, I just don't really like adding more and more unique behaviour to the game to fix a couple maps
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> its not unbeatable
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not beatable by regular means
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> maybe u should look up that word again
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 dont need any unique behavior to fix this
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ScReeNy no need to be salty, you cheated, you even knew what you did was "grey" at best, gratz on the run
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It won't stay in the leaderboard under the current rules
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> yea i knew its grey that why i asked before and am still betrayed of my rank. Thanks for calling it cheat and not bug.
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> yea i knew its grey thats why i asked before and am still betrayed of my rank. Thanks for calling it cheat and not bug.
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if you wanted to be 100% sure you should have explained what you wanted to do
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> See you still have this attitude, hunting for nuances in my wording, you lot asked us 50 times about deleted ranks until you got the slight wording mistake you needed and went with it
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> i thought u meant that as a changing of your position by choosing to say cheat
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Again, very impressive run, not touching the cp tiles doesn't look that easy on this map. It's not staying
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's both a mapper oversight and a bug. Mappers should be careful with their checkpoints
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But crossing the start line, very obviously should reset your progress
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why?
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> weapons dont reset either
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean progress in the map, as in how far you are
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> i think its impossible to balance team0 ranks
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as you are playing the map and your rank represents the time you spend on the map, I have no issue with how you get it
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> then dont delete my rank but change my time to 6h ð
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You were completely free to just finish it with your actual rank of 6 hours
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't make you go all the way back to the startline ð
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> do you guys know if the player limit/ip was ever lower than 4?
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> cause i remember in like 2015 i couldn't play with my brother
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should have another leaderboard where we archive these ranks? any% runs are indeed interesting
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not this kind as it's just a really long run that appears to be short. But with other runs like the old hc2 hammerfly around the map, it's decently fun to watch
14:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> that were easy times
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> we should have a leaderboard for people that help fix bugs instead of waisting our time
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> when i report bugs i get ignored and they get abused
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what bug did you report that got ignored
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> nulltr.sg for example
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> whatâs the bug there
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> you can skip first 2 parts by abusing cps and start tile hitbox
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah well too late to fix that now
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are maps where you get back to the startline with different cps
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also solo maps
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> unnecessary and might break something
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> F3
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> did u change any rocket physics recently?
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was that fix for binary, but that only applies to maps that need it
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jesus Christ why?
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> @Learath2 yes, it should be able to do that. I actually had some code for that, but forgot about it for a while (and planned to fix some small things)
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> the only thing missing is to apply the input from the dummy
