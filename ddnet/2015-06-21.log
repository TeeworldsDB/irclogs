12:15 < WolfAlex> deen: ping ._.
12:43 <@deen> WolfAlex: pong!
12:44 < WolfAlex> too late ... there was a blocker on ddnet ... but he is gone now :)
12:46 <@deen> should look for a mod instead, better chance of them being online: http://ddnet.tw/staff

15:09 <@deen> eeeee: strange, GER2 showing load of 9 and 100% cpu, but sum of all processes in htop is maybe 10%
16:43 <@deen> eeeee: looks like GER2 starts having that problem as soon as i start the game servers
16:44 <@deen> i guess the server is out of capacity
16:44 <@deen> was just hoping to have it for the tournament because I'm expecting ddos attacks
17:05 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you tried glances?
17:05 <@deen> since i don't know what "glances" is, probably not
17:05 <@heinrich5991> the first top/htop I somewhat understand
17:08 < ochristi> what's wrong with htop?
17:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: it e.g. shows stuff like: everyone is waiting for IO or so
17:09 <@deen> NotImplementedError: couldn't find /proc/1/io (kernel too old?)
17:09 <@deen> hm^^
17:09 <@heinrich5991> uname -a?
17:09 <@deen> Linux ti 3.19.8-gentoo #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu May 28 00:19:09 CEST 2015 x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9300 @ 2.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
17:09 <@deen> i guess i need to enable something in the kernel^^
17:09 <@heinrich5991> that doesn't sound too old
17:11 <@heinrich5991> ochristi: I don't know, it didn't help me I think. opening it right now shows me 10 firefox processes and 10 teamspeak processes. I suppose that it shows threads, but that isn't really helpful
17:11 <@deen> i should just switch to arch instead of configuring my own kernel
17:13 < ochristi> heinrich5991: f2 display option "[x] hide kernel threads [x] hide userland threads"
17:14 <@deen> heinrich5991: glances looks interesting, thanks
17:14 <@deen> too bad it needs so much cpu itself
17:15 <@heinrich5991> ochristi: thanks! but why isn't that the default? :/
17:15 < ochristi> dunno
17:17 < ochristi> there are couple more things I would config differently
17:17 <@heinrich5991> (I like it when software has useful defaults – e.g. teeworlds also has some way to go for that)
17:17 <@heinrich5991> for example you can't just double-click a server to start a useful server
17:17 <@heinrich5991> it could generate a random rcon password, but it doesn't
17:18 <@heinrich5991> *double-click the server executable
17:20 <@deen> heinrich5991: not sure if that's a good idea
17:21 <@deen> heinrich5991: makes running a local testing server more difficult
17:21 <@heinrich5991> I am! :P
17:21 <@deen> and most people just use the server to test maps
17:21 <@deen> or for lans where it doesn't matter that everyone knows rcon is rcon
17:22 <@deen> that reminds me, i wanted to auto-enable antiping when ping is higher than X
17:22 <@heinrich5991> deen: wait a second – how does generating a password if nothing is configured make any of your mentioned points worse? ^^
17:22 <@deen> I've seen sooo many people playing with ping 150, and they never heard of antiping
17:22 <@heinrich5991> if you configure a password in LAN, you don't get a generated one
17:22 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, how do they find out the generated pw?
17:23 <@heinrich5991> in the server console
17:23 <@deen> no one reads that
17:23 <@heinrich5991> you can style it so people read it
17:23 <@heinrich5991> but it doesn't make things worse
17:23 <@heinrich5991> you don't need to restart the server to configure an rcon password
17:24 <@deen> in ddnet rcon is set to rcon by default^
17:24 <@heinrich5991> that's a very bad idea
17:24 <@heinrich5991> like really bad
17:24 <@deen> i don't think so
17:24 <@heinrich5991> the default configuration should never be an insecure one
17:24 <@heinrich5991> that's like ignoring errors by default in programming languages
17:25 <@heinrich5991> a missing configuration shouldn't lead to an exploitable server
17:25 <@heinrich5991> that's like routers coming with a default password
17:25 <@deen> it doesn't
17:25 <@deen> the shipped autoexec.cfg just contains rcon pw rcon
17:25 <@deen> and it's meant to be an example for how to write your own config
17:26 <@heinrich5991> yea, but if you had some rcon password generation
17:26 <@heinrich5991> you wouldn't need to make everyone exploitable if they don't know what they're doing
17:26 <@heinrich5991> e.g. my browser turns off exploitable plug-ins
17:26 <@heinrich5991> despite me having installed them
17:27 <@heinrich5991> to choose an insecure route, I must explicitely opt-in
17:27 <@heinrich5991> (I think debian had some standard for that, that an unconfigured server must be safe)
17:28 <@heinrich5991> consider what would happen if minecraft shipped with a default password :D
17:29 < ochristi> heinrich could even something harmful happen?
17:29 <@EastByte> yea
17:29 <@EastByte> they could fill you harddrive using the record command
17:29 <@EastByte> evil stuff
17:29 <@heinrich5991> people having rcon access that shouldn't
17:30 <@deen> and with rcon you can read any file the user has read access to
17:30 <@EastByte> yea that aswell
17:30 <@deen> so all passwords etc
17:30 <@EastByte> depends on the fileformat though
17:31 <@deen> heinrich5991: want to add the feature?
17:32 <@heinrich5991> now that I ranted so much about it, I suppose yes ^^
17:32 <@deen> so if no rcon pw is set, just generate a random one and print it visibly to log
17:33 <@deen> sounds ok to me
17:33 <@heinrich5991> (that's the behavior of a teamspeak server btw)
17:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you remember when and where I added a secure random number generator to teeworlds?
17:34 <@deen> no
17:39 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: maybe you did not^^
17:39 <@EastByte> well I guess in the 0.7 protocol update
17:39 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I found it: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/160/files
17:39 <@EastByte> oh
17:40 <@EastByte> neat
17:43 <@deen> any idea which ping would be a nice limit for antiping?
17:43 <@deen> I'm thinking of 100
17:44 <@deen> hm, this may be annoying when you're right at the border of 100
17:44 <@deen> and sometimes antiping enables and disables
17:44 <@deen> I'll just disable it by default
17:46 <@EastByte> would be better
17:47 <@deen> yeah, but noobs still won't find it then
17:47 <@deen> I'm worried that many people will never start playing ddnet because they have high ping on every server
17:48 <@EastByte> isn't that a typical problem with online games?
17:48 <@deen> not sure, I'm not playing any others :P
17:48 <@EastByte> haha
17:49 <@deen> exact time is very important in ddnet
17:49 <@deen> timing*
17:49 <@heinrich5991> deen: I know this a lot more complicated, but have you considered asking the user if their ping is high?
17:49 <@heinrich5991> probably too much effort for this thing though :/
17:49 <@EastByte> by showing an assistant dialog?
17:50 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, I've considered it, but wouldn't want to implement it in TW
17:50 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: dunno, maybe a notice like the team balance warning
17:50 <@heinrich5991> yea, tw ui stuff is exhausting
17:50 <@heinrich5991> if that's the right word
17:51 <@deen> ddnet tournaments are exhausting too
17:51 <@deen> and we'll have one with a Novice map in 2 hours!
17:51 <@EastByte> nobody here manages tournaments except you ^^
17:52 <@deen> yeah, and I always forget half the things and have to do them in 2 min before the tournament^^
17:52 <@heinrich5991> I'm sure they are, and I admire your continuous investement in ddnet
17:53 <@deen> thanks =)
17:54 <@deen> oh, and i checked, not a single server running publically with rcon pw rcon, phew^^
17:58 <@heinrich5991> that's good ^^
18:00 <@deen> works for me:

18:13 < Savander> maybe it should check every some time if your ping is highter than xxx?
18:13 < Savander> every minute or smth
18:13 < Savander> ahm
18:13 < Savander> nevermind
18:27 < Savander> teeworlds has raw input option from mouse? 
18:27 < Savander> ?
18:54 <@deen> 1 hour until tournament
19:09 <@deen> anyone know why sv_reserved_slots isn't working?
19:10 <@deen> probably because of 64 player changes^^
19:12 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L920-L925
19:12 <@deen> really need it for the tournament now
19:12 <@deen> should've tested it before =/
19:15 <@deen> ok, got it
19:15 <@deen> i can fix it
19:15 <@deen> without restarting server
19:15 <@heinrich5991> how can you fix it without restarting? ^^
19:16 <@deen> by kicking the player with id 63
19:16 <@deen> it only works if no one is connected with id 63 already
19:17 <@heinrich5991> oh lol
19:17 <@heinrich5991> I didn't see that ClientID >=
19:24 <@EastByte> we need unlimited spec slots :)
19:25 <@EastByte> although it would be hacky to implement
19:52  * Learath2 is looking to buy a NES with 2 controllers
19:52 < Learath2> if anyone has one that he wants to get rid of
19:53 <@deen> i have an emulator!
19:53 <@EastByte> stream is up
19:53 < Learath2> doesnt help extend my collection tho :D
19:55 < Learath2> found some sweet deals on ebay but shipping is like 80$ from US....
20:10 <@deen> EastByte: stream is down?
20:12 <@EastByte> yea
20:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #225: Randomly generate rcon passwords on startup, if none is set. (DDRace64...pr_password) http://git.io/vLyxI
20:17 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/225
20:17 <@heinrich5991> oh :D
20:18 <@deen> ^^
20:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: if you want to keep the password in autoexec.cfg, I can either remove that commit, or you can merge with "pr_password~"
20:22 <@deen> Hallowed1986, our livestreamer was ddosed
20:22 <@deen> that's why the stream stopped
20:26 <@EastByte> I don't understand why streamer cannot hide their ips
20:26 <@EastByte> that's like the first rule
20:28 < Savander> some guys in Poland, masking streamers
20:28 < Savander> hide their ips, VPN
20:29 < Savander> offer their connection to streaming
20:29 <@EastByte> that's really unnecessary
20:29 < Savander> for free
20:29 <@deen> i bet he runs a for-profit vpn service and that's his advertisement :P
20:30 < Savander> yea a bit :P
20:30 < Savander> they offer much more ofc :P
20:31 <@EastByte> a streamer needs low latency + high bandwidth
20:31 < Savander> but it's only for "famous: streamers
20:31 <@EastByte> a vpn affects both
20:31 < Savander> not really
20:31 < Savander> you don't need low latency
20:34 <@EastByte> it's preferable for a stable connection
20:36 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/41/
20:36 <@deen> wooohoo, so many finishes^^
20:36 <@deen> pretty short tournament map
20:37 <@deen> I'll try adding flags to that list
20:37 <@deen> maybe it looks good
20:39 <@EastByte> :)
20:39 <@deen> and not only GER flags^^
20:40 <@deen> first finish is CAN, then 22 GER, then South Africa, hmmmmm

20:48 < Savander> im here.
20:48 < Savander> xd
20:48 <@deen> hehe
20:51 <@EastByte> I failed at ~70% :(
20:51 <@deen> ouch
20:51 <@deen> ^^
20:58 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/41/
20:58 <@deen> better with flag?
21:01 <@EastByte> yep
21:02 <@deen> may be a bit misleading
21:02 <@deen> because the GER people aren't necessarily from germany etc
21:02 <@EastByte> their fault^^
21:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: what about mixed teams? :)
21:04 <@deen> huh?
21:04 <@heinrich5991> oh
21:04 <@deen> heinrich5991: this just shows the country of the server they played on
21:04 <@heinrich5991> it's the servers
21:04 <@heinrich5991> :)
21:04 <@deen> and it's kinda difficult to play in a team on different servers^^
21:04 <@EastByte> oh lol, okay
21:05 <@heinrich5991> maybe put a european flag there :D
21:05 <@deen> yeah, but the server is called GER
21:05 <@deen> and on CAN people from USA play, on RUS from Ukraine, on Chile from South america etc
21:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLSYa
21:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 2336b61 def: Add some comments to autoexec.cfg
21:48 < eeeee> deen: yeah i got a cpu alert around 6 hours ago
21:48 <@deen> weird
21:49 <@deen> server always was at 0-1% cpu
21:49 < eeeee> did you try rebooting it or something?
21:51 <@deen> no
21:51 <@deen> i see that you have sth running on it
21:52 <@deen> anyway, no noticable attacks on GER
21:52 <@deen> but i hear that people are working on a new attack
21:52 <@deen> using gameinfo packets
21:52 < eeeee> i'm running a server list daemon for teewebs there
21:53 < eeeee> how would that work?
21:56 <@deen> no idea
21:56 <@deen> i asked for logs of the chat
21:56 <@deen> but didn't get anything
21:57 < eeeee> okay i'll try to finish my patch just in case
21:57 <@deen> but the guy said he's worried and he's an old ddoser himself
21:57 < eeeee> gonna also update and reboot ger2
21:57 <@deen> oh, i know why
21:57 <@deen> damn
21:58 <@deen> i just copied the ddrace server executable from GER
21:58 <@deen> instead of compiling it on GER2
21:58 <@deen> because i wanted to save precious cpu
21:58 <@deen> and the binary was optimized for that specific cpu
21:58 <@deen> so we get this:
21:58 <@deen> [13438769.558032] traps: DDRace64-Server[23156] trap invalid opcode ip:422f59 sp:7fff8a3b8550 error:0 in DDRace64-Server_sql[400000+3e0000]
21:58 <@deen> my bad
21:59 <@deen> would be nice if i could access github per https:// or git:// from GER2
21:59 < eeeee> oh okay
21:59 <@deen> then i could recompile easier
22:01 < eeeee> deen: i've whitelisted github subnet
22:01 <@deen> thanks
22:05 <@EastByte> hm gameinfo packets, maybe req serverinfo flooding?
22:06 <@EastByte> maybe they are working on the first tw serverlist amplification attack
22:06 <@deen> yeah, i guess
22:06 <@deen> because if you send a 64 player request
22:07 <@deen> up to 4 big packets are send as response
22:07 <@deen> so if they fake our own servers they can make them attack each other
22:07 <@deen> ip-spoof*
22:08 <@EastByte> so atleast you could blacklist your server ip addresses on out traffic
22:09 <@deen> better on in traffic ;)
22:12 < eeeee> we could also merge the http serverlist from teewebs, make ddnet client use it as a fallback, would allow us to drop all serverinfo requests while under attack
22:12 <@deen> how does http serverlist handle pings btw?
22:13 < eeeee> tries to guess the ping with geolocation :P
22:13 <@EastByte> heh
22:14 <@EastByte> "you on your mobilephone, your ping must be about 45ms"
22:14 <@deen> eeeee: hehe
22:14 < eeeee> sounds crappy, but in practice i think thats more than enough since you'd normally just connect to the closest ddnet server anyway
22:14 <@deen> ok, now i understand the geoip thingy running on ger2!
22:14 <@deen> in practice it's great, i agree
22:14 <@deen> didn't even think of it
22:14 <@deen> and of course for some people it won't work
22:14 <@deen> anonymous proxies etc
22:15 < eeeee> why would you even...
22:15 <@EastByte> or playing in the ccc hamburg
22:15 <@deen> when i check ddnet player stats, there are always some people with geoip "anonymous proxy" or "unknown"
22:15 < eeeee> probably banned trolls and such
22:16 <@deen> we don't ban people though
22:16 <@deen> only a single person :P
22:16 <@deen> so yeah, it's fine all in all
22:17 <@deen> anyway, you hade some other fun ideas I'm waiting for!
22:17 <@deen> like loading skins on demand
22:17 <@deen> busy finishing adrenaline 3 again
22:17 <@EastByte> yes, eeeee we are waiting for PR :)
22:17 < eeeee> i basically have the skins code, it works but it just makes everything so ugly
22:18 <@EastByte> ugly?
22:18 < eeeee> yeah you have to put a lot of hacks everywhere
22:18 <@EastByte> ah I thought ugly ingame
22:19 < eeeee> to do it the right way you have to rewrite half of tw core (like matricks did in his ressys branch)
22:19 <@EastByte> would've been to easy otherwise
22:19 <@EastByte> too*
22:22 <@EastByte> eeeee: https://github.com/east/nimtw/blob/master/netmsg.nim <- this is how the datasrc python code generation would look like in nim (the network part)
22:23 <@EastByte> I think this is much more clean :)
22:23 < eeeee> yeah especially the description14 part :P
22:23 <@EastByte> yep... that's awkward
22:24 < eeeee> other than that looks good i guess. i like when there's no copypasta
22:24 <@deen> array[1..14]
22:25 <@deen> or 0..13, whatever you prefer
22:25 <@EastByte> hmm would make the macro more complicated
22:25 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw/blob/master/netmsgtypes.nim#L14
22:26 <@deen> sure, always make huge macros so you can save a few lines in the showcase code^^
22:26 <@EastByte> haha^^
22:26 <@deen> well known nim-ism
22:27 <@EastByte> I already unpacked some chat messages, works so far
22:27 <@deen> cool
22:27 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/nimtw/blob/master/bouncer.nim#L31
22:29 <@EastByte> most of nimtw still looks like nim abused as C
22:29 <@EastByte> I guess Araq wouldn't like that
22:30 <@deen> that' what happens
22:30 <@deen> when you translate code literally
22:36 <@EastByte> well I basically made the repo to learn translating C -> nim logically and not literally
22:36 <@EastByte> so I'll improve that
23:06 <@deen> EastByte: you could also put them into groups^^
23:06 <@deen> yes, no, pass, total: ClientIdValid
23:07 <@EastByte> also need a special case in the macro
23:07 <@EastByte> needs*
23:08 <@deen> i just like that about nim
23:08 <@deen> when you have parameters in a proc and members of an object, to define them like that
23:08 <@EastByte> yep me too
23:11 <@EastByte> the nim syntax actually feels more sexy than the one in python
23:13 <@deen> yes, i agree
23:13 <@deen> at first i wanted nim to be more similar to python
23:13 <@deen> but now i prefer it
23:14 <@EastByte> ^^
23:14 <@deen> i guess it's a result of araq just doing what he wants and having some unique views
23:14 <@deen> which also results in araq regularly bashing everything unix related, but oh well...
23:15 <@EastByte> so he uses windows?
23:16 <@EastByte> also he seems to have a different view about IDEs
23:23 <@deen> yeah
