01:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: can you send a voice memo on how to pronounce Learath2? Or did we do that already. I vaguely remember something.
01:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s Getty? Is it this https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/photo/illustration-of-black-curly-woman-on-pink-royalty-free-image/1480840544
01:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What do they do? Do they sell this simple cartoon image for 500 dollar? A single image? Not as physical painting by an artist? Just a png? Or what is this about
01:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Feature! No bug. It’s down for maintenance trying to make its ping smoother.
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao automatic heating
04:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> am i too stupid to use bindaddr in ddnet? is anyone using it?
04:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> what does it do?
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it binds a address
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if u have multiple ips you can choose one
04:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> from the ones that show up in ``ip a``
04:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am too stupid to use it in ddnet
04:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works like a charm in vanilla
04:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> like LAN or localhost or smt?
04:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
04:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur wifi might have a different local ip than ur lan 
04:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or your vps might have two public ipv4s assigned
04:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> do you set it in cfg? how do you use it?
04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> either 
04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> als cli arg or cfg
04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> work both in vanilla and none in ddnet
04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for example this should work at all times imo ```./DDNet-Server "bindaddr 127.0.0.1;sv_port 8888"```
04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> given ur 8888 is free
04:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> does it through an error or smt?
04:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes that it can not bind it
04:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then the server stops
04:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah same
04:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It has to be an user error
04:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well vanilla tw server also fails
04:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
04:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait what vanilla fails for you?
04:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send screen
04:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> `./teeworlds_srv "bindaddr 127.0.0.1;sv_port 8303"`
04:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is 8303 free on ur sys?
04:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ```./teeworlds_srv "bindaddr 0.0.0.0;sv_port 8303"```
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does this work for u?
04:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it does
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak ``ip a`` pls
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe you have no loopback defined or sumsin
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me 127 works
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh which tw version? im latest commit
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I use debian BTW
04:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> pastebin or do you have a paste service?
04:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use antiX BTW
04:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (debian without systemD)
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> run this as root <:justatest:572499997178986510>
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``wget -O /usr/local/bin/cstd https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/0 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cstd``
04:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD pastebin it is ig
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then ``cstd logfile.txt``
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fakof
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then do this xd ``wget -q -O - --post-file <file> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/``
04:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> why does it need root though?
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to install into /usr/local/bin
04:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah but why would a custom usr path suffice?
04:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u can also install it elsewhere but then you have to use ur own brain xd
04:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes 
04:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah
04:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> welp I'm too bored to set that up xD. https://pastebin.com/ss1hgKaL
04:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it'll expire after 1h
04:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd xd
04:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat shell u use?
04:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oksh I think or ksh
04:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> lemme see
04:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats the rc file location?
04:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm
04:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``echo $SHELL``
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/;wget https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/0 -O ~/.local/bin/cstd;echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> .kshrc``
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that could work 
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> untested might delete ur harddrive
04:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ru Learath though?
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm u have 127.0.0.1 right there why does it work for me but not for u
04:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not as evil as lerato
04:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat dis do ``./teeworlds_srv "bindaddr 192.168.1.10;sv_port 8888"``
04:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also thank for ur ip enjoy ddos
04:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> np
04:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> same
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how
04:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it works for me
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which tw version is that?
04:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> latest from site
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> latest commit?
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or latest release
04:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> latest release yeah this one <https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases/download/0.7.5/teeworlds-0.7.5-linux_x86_64.tar.gz>
04:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah cring outdated
04:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i somehow doubt it got fixed on master
04:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> story of vanillaa
05:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw that one `./tee... "bindaddr 192.168.1.10;...` aslo fails to bind
05:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u said that alr no?
05:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I said np and same to this
05:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > also thank for ur ip enjoy ddos
05:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaaa lol
05:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought "same" also fails
05:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah it did
05:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> communication skills
05:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> we're pro grammars
05:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go build tw from source
05:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 😬  ok
05:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> from github repo right?
05:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah the build from source also fails with that
05:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > ./teeworlds_srv "bindaddr 192.168.1.10;sv_port 8888"
05:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how
05:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about 127.0.0.1
05:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeap same ```[2024-01-28 06:07:21][net]: failed to bind socket with domain 10 and type 2 (99 'Cannot assign requested address')```
05:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats not an error
05:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that always shows no matter wat u do xd
05:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but does the tw server run without crashing?
05:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> this time it didn't (I tried running with this `./teeworlds_srv "bindaddr '192.168.1.10';sv_port '8888'"`)
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doubt
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fakin korn shell
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafalk
05:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :)
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt that a posix string command?!
05:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> idk I have a the bad habbit of closing something I see and I no longer see what to do with it so lemme rerun the cmds again
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ```./teeworlds_srv 'bindaddr 192.168.1.10;sv_port 8888'```
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe this works in korn shell
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then defs do not run the cstd install command i sent u
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your quoting will for sure reformat the harddrive
05:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
05:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Chillerato
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay thats it
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am filing a complaint
05:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> to?
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> these ddnet guys
05:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah
05:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> angry ddnet customer moment
05:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> did you pay your fee though?
05:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm ..
05:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i am totally paying the full premium ddnet pro monthly membership fee
05:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nice
05:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I was about to write where you should pay
05:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my company has a deal with ddnet corp so all employees get a ddnet membership for free 
05:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> #corporatebenefits
05:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nice
05:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bisect time i guess idk how far to go back
05:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i went 14k commits back that was before bam 5 support <:justatest:572499997178986510>
05:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> do you think it could be a firewall issue?
05:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 127.0.0.1
05:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ikr
05:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its all behind the firewall
05:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh idkr
05:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i tested 3 networks
05:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also why does the firewall only mess with ddnet and not tw?
05:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then ddnet should hack the firewall in the same way teeworlds does it
05:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes 14k commit old ddnet segfaults
05:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> classic C++ moment
05:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hah okay but bindaddr works!
05:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD maybe the formating of the cmd inputs changed or smt
05:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?? xd
05:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :monkaStop: me nobo
05:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> idk why it work with this though `./DDNet-Server "bindaddr localhost"`
05:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> localhost is a broken concept anyways
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfy4Q-uDV6I
05:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I thought localhost was 127.0.0.1
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cuz dns and localhost doing extra shits
05:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> na watch the video localhost might be more than 127.0.0.1
05:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> k
05:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao i sent u the prime reaction for extra commentary in case your attention span drops otherwise
05:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> now what's the difference between `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`?
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as far as i know 0.0.0.0 is basically bind all u can get or sumsin like that
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also usually the default
05:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but this is more me assuming than knowing
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what i do know is that when you bind 127.0.0.1 you do not need a firewall anymore. Because nobody from outside of your device can reach it
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> while if you bind 0.0.0.0 its usually reachable
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> check ``netstat -tulpn``
05:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see my ssh server at 0.0.0.0
05:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and a bunch of local services at 127.0.0.1
05:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so the test "bindaddr 0.0.0.0" might be useless its probably same as no bindaddr at all
05:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then "bindaddr 192.168.178.32" is one specific ip you have and not all or the first
05:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what 0.0.0.0 even does. can it bind multiple ips?
05:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who  knows
05:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> networking is something that in all those years acting all techy never really clicked for me <:feelsbadman:391614770303991808>
05:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :(
05:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw this is where the code for the bindaddr is (I think) (src/engine/server/server.cpp@2765)
05:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am just not exposed to any problems facing it usually so there is no hands on expiriecne
05:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> every time i lookup some yt vids on routing and iptables im lost xd
05:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks but i know how to find a string in the code xd
05:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
05:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hax
05:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i could blame the shit out of it but i decided to bisect instead
05:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
05:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also why u even awake 
05:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yru?
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt it 6 in the morning for u?
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me its almost lunch time :D 
05:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :)
05:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> have you ever seen a ghost sleep?
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat time is it for u?
05:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 6:50
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye watfak
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why u awake
05:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 🛏️ :scedule: 🔫
05:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> get some help
05:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It was I.
05:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well now it's almost time to wake up. It'd be a waste if I slept ^^
05:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bruv
05:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe it's the jetlag from coming from spending too much time in the underworld 🤔
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which underworld
05:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> fng
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxD
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jetlag from fng
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> classic
06:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bought myself an rx 7600, midrange gpu for only 260€
06:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> still better than what I had lmao (1050ti with low cache and 4gb vram)
06:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Now I can truly run teeworlds with rtx :owo:
06:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I was actually surprised it was that cheap for the performance it gives on most games with 1080p
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> amd consistently goes for way lower than nvidia used
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> brand loyalto
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> y
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> xnmx
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i would have gone for 6650 xt
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> it's very good valur rn
07:10 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
07:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well, for my specs it was the most optimal tho
07:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and I wouldnt spend too much noney on it, I just needed a replacement
07:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> gm :brownbear:
07:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> In 2019, a person chose a vanity license plate that said "NULL" and subsequently received thousands of dollars in fines from random vehicles for which the license plate was unavailable. Some database programmers somewhere along the way failed to consider the difference between the string NULL and the value NULL.
07:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> lmao
07:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> devs' worst nightmare: null as string debugging
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i remember that
08:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can you name yourself in tw null? xd
08:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but it will break ddnet servers axaxaxax
08:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @tsfreddie: yo fred did he say anything interesting? I just randomly found this https://bamcane.github.io/articles/DDNetPP.html too lazy to use translator xd
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm not your translator
08:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it's just a general guide of the mod
08:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also you can just ask the person @remakepower
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> he might not know ur joking
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> fred u aint gotta be rude..
09:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they did wrote a hit piece about how dead (admittedly true) TeeworldsCN was in 2022 so I don't feel like commenting more about how I feel about anything related to the guy lmao
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> fred do u have fortnite
09:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't
09:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks mr translator c:
09:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
09:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah he is a friend of yours
09:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Look another one of your friends just donated :)
09:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>  wdym friend
09:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> racist Dragon axaxaxax
09:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im troling a Bit
09:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
09:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Define hit piece?
09:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Was it trending on TikTok?
09:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Drunk deen
09:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @tsfreddie:
09:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just an article
09:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> on some chinese website
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Such hit
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What even is teeworldsCN
09:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> me
09:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i am TeeworldsCN
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How can you die?
09:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
09:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz I abandoned the servers
09:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Game servers!
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
09:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk they just think we don't host more teeworlds servers anymore and no one mods them anymore
09:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure I ever saw them. Are they behind GFW? Or is it my china ping filter
09:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i think we literally stopped modding all our server after that since everyone is getting jobs at that point
09:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There are china specific mods?
09:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like what?
09:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just mods that I could find back in 2013 or 2014
09:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and my solofng
09:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah like ball and shit?
09:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
09:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool
09:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> occasionally there might be some other things I made
09:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wowo developer
09:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> other than every fng reimplementation, everything just dies in a week i think
09:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i've made like 3 or 4 fngs
09:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> from with fstd code, from vanilla teeworlds, from ddnet and then from ddnet but ddnet-pvp
09:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
09:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still, everything is dead tho
09:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ddnet 1v1s lol
09:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i couldn't bother to update any of them
09:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet-pvp is literally made for 1v1s
09:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is ddnet-pvp
09:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz them 1v1 players keep kicking everyone just to have a server
09:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just a ddnet server stripped back to teeworlds gameplay and with multiple rooms
09:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well one things for sure
09:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/teeworldscn/ddnet-pvp
09:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> need good maps to make good gameplay
09:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool
09:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How merge friendly is it tho?
09:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not
09:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or will it outdated ddnet over time :c
09:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yep, not merge friendly at all
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i made it to have like 64 gamecontrollers and gameworlds
09:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for them rooms support lmao
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> each room can have their own gamemode too
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so it's a bit janky
09:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oh damn
09:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably better off with a proxy approach in the first place
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah it’s multi gamemode
09:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, multi gamemode
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks like the thing I started working on
09:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i abstracted a lot of stuff in gamemode class
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Modding via a proxy?
09:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i even had a weapon class so you can just code a new weapon without keep modifying the same entities
09:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rooms via a proxy?
09:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think fok had that
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> since ddnet-pvp is still capped at 64 clients
09:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah you want like multiple games. But one entry in the master server
09:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fokko has minigames but no proxy
09:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
09:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Some block servers and mmo servers had that I think
09:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> mainly for everything pvp related
09:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> zcatch fng instagib and stuff
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I build the exact same thing wtf
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didn’t know yours exist
09:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so the pvp players can just have one or two servers for everything they want to play
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
09:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't manage to finish multi maps
09:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I named it ddnet-insta because I only intend to add instagib based mods no vanilla damage CTF etch
09:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's a lot harder than i thought. or i'm just bad
09:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think I will just spam servers
09:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> check the issues on that repo
09:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was... optimistic
09:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :D
09:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i was quite proud about the gamecontroller interfaces tho
09:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go pr them to ddnet
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably can't
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
09:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i would need to add ddrace back which seems too much work
09:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I decoupled a lot of things, like one player can hold more than 5 weapons now. and you just register the weapons in your gamemode controller
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool stuff oke gtg
09:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>  ye, imma take a nap as well
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can we maybe move the community filter out of the whole (info/filter/friends) block?
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i still find it extremly unintuitive
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and currently the UI is also pretty unfair towards non-community servers
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201094064263659580/image.png?ex=65c89104&is=65b61c04&hm=49b84409ea5654fecdeb056537db9827169181ee083fbcad2660d139d6e93a8c&
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> our UI generally always feels so overwhelming, because there is so much text displayed at once
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> ball
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dragon
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> hi jkupstar
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> fix windows issue yet
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, i won't fix it for now since it's very very edge case and also depends on the mentioned SDL bug
11:09 < bridge> <robyt3> What about #7848?
11:10 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7848
11:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe could be fixed by setting correct window size when changing screen
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont have 2 screens
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also never implemented anything for it
11:11 < bridge> <robyt3> I see, you'd also need two screens of different size
11:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, I think the shipping for one of my screens for cheaper than the screen itself
11:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, I think the shipping for one of my screens for more expensive than the screen itself
11:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, I think the shipping for one of my screens was more expensive than the screen itself
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> ill do it
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted it up top
11:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @swarfey: bot supporter axaxaxax https://youtu.be/caIs71IpWTM?si=QIKELrxG1qHWbtZM
11:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> flooding for skids
11:56 < bridge> <swarfey> O_o
11:56 < bridge> <swarfey> Wasnt there some too many connections in a short time thingy at some point?
12:00 < ChillerDragon> maybe its rigged local server
12:56 < bridge> <swarfey> fair enuf
12:56 < bridge> <swarfey> its kog, they might run some rigged ddnet
12:56 < bridge> <swarfey> seems like kog, they might run some rigged ddnet
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> How did this even happen? Github knows my avatar but at the same time doesn't know my avatar
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201133853121716305/image.png?ex=65c8b612&is=65b64112&hm=6567bfcda3597a2c4aa6b576bb2b9174a85846d40a4f148344293afcde5750ee&
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> javascript devs
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> web developers, try not to have 50 sources of truth challenge, impossible difficulty
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> facts :justatest:
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thats why u gotta use htmx :gigachad:
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the more i use javascript(or typescript etc.) the less i like async coding. not bcs async is bad, but bcs javascript uses it for everything xD
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh the profile picture component is out of sync, let's just ignore the error
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead of handling it
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can't recover anymore anyway
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ive seen some lib which takes async function to set .env variables. you can easily send 10 requests collect all data  and then run the app
13:17 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Exactly that. +100 ❤️
13:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Exactly that. +100 ❤️
13:22 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I've complained about this issue back on Oct 8 when the PR was opened, as it hurts a lot.
13:23 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Exactly that. +100 ❤️
13:23 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I've complained about this issue back on Oct 8 when the "Communities" PR was opened, as it hurts a lot.
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno why you wouldn't just put it next to the existing filters..
13:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Where? Above the filter seems doable, but left or right is impossible because we still support 5:4 resolutions
13:32 < bridge> <Ewan> Press F4 for free hat
13:38 < bridge> <remakepower> The new type filter seems be similar to the "game types filter", only difference is the new type filter only select the communities (in the communities filter) server
13:39 < bridge> <remakepower> and it's has less game types for you to choose
13:42 < bridge> <remakepower> oh, that's a bug?
13:42 < bridge> <remakepower> Sorry, i didn't see the commit
13:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Seen this avatar today already. I think it’s Microsoft fucking stuff up again
13:59 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201149455827738695/screenshot_2024-01-28_13-58-09.png?ex=65c8c49a&is=65b64f9a&hm=4e9c5262a32949d629fa787e9f88c90a92d752ce8ae6015cfba08361807f6d85&
14:00 < bridge> <remakepower> wow, pretty ui
14:01 < bridge> <remakepower> but why we need to add the page button join again
14:21 < bridge> <louis> ooh that's nice
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it would be epic without kog there
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
14:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki please trashing other people's projects, at least in a lazy way
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not trashing anything
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> its closed source and we should foster a open source community
14:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can say that, but not the first thing, please
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ???
14:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > #1 Be nice – Don't insult others or engage in lazy negativity towards other people's projects, even as a joke.
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt do that accordinf to my judgement
14:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
14:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in my view, saying negative stuff about other projects, e.g. kog, falls under that rule, if it's not accompanied by some reasoning
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> saying u dont want kog in ddmet client doesnt mean saying its bad or trashing it
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 maybe we should reserve the community filters for communities hosting more than a couple of servers, while still allowing others to get a logo
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe that was an overly strict reading of the rules, ok 🙂
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nais
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cant wait for tabs back 😬
15:08 < bridge> <zhn> 4:3 problem?
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he means if left & right side are used for filters
15:11 < bridge> <robyt3> 5:4 has the lowest width available, so only 3 favorite tabs are possible
15:11 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201167765332049940/screenshot_2024-01-28_15-09-41.png?ex=65c8d5a7&is=65b660a7&hm=0ed2074d979d88bb48201677617cc19e7c79979fbc3d4a9266f0e2a2bc1f1898&
15:12 < bridge> <robyt3> 5:4 has the lowest width available, so only 3 favorite community tabs are possible

15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that sounds good already
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what happens if u select 4? XD
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> peng
15:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Removes the oldest one so at most 3 are selected
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean that is probs already lot of work.
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> theoretically we could maybe add some kind of arrow that lets you select out of all favorites and throws the most right out or smth like that xD
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i guess your solution is fine
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki for AGPL, the worst of all licenses, is the one that shares a modified library always the one that takes responsiblity?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. i modify a AGPL lib, but don't release the source code. now this lib gets widely shared, so basically impossible to revert the "damage"
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are the users that use it also doing smth illegal then?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is i release the lib annonymously and it will still spread as said
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> you have to share the source when u share the lib/software
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for normal copyrighted stuff users are probably also doing illegal stuff if they get a copy
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes but what happens if that doesnt happen
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u never share it or let anyone else use it i think u dont have to share, its when a user uses the software he has the right to have the source
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> for agpl if the user uses the server software he has the right to have the source too
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if he doesnt have the source that's no problem for the user?
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only for the one that shared it?
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean in the context of a server?
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u get GTA 5 illegal.. you criminal
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you get a modified AGPL game, whos modifications are not shared, is that illegal for the user to use?
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like GTA
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its the duty of the distributor
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure this is all defined in legal jargon xd
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but gpl is all about the user
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its proba fault of the one who has given the user the software
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if he released it annonymously, the AGPL software can be distributed without any fear?
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs the end user defs doesnt know he is doing smth illegal
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and he might share it with friends
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> using the software is probs never ilegal in gpl, but if u dont have the source its more about someone broke the right u have to have the soutce
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> fokim mobile
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or even in internet, not knowing it's AGPL
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> the end user will never be dojng anything ilegal
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> more like someone is breaking the user rights
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> because the user by using agpl software has the right to obtain thw source code
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see, so the sharer is highly criminal
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he betrayed 8 billion ppl
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> potentially
15:35 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> Lol, where did DDNet community go ingame?
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
15:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> what os do you guys use?
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kog invaded us
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 when fix
15:37 < bridge> <vena6080> pls go back to old ddnet, why delete the tab ddnet and Kog???
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @vena6080
15:38 < bridge> <vena6080> again random shit done in dev
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they will come back
15:38 < bridge> <robyt3> @deen DDNet community is missing, related to adding turkey servers to info?
15:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> i want to install some reasonably easy to use linux distro
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kubuntu
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont use it
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd say thats a good distro
15:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Fixed it, was a missing comma in the servers json
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😄
15:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> deen biggest trol
15:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> casual rm -rf /root in a commit disguised as „no more variables.h“
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's when u dont use vscode to edit your json
15:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use gentoo btw 😏
15:46 < bridge> <pilonpl> i was thinking about fedora or pop os
15:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> fedora because some other internet person told me about it
15:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> pop os because it seems like a popular distro on proton db lol
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> have u ever used linux before?
15:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> yes
15:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> i am using linux rn
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then fedora might be a new challenge
15:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> why
15:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use iOS BTW
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno what your are interested in linux.
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fedora is simply a distro that doesnt inhered from debian or arch
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like most do
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u just want good desktop experience, kubuntu or pop os might be better
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fedora was the first to use LTO no most packages afaik
15:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> thats what i thought since no one on protondb uses fedora
15:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> so far i have used linux mint and manjaro
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i am biased, i don't like pop os bcs of gnome.
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i guess u can try and see if u like it
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> other than gentoo, nixos or arch most distros are same boring
15:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is LTO
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its whether u choose rolling distro or not
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> rolling means more updated software
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> optimizations at linking time
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> link time optimizations
15:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets implement tto
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> tee time optimization
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> vto
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> rto
15:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> CTO
15:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess its possible to install some other desktop enviroment
15:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s the point then
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno, chiller likes gnome
15:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn’t pop os mostly about the desktop environment?
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe ur brain is like chillers
15:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> gnome is pog
15:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> My brain is crack
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t like pop os because it’s not Debian
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is ubuntu debian for you?
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pop os sounds like Ubuntu to me
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> based
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Same as C++ is not C
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you read out of sync
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> As oy would say it
15:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> i would use a window manager if i was *pro* enough to use it
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i agreed with you
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh no
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Windows manager
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kwin
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> KDE window manager
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> KDE = Windows
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> KDE = Windows but in better
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Gnome = macOS
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gnome = Android just for tablets only
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rude
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Android is ugly af
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you got it
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> finally
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😉
16:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .\_.
16:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You tricked me
16:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> is android a linux distro?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, but modified linux kernel
16:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> so it is linux
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a bit
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since android 8 there is also SELinux
16:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> actually i think we need more OSes for mobile devices
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think we need one that isnt built around java
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :cammostripes:
16:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> but its not gonna happen
16:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> because everyone just uses android lol
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly that is the case
16:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> at least better than ios
16:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> the only issue with ios is apple
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how much java is it in practice?
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me iOS is red flag anyway.. it forces you to use safari
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is it JITed?
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not about performance
16:05 < bridge> <pilonpl> how is that even legal lol
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without java u cant request most APIs
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apple has graciously allowed you to provide more browser engines thanks to the dma
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but only in the eu
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but afaik the backend is still safari
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or did that change recently?
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, chnged like two days ago
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> yo what enum does spawn tile have again?
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but no browser engine has been released, I think
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> finally webgl 2 support on iOS XD
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fcking apple
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> Did you see apple skirting the eu law requiring them to allow sideloading?
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I hope hte hammer comes down on them
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also heard they now allow other stores? but still want money from those
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if the eu will just let it slide
16:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> core technology fee
16:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> nope
16:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> they dont even comply with the law
16:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> with the goals of the law
16:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe the US is going to get some better legislation around it
16:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if they start seeing browser enginees popping up on ios
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Goals/spirit of the law interpretations are much different to letter of the law interpretations
16:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> they are one of the biggest companies in the world and they are afraid allowing people to actually use their devices will destroy their bussiness lol
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> The people will even defend their behaviour. If not for the pesky governments they wouldn't really even need to change anything ever
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> not allowing users to install software without apple's consent is actually a feature
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> because
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> malware
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> and children
16:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> lol
16:14 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> So sorry to disturb but can u check this client's legallity https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1200936283363627008
16:15 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> I need an offical recommend, really
16:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> i am pretty sure only the features present in the official client are allowed
16:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> also whats the point of developing a separate client
16:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> when you could just improve the official one
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it changes what you can do with your dummy, it's not allowed
16:22 < bridge> <syrinok> Modifying how the dummy works for any kind of advantage is against the rules.
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> What about chika's private Client then? Controlling what Inputs are copied by cl_dummy_copy
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> (only movement, only Hook, dont JUMP when Main jumps)
16:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you had to finish the refactoring and only then merge :kek:
16:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh @milkeeycat why xd
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It does almost nothing. I thought we had to refactor everything and then merge :p
16:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I take every fix in master I can get c:
17:08 < bridge> <degisikadamx02> ty all ! it is hard to accept but I'm sure I have to put a stop to this project :( . My main motivation was making dummy more controllable and advanced. Also I wonder about Chika's private client. Is it acceptable to modify which input dummy can copy separately?

17:43 < bridge> <teero777> yo are there any instructions on how to compile old clients with bam?
17:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> smt like this https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_linux ?
17:46 < bridge> <teero777> thx
17:53 < bridge> <teero777> shit i need bam 0.4.x bug there are no releases for that....
17:53 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201208404945948712/image.png?ex=65c8fb81&is=65b68681&hm=e5f452e37e27f036983512324a985f40010d1a8f1852d8d48bfa8179624dd095&
17:53 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/matricks/bam/
17:54 < bridge> <teero777> nvm
17:57 < bridge> <teero777> okay it works
17:57 < bridge> <teero777> nvm
18:04 < bridge> <teero777> okay ddnet 3.0 is uncompileable without pulling old versions of the libraries
18:47 < bridge> <baby frog> why is it when i comment out entire sections of code that are seemingly important, there is no change in-game? or, visually there is a change, but, it just appears very "laggy"
18:47 < bridge> <baby frog> (i know this is a very stupid question, but if someone could humor me i would appreciate it)
18:48 < bridge> <baby frog> and i'm talking about core features of the game, like firing the weapon, or changing "Tick" code
18:55 < bridge> <patiga> @lukaskawalec are you compiling your own client or server?
18:55 < bridge> <baby frog> i cloned ddnet and am working on that, if that's what you mean?
18:56 < bridge> <baby frog> i make changes to game-server for example
18:58 < bridge> <baby frog> are you suggesting that i am only making changes client-side, and server side nothing is affected? @patiga
19:00 < bridge> <baby frog> Ahhhhhhhh
19:00 < bridge> <baby frog> i guess i wasn't building the solution... i was only pressing 'Play" as that worked in the past
19:00 < bridge> <baby frog> now it's making a difference
19:01 < bridge> <baby frog> thank you 🙂
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> @deen it'll have to be a 18.0.3 sorry :/
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> I seem to have messed up the updater much more than I thought. Just never tested a client/server update, data updates worked fine so I assumed those would also work
19:35 < bridge> <baby frog> only advantage would be to not copy movement
19:36 < bridge> <baby frog> if you want to copy movement and hook, but not jump, then you can do that with dummy control
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> simultaneously ?
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> I have grown so rusty that it's actually shameful
19:37 < bridge> <baby frog> cl_dummy_control 1; cl_dummy_copy_moves 1; bind mouse2 “+hook; +toggle cl_dummy_hook 1 0”
19:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> interesting, the dummy gets the jump input, but doesnt jump (indicated by movement arrows) - also there's a typo in cl_dummy_control lol
20:01 < bridge> <baby frog> yes this is a core feature of dummy_copy and dummy_control. if you have both enabled at the same time, the dummy will only copy movement and aim - and it makes jump, hook and fire optional.
20:02 < bridge> <baby frog> never noticed the typo
20:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> "Whether can you control dummy at the same time" doesnt sound right
20:03 < bridge> <baby frog> yeah its the same on ddnet.org
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki you use neovim, right?
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> not much lately
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> mostly vscode
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> what made you go back?
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had smth in my config that annoyed me
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i didnt find time to fix it so i just used vscode xd
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> Another question, did you have LSP working within cmake projects?
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always ln -s the compile_commands.json to base dir tho
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Did you use a cmake plugin or did you generate your own cmake projects and symlink?
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i run cmake myself
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux as a ide if u use nvim
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i run cmake myself with vscode too tho xd
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a script tho
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> for ddnet
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> and another for llvm
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> one last question, did you use something like `project.nvim`?
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
21:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe my way is outdated tho
21:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> are you gonna use neovim? 😏
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> yeah, I'm considering it, I kinda got bored of vscode so I need something to waste my time learning so I can feel productive
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :gigachad:
21:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> Learath Just Pass the clangd Compiler flag through cmake and make it an alias to get clangd working correctly with nvim
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim you can check this out if you want :owo:
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> I don't follow 😄
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> I wish we had a cmake target for `generated`
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> I'd rather not make local changes to the cmakelists, nor do I want to lock myself into only compiling with clang, keep that in mind
21:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Not modifying the local cmake - But passing the flag: cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/path/to/clangd"
21:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Nvim is a Lot of fun espacially configuring it in lua
