08:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but apparently not the ddnet's ones, very weird
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> is there a way to implement api in to google doc to keep the points updated there in a list?
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> or does a public api even exist? ^^¬∞

11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno exactly what you mean, but the driver app can handle auto sync, so you can write a tool for your computer that fetches the current ddnet database and converts the files to whatever you need
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but there is no tool in ddnet if you meant that
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno exactly what you mean, but the google drive app can handle auto sync, so you can write a tool for your computer that fetches the current ddnet database and converts the files to whatever you need
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> with google doc you can do this really easy without creating a new tool/programm. just api is needed
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but there is no API in ddnet todo that for google docs
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> You can maybe import the CVS and filter only stuff you need:

13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > PING www.facebook.com(2a03:2880:f11c:8083:face:b00c:0:25de) 56 data bytes
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just noticed
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> facebook ipv6 addre has facebooc in it

13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd

14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> are you guys using the pc's location to set the bg in tw?
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> the local time and date
14:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> i see
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nice, with 2¬π¬≤‚Å∏ possible addresses, i guess you can choose whatever you want just like in some US state where you can choose your own license plate
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn get a ipv6 with the hex 0xdeadbeef in it
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 0xDEADBEEF was originally used to mark newly allocated areas of memory that had not yet been initialized‚Äîwhen scanning a memory dump, it is easy to see the 0xDEADBEEF. It is used by IBM RS/6000 systems, Mac OS on 32-bit PowerPC processors, and the Commodore Amiga as a magic debug value. On Sun Microsystems' Solaris, it marks freed kernel memory. The DEC Alpha SRM console has a background process that traps memory errors, identified by 
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> curiosity

19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if you can trigger some bug by having these in an ipv6 address
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> shouldn't. we always just used them on a crash/memory corruption to see what was going on with the memory in question. so you could only confuse the dev debugging

20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Microsoft has swiftly fixed an embarrassing gaffe which saw a chunk of code labelled "big boobs".
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> The hexadecimal string 0xB16B00B5 was discovered lurking in code that helps a Microsoft program work with Linux open source software.
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo>

22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> open source therrorism? I approve
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> That's scary on nvidia side
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> but like, can you actually negotiate like that? have hackers a good track record with not just using the same hostage again?
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc the hostage would keep them having the drivers open source xd
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but probs nvidia wont do anything
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but iirc nvidia confirmed the leaks
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Nvidia was the victim of a ransomware attack a few days ago. The group that claims to be responsible for the attack says it had access to Nvidia servers for a week, gained admin access, and pulled at least 1TB of data (via Tom's hardware). The group has threatened to sell or release the data unless Nvidia contacts them and removes the mining performance limiter on their RTX 30-series GPUs.
22:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i love the picture caption
22:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > According to Nvidia, the hack was initially described as 'relatively minor,' and explicitly said it had no connection to the war between Russia and Ukraine. The group also said itself, "we are not state-sponsored and we not in politics AT ALL," from screenshotted Telegram messages shared by Videocardz.

22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If they have anything, they will release some content in torrent, in crypted form.
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Not key of course
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's the point of releasing in crypted form?
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess they can also leak excerpt, or directory structure so that nothing valuable is leaked, but still show that they really have the data
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> They release key only to nvidia, yeah, to show they really have data.
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Torrent package would spread in zero time, infinite backups at zero cost üòâ
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> This is a company killer move, btw.
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Cinese competitors don't give a shit of patents ü§£
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <M Emile> Any chance "cl_antiping_smooth" will ever be added to the ddnet tab in the options?
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <M Emile> Nobody seems to know it's a thing
