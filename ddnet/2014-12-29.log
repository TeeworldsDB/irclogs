00:09 <@deen> Finally a good looking singing solution: http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify
00:10 <@deen> there's a "portable" version: https://github.com/nurse/signify/commits/master
00:10 <@deen> Especially fun is the last commit: "Remove Linux support"
02:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/XAcaXA
02:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 66be23c def: Remove unused members
06:11 < eeeee> didn't know you're into singing
09:16 < eeeee> latest zlib commit breaks my js thing :(
09:16 < eeeee> think i'm gonna write a sad song about it
09:20 <@deen> huh?
09:20 <@deen> all i did was update zlib, right?
09:20 <@deen> signing*^^
09:22 < Nimda> Koule 7 by Intercity & Broken & Bee just released on Novice at 2014-12-29 09:19
09:23 < eeeee> yeah but it seems that now it's not including the necessary headers because i don't have the necessary defines
09:23 < eeeee> or something like that
09:25 < coffee`123> I have the same problem deen
09:25 < coffee`123> http://pastebin.com/6qDJ3WF8
10:00 < eeeee> seems easy to fix
10:00 < eeeee> i can take a look tomorrow
10:01 <@deen> oh =/
10:01 <@deen> sorry about that, had to apply the new zlib version because there were huge security vulnerabilities
10:02 < eeeee> yeah in my case i just dont HAVE_UNISTD_H anymore for some reason
10:02 <@deen> hm
10:03 < eeeee> including it manually helps
10:03 <@deen> including what where?
10:03 <@deen> coffee`123: if we remove the include to gzguts.h it works?
10:03 <@deen> or what?
10:03 < eeeee> well just writing "#if 1" instead of "#ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H"
10:04 < eeeee> not sure whats the right way to deal with that though
10:04 <@deen> me neither, and why does it work here?
10:04 < eeeee> but it compiled! so cant be wrong
10:05 < eeeee> idk i also dont get it how was it working before the update
10:05 < eeeee> but i can't debug now, have to sleep
10:05 < eeeee> work tomorrow
10:28 < coffee`123> I'm running on windows deen and I use mingw64
10:28 < coffee`123> When I remove the include gzguts.h everything works fine
11:45 <@heinrich5991> deen: what sec vulns?
11:46 <@deen> "Version 1.2.8 fixes a very rare bug in decompression. All users are encouraged to upgrade immediately."
11:46 <@deen> http://www.zlib.net/
11:47 <@deen> ah wait, maybe not a security vulnerability
13:11 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8809215 :)
13:11 <@heinrich5991> you're the top post
13:34 <@deen> heinrich5991: I know, but I posted too early^^
13:34 <@deen> I assumed it was released because I saw the news post, but they haven't uploaded binaries yet, oops
13:37 <@deen> And too bad it's not Nim 1.0 yet :P
13:39 <@deen> still, I think Nim would be ideal for hookrace if I ever get to writing it
13:49 <@heinrich5991> deen: I don't think you can easily extract a new game from the current ddrace community
13:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: Wouldn't be my plan, I'd want something new
15:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: "Nim has the advantage of compiling to/through C, for which compilers have been optimized for a long time."
15:04 <@heinrich5991> Rust compiles to LLVM IR, also gets similar optimizations for free
15:07 <@deen> Yeah, they said the same on HN
15:07 <@deen> not sure, maybe clang does some special thing for C code
15:08 <@deen> otherwise I don't know why Nim was faster than Rust in all benchmarks I've seen
15:10 <@heinrich5991> maybe it nim makes it easier to write performant code?
15:12 <@heinrich5991> I haven't seen many nim benchmarks though
15:12 <@heinrich5991> can you point me to one?
15:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
16:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #120: added refill jumps and cleaned tile detection (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/TVw-FA
16:53 < DoNe> src/game/server/entities/character.ccp L1593 missing?
16:56 < DoNe> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1555
16:56 < DoNe> oops it was 1593 because i changed smth
17:08 <@deen> sorry, heinrich5991, decided to hike in the snow
17:09 <@deen> haven't seen many with Nim & Rust either
17:09 <@deen> http://togototo.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/benchmarks-round-two-parallel-go-rust-d-scala-and-nimrod/
17:09 <@deen> https://github.com/logicchains/LPATHBench/blob/master/writeup.md
17:12 <@deen> https://github.com/zezba9000/RayTraceBenchmark
17:14 <@deen> I guess most don't publish their small benchmarks. I tested Nim against a few gnu coreutils and was quite happy with the performance
17:26 < Savander> ovh = "Takes the task with an error. Some features will not be available until the problem is resolved. Please be patient." ahm
17:38 < mpl_> hmm i can't download maps to be tested
17:45 <@deen> mpl_: huh?
17:46 <@deen> mpl_: ah, you're not a tester
17:46 < mpl_> yea you removed me :/
17:46 < mpl_> I've been doing some testing this morning
17:48 <@deen> oh
17:49 <@deen> i thought you were inactive, so i removed you and some other testers
17:49 <@deen> want to be a trial tester or official one (have to be a bit more active)?
18:03 < mpl_> its hard to be a player , a mapper and a tester at the same time
18:03 < mpl_> put me on trial i guess
18:03 < mpl_> to be judged.
18:03 <@deen> yeah, then you can download maps from forum
18:03 <@deen> but i don't expect you to test 24/7 :P
18:04 <@deen> also, why do you always have a different name on IRC? hard to tell it's you
18:06 < mpl_> im too lazy to type out my whole name
18:06 < mpl_> lol
18:06 < mpl_> im the wurst
18:14 < mpl_> what do we do if we think a map is ready for release
18:15 < mpl_> i think MojoJump is
19:35 < Maple> yea mojojump seems ready deen
19:36 < Maple> rush it to the limit
19:38 < WolfAlex> Muttley, tw afk?
19:39 <@deen> oh god, so many forum posts
19:40 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:40 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 539
19:40 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
19:43 <@heinrich5991> deen: what's maxclients on ddnet currently?
19:44 <@heinrich5991> and is there a way to query the complete server info?
19:44 <@deen> max clients per ip is 4
19:45 <@heinrich5991> and max_clients?
19:45 <@deen> complete server info? send a 64 player serverinfo request and get back (up to) 3 packets
19:45 <@deen> 64
19:45 <@deen> we often bump at the limit of 64
19:45 <@heinrich5991> bump?
19:45 <@deen> we often have servers with full 64 players
19:45 <@deen> like right now
19:45 <@heinrich5991> deen: is there some hint that a server supports the 64 player info request?
19:46 <@deen> heinrich5991: i use some weird heuristic
19:46 <@deen> but always have to send a normal request first =/
19:46 < meow_> sup deen, i know you're irritated by things like this but i accidently finished a map because i changed my name with clan prefix and not to my real name :/ would it be too much effort to take a short change on it
19:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: for your own servers you could append a hint to the normal server info?
19:47 <@deen> heinrich5991: this is the heuristic: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp#L22-L27
19:48 <@deen> meow_: map name, from which name to which?
19:49 < meow_> Biome Master, from Sk|Meow~ to Meow~ and from Sk|Spyker to Spyker 
19:49 < meow_> it will be the last time i annoye you with this shitty namechange
19:49 < laxa> meow_: last time was already last time :D
19:49 < meow_> -.-
19:49 < meow_> psssh
19:49 < laxa> xD
19:50 <@deen> hey laxa 
19:50 < laxa> Hey deen
19:51 <@deen> meow_: done
19:51 < laxa> new hall of fame coming this night if I don't forget to upload :)
19:51 < meow_> could you do this for spyker too, please? 
19:51 < meow_> :3
19:52 <@deen> meow_: exact names?
19:52 <@deen> done
19:52 <@deen> you guys with your names...
19:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: I accidently finished a map with the wrong name, I think I finished with 'deen'? can you run a quick replace all "deen" with "heinrich5991" please? if it's not too much work
19:52 <@heinrich5991> :D
19:53 <@deen> heinrich5991: exactly
19:53 <@deen> people want to change names way too often
19:53 <@deen> even if we had accounts I wouldn't want to allow it
19:54 < meow_> Sk|Spyker to Spyker
19:55 <@deen> done already
19:57 < meow_> DX Racer
19:57 <@deen> ?
19:58 < meow_> oh sorry, it wasnt for you guys :D
20:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/fHWLjQ
20:06 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 f0d8300 def: Fix old bug
20:32 < Nimda> MojoJump by Vasten100 just released on Solo at 2014-12-29 20:30
20:35 <@deen> Maple: you have Dinner running after you in forum repeating your opinion? :P
20:35 < Maple> i guess we think alike
20:36 <@deen> it's enough if one of you posts and writes "tested with X, who has same opinion
20:36 <@deen> "
20:43 < Maple> we didnt test all together though
20:43 < Maple> and Mojojump gives too many points
20:43 < Maple> i finished in 4 mins, 12 points
20:52 <@deen> ok
21:54 < Maple> god i feel stupid
21:54 < Maple> like i did a perfect run
21:54 < Maple> but i just noticed that
21:54 < Maple> i standed 20 seconds at start of the run
21:54 < Maple> and i had touched the start line 
21:54 < Maple> and i didnt know
21:54 < Maple> xD
21:55 < Maple> im literally crying right now
22:05 <@deen> hahaha
22:05 <@deen> bad luck :P
