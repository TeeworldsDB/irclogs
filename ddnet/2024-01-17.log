00:32 < bridge> <reitw> upgrade ur os lmao
00:32 < bridge> <reitw> well debian 12 comes with openssl 3 for eg
00:34 < bridge> <yekrm> The hosting only has ubuntu 20.04 and debian 11 üíÄ
00:34 < bridge> <yekrm> I'm already looking for another one
02:54 < ChillerDragon> i am starting to blame fkin asan for my issues
02:55 < ChillerDragon> if i run it with asan it corrupts my pointers and without it works fine
04:01 < ChillerDragon> okay finally! i have somewhat prooven that i could argue it is not me who introduced the bug to some degree
04:01 < ChillerDragon> i blame magnus
08:00 < bridge> <learath2> It does it on purpose so ub breaks
08:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's the spirit
08:26 < bridge> <teero777> well just make own chain things for the game mode and don't reuse the server ones?
08:26 < bridge> <teero777> copy-paste
08:39 < ChillerDragon> that sounds horrible
08:39 < ChillerDragon> how would i even chain the existing console without touching its code
08:46 < bridge> <teero777> Haven't looked at the code
08:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Touch the Code, If you were to understand magnus's old Code, you'd ascend to the Higher realms
08:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/Milk-Interpreters/milk/blob/main/README.md what do you think 'bout this kind of syntax? :owo:
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```cpp
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> // create that son of the bitch on heap
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> let heap_foo: *Foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo)) as Foo;
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
09:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Nice
09:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont even know if half of those ideas are possible :kek:
09:30 < ChillerDragon> touching code is not an option in git conflict driven development
10:21 < bridge> <kekomonter> Typescript++? :monkaS:
10:22 < bridge> <zhn> it looks like rust
10:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> typescript is like a linter xd i hope it will have real types xd
10:22 < bridge> <zhn> rust++
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> never
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> imagine having typepython
10:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i yoinked all cool parts of rust
10:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but saved pointers
10:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> Rust with pointers :thonk:
10:24 < bridge> <zhn> clearly
10:24 < bridge> <zhn> he added weak pointers into rust xd
10:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust written by toddler with pointers
10:24 < bridge> <zhn> use unsafe
10:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no generics and no traits :feelsbadman:
10:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Rust with pointers? No need to Use Rust at that Point :BRUHH:

10:50 < ChillerDragon> ryo uses gentoo BTW
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes thats me
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my logs got spammy is that on me?
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705486700.png
11:23 < bridge> <zhn> master merged?
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last merge was uhm like 2 day ish ago
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its a custom fork
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt really touch the master code so i am wondering if i somehow managed to add a bug 
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i merged master just now again lets see
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still happenin 
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on empty servers actually
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try vanilla ddnet
11:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps related to the curl-multi PR
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can check whether it also happens before
11:26 < bridge> <zhn> maybe https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7683
11:26 < bridge> <zhn> ah
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> official ddnet servers dont have it?
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unclear if they're updated yet, probably not
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet-insta is bleeding edge hehe
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet servers are debian 12 right?
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep have it in vanilla ddnet too 
11:58 < bridge> <zhn> src/engine/shared/http.cpp:510
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/7c4bde43b1de69c718cd23c2b8dd35b268cf6080/src/engine/shared/http.cpp#L510
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> previously, logging looked like this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f298b2802665754f8476f715e096efd9617a1aea/src/engine/shared/http.cpp#L288-L303
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so just add ``	if(g_Config.m_DbgCurl || m_LogProgress >= HTTPLOG::ALL)`` and call it done?
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also why does it do sooo many requests even?
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> yo are custom master servers supported on the client side?
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> yo are custom master servers supported on the client/server side?
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> So basically like a private network of servers
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> With passwds and stuff would be cool. So you could select a custom master server and tell it a password and then you can join all the servers
12:32 < ChillerDragon> define supported
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> No need to change code
12:33 < ChillerDragon> the master is basically just a hardcodet url in the code 
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok
12:33 < ChillerDragon> oh yea then no
12:33 < ChillerDragon> but easy to swap out and the master is also easy to self host
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> new pr incoming
12:33 < ChillerDragon> true tw masters on the server side were a masters.cfg
12:34 < ChillerDragon> so that was more custom master friendly
12:34 < bridge> <furo321> You can change the URL the server registers to with `sv_register_url`, but client-side is hardcoded.
12:34 < bridge> <teero777> So it's useless basically xd
12:34 < ChillerDragon> no
12:34 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe for a hub of servers that connect to a custom master server
12:35 < ChillerDragon> i do not see much difference in effort in shipping new clients to your users vs shipping new configs
12:35 < ChillerDragon> both is a manaual process for all of your users
12:35 < bridge> <kaffeine0> "Type this in F1" vs "fork, build, distribute the clients for all supported platforms"
12:35 < ChillerDragon> but yea would be cool if it would also be customizable on the client side
12:36 < ChillerDragon> yea ok fair
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> haha I already see ppl trying to connect to servers and then noticing they accidentally changed master server xd
12:37 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I forgot to add "maintain", which means "repeat for each DDNet release". üòï
12:37 < ChillerDragon> omg you mean master servers showing up in the server list? :D 
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> Dunno
12:37 < ChillerDragon> then you need a master master server
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> Would be cooler for differentiating between kog and ddnet or other platforms
12:38 < ChillerDragon> thats  your use case? :D 
12:38 < ChillerDragon> we have cummunities bruv
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> idk I just thought it would be cool to host own master server
12:38 < ChillerDragon> yes it would
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> client side can be read from a fil as well
12:39 < ChillerDragon> oh ok nice
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> master_urls.cfg or so
12:39 < ChillerDragon> here u go
12:39 < ChillerDragon> teero when host
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg`
12:39 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that it only downloads one of them
12:39 < ChillerDragon> ou sad
12:39 < ChillerDragon> im waiting for scrumplex reverse proxy master server
12:39 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller let's make secret community
12:40 < bridge> <furo321> Oh right, I totally forgot about this. Nice!
12:40 < ChillerDragon> ok
12:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so you need to include the official list if you want to add more servers
12:41 < bridge> <teero777> for real gamers
12:41 < ChillerDragon> pog
12:43 < bridge> <Scrumplex> lo
12:43 < bridge> <Scrumplex> lol
12:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a nice project if you don't have an idea on how to do that yet üòâ
13:32 < bridge> <zhn> updates info about server it seems
13:33 < bridge> <zhn> on every known masterserver
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: how many is "so many"?
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it does one for every info change, but at least every 15s
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IIRC
13:34 < bridge> <zhn> yeah had the same idea quite long time ago, but its not really useful as it sounds to be
13:35 < bridge> <zhn> like lmfao every tw project will host their masterservers for their own projects
13:35 < bridge> <zhn> kog master + ddnet master
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> + noname projects will appear as soon as possible
13:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> @reitw when blockworlds master server
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is a custom master server interesting?
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> for project-turned clients i think
13:36 < bridge> <zhn> i don't know for now xd
13:37 < bridge> <zhn> in before it was quz we had no http masters
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't understand this sentence
13:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ats
13:37 < bridge> <zhn> like you would be able to send some *personal* info to master
13:37 < bridge> <zhn> account system for masters huh
13:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give an example?
13:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can already send whatever info you want to the mastersevers
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> custom master that will not send you any server it has in list unless you logged in
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> i.e
13:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see the benefit
13:39 < bridge> <zhn> from my side
13:39 < bridge> <zhn> like if i had custom server
13:40 < bridge> <zhn> i would be able to send my servers an "event" or notification about player log in in master so it would be able to show other logged players that he's ingame
13:40 < bridge> <zhn> currently you will not see any player afking in menu
13:41 < bridge> <zhn> idk i just throwin random ideas i produce at the moment
13:41 < bridge> <zhn> nothing special actually
13:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see. sounds more like an accounts server, less of a masterserver thing
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For me only because it seems there is no arbitrary protocol name. Either 0.6 or 0.7 xd
13:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can add your custom protocol
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem with arbitrary protocol name is that we cannot verify that you correctly forwarded ports
14:01 < bridge> <zhn> no why
14:01 < bridge> <zhn> master can have another protocol to manage heartbeats
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, it could, but I see little reason to do that
14:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Check the log timestamps I sent. I count 2 per second. And expected like 0 instead. It‚Äôs an empty server what info is even changing?
14:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think my reply broke
14:18 < bridge> <reitw> well afaik it was only used by "tournament" clients
14:19 < bridge> <reitw> but I don't see the point of having owned master servers
14:27 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> please add a function in the editor so that you can quickly hide/unhide layers
14:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> from the logs, it seems each protocol does it every 15 seconds
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems expected, chillerdragon
14:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> there is a little eye icon in the left side of every layer? idk you mean that or something else
14:38 < bridge> <avolicious> For KoG it would be interesting for a service mesh. We would internally send master-server data and the official master servers can pick up this info without actually pinging our servers.
14:38 < bridge> <avolicious> But that would add a lot of complexity for a little to no benefit for the majority üò¶
14:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Like Brokering
14:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does "brokering" mean?
14:40 < bridge> <avolicious> We host a dedicated masterish application on one of our edge-servers so the official master can take this info and populate
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh each protocol. Yea I guess if everything still runs smoothly it‚Äôs fine to do it.
14:40 < bridge> <avolicious> All our servers will report to our internal master server
14:41 < bridge> <zhn> making ddnet an engine for modding but nothing more it
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> Does that even cut down on anything? I guess if your servers already have to report all that info to an internal server
14:41 < bridge> <zhn> i still remember the words about teeworlds being a game in first and not an engine xdddd
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we do that, we can also extend the masterserver to listen for arbitrary protocols, seems like the least of our problems then ^^
14:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> without further context this seems somewhat unneccessary to me, i might not fully understand it tho
14:42 < bridge> <avolicious> We would remove backwards comp for server info. Because HTTPS master sounds like the way to go
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can do that today
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't depend on hosting your own masterserver
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, we don't get the info through the legacy protocol unless you registered through it
14:43 < bridge> <avolicious> But you ping the server to test if its reachable, no?
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we could add a flag to not register your server with the legacy masters if you don't want it
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's unrelated to the legacy serverinfo
14:44 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh gotcha
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. we do, to see that port forwarding is correctly configured
14:44 < bridge> <avolicious> I thought you do some verification too
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we only check whether you can receive UDP packetts
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we only check whether you can receive UDP packets
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by sending a specific one with a token that you then use on your next https register attemtp
14:44 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, we've talked about that in dms already üòÑ
14:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by sending a specific one with a token that you then use on your next https register attempt
14:45 < bridge> <avolicious> Doesnt work that good on stateless firewalls üòÑ
14:45 < bridge> <avolicious> Esp. if we dont know the IP of the master trying to connect to the server
14:46 < bridge> <avolicious> That would be neat if we could do this within our internal master server & then report it back to the official ones
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that would defeat the point. we're trying to check UDP connectivity from the outside
14:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Is there some way to disable this check? Either via flag or special json sent to the master server?
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we could try to connect like a normal teeworlds client, so that your firewall works with it
14:47 < bridge> <avolicious> You can disable manually, but I dont want you to work all day long to bypass the ips üòÑ
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> currently, there's no way except manually
14:48 < bridge> <avolicious> Ok gotcha
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> could be added as an extra https header though
14:48 < bridge> <reitw> in first it was more of an engine than a game afaik from magnus
14:48 < bridge> <reitw> but he decided to switch it to a game & made tw
14:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Would be neat to enable for trusted communities or experienced users, so as an opt-in üòÑ
14:49 < bridge> <reitw> the thing that I still can't believe about it is that tw was in the first place a project presented at Ubisoft
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can see it being useful for firewalls that can't deal with it
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> other than that, I don't see a reason to disable i for "trusted communities" or "experienced users"
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's enabled for ddnet servers (except ger10, chinese servers) as well
14:50 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, I just wanna point out that it should be as an opt-in, not as default
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah yea
14:51 < bridge> <avolicious> Sometimes its useful to troubleshoot networking üôÇ
14:51 < bridge> <reitw> @avolicious unplug cable & issues are fixed
14:51 < bridge> <reitw> no community = nothing to fix :giga_chad:
14:52 < bridge> <avolicious> Hard in google datacenter
14:52 < bridge> <avolicious> I cant find the server in there
14:52 < bridge> <reitw> @avolicious ah, well here they did put some data in the cloud with OVH datacenters
14:52 < bridge> <reitw> ez way
14:52 < bridge> <avolicious> OVH is likely to burn down
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont trust this company anymore
14:53 < bridge> <reitw> lmao well they did change the protection policy again, have to explain them 10 times that it's their fault if players get timed out
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> They changed their ddos notification format recently
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> I thought it is scam
14:54 < bridge> <reitw> yea I saw xD
14:54 < bridge> <reitw> they still didn't change the panel tho, takes still 10 years to load
14:54 < bridge> <avolicious> Yep, payment panel looks like a website from 2000
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> yeah im talking more about teeworlds itself
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> not about some company proposed engine he was making
14:56 < bridge> <reitw> I stay at ovh cuz I don't pay those 10gbps
14:56 < bridge> <reitw> But for all the shits they've done I'd have left since a long time
14:56 < bridge> <avolicious> We have some server there too, because they are cheap in our contracts
14:57 < bridge> <reitw> I still have to see why in some cases xdp works very well on a virtual machine on some providers
14:57 < bridge> <avolicious> Support is crap
14:57 < bridge> <reitw> Like hetzner, we had an attack when we switched temporarily, and cpu was amazingly fine during the attack
14:58 < bridge> <reitw> But on some other hosts it was kinda bad, dunno why, maybe the driver version or virtio
14:58 < bridge> <reitw> But on some other hosts it was kinda bad, dunno why, maybe the driver version of virtio
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> I told hetzner that we host teeworlds servers, its built on top of UDP and we receive a lot spoofed udp traffic.
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> 
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> After the first attack hetzner be like:
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> Your server sent unusual amount of traffic, please answer or your server will get stopped within 72 hours. Please fill out the form below
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> I was like... WTF... I told
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> I was like... WTF... I told you
15:01 < bridge> <reitw> Lmao
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> For some reason hetzner doesnt bother us that much
15:01 < bridge> <avolicious> But better than Vultr, they just shut our servers down & wanted 300 USD for additional outgoing traffic
15:01 < bridge> <reitw> tf
15:02 < bridge> <avolicious> Lucky you
15:02 < bridge> <reitw> prob today, but in the past if you were constantly attacked they'd tell you to go away
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> Your story sounds like the hetzner of the olden days yeah
15:02 < bridge> <avolicious> I still get this emails on a monthly basis
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> I even got one of those 72h notices on my personal server once
15:03 < bridge> <avolicious> I wrote a browser script to autofill the form & submit
15:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
15:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think deen did some stuff to block it
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe deen also gets them and just doesn't tell us anymore üòÑ
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the attacks
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not the mails
15:04 < bridge> <reitw> just to tell, I recently stopped one additional IP & switched to the main IP of the server for tw. I asked them to put the same Anti-DDoS profile on the main IP , and they were like "we noticed that the profile was not the correct one for your situation, we switched to the TEAMSPEAK profile"
15:04 < bridge> <reitw> :KEKSad:
15:04 < bridge> <zhn> xd
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> Our reflection ratios are very good last I checked. So maybe that's why they don't really bother us
15:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> the guy who switched to the teamspeak profile rn::gigachad:
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that's due to some filters that deen put, I think
15:05 < bridge> <avolicious> Damn
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> Ah might be
15:05 < bridge> <avolicious> the two iptable rules, no?
15:05 < bridge> <reitw> aren't you ratelimiting alot to avoid mass reflection?
15:05 < bridge> <avolicious> To rate-limit specific packages
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> something like that
15:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like @avolicious is better informed than I am ^^
15:06 < bridge> <reitw> I think those are detailed in his blog
15:06 < bridge> <reitw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1197180159132962836/image.png?ex=65ba53e8&is=65a7dee8&hm=bd11ff08d929632826b659a534885a36bfd3a94d5874deee9b5d61da7bb398e8&

15:07 < bridge> <avolicious> Check the link
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I think we might have a couple extra nowadays
15:07 < bridge> <reitw> ah well kinda the same
15:08 < bridge> <reitw> u could even switch everything to mangle table to improve performance by little
15:08 < bridge> <reitw> u could even switch everything to mangle table to improve performance by little (even if mangle is not made for filtering)
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> Is that still good practice? I thought it was discouraged for some reason
15:09 < bridge> <reitw> it is discouraged because mangle table's purpose is not for that, but it's still executed before so
15:09 < bridge> <reitw> never had issues
15:09 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> yes, but it‚Äôs not convenient to click on each layer
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> But with no mangling rules, how long does it even take for the packet to pass through? Isn't the prerouting table right before the input table

17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are 2 things which can disable hooking, so its checking for both
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think they're complaining about the `this->`
17:35 < bridge> <teero777> not ddnet-conform xdd
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> seems there are quite a few of them actually

17:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> some of these are mandatory
17:39 < bridge> <teero777> isnt it bad practice to shadow variable names and then do `this->` ?
17:39 < bridge> <teero777> isn't it bad practice to shadow variable names and then do `this->` ?
17:39 < bridge> <teero777> or for what reason are they mandatory?
17:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `this->*` looks like some member pointers
