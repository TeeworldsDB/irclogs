00:01 <+bridge> <WarNer> how do I set the default time in the scoreboard to 0 instead of 00:00? I've set client_score_kind to points instead of tiem but I still get 00:00
00:02 <+bridge> <WarNer> time*
00:04 <+bridge> <WarNer> how do I set the default score in the scoreboard to 0 instead of 00:00? I've set client_score_kind to points instead of tiem but I still get 00:00
00:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's a gameinfoflag for it, I think
00:10 <+bridge> <warner6439> CLIENT_SCORE_KIND_POINTS?
00:25 <+bridge> <warner6439> okay I got it
00:51 <+bridge> <-StormAx> ah wait wha?
01:34 <+bridge> <totar> does anyone understand what the dead reckoning system does?
01:34 <+bridge> <totar> I'm a little bit confused why its there
01:34 <+bridge> <totar> specifically the server side one
11:01 <+bridge> <gerdoe> if you mean character cores reckoningcore is just last state that was sent to players
12:35 <+bridge> <teero777> where are the default key bindings stored?
12:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> in the client
12:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/binds.cpp#L203-L249
12:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/binds.cpp#L462-L495
12:53 <+bridge> <teero777> k another question. in what range is IntraTick in CPlayers::RenderPlayer supposed to be?
13:01 <+bridge> <teero777> im assuming its just between 0.0 and 1.0 since its used for interpolation so the game looks smooth.
13:01 <+bridge> <teero777> ok nvm it is between 0 and 1
13:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U sure?
13:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> There were such vars not in 0..1 bcs of snapshots not arriving every tick
14:25 <+bridge> <vinson7987> hey
14:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hi o/
14:26 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i have a problem
14:26 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how to draw a circle on a pos in game
14:28 <+bridge> <vinson7987> like i want to draw a circle like
14:28 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122865905630728293/image.png
14:28 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so i want to draw a circle on the player's pos
14:28 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so i just use drawcircle(localplayperpos,10,{1,1,1,1})
14:28 <+bridge> <vinson7987> but this doesnt look great
14:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you send a screenshot?
14:41 <+bridge> <vinson7987> wait
14:44 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122870011090968667/image.png

14:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see a circle there at all
14:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> yes
14:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> so this is the problem
14:55 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how
14:55 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122872737812205659/DDNet_Client_2023-06-26_20-53-44.mp4
14:55 <+bridge> <vinson7987> now u can see it
14:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like you have a problem translating coordinates
14:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe check how the laser is rendered
14:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's also a line
15:21 <+bridge> <scar17off> use character renderpos
15:22 <+bridge> <scar17off> and there is a function that can draw circles (drawquad but 64 segments)
15:35 <+bridge> <teero777> i hate intra ticks ðŸ˜­
15:35 <+bridge> <vinson7987> no
15:35 <+bridge> <vinson7987> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122882862056734740/image.png

15:36 <+bridge> <scar17off> use DrawQuads
15:37 <+bridge> <scar17off> and check your newPos before drawing
16:13 <+bridge> <teero777> ......
16:13 <+bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1122892400440909914/image.png
16:13 <+bridge> <teero777> so wtf?
16:13 <+bridge> <teero777> so what boundaries do the intraticks have?
16:14 <+bridge> <teero777> 1.5?
16:16 <+bridge> <teero777> i am so very confused
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think there are no real boundaries. It's basically ticks as decimals since last snapshots
16:16 <+bridge> <teero777> sometimes when i move faster or teleport it goes upto 7??
16:16 <+bridge> <teero777> so how does this even work?
16:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I dunno the idea behind it is weird. But as said snapshots are not sent every tick
16:18 <+bridge> <teero777> i just want to have a tee drawn somewhere and and still have it beeing smooth ike everythng else without updating the code every frame
16:18 <+bridge> <teero777> i just want to have a tee drawn somewhere and and still have it beeing smooth ike everythng else without updating the core every frame
16:19 <+bridge> <patiga> heh my rendering thing has a very similar output, I also want values between 0 and 1 but have some outside that range due to float stuff
16:19 <+bridge> <teero777> i just want to have a tee drawn somewhere and and still have it being smooth like everything else without updating the core every frame
16:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That won't work anyway
16:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Without a prediction tick u can't really say if the tee is about to stop
16:20 <+bridge> <teero777> about to stop? i just need interpolation between the previous pos and the pos right now
16:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> " without updating the core every frame"
16:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> sounds like u want the case where a player might have stopped
16:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar> from the "core" POV
16:28 <+bridge> <learath2> I can check when I get home but iirc we either linterp between pred and current for the intra ticks or we just predict for every intratick and render the predicted core
16:29 <+bridge> <teero777> k
16:30 <+bridge> <learath2> But the main idea is that we do update the position and other state variables every intratick, either by interpolating or by repredicting. If you want smooth movement that is a must
16:35 <+bridge> <calatik_x_cat> hmmmm
16:44 <+bridge> <teero777> btw what does CFlow do?
16:46 <+bridge> <teero777> ah btw i fixed it. i fixed it by just rewriting the RenderPlayer function for my usecase
16:50 <+bridge> <robyt3> Currently nothing because it's disabled in code. It's supposed to by a system for dynamic smoke effects. See https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1117482943829528636

16:51 <+bridge> <teero777> that looks amazing ðŸ¤©
17:06 <+bridge> <botondus> ur mom
18:30 <+bridge> <smetanolub> can you say me best performance settings for linux?
18:31 <+bridge> <smetanolub> i updated client,i had 10000fps, now i have 4600

18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the restart
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where did u got the client from btw?
20:32 <+bridge> <totar> does anyone know any maps with laser weapon tele? I need to test something with it
22:02 <+bridge> <chairn> some segfault are not true segfault
