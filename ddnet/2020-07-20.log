15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> teeworlds is in arctic code vault?
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Every public project on github is
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://archiveprogram.github.com/
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> On February 2, 2020, GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository, to be preserved in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault. This data will be stored on 3,500-foot film reels, provided and encoded by Piql, a Norwegian company that specializes in very-long-term data storage. The film technology relies on silver halides on polyester. This medium has a lifespan of 500 years as measured by the ISO; simulated aging tests indicate Piql‚Äô
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tw is in a foot film reel
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Project Silica from Microsoft Research
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The GitHub Archive Program is partnering with Microsoft‚Äôs Project Silica to ultimately archive all active public repositories for over 10,000 years, by writing them into quartz glass platters using a femtosecond laser.
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon tw into a quartz glass platter
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine someone in 10k years, doing git blame and finding your commit
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > copied refactor to trunk
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> haha heinrich such a meme commit
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> oh btw @Ryozuki such a nice move to add the valgrind thingy :)
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> I assume it reduces the valgrind spam that makes it so annyoing to debug twcode
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law when you are around, can you help me debug the vote not going away for 0.7?
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Sure, I'm up until 18:20
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, I don't really feel like debugging now :/
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can wait another day, or maybe I'll feel more up to it at night
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Yea write me if you need me ^^
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh @Soreu its not exclusivly created by u huh? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v0LOIVywsWQgrl9CHy2RgwsClMlaAVxd/view?usp=sharing do you have authors for it?
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Nope, it's just a giant ass mess from all kinds of databases I found in the past. And since Kingston asked me if I have any graphics, I just packed it all & sent also to You
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti it seems that this discord's whis is indeed not the original whis
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> hmmk @Soreu ill see what i can do with it :) thanks its a good compliation
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice you actually looked into it @heinrich5991?
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the original whis has a teeworlds forum account, so I tried contacting them there
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> yea thought so
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> did he respond?
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> How does a years old teeworlds account make u think that xF
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, otherwise I couldn't know that this discord's whis is the wrong one
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> yea otherwise its the i forgot pw classic
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> cool so the old whis is still alive and responds on froum o.O ? thats impressive
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lol
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=6902
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it lists all these old skins
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 thanks for digging into it ill reward your investigation with the worlds worst writeup ever made that is still listed in a awesome writeup collecection https://blog.shashank.co/2013/12/imgur-xss.html :D
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I wasnt the only one who thought it :feelsbadman:
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it doesn't contain any information
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> yea I also got pranked
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> ikr @heinrich5991 :D its such a prank wrietup
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so this whis is a faker
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> They even have same design skills
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats the catch that the new whis is also a designer
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe he is bipolar
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Im only friends to new Whis
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> xd
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> Also I thought never would anyone fake in tw especially not old inactive player
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> just for a quick troll known current players
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean it's fine to reuse a nick
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> chillerdragon ive seen like 2 diferent people faking u this week on my server
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> 200IQ Move, giving himself an out if he ever wants to "return" after big trolling :troll:
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 he actively tries to fake whis
19:20 <+ChillerDragon> yea well but that doesnt count noby
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he uses the same skin
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but pretending to have created the skins is not fine
19:20 <+ChillerDragon> not using same name
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> heinrich ban him
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/734822088879243314/unknown.png
19:20 <+ChillerDragon> make him admin
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he has this skin cat as profile in discord

19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i guess so
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> should i let them be?
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> thats something different
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> The question is, is the new whis an old Players who was well known in the community or is he a complete stranger
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> I have a fan recently too, it's cool
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> usually id say no faking but if u dont care then ok..

22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ÏàòÍ∑∏Î¶¨Îãà> can it be that swiches dont really work with /r?
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ÏàòÍ∑∏Î¶¨Îãà> they seem to just reset all switches on each /r
