00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut does it support gamepad well?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tried it, not comfortable for me but it works
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you set the direction with the dirpad or is it some sort of mouse emulation?
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mouse emulation, but there is an issue for it iirc
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't sound good IMO
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, but other than that its good, also has calibration etc
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think thats the only thing missing
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the main thing to make it playable at all?
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea true
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> When u setup very high mouse sense and max distance, mouse Emulation is playable. But would love to have it as real input

12:15 <+ChillerDragon> Like how is that a mapres? That is not a quad nor has it tileset resolution?! @Soreu https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1595585670.png
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I feel like I don't want to know xD
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> sorry @Welf for showing 12+ content and ass of womans ^^
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but since many ppl often use whatever should be quad as a tileset...
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and a üêí
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> how does it work if u have a wrong res tileset?
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> is it streched? or cut?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Honestly I no idea, since I never used one with wrong resolution
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> good style
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd guess for stretched
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> yea guess so too. It will haunt me in my dreams
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> ChillerDragon come back to tw when
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> not even joking if u sort two days straight mapres you start dreaming of it
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> when i sorted 1GB of mapres :D
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> i play tw
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> but not ddnet
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: stretched
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-356

12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> > sorry @Welf for showing 12+ content and ass of womans ^^
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> @[quakenet] ChillerDragon#0000 dude it was about her being underage
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> women
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> dont assume age :D and since when are pictures of younger female a problem?
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F_BeKya1LSCA4%2FTGrylZtFIdI%2FAAAAAAAABUI%2FpGEHef8gHzM%2Fs1600%2FIMG_4264.jpg&f=1&nofb=1 pls dont ban me
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> I thought only in sexual context thats problematic
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> > dont assume age üòÑ and since when are pictures of younger female a problem?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> @[quakenet] ChillerDragon#0000 i am pretty sure she was underage back then, i can ask her if you want
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> wait do you know her?
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> is this a tw player? I thought its some random stock photo
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> well then its more a dox than about being underage right?
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Welf also whats the problem about pictures from underaged?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> it attracts pedos lol
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> you know her too xD
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> it's not a dox if she uploaded it
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i heard about pedos in tw recently

13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> only map i could find with this mapres is this one: https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/Project420_8041c8ba.map
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon it's offtopic to begin with
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Second, it makes people do double takes on my screen while passing behind me
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> Since we have these kind of messages, i think we should add special ones on novice servers/ on the perma novice servers. like "write <kill> in f1 to respawn" or "write bind k kill" to respawn when you press k
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/736206337662517261/screenshot_2020-07-24_14-59-06.png
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> okay I removed the image you all happy now? :D
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> @Welf im still interested what your problem with it is and who that is
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 how are teeworlds mapres offtopic?
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> this image is not attracting pedos lol its just a grill in water nothing special
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> typical pedo videos are e.g. families (with children) on the beach. i hope that helps. i would not like to spread the information about who she is.
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> Ok yea seems like im not well informed in the pedo buisness but i believe u and deleted it. You peeked my interest now if you say I know her oO could you tell me a name in private?
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> @Welf ^

15:26 <+ChillerDragon> its vanilla without anticheat plugins
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> just regular cheats like xray flyhack and the glitches like dupes etc
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> flyhack sux
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> its not bad actually just a few kicks but yea vanilla anti cheat is very bad
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> its worse than @onbgys anti bot it also kicks vanilla clients and hackers still have a lot of freedom
