10:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Morning üçµ
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `any(license` is always true
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the if looks bad anyway, it should be something like `re_match.group("license") in licenses`
13:01 < bridge> <murpi> ```py
13:01 < bridge> <murpi> import re
13:01 < bridge> <murpi> 
13:01 < bridge> <murpi> def abc(string) -> bool:
13:01 < bridge> <murpi>     regex = re.compile(r'^\((?P<license>.{3,8})\)$')
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     re_match = regex.match(string)
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     licenses = ["CC0", "CC BY", "CC BY-SA"]
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     if re_match.group('license'):
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>         if not any(license in re_match.group('license') for license in licenses):
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>             return False
13:02 < bridge> <murpi>     return True
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> 
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> result = abc("(CC SA-BY)")
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> print(result)
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> ```
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> 
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> Result is False
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> if I use CC BY-SA
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> result is True
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> and if I use CC BY SA
13:02 < bridge> <murpi> it also returns True
13:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool üôÇ
13:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's only implemented on the client side, and for third-party servers
13:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> black
13:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> all inside the training data
13:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we should simply fix our skins
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you want `re_match.group("license") in licenses`
13:29 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, that's what im using now. üòÑ
13:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> your check also allows ABCC0DEF
13:35 < bridge> <murpi> any() seems to turn hyphens into spaces or something
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `any` is a function that turns a list of booleans into a boolean
13:36 < bridge> <murpi> I can't think of any other reason why this would be True
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you check whether `CC0`, `CC BY` or `CC BY-SA` appear in your license string
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this meands `ABCC0DEF` will also be accepted by the check
13:37 < bridge> <murpi> Why is CC BY SA True?
13:37 < bridge> <murpi> Ah
13:37 < bridge> <murpi> I see, nevermind xD
13:39 < bridge> <murpi> Adding those licenses into the regex itself would've been an alternative so it doesn't match substrings
13:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do we have a friend only mode or something like that in ddnet right now
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like you can only see names / clans in your friend list
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently people are now changing their names to banned names and doing stream sniping to trigger auto bans chinese streamers
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently people are now changing their names to banned names and doing stream sniping to trigger auto bans for chinese streamers
13:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :monkaStop:
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like in which you can only see names / clans in your friend list
13:48 < bridge> <sedonya> @robyt3 Infinite afk mode
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It was fixed weeks ago. But in some countries they still get the broken one
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't understand how this is related to friendlist. Are the streamers changing the name or what xd
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> other peoples changing names and joining the same server
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cl_nameplate 0 probably can avoid this but maybe a friend only mode can let them still see friend's name and chat
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah they change name to disallowed words?
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now i get it xd
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But i guess we don't directly have this. /Dnd is the cost
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Closest
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But whisper might still work
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently major streaming platform here in china are doing OCR occationally just to auto bans
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> dnd still shows names i think?
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they'd probably need to turn off both chat and nameplates to be safe which might be quite alone lol.
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i might PR on holiday i guess
14:35 < bridge> <learath2> If a skin ends up in there that isn't correct the results seem to be far more catastrophic than intended
14:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like we wouldn't notice it otherwise
14:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's intended to be somewhat obvious so that instances of it will be reported
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> We can't even fix it in a reasonable amount of time due to how aggressive cloudflare caches them
14:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can probably empty cloudflare caches. it'd be nice to add a check to the process of adding skins to the db
14:38 < bridge> <learath2> It locks all input killing runs, somewhat obvious is probably desirable, killing runs is not. I think it does more harm than good, we can just make sure there is only one way to add a skin and it's checked
14:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be better to make it dismissable with tab instead of locking input
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So or so.would be nice if smbdy with cloudflare access can check
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> emptying cloudflare caches?
14:47 < bridge> <sedonya> Maybe you could help?
14:47 < bridge> <sedonya> @jupeyy_keks
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think u also need to change info. Ddnet for that to work. It gets the version number from there
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I purged skins.ddnet.tw and skins.ddnet.org
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except you coded that out already. I didn't follow your development
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok nice
15:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Then something with your download didn't work
15:37 < bridge> <sedonya> Okay, I'll take a look later
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is furo on discord the furo on github?
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we gained quite an active contributor recently üôÇ
16:56 < bridge> <nouaa> @furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there goes my plan not to ping random people üòÑ
16:59 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> Ah, no worries. Yeah, it's me.
17:03 < bridge> <nouaa> Just investigate I guess üòÑ
17:03 < bridge> <nouaa> (Don't worry i turned off the ping)
17:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah nice üôÇ
20:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i keep getting ads for log2base2
20:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is it any good
20:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you should install an ad blocker ^^
20:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why did 17.3 break so much
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the real question is:
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is everyone allowed to break ddnet except me
20:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> incredible
20:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> mobile plus im lazy
20:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like i **have** newpipe but the subscription transfer is so complex
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> What broke?
21:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> My hack to show a predicted hook attached to a tee without showing the tee, i didnt investigate, idk why yet.
21:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> also rainbowname has gotten way more un-nice, lets say it like that
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think hook was touched in 17.3 so maybe an accidental breakage
21:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i couldnt spot anything suspicous on the first looks through the affected files
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> The other one I don't even consider breakage, it's just a change
21:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (most like affected)
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> I'd just git bisect if I were you
21:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea probably
21:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> oh, and also the new order in teams makes my spec menu page selector in the wrong order
21:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz yellow is now after red and blue (for my flag spectaing)
21:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> spectating*
21:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> anyways
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> Though I don't consider it breakage, there is something to be said about whether or not it's the best solution to the problem
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe drawing a border around teams would be better
21:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ik
21:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the hook bug annoys me tho
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> Hook one sounds like unintentional breakage so if you find it let us know
21:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i mean you could make it another color right
21:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
21:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> search one for me, please
21:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> im color blind
21:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> really
21:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
21:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> how did i never know that lol
21:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> maybe you're aswell
21:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> nah i see them all fine
21:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> then you would've known it
21:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> in a perfect world you can set your own team color
21:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> in a perfect world ddnet is an own game, not a mod of teeworlds
21:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> possibilities
21:09 < bridge> <learath2> If this ever becomes a thing we definitely need borders around teams
21:10 < bridge> <cyberFighter> in a perfect world you actually worked on your server
21:10 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
21:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> true
21:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> in a perfect world i had time for that
21:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if i knew anything about low level coding id want to make ddrace 2.0
21:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do it
21:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok but   where do i start
21:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> define ddrace 2.0
21:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what is it
21:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't usually consider hacks to be part of backward compatibility promises
21:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think the better solution is to make them non-hacks
21:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> current ddnet version but built from the ground up and optimized accordingly
21:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> urfunny
21:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you waited
21:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
21:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i mean heinrich
21:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> I'm mostly curious because something else might have been broken, not to necessarily restore the behaviour
21:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yay modding ddnet is so fun
21:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> protocol changes every week and breaking things which have been there since forever and also work on 0.7
21:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
21:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> afk
21:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I want a rust with a stable ABI
21:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that I can have dynamic libraries
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best part of rust would be destroyed
21:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is the best part "not being able to do shared libraries with rust interfaces"?
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best part is not sharing anything
21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust can use shared libraries with C interfaces and can expose them, too, todaz
21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust can use shared libraries with C interfaces and can expose them, too, today
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, bloat from the 1990 üòÇ
21:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> part of why rust is successful, probably
21:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it can interact with the rest of the world
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but imagine we'd have all knowledge from today and hardware from today
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but no software
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what would we do?
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd think shared libraries are still the way to go
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> especially for stuff like TLS libraries
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true, i was 15 years in future
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let me ask again in 15 years
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that they can change without hte underlying program changing
