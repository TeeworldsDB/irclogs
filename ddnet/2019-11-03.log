14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> hey i have an issue with lags, that are probably caused by the ddos protection
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> i already explained them here: (https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/611160075201151004)
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> today they are back, after some testing:
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> - they are only presend on DDNet Ger servers (neither non-ddnet nor other regions)
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> - on the `Prediction Margin` graph (with the keybindings ctrl-shift-d + ctrl-shift-g) the graph will freeze whenever i have lags, while the `Gametime Margin` continues. the gametime margin will freeze however, if i kill my internet manually.

14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> - the `Prediction Margin` spikes after big lags/resets
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga I doubt it's because of the ddos protection as we really don't have filters that would drop actual teeworlds traffic, the hoster might add them, but in that case everyone else should feel them ðŸ¤”
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> true
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> tho i dont really know where to point to next
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> lets blame telecom and wait till the problem fixes itself after some time again?
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> or do you have another idea about what could be blamed?
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really familiar with those graphs, maybe we could find out what they really quantify and work from there?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> I noticed the same type of lag on GER servers
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> I think that when the graph freezes it means packet loss, while spikes/red color either means jitter/delayed packets or prediction time reset
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Do you happen to know how many bytes will the token take in SERVERINFO_EXTENDED?
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen could you fix the uninitialized variable we have in the server aswell in #1956?
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the members of `CPlayer::m_Latency`
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 m_Latency is a struct, so it is default-initialized
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Info is the one that's not initialized properly apparently
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> done
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Is there a way to kill a player when enter arena if its not official client ? something other than version control
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u just said makes no sense to me
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @mohsen7s no included feature for that, you'd have to write it yourself
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm getting some ridiculous lags on GER :/
20:56 <@deen> same
20:56 <@deen> packet loss, probably because of the ddos protection
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: do you have a moment to show me how to set up servers?
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also do we maybe have a sequence number in our packets so we can measure packet loss?
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> dunno, but the missing packets are very obvious in ctrl-shift-d ctrl-shift-g
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sure, what do you need help with?
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ?
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I couldn't get the server... card blocked ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it'll have to wait until tomorrow
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> let me guess, ovh?
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hetzner
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's the banks fault
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> their fraud detection seems waaay too sensitive
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I keep getting weird invoices from the russian hoster btw, but without any request to pay something
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not sure if they're trying to rip me off or doing some tax scam
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, probably some money laundring stuff ðŸ˜›
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> hetzner will be another ger2, right?
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> last time I got it I was busy so I couldn't watch how it behaved
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> do they have some special firewall what's the plan?
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> hetzner.de is down for me btw, might be a bad sign ðŸ˜„
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I was hoping a 1gbit link would help
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone else seems to be able to play, but I get a metric shit ton of packet loss ðŸ˜¦
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen here?
