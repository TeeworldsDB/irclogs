12:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That should work fine @Arseniy Zarche , but recently we have problems with DDNet 11 on old gpus
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So your friend might want to try DDNet 10 as well
12:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Basically any computer in the last 10-15 years should work fine
12:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> deen, i have issues with these updates sinse 11. I have now less fps than ever. like i had 200-300 fps with entities and now i have less than 100 fps. 4 core 1.6 ghz
12:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (all core activated btw)
12:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Cellegen can you also not turn off VSync?
12:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> without vsync btw
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and you are 100% sure it's off?
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> all settings used for higher fps
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> y
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what config do you use?
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you post it
12:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> w8
12:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail @ᶰ°Konͧsti wants his map fixed. what are the things that have to be done?
12:57 <@deen> Cellegen: You might have the same issue: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=6409 No solution so far unfortunately

12:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> shit then xd
12:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen 
12:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `

12:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is the SDL code, if something else than `_this->GL_SetSwapInterval(_this, interval);` is called, then it's SDL magic
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it can turbo boost
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so sinse when OpenGL support came,
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> huh
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has nothing todo wiht it xd
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> shit then when i could download the lasest version which has no OpenGL support? ;O
12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well there were other changes made
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cool
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> opengl 3.3 is just a new version
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should it decrease performance if you let it disabled
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the vsync bug in forum, ok.
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who knows maybe i dont have opengl 3.0 support on my pc
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you even have
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> your CPU is new enough
13:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you download the latest driver from intel it should work
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats why i surprise
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> d
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ok i could try
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that doesn't solve your entity issue
13:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are you sure you aren't on a map with lot of teleporters or speedups where it happens?
13:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im sure, i tried on Silex maps, and my maps too
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> silex maps shouldn't be laggy :/
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you test it on a map without speedups, ninja and turn of cl_entities_text
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you test it on a map without speedups, ninja and turn off cl_entities_text
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> after i instal some driver stuff
13:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_refresh_rate to zero?
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but normally entities should be faster except the overlay text
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> will try
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991 idk, if he has a fix that doesnt affect the gameplay we can do that
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail it does affect game play
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in what way
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a way that apparently fixes a cheat. @ᶰ°Konͧsti care to specify more?
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Jupstar ✪ lol i downloaded an intel support assistent program cuz i have no idea what driver should work for it xD
13:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> looks like i have the latest version of my driver
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 @snail it doesnt affect the gameplay because you will have enough speed to cross the kills if u played legit but not if u want to cheat with a rocket
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti obviously it affects game play if some finishes are not possible anymore
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or do we have a different definition of "gameplay"?
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol why should some finishes not be possible anymore?
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> plss dont change rocket again
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xD
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there is a finish you wanted to remove after the fix. that finish wouldn't be possible anymore
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as far as I understood it
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol what no
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ask @snail when the map was released it was finishable in 10 seconds
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and his french friends abused this cheat and waited for a legit 6 minute time
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. so the fix changed gameplay. but it was OK, because the map was so badly broken before
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but this fix also changes gameplay if I understand it correctly
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but the ranks made by this cheat werent fully deleted
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no it does not :D
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I don't have to delete ranks after applying the fix?
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> the rank from lola is done with the cheat i fixed now
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> so it need to be deleted
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. so that particular run from lola cannot be done anymore
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> → it changes gameplay
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have a different definition of gameplay?
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd ye
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ok yes it change the gameplay in this case
13:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but since is a fullcut it should be fixed and the rank deleted
13:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> OK
13:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail  read that? ^
13:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cheats != intended gameplay :ww:
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Jupstar ✪ welp on Kobra 4 basic map shows 220 fps - on my map Dynasty shows 240 fps - on another maps shows 260 fps with cl_refresh_rate 0
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then the grenade fix also doesn't change gameplay because it wasn't intended, @jao? ^^
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Cellegen and is that good or bad? XD
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> different thing
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> kinda good but it doesnt reaches 300 fps somehow. but the lower versions did
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i wanna test lower version if its possible.
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> will i get my fix now? :feelsbadman:
13:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [1:24 PM] heinrich5991: snail read that? ^
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> hes offline and lol what should he say
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> my fix only affect that one rank1 nothing else xd
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he responded before
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I don't even know how to replace maps, I kinda need him
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xD
13:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> deen amazing knowledge too :danAmazing:
14:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti what?
14:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen heinrich needs help to upload my fix of my map xd
14:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> deeeeeen any links for downloading lower versions of ddnet? ,;cc
14:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
14:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> scp map ddnet.tw:servers/maps; ssh ddnet.tw servers/git-update-files-only.sh
14:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thx
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991  well are we 100% sure adding a kill wont ruin some legit runs?
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it kinda is a buggy "feature"
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is?
15:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> @Cellegen are you done ur problem?
15:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye,
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991 falling through the kill with speed
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh. is the kill tile placed somewhere where regular runs also go through?
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you could be unlucky to hit it even if you're fast (if the movement isn't synchronized for all players)
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti ^
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> the kills are placed so that u wont hit them
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> u talk about a specific map?
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 if u play normal u wont go there
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and u allways have the same speed at finish fall
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its 100%
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ( @Im 'corneum  )
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'll fetch the map_diff script from somewhere
15:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :ww:
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> my fix is the best way to fix without any big change and its not affecting gameplay except for the cheated rank1
15:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but its using a glitch
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> which by definition might not be consistent
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> this glitch is a part of ddrace
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> shotgun/spec bug is also used in some maps
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you don't get guaranteed death tile skip at certain speeds
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and even more, I don't like adding glitch use to maps)
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't this be fixed without glitches?
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol what
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ofc i can guarantee that
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the players are perfectly synchronized at that point?
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i have made a map where u skip 400 death tiles on 600 tiles height
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u allways have the same speed on the same position
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could we still fix it without using glitches please?
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it wouldnt work with crossing the stopper otherwise also
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its using a glitch already
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to add more
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> every other solution breaks speedruns
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's maybe not fix this in that case? "part of the map"?
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its a fullcut
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and i want it fixed
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i dont see the problem
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to add more glitch use to maps
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's my problem
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> there are a lot of maps which use glitches
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is that ddnet's opinion too?
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> just see it as a feature not as a bug
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know, it should be IMO
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> glitches are just bound to fail at some point
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i have maps in my editor which are still in progress, they all use skipping kils instead uf using stoppers
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well we made a tourney that relies on glitches/bugs.. soooo
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> thats a cool way to make people play a lot of parts just to be able to cross it
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I know nearly everything about physic glitches and i can promise you that they arent "buggy"
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it works 100%
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is this the thread where konsti is trying to cheat
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's bound to break eventually if someone touches some part of the code
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby no
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or even just compiles with different compiler options
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or even just compiles with a different compiler verison
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or even just compiles with a different compiler version
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 u cant touch the code in this case because this bug was abused hundreds of time, so it would break dozens of maps
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but I don't want to add more maps to the problem
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmfao
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> this isnt a problem
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its a feature
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> mappers can do really cool shit with it
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it is – what happens if you can't compile ddnet to work with your maps anymore?
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because in the future they apply different floating point optimizations
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> maybe you should play brainduck, it uses dozens of glitches and physic bugs
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they = compiler vendors
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> you cant change floating point shit, it would change your movement
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> in swings for example
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compiler vendors are the problem, not me
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol you would have to fix this then to make physics work like before anyways
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> so my map isnt the problem
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's part of the problem. I won't add more glitches to existing maps, sorry
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> maybe that decision shouldnt be related to you
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and more to testers
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, maybe
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about glitches in new maps
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not allowed?
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd suggest them to not release maps relying on glitches either
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> k
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ok delete brainduck, justice 1+2, delirious and all topranks of maps
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they are a problem. I haven't said that I will delete problems, I said I won't add new problems
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and lol a lot of olschoolmaps too xD
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u dont add new problems
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I do
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no?XD
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u cant "fix" the maps anyways
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> more maps to be fixed/special-cased/whatever in case anyone wnats to fix that bug at some point
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u need to keep the code like it is
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> LMFAO u cant fix all the maps
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because there are too many? see, that's why I don't want to make the problem bigger
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> omg
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u dont make it bigger
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> because its a no go to change the physics
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u cant say what maps are related to glitches
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> a lot of maps are
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nobody knows how much
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> so u cant change the physcis
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in case anyone ever wants to touch that piece of code, we now can generate a nice idea of which maps rely on what and which don't
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> even 1000 new maps with glitches dont make the problem bigger
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we now have all the movements of all players
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no u cant
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao u dont
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can check whether they use a bug
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, we do?
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u have movements of the last half year
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ddnet exists 4 years omg
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and i could say u 50 maps without thinking
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but there are hundreds
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see, and we could check which have it by replaying the runs
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol no
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> how would u replay a four years old run without having its movement?XD
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and lol
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> every player would 
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> tar and feather you for *again* touching the physics
16:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> did u see how many problems uve got with only fixing the grenade bug? And this is hopefully not related to hundred of maps.
16:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But what we are talking about now is
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because 100 of maps rely on going through kill tiles
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i dont talk about the killtile thing now
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> he was talking about floating points
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and that would affect every map
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> because it changes your movement
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> how you swing for example
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so suppose someone wants to fix the kill tile bug at some point
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your map would be an additional problem
16:11 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> are you guys imposing a speed limit to catch glitching?
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> you cant fix the killtile bug anywyys
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, the problem is that we inherited ugly code that doesn't check for collision with custom tiles
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> when will u understand that
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, the problem is that we inherited ugly code that doesn't check for collision with custom tiles correctly
16:12 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> oh. ow
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and this means you can skip through some custom tiles at certain speeds
16:12 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> mm
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because there's not a single tick when you actually touch the tile
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> collision tiles are not affected by this because they use different, and correct, code
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise this would be a real disaster
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> xd
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nemo: and fixing bugs like this is pretty hard because people are bound to have created maps that rely on certain bugs
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its not pretty hard
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its nonsense
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> or better call it bullshit
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 HELP BIG BUG PLS FIX
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/435445319191232512/screenshot_2018-04-16_16-21-23.png
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it wont affect gameplay!
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> we can fix all maps!
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: make a new versino of the tile that is not buggy
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: deprecate the old one?
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: replace all official map tiles w/ new version?
16:25 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> then laugh when people try to exploit the new tiles.
16:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> evil
16:29 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> the reason I perked up glitching tho, was that it used to be that using a portal gun loop + invulnerability or just flying really really high in saucer you could go fast enough to punch through part of our game map
16:29 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> it was kinda funny
16:30 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I ended up imposing a "terminal velocity" of 2 pixels per millisecond.
16:30 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> let's call it "air resistance" instead of "Hedgewars fails at collision checks" 😉
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have 6000 units per game tick
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> game tick is 1/50s
16:30 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> we have a long standing bug of reducing our tick granularity some, it's a waste for most gears
16:30 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> the only one that currently has anything like that is rope
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and we pissed off a ton of people changing that at first
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> even there our granularity is ridiculously high... 1/125
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, the "rope" is a main gameplay element in teeworlds. and then it's not round-based ^^
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> sure.
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> rope people are super sensitive to changes in rope feel
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> took a while for them to forgive us, and some minor tweaking
16:32 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but yeah. ddnet pretty much requires rope
16:32 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> for everything
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen ^^
16:32 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: BTW. I think I challenged you to this one long ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxE7ZNJEfFc  - I ran into this video the other day. someone who actually finished it.
16:33 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I've yet to manage that
16:33 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: if I even manage to get to the challenge jumps, I usually drown due to the water rise failing the jump over and over
16:34 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but being total fail at roping has not discouraged me from screwing w/ it 😃
16:34 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: and... the main reason our granularity is so insanely high is not the round based thing, it is the pixel based thing
16:35 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that and meh homebrew physics 😝
16:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the video looks like the prediction is off
16:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like the hook doesn't look like it would hit and then it suddenly attaches
16:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Lol i wanted to download hedgewars
16:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But arch Linux sucks :feelsbadman:
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im lazy
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hm
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> we have a couple of arch people hanging out in the channel
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I'm gonna pacman it
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> not aware of any (current) problems with the package
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> K got it
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> last screwup that resulted in like a dozen emails from arch users was arch bumping physfs and not bumping hedgewars - and relying on physfs promise of ABI compatibility (hah)
16:46 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> eventually found a struct with a field change 😝
16:46 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> frustrating part was arguing w/ arch about "plz just rebuild the Hedgewars package thx"
16:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a link to mailing list?
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> mailing list?
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> oh. the emails
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heh. we have this feedback page inside the app
16:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the thread about rebuilding in arch I ment
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ahhh
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> lemme see!
16:47 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> it was on IRC but also in bug report
16:48 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> might be some stuff in the bug report
16:48 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and I know I emailed the arch users the bug
16:48 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> we never have had this kind of prob w/ debian/ubuntu/gentoo 😝
16:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, they simply don't update the libraries 😉
16:48 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> well. it helps that debian I think has more rigorous testing and also, well, their dev idles on our channel
16:49 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> s/dev/maintainer/
16:50 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: https://issues.hedgewars.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511
16:51 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heinrich5991: in the end it was fixed just 'cause we did a new release
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😦
16:51 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> was basically broken for 2 months
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Tuesday, 17 October 2017, 20:13 GMT
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> So, obviously, what I propose is to re-build hedgewars. Maybe other physfs-dependent packages, too (this I don't know).
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Comment by Matthias Blaicher (mabl) - Thursday, 07 December 2017, 14:55 GMT
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Since this bug is fixed by a rebuild and there has been a new version of hedgewars since mid-november, I'd propose to just update the package and everything will be fine 😃
16:52 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> us constantly telling users "downgrade physfs or rebuild hedgewars"
16:52 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> (or do your own build)
16:52 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ah well whatever
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and arch linux maintainers being stubborn :/
16:52 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hehe
16:52 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> we were joking about adding an autoreply script
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol this hedgewars game sucks
17:09 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> *sniff*
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it requires accounts and accounts are bad
17:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> doesn't require accounts
17:36 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> account is only if you want your stats on server, want to reserve a username, or want to rejoin a game on disconnect
17:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> or join a server which only allows registered users aka all
17:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> anyways even the option of having accounts is bad
17:41 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hm?
17:41 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> hardly anyone requires registration
17:41 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but some people do enable that if they are being harassed
17:42 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> also you might have a confusion here between "server" and "room"
17:42 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> at the server level there's basically 0 servers besides the official one that support registration
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> anyway. gonna bet most people disagree w/ you on the fundamental point - esp the ones who chat routinely on the server
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> kinda like on freenode, people like to know who they are talking to
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that's basically the main reason for it. that and spam/abuse
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> the forums are never going to support unregistered 'cause we would not be able to handle the moderation load
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> feel free to start an anonymous message board of your own and announce it on the site if you want that
17:51 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> the one I do regret ever allowing was the repeated request for password protected rooms
17:51 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I'd swear people turn that on just for the hell of it now then wonder why no one joins
17:51 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> think it was really poisonous to server activity
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Mitchell> why is ppl talking to bots
18:17 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> bridging I guess
18:17 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I'm on freenode personally
18:17 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> at least - I'm guessing that's what you're talking about
19:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/j62abm
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u do masterserver bans?
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Teeworlds>hedgewars
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I can do these
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at the image ^^
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki may I share that image furtherly? does it disappear?
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think it disappears
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I forwarded it to teecloud.de, since they seem to be hosting these kinds of servers
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki if they don't answer in a couple of days, I'll ban the IPs
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
