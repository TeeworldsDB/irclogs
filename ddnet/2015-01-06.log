03:14 < Maple> laxa get ready to upload shit load of demos
03:14 < Maple> and deen i sent a demo that proves my innocence , hoping that i can get my team time back on Epix
10:59 < eeeee> when i also kill the collision for all those extra layers (which seems not being used in client) it still seems to work fine and in-client reported mem usage is like 9mb
10:59 < eeeee> overall mem usage is a bit higher though (fragmentation and shit)

16:29 < laxadedi> I dunno what could be the issue

18:43 < maple> deen i posted a new infectZ map
19:04 < coffee> I like your work "maple", but in my opinion, it doesn't fit with the infectZ purpose
19:04 < coffee> It makes sense for classic CTF mode
19:04 < coffee> But why not , anyway, deen is the main decider after all
20:32 <@deen> no
20:32 <@deen> testers decide
20:32 <@deen> and you because it's your mod
20:51 < coffee> a mod for another mod
20:54 < maple> its fairly hard to test without a bunch of zombies
20:54 < maple> thats what im curious to see
20:59 < coffee> It's important to make maps which work for small number of players
21:18 < Maple> what we are saying
21:19 < Maple> is give "my map" a chance
21:46 < coffee> ^
21:46 < coffee> Maple : you are the same Maple as before :p
21:46 < Maple> mhm
21:48 < coffee> You told me the same words for blockZ :D
22:05 < Maple> never gonna give you up
22:23 < coffee> <3
