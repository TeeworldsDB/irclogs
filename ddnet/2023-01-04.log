14:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> does this change physics tho
14:45 <+bridge> <nekorul> @Jupeyy_Keks my gpu 0 is nvidia geforce gtx 1650, gpu 1 is integrated amd ryzen 5 4600H and i cant even get 200fps
14:45 <+bridge> <nekorul> i saw your post and if theres anything i can help with, id like to help.
14:45 <+bridge> <nekorul> all i want is for my problem to be solved.
14:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My post is specifically to make sure that the default gpu that is selected under Windows will be used in Vulkan too. So i need a way to be sure i can detect that. The easiest and probably working solution is simply that Windows changes the order the gpus are listed in the client
14:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u want to check that too, go into the client and select Vulkan. Then restart and see if there is a graphics cards setting now in the graphics settings. If so both of your gpus can be used to render the game. Your integrated card will probably be faster if the discrete gpu has no direct hardware connection to ur display

15:41 <+bridge> <nekorul> btw lower fps with integrated card
15:42 <+bridge> <nekorul> btw lower fps with integrated card but better quailty
15:46 <+bridge> <nekorul> did smth and now higher fps w integrated card
15:49 <+bridge> <nekorul> did smth and now higher fps w integrated card thx
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can u also try to set default gpu in Windows settings or Nvidia control panel to the amd one to check if the order of both gpus changes? U can revert the change afterwards again

18:01 <+bridge> <KOF> Hi.
18:01 <+bridge> <KOF> 
18:01 <+bridge> <KOF> On KoG we have moving tiles but we don't have moving tiles prediction on ddnet client, so playing with high ping is painful. Is it possible to add such a feature or we should create KoG client for that? :feelsbadman:
18:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> best is you create an github issue for that
19:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im against addinct prediction to support closed source servers

20:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> look in scoreboard and nameplates and change them xd
20:47 <+bridge> <Mahdiyar> ok
20:51 <+bridge> <Mahdiyar> where is line code?
20:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CTRL+F
20:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i search it or u
20:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is the difference lol
22:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> any idea of how i can resolve those?
22:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/3841720848/jobs/6542261625>
22:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> i don't get how it sees a potential leak...
23:00 <+bridge> <deen> The logic of this check is a bit simple, it assumes some conditions for branches which can be impossible
23:00 <+bridge> <deen> if that's the case add `// NOLINT(clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc)` on the line
23:00 <+bridge> <deen> (where the error is triggered)
