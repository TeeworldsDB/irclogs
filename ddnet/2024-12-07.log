00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see, ig i wont understand it without seeing the task xd
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's 00:00:30
00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you lost
00:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I absolutely lost
00:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I rewrote the function to be much cleaner and simpler, got rid of a few extra steps, writing something that could almost be considered not jank...
00:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and it's a solid 1-2% slower
00:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love immutability
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> @totar type `kill lag` in console
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> to kill lag
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> same with `minimize lag`
01:09 < bridge> <totar> yeah but people use kill normally
01:10 < bridge> <totar> in that way
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> most plp have a bind to kill
01:10 < bridge> <totar> I find it useful to have it available
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> well u can always
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> allow_dangerous_commands
01:10 < bridge> <totar> I thought that doesnt save
01:10 < bridge> <totar> also
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt on purpose
01:10 < bridge> <totar> I don't want to enable unbindall
01:11 < bridge> <totar> unbindall is like an order of magnitude worse than those other ones
01:11 < bridge> <totar> so I'd rather just never enable it
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> thats would be deleting unbindall
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> which i dont want
01:11 < bridge> <totar> no
01:11 < bridge> <totar> I just don't want to need to enable it to use those other commands
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> oh oke
01:12 < bridge> <totar> minimize also does nothing?
01:12 < bridge> <totar> just open it
01:12 < bridge> <totar> you're already in f1
01:12 < bridge> <totar> you weren't playing
01:12 < bridge> <Solly> thats fair
01:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> holy hell HOW am I this DAFT
01:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> `fmap` and `(.)` are the SAME THING
01:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> new revelations every day
01:12 < bridge> <totar> the real issue here is allowing this at all
01:13 < bridge> <totar> kill should enforce a single parameter
01:13 < bridge> <Solly> ig so
01:15 < bridge> <totar> ```cpp
01:15 < bridge> <totar> void CGameClient::ConKill(IConsole::IResult *pResult, void *pUserData)
01:15 < bridge> <totar> {
01:15 < bridge> <totar>     if(pResult->NumArguments() == 0)
01:15 < bridge> <totar>         ((CGameClient *)pUserData)->SendKill(-1);
01:15 < bridge> <totar> }
01:15 < bridge> <totar> ```
01:15 < bridge> <totar> 
01:15 < bridge> <totar> I think this works
01:15 < bridge> <Solly> shouldnt it be forced at the parser elvel
01:15 < bridge> <Solly> shouldnt it be forced at the parser level
01:16 < bridge> <totar> that could break some incorrect binds or configs that people use
01:17 < bridge> <Solly> ):
01:18 < bridge> <totar> I'm still not really a bad of grouping the slightly harmful commands with unbindall
01:18 < bridge> <totar> I'm still not really a fad of grouping the slightly harmful commands with unbindall
01:19 < bridge> <totar> you can always tell them you press alt+f4 to gain points
01:19 < bridge> <Solly> unbind alt+f4
01:19 < bridge> <teero777> type `quit gambling` to convert all your luck into skill
01:19 < bridge> <totar> ??
01:19 < bridge> <totar> alt f4 is good
01:20 < bridge> <totar> that's the only way I close the client xd
01:20 < bridge> <Solly> uhmm actually i use win+f4
01:22 < bridge> <totar> I'm still not really a fan of grouping the slightly harmful commands with unbindall
01:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's the keybind to open the secret dev console where you can get super no matter whose server you're on
02:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> norming
03:34 < bridge> <totar> @jupeyy_keks I updated my graphics drivers and vulkan is slower than opengl now, it runs at 600fps
03:35 < bridge> <totar> I haven't changed anything about my installation
03:37 < bridge> <totar> it also has really noticeable stutters

06:17 < bridge> <totar> @tsfreddie the behavior in your video on github doesn't seem to have anything to do with the sequence of things you do before it? If I have a 300ms connection on steam ddnet and do /spec it will cause a pop-in every single time.
06:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably
06:18 < bridge> <totar> either way I can't really be bothered to figure that out so I'm just going to rename the flag
06:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the sequence it's just me doing mental gymnastics trying to find something. but renaming the flag and make sure it represents the input type does bare us from playing mental chess just to figure out what the code does
06:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>

06:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the sequence it's just me doing mental gymnastics trying to find something. but renaming the flag and making sure it represents the input type does bare us from playing mental chess just to figure out what the code does
06:33 < bridge> <totar> ok I figured it out, it was completely unrelated to anything, apparently the purpose of PLAYERFLAG_PLAYING was actually to clear the playerflags between ticks because it was never doing that anywhere else.
06:33 < bridge> <totar> @tsfreddie can you test it again after the artifact builds
06:35 < bridge> <totar> I can't get it to do the popping anymore
06:35 < bridge> <totar> so I think it's fixed
06:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @totar maybe use a latency faker, it is more reproducable under higher ping
06:55 < bridge> <totar> I am
06:55 < bridge> <totar> It's at 900ms
06:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the easiest reproducable step is to just press pause bind and enter chat really quickly
06:56 < bridge> <totar> did you run the server and the client?
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
06:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just built your pr here, it's the same server and client version
06:58 < bridge> <totar> but I did the exact same thing as your video
06:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1314833615137280000/2024-12-07_13-58-00.mp4?ex=675535ba&is=6753e43a&hm=af10af74cd6036e3a63cc9b3aeac345391bdc6e9c4d9ce00b0274ca79cd1111d&
06:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> here's me checking commit version, building your code and run it
06:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm using clumsy btw
07:00 < bridge> <totar> the thing you did the video is patched tho right?
07:00 < bridge> <totar> the thing you did in thevideo is patched tho right?
07:00 < bridge> <totar> the thing you did in the video is patched tho right?
07:00 < bridge> <totar> I can test this seperately
07:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i posted two new videos on github
07:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> those are still do able
07:01 < bridge> <totar> the first video
07:01 < bridge> <totar> from an hour agoi
07:01 < bridge> <totar> from an hour ago
07:01 < bridge> <totar> does that still happen
07:01 < bridge> <totar> the one with all the steps
07:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably not
07:01 < bridge> <totar> ok
07:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: but again, tie the flag to input type is probably the best thing to do.
07:05 < bridge> <totar> I don't really see any reason it can't work tho
07:07 < bridge> <totar> why would there be popping when you're viewing your own tee, isn't that a different issue?
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
07:07 < bridge> <totar> no?
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the same issue
07:07 < bridge> <totar> hmm
07:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the same issue where server can not tell what type of value m_TargetX and Y is holding
07:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> any other conditions beyond just `m_pClient->m_Camera.CamType() != CCamera::CAMTYPE_SPEC` you are just introducing potential desyncs and confusing the server.
07:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm sure @learath2 understand this as well, he can back it up.
07:09 < bridge> <totar> ok
07:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> imma be afk for a bit. maybe someone else can confirms where the problem lies. my english is not up to task to explain this right now i think.
07:15 < bridge> <totar> I've updated it again
07:19 < bridge> <totar> I wanted to keep it the same as the only one meaning to ensure compatibility with mods who may be doing who knows what with the flag. I think the popping when you press chat and spec at the same time is probably not worth that risk but I've done it anyway
07:20 < bridge> <totar> I wanted to keep it the same as the old meaning to ensure compatibility with mods who may be doing who knows what with the flag. I think the popping when you press chat and spec at the same time is probably not worth that risk but I've done it anyway

07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > I wanted to keep it the same as the old meaning to ensure compatibility with mods who may be doing who knows what with the flag.
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 
07:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> revert my pr and mark the problem won't fix is a better way to achieve that and not having to use another bit of playerflag.
07:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just finished my walk
07:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
07:59 < bridge> <totar> the version that only breaks if you press chat and pause at the same time is still a significant upgrade at very little maintinence cost imo
08:00 < bridge> <totar> I've already exhausted nearly my entire energy budget for this topic so I'm willing to do literally anything. I don't even care about removing the 6th flag anymore
08:01 < bridge> <totar> I'll just have to put a setting in tclient that turns it off for the next 5 months until noby updates his fng servers
08:01 < bridge> <DDNet> null
08:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh ye, that happened
08:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fng
08:05 < bridge> <DDNet> null
08:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > the version that only breaks if you press chat and pause at the same time
08:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 
08:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that also breaks whatever mods are doing with the flag when player is spectating in freeview while not having chat or menu opens, therefore breaking both compatibility purpose and the fix purpose.
08:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 
08:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I'll just revert my pr directly, the original issue is such a small issue, marking won't fix is probably better for both compatibility and not introducing new flags. the issue gotta be marked won't fix tho, cuz someone might try to fix it and do what we've tried all over again
08:16 < bridge> <Sans> wasnt it 🍉
08:16 < bridge> <Sans> fng
08:16 < bridge> <DDNet> null
08:16 < bridge> <Sans> uh
08:16 < bridge> <Sans> wasnt it "🍉"
08:16 < bridge> <Sans> :oop:
08:20 < bridge> <totar> but you could already arbitrarily overlap spectating with any either state of the playing flag so mods would already account for this scenario
08:20 < bridge> <totar> but you could already arbitrarily overlap spectating with either state of the playing flag so mods would already account for this scenario
08:23 < bridge> <totar> the chance of a mod ONLY breaking if you do not have playing or menu or chat seems very low to me
08:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bot lied to you
08:24 < bridge> <Sans> :why:
08:26 < bridge> <totar> this is the only new scenario introduced by the version that doesn't invert the flag
08:26 < bridge> <totar> you still can't have playing + menu or chat
08:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if some mod is using PLAYERFLAG_PLAYING to do something i can see someone only checking that bit without knowing what the client does, which would have behave differently if we also mask it with a camtype condition.
08:29 < bridge> <totar> yes but you're not playing while spectating, and you could always have the menu open at the same time
08:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you are playing while spectating other players
08:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if we are talking about that flag
08:30 < bridge> <totar> yeah but that's fine because you're not doing inputs
08:32 < bridge> <totar> the server can't assume that the playing flag means anything while you're spectating because you can also have the menu or chat open, so it no reasonable person would trigger any logic based on it
08:32 < bridge> <totar> the server can't assume that the playing flag means anything while you're spectating because you can also have the menu or chat open, so no reasonable person would trigger any logic based on it
08:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> at this point we are just speculating what modders think
08:33 < bridge> <totar> no
08:33 < bridge> <totar> ok hold on
08:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why can we use that command anyway
08:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
08:40 < bridge> <Sans> excellent question
08:40 < bridge> <Sans> i have no idea
08:42 < bridge> <totar> ok I checked all the mods
08:42 < bridge> <totar> none of them check for it in any way
08:43 < bridge> <totar> ok I checked all the mods on <https://github.com/miguilimzero/teeworlds-mods>
08:43 < bridge> <totar> if someone complains we add a servercap
08:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so replacing it can be considered safe for now?
08:43 < bridge> <totar> yeah
08:44 < bridge> <totar> 0.7 doesn't have any equivlient for this flag either
08:44 < bridge> <totar> 0.7 doesn't have any equivalent for this flag either
08:44 < bridge> <totar> they deleted it
08:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sounds good to me
08:45 < bridge> <totar> so we keep the full replacement version?
08:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't mind.
08:45 < bridge> <totar> or the lite version
08:45 < bridge> <totar> ok
08:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i also don't mind reverting it. i just don't like the one that breaks only sometimes
08:47 < bridge> <totar> I don't mind that version because it self documents the problem but idrc

11:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure I've convinced you guys that I should ABSOLUTELY be working on DDNet code :P :P :P
11:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ill look at the prs when I do the 2nd part of day 6 xd
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg aoc is bad for humanity confirmed
11:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I still need to figure out how to make that run in under 15 hours... :justatest:
11:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> mine is fast
11:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but has one problem, it gives wrong asnwer
11:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but has one problem, it gives wrong answer
11:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> mine is SLOW AS HELL because all my state is immutable
11:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, not like I can be certain that mine gives the correct answer considering it would take FIFTEEN HOURS to complete
11:59 < bridge> <woidless> By the way, I will study C++
11:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe I'll just cheat and skip the second part of 6 until later, just write the solution in a more human language as a temporary solution
11:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted once for the problem to complete but then it turned out that it was in an infinite loop 😬
11:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure by the end of this gauntlet I'll be writing point-free code like a god
11:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i did every possible mistake on this problem
11:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure by the end of this gauntlet I'll be writing point-free code like some FP god
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo nice https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1733569145.png
12:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There's me in 2nd place with a single shameful gray star...
12:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and I'll be in like 4th place once everyone else catches up on the problems
12:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yet somehow I feel like I have a very realistic chance of winning if I simply don't quit halfway through :P

12:03 < bridge> <Solly> it looked like js so i wrote console.log x-x
12:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> `if(Stroke)` is redundant, as you're always having a stroke
12:05 < bridge> <Solly> D:
12:39 < bridge> <Solly> i really want to use goto's in my code rn D:
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your gpu hates you
12:44 < bridge> <Solly> why
12:44 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
12:44 < bridge> <Solly> const CChat::CLine *pLine;
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>     if(pName)
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>     {
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>         for(int i = GameClient()->m_Chat.m_CurrentLine; i >= 0; --i)
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>         {
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>             if(str_comp(GameClient()->m_Chat.m_aLines[i].m_aName, pName) == 0)
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>             {
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>                 pLine = &GameClient()->m_Chat.m_aLines[i];
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>                 goto matched;
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>             }
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>         }
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>         for(int i = GameClient()->m_Chat.m_CurrentLine; i >= 0; --i)
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>         {
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>             if(str_comp_nocase(GameClient()->m_Chat.m_aLines[i].m_aName, pName) == 0)
12:44 < bridge> <Solly>             {
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>                 pLine = &GameClient()->m_Chat.m_aLines[i];
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>                 goto matched;
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>             }
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>         }
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>         GameClient()->m_Chat.Echo("No chat to translate");
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>         return;
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>     }
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>     else
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>     {
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>         pLine = &GameClient()->m_Chat.m_aLines[GameClient()->m_Chat.m_CurrentLine];
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>     }
12:45 < bridge> <Solly>     matched:
12:45 < bridge> <Solly> ```
12:45 < bridge> <Solly> i feel like this is the cleanest way to do it x-x
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> randomly jumping around is hard for gpus xd
12:45 < bridge> <Solly> well as long as ur in the same section it isnt bad?
12:45 < bridge> <Solly> well any less than jumping at all
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just be careful not to create spgethi with goto
12:45 < bridge> <Solly> is this spagheti
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u have learath in this chat
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he loves u now
12:46 < bridge> <Solly> sorry im alrady taken /:
12:46 < bridge> <Solly> also what do production servers follow?
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i generally don't like returns that are not early returns or part of a return chain xd
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i think it's not the easiest to follow code
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's also not a lot of code
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it also depends on how big your function is
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> well i want to move the no chat to translate to just above the match
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> and it is an early return
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> cuz if it doesnt return, as the code suggests will translate the message
12:47 < bridge> <Solly> a commit merged yesterday is already in effect
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you could for example move everything above the `matched:` into a closure or extra function
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you don't need the goto
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> but... thats weird...
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> i like top to bottom
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> (i can also jsut use a flag but then the second no case check would be indented 1 more)
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> (i can also use a flag but then the second no case check would be indented 1 more)
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then you clearly express: You want to return your search for a match as soon as you have one
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> (^ never nester moment)
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> oh above!. i read below
12:48 < bridge> <Solly> yeah that works
12:49 < bridge> <Solly> ima do that
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Especially on older GPUs code like
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```glsl
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if (condition) {
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>   a();
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> } else {
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>   b():
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> }
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> would first pause every single thread where `condition` is false and execute `a();` on every single thread where it's true
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> then pause every thread where `condition` is true and execute `b();` on every single thread where it's false
12:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and then finally continue execution of all threads like normal
12:51 < bridge> <Solly> thats why i said as bad as jumping at all
12:51 < bridge> <Solly> also not the case anymore
12:51 < bridge> <Solly> and a function call would be the same (as it would be inlined cuz gpus)
12:52 < bridge> <Solly> i only learnt about this in the past week, take that therapist i did learn something from yt!!
12:52 < bridge> <Solly> ^ thats a joke it was just random computer documentaries i had as background audio
12:52 < bridge> <Solly> ^ and i heard that and i was like huh.... i didnt know that
13:31 < bridge> <sk3dguard> $eflcoders
13:31 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> My experience with LSP today:
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I use an NVim configuration made by someone else because I'm lazy
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I start writing code in a language that the config has pre-installed LSP for
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I get annoyed by the LSP
13:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I switch to plain Vim to get away from the fancy config
13:41 < bridge> <learath2> What annoyed you the most?

13:49 < bridge> <rutujek> Solly i replied to another message wait
13:49 < bridge> <rutujek> this
13:49 < bridge> <rutujek> bc you want to use goto's
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
13:49 < bridge> <rutujek> bc you want to use goto
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is the new best argument
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't use goto bcs GPU burns
13:50 < bridge> <Solly> i dont know if i didnt make it clear, but this is running purely on the cpu. i get the gpu thing was a joke... but

14:02 < bridge> <Solly> ugh
14:05 < bridge> <teero777> hmm most games would break if my PC would be too good right?
14:05 < bridge> <teero777> In the theoretical case I had 1000000 fps in a game wouldn't the dt be literally 0 causing all games with Delta time to break?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you dont clamp the fps that can happen yes
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet is nano second aware, so it might still work
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😉
14:06 < bridge> <Solly> thats 1000 ns per frame so itd be fine
14:06 < bridge> <Solly> thats 1000 ns per frame so (modern) games would be fine
14:07 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet doesn't use Delta time at all no?
14:07 < bridge> <teero777> Okay imagine higher
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least for particles it does i think
14:07 < bridge> <Solly> ^ and tater rainbow effect
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just never store time in f32
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> worst you can do xd
14:08 < bridge> <teero777> did you refactor it to do that? Pretty sure I don't use dt for that
14:08 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
14:08 < bridge> <teero777> why?
14:08 < bridge> <Solly> cuz gametick doesnt increase sometimes and i couldnt figure out why... so i just went.... mmm dt
14:08 < bridge> <Solly> also gametick only means 25 fps
14:08 < bridge> <Solly> also gametick only means 50 fps
14:09 < bridge> <Solly> (need more precise rainbow)
14:09 < bridge> <teero777> then go use std::chrono xdd
14:09 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:09 < bridge> <Solly> static float Time = 0.0f;
14:09 < bridge> <Solly>     Time += Client()->RenderFrameTime() * ((float)g_Config.m_ClRainbowSpeed / 100.0f);
14:09 < bridge> <Solly>     float DefTick = std::fmod(Time, 1.0f);
14:09 < bridge> <Solly> ```
14:09 < bridge> <Solly> darn i used a float
14:10 < bridge> <Solly> if i did Time %= 1.0f then it works for big fps
14:10 < bridge> <teero777> u gonna break everything on my new pc
14:10 < bridge> <Solly> (as long as it doesnt go above 1 then precision shouldnt mater)
14:11 < bridge> <teero777> Problem is that renderframetime will be returning 0
14:11 < bridge> <teero777> Rainbow is not gonna rainbow anymore
14:11 < bridge> <Solly> it returns `0.000001`
14:11 < bridge> <Solly> which is easy enuf for f32
14:11 < bridge> <teero777> no
14:12 < bridge> <Solly> it returns `0.000001` (for the fps you said)
14:12 < bridge> <teero777> 10000000000000 fps
14:12 < bridge> <Solly> ohno
14:12 < bridge> <teero777> It's a continuous computer
14:12 < bridge> <teero777> Frames don't even exist for it
14:13 < bridge> <Solly> ohno 9.99999999999802e-9 error!?!?!?!
14:13 < bridge> <Solly> ^ that was also calculated in float so that might aslo have an error
14:15 < bridge> <Solly> ohno 1e-8 s (over a second) error!?!?!?!
14:15 < bridge> <Solly> ~~^ that was also calculated in float so that might aslo have an error~~ (f64 B))
14:15 < bridge> <teero777> Make it infinite fps
14:16 < bridge> <Solly> if u have a computer that good go simulate a universe with a lower spec computer in it
14:16 < bridge> <Solly> ^ REFERENCE
14:16 < bridge> <teero777> :o

14:17 < bridge> <Solly> the first thing i searched wow
14:17 < bridge> <Solly> that didnt happen last time
14:17 < bridge> <Solly> <https://qntm.org/responsibilit> @teero777
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u have so many fps, then we also should switch to smaller time units generally
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 128-bit computers will be default
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem with floats is continuous accumulation of small decimals.
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is when floats suck
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You basically always end up rounding up or down
14:22 < bridge> <Solly> its such a small error and for a visual effect even at such high fps it doesnt matter
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Over a time frame of 20 minutes you are at least 1 second off even with only like 60fps
14:22 < bridge> <Solly> 👻 !!!
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just saiyan
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> oke
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> thank u for the knoleg
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> np
14:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok I cheated to get my missing star, wrote the solution in lua
14:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> kinda gross, it takes 8.5s to execute, and that's after shaving off a couple seconds
14:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> better than 15 hours
14:23 < bridge> <Solly> (estimated i hope)
14:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> why am I writing high level languages like this
14:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I calculated the 15 hours from the time to process a single case and the approximate number of cases, it'd likely be a fair bit faster in reality
14:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but not by more than a couple hours
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> This i great
14:34 < bridge> <Solly> ik
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> I am a little confused tho. Before they had built the machine there was only one reality. But the moment they started the simulation they created infinite realities.
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> So they are in the original reality
14:35 < bridge> <Solly> well they cant tell that
14:35 < bridge> <Solly> everyone else also believes they are the ones who first turned on the machine
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> hmm yea okay I see. But they know that there is a reality that is original
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> and we as the reader cant assume its from the perspective of the first reality
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> hmm true
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> Actually yes we can
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> the machine simulates all time before they start peering at themselves
14:36 < bridge> <Solly> so them making and turning on the machine "exists" for all realities
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> Since the first part of the story was when the simulation wasn't tested yet
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> Well Diane maybe tested it herself befor
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> Hmm
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> that time still had to be simulated by the machine
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> But how'd she turn it off and on again without disappearing into nothingness
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> they werent simulating the universe
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> And if it is turned off only the original world will remain
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> they get scared turning off the universe when they start simulating it
14:37 < bridge> <Solly> because it does mean turning off reality for infinate realities
14:38 < bridge> <Solly> that is one way to see if you are the original reality
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> yea by the original reality wouldn't get turned of
14:38 < bridge> <Solly> by turning it off
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> So they would only exist in the original reality once they turn it off
14:38 < bridge> <Solly> the problem ethically isnt with "killing" themselves its with everyone else in it
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> Would the changes they made still be there?
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> well they are in a simulated reality as well
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> because the bar of gold appears
14:39 < bridge> <teero777> not really since the real humans do survive
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> but for the original reality which doesnt have a bar of gold
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> there is a difference between the 2 universes
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> butterfly effect ergo there are 2 different sets of everyone who exist
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> maybe not infinate but not only the "true" one
14:39 < bridge> <Solly> seeing as all but the original are identical
14:40 < bridge> <Solly> there is a difference between the original and the rest of the universes
14:40 < bridge> <Solly> there doesnt neccesarily have to be a original reality
14:40 < bridge> <Solly> which i assume is something they are also scared off
14:40 < bridge> <Solly> which i assume is something they are also scared of
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> so in the original one there won't be a gold bar appearing. If I were them I would turn off the machine even if a gold bar appeared.
14:41 < bridge> <Solly> the simulated realities dont have to turn off the machine
14:41 < bridge> <Solly> they still die if anyone above them does
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> But can they even?
14:41 < bridge> <Solly> yes
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think they can really decide
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> Since they all come from the original
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> I do believe in free will tho
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> Just not for the simulated guy
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> well they can test whether they are the first copy
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> by all turning off the machine
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> Just not for the simulated ppl
14:42 < bridge> <Solly> seeing as they could internally decide to not turn off the machine if they are the original (or just tell themselves not to)
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> Also wouldn't the original world that doesn't have gold bar be completely different than the ones below?
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> that would differentiate the first copy and the rest of the universes, (^) which then again causes an ethical concern
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> that would differentiate the first copy and the rest of the universes, (^) which then again causes an ethical concern (that is a universe where they didnt decided to turn of a machine would be something whcih can cause side effects)
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> eventually
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> they would diverge
14:43 < bridge> <Solly> theoretically
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> yes so the simulations are just simulations they are not real
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> from our perspective there isnt
14:44 < bridge> <teero777> Since the original world is special
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> and what makes something a simulation
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> if its perfect to every degree it can be
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> (which is what the argument here is)
14:44 < bridge> <Solly> (which is one of the questions which was probably intended to be asked from this)
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> (which is one of the questions which was probably intended to be asked from this, seeing as the guy questions how to find where they are in the universes)
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> if its perfect to every degree ~~it can be~~ there is (for the sake of argument)
14:45 < bridge> <teero777> No since it is not the original world so it will diverge front the real world at some point if there is any intervention
14:45 < bridge> <teero777> Idk
14:45 < bridge> <Solly> if its perfect to every degree ~~it can be~~ there is (for the sake of argument, from their perspective (and from the male characters one i forgot their name) they cant be sure if they have covered every degree)
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> ethics would be weird
14:46 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but everything and everyone would fold out the same if the original universe had a gold bar as it does in the first copy (and the rest assuming they dont suiside)
14:47 < bridge> <teero777> But the original world doesn't get the gold bar since it is not simulated by itself
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> also you can check which universe you are in but it would take an infinate amount of time on average
14:47 < bridge> <Solly> (you simply either pass a message to the next universe whether you got a gold bar or not, or the previous message you got)
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> but if it did, it would fold out the same
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> seeing as the simulations are perfect
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> as the simulations are perfect
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> its not any different so how can you make a different judgement
14:48 < bridge> <Solly> based on something (the universe they are in "fake", or real) which has no effect
14:48 < bridge> <teero777> No it would take exactly 1 second
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> assuming each message pass takes a second it would take n seconds (n being the universe you are in) to determine if you are in that universe
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> unless the machine does it then it would be instant
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> unless the machine does it then it would be instant (the machine can do it)
14:49 < bridge> <Solly> although conveying an infinate amount of information would be impossible
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> unless the universe has infinate precision (it doesnt(?))
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> Tbh the most impressive thing in this short story is the fact that they made the simulation
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> Which seems pretty impossible
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> yep
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> they put quantum in the name so ofc it works
14:50 < bridge> <Solly> but the machine existing isnt the point
14:51 < bridge> <Solly> its the outcome of simulating itself
14:51 < bridge> <Solly> which could even be seen as a mistake
14:51 < bridge> <Solly> as if you never do it, you would never have this moral dilema
14:51 < bridge> <Solly> but ofc its the first thing youd (and i would) try
14:51 < bridge> <Solly> after solving mathimatical theorems
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> try is good
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> Succeed is har
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> Succeed is hard
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> once you have the machine
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> ^ the machine is the real blocker
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> ^ you can brute force the equation of the universe with a machine as such
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> But it seems to take time to compile programs for the machine
14:52 < bridge> <Solly> not that long
14:53 < bridge> <Solly> (you just try every equation possible and ask it to check if the machine exists, if it does, then the equation is accurate enough)
14:54 < bridge> <Solly> (and since the machine is able to calculate the last digit of pi, it can also search all equations so it can also find one with no error by checking if everything happens in the same way till t=infinity)
15:04 < bridge> <teero777> hmm yea

18:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> See, I expected `visited_states[state]` to take the most time, but it appears that's 6x less important than simply reading where the walls are in the play area
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> No, if you need to indicate the result of `OnCompletion` then you should add a different mechanism for that
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> And make sure to only access that result when the request is done
18:06 < bridge> <Solly> i just want m_state == done so i can access stuff
18:06 < bridge> <Solly> in oncompletion
18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> `OnCompletion` runs on the curl multi thread, you shouldn't perform heavy work there or you block HTTP requests
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> We currently poll the job result in other components
18:08 < bridge> <Solly> oh so i should make some way to tell the mainthread
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> We currently poll the request result in other components
18:08 < bridge> <Solly> should i do that sorta polling in onrender?
18:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Ideally, the main thread reads the results from the completed requests
18:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you avoid the need for additional synchronization
18:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I tried to add completion callbacks for jobs before, but I haven't finished it
18:10 < bridge> <Solly> (?)
18:11 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that's how we currently do it for all requests I think
18:11 < bridge> <Solly> thanks :D
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can even use a LuaJIT specific feature to specify that the table should be allocated as an array, don't use the hash map part of the table since I'm only going to be accessing this in a very specific range of integer keys
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and it still takes forever
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait. WAIT NO WAY!
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Have I been stupid this whole time?
18:15 < bridge> <Solly> and once uve done that u can compile it to c then use -O4
18:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Did I trust the profiler too much? The line right before that if is the line where I add a new entry to the big hash table of visited states
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It could totally be that that's actually where the time is spent, as intended, and the profiler is just a little off due to optimization magic
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I wonder what'd happen if I tell LuaJIT to use -O0
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well, -O0 didn't make it make any more sense
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> @sollybunny  i tried adding a new command to the `dont kill on practice` section you added to toggle it on and off.
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> i have no idea how to keep a state set after a player dies.
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> `pChr->SetKillable(pResult->NumArguments() == 0 ? !pChr->Core()->m_Killable : pResult->GetInteger(0));` this is automatically set to false whenever a player dies, which is generally intended behaviour, but i want to keep it across the entire "practice session"
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> elp, me noob
18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah you know what, i'll just push it for your eyes to see
18:43 < bridge> <Solly> did u add setkillable?
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```cpp
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> void CCharacter::SetKillable(bool Killable)
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> {
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>     m_Core.m_Killable = Killable;
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>     if(!Killable)
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>         Freeze();
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> }
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's a mere style copy from the invincible toggle
18:44 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :BB::OO::OO:
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```cpp
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> void CCharacter::SetKillable(bool Killable)
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> {
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>     m_Core.m_Killable = Killable;
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>     if(!Killable)
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ>         Freeze();
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> }
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's a mere copy from the invincible toggle
18:45 < bridge> <Solly> you can have a flag called m_killable(_practice) and u can just use it where i ignore spikes with practice (add `&& player->m_killable == true)`
18:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah but "killable" is automatically set to false after the player actually dies. meaning you need to set it after each death
18:46 < bridge> <Solly> make a new flag
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> :feelsbadman:  okäse
18:48 < bridge> <Solly> touching what invinsible uses is probably a bad idea
18:48 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Yay new country flag:toptri:
18:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah you may have misunderstood, i dont reuse anything from invincible, just the code style used xD
18:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'd like to make every single practice command a toggle at some point
18:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> darn these `un` commands

18:51 < bridge> <Solly> `/shotgun ?i[enabled]`
18:51 < bridge> <Solly> 0 or 1 for disable and enable
18:51 < bridge> <Solly> empty for toggle
18:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> yea
18:52 < bridge> <Solly> (and even if you have aliases for 0 and 1 such as remove and add, no argument should be default)
