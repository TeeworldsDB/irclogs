10:17 <@heinrich5991> deen: any reason we had `merge_slashes off;` in the nginx config?
10:18 <@heinrich5991> I turned it on again due to a vulnerability, we can probably also fix it another way if we need `merge_slashes on;`
10:58 <@heinrich5991> and do we have some space where we can put people who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities?
13:12 <+fstd_> why do people always want responsible disclosure... isn't it more fun to see the world burn every now and then?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> I agree
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> With fisted
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we have that even in a world with responsible disclosure, fstd_ ^^
