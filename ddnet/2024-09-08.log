00:59 < bridge_> <totar> how can you have src == dst without them overlapping?
01:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> mmap
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Philosophical that is a interesting question.
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do two parallel lines intersect if they are equal.
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
01:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no that was just an observation that ubsan doesnt find that case
01:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Philosophically that is a interesting question.
01:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do two parallel lines intersect if they are equal.
01:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
01:06 < bridge_> <totar> do you mean src and dst as pointers or the actual data?
01:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the two pointers poiting to the same data
01:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hope u read this
01:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs this topic is simply about ubsan not reporting this, which is very likely a bug in ubsan
01:08 < bridge_> <totar> I don't understand how you can have two pointers that point to the same memory and then not have it overlap if you copy from one to the other?
01:08 < bridge_> <totar> is that the bug?
01:09 < bridge_> <totar> you wrote it like src == dst is fine unless they overlap
01:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it probably is a bug yes.
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> yeah but you can clarify what you meant by 
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> 
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> > a. If you memcpy where src == dst. it's not UB
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> > b. but if src and dst overlap it is
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> 
01:16 < bridge_> <totar> How can you have a without b? I think b is always true given a
01:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah that is the whole point
01:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is why ubsan probably contains a bug
01:22 < bridge_> <totar> how did you even figure this out tho
01:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we had a overlapping bug in ddnet depending on the pitch size vs width in resolution for the video encoding process
01:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte apparently had a non divisible by 4 resolution, i never tested it with that.
01:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
01:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I found a different bug, reported that. Robyte tried to reproduce and found this
01:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i remove the if where it checked against the width and still didnt get his bug
01:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs ptr == dst, bcs width == pitch
01:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the code tried to repack itself without alignment, which was wrong anyway
01:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i'd probably never have found it bcs ubsan also didnt report this bug xD
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> so what does ubsan even check for? it checks for src==dst but not for overlap?
01:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno why it didnt catch this one. i assume they simply rely on the memcpy impl, and if the memcpy impl does a src == dst check to skip the copying it might never trigger
01:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or whoever added the check was drunk xd
01:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the ubsan check
05:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i finally know now how u gamed with ping i assume you used cl_antiping :D i only had cl_predict on
05:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> u have never used antiping?? oh dear
05:50 < bridge_> <syrinok> Antiping haters should see the light like I have, it's worth it
06:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan i prefer good internet
06:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if my internet is not perfect i just dont play
06:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
06:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I spend 2 days reverse engineering ddnet persian protocol
06:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1725768644.png
06:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chillerbot-zx can now connect to all ddnet persian servers xd
06:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> figuring out their custom snapshots was a bit tricky but no problem for haxor dragon who can read network hexdumps of snaps and just sees tees
06:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAYXgbSlSv0

06:28 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Very nice
06:30 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Now you should help me develop this https://twelo.pages.dev
06:30 < bridge_> <pathos3005> And re: GitHub, yes it's me üòÑ
06:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice site
06:31 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Thanks
06:31 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Only few pages are available as dummy front end
06:34 < bridge_> <pathos3005> So I think I can figure out how to setup Javascript (probably not secure?) to interact to a pythonanywhere Flask API, but I couldn't figure out how setup database that connects to the API :(
06:34 < bridge_> <pathos3005> 
06:34 < bridge_> <pathos3005> I explored a bit of pythonanywhere's Flask Alchemy SQL, as well as Turso. Turso I didn't delve in deep because it seems like it requires Rust (just for the Cargo I think). D:

06:39 < bridge_> <pathos3005> If you happen to know anyone that can do backend, and someone that can mod a TW server... üòâ
06:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> basically everyone who is active in this channel @pathos3005 xd
06:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw if you want to do stats stuff i recommend ddnet-insta it already has a json api @pathos3005  https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/blob/e2031acdac3040e9944fb785d97d934527a588ad/README.md#json---javascript-object-notation-format-4
06:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it recently also got brand new CTF/DM support
06:47 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Needs a 'win' key :P but looking nice
06:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> win key?
06:48 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Yeah key-value pair, win = 1 or win = 0 without deducing it
06:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where?
06:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to know which team won? Its the one with the higher score lol
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> It could be something like
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> ```
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> ...
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> "score_limit": 200,
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> "win": -1, for red, 1 if blue, 0 if tied
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> "time_limit": 0,
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> ...
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> ```
06:49 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Yeah you're right
06:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i could add it but seems a bit redundant and also I don't like the magic values too much
06:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is looking at the score a problem for you?
06:50 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Now that I think about it, no -- just far future scope to have 'agree to tie' games, that's all
06:50 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Typically due to disconnects or emergencies etc.
06:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gctf community is building something similar
06:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> TNT has some ranking website based on those stats
06:52 < bridge_> <pathos3005> You have link?
06:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no i lost it -.-
06:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://gctfleague.org/
06:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez found it
06:54 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Wait, is it automated? Like you log in through the client like Teerace?
06:54 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Auto upload results
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it posts the round stats to a http endpoint of every game
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no accounts 
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here is the code for the site btw https://github.com/TyeNTy/teeworlds-league
06:55 < bridge_> <pathos3005> So no account system, right? Or planned?
06:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Not planned
06:56 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Something like Teerace would be *ideal*
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I see
06:56 < bridge_> <pathos3005> Otherwise, it's basically another https://teerank.io
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea
06:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont have time for accounts now first i want to get other stuff done but maybe somewhen far in the future. Guess for now you have to code it your self.

12:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning fellas
12:52 < bridge_> <chairn> yes, they intersect at every points you consider
13:02 < bridge_> <aegisub> their intersection product in the projective plane is a single point, in the affine plane it's zero because the lines themselves are zero
13:08 < bridge_> <chairn> what the hell is intersection product ? you mean orthogonal projection ?
13:14 < bridge_> <aegisub> it's a concept in algebraic geometry

13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> # New Android beta version!
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> See https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8632 for details. The controls are now adjustable, although you will need to use an external text editor for it:
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. Export the touch configuration to the clipboard.
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. Save the clipboard to a file so you can easily edit it (you should also do this to have a backup of your configuration in case you need to reinstall the app!).
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 3. Edit the configuration (see link above for details about the format).
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 4. Copy it to the clipboard and import it in the client again. If the configuration could not be loaded, check the local console for error messages containing `touch_controls` and fix it accordingly.
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 5. Save the changes in the client when you are done. You can also discard your changes or revert to the default if you messed up.
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> Example for a new touch button:
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```json
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> {
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "x": 500000,
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "y": 500000,
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "w": 100000,
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "h": 100000,
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "shape": "rect",
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "visibilities": [
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>         "ingame"
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     ],
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     "behavior": {
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>         "type": "bind",
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>         "label": "Example",
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>         "label-type": "plain",
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>         "command": "echo Hello world!"
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3>     }
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> },
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```
13:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
13:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Next Android beta version is now available, see https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1277345584080097320/1282304450014482504
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> im bored so i decided to make my own rly simple isa and a emulator for it, what do u think
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont want to add immediate add cuz u can do that with a mov, since i want to keep it simple
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1282308394580967435/imagen.png?ex=66dee241&is=66dd90c1&hm=c2d0477af85f4273ab81160524b38d279a49816db4d0ff52fc6615cfe90c2854&
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> totally not riscv inspired
14:55 < bridge> <chairn> why no null opcode ?
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ Ip man hold my dumpling https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=on_fire_mode_idm.mp4&u=chiller
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> make instant respawn
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah man it is cool ngl
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just dunno if cool in competitive scenario
15:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it possible to make the client not die after `systemctl suspend` command?
15:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the process still exists but it doesn't render anything or play any sounds
15:41 < bridge> <zhn> risc6?
15:41 < bridge> <zhn> i like the way ryo copies everything he loves
15:42 < bridge> <zhn> at that point he can proceed to create human cloning machine
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> true, i guess it will be the noop
15:50 < bridge> <zhn> @ryozuki eta? :troll:
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD soon tm
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh my idea is make this emulated isa and a custom compiler then a lang using this
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> and maybe a rly simple os on top
15:52 < bridge> <zhn> ye and then verilog prototype for it
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:52 < bridge> <zhn> homebrew processor
15:53 < bridge> <zhn> and ryo industries frfr
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
15:53 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder if intel will sell their factories
15:53 < bridge> <zhn> u can buy one
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
15:54 < bridge> <zhn> to remake it into foss factory
16:04 < bridge> <_vencha> what the hell is this
16:04 < bridge> <_vencha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1282340780173688916/sigma5ss.mp4?ex=66df006a&is=66ddaeea&hm=2f219dc0119d0ec5354e51489361ac36a7b66f3c2f9a48572c613b1bf1392159&
16:04 < bridge> <_vencha> is it possible to do something like this?
16:04 < bridge> <_vencha> i saw it on a trashmap server
16:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> it has similarities to one of chillerdragon's bots - pretty easy to code
16:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Trash map are official ddnet servers as far as I know
16:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So this looks like a sus bot client
16:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It has been done as you can see in the video. Or what do you mean by is it possible?
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> no.
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> trashmap is not affiliated with ddnet
16:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Since when?
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> since ever :p
16:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> its a project by timakro
16:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs built by timakro for map testing not for server modding to my knowledge
16:10 < bridge> <_vencha> so doesn't ddnet have an anticheat?
16:10 < bridge> <_vencha> the bot makes suspicious moves and doesnt get banned when there is anticheat
16:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No not all servers have anti cheat
16:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but he rq so I thought it‚Äôs hosted by ddnet these days
16:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Anyways the way I understood it is for map testing and not for custom servers
16:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah but that's for timakro to decide and handle, his last discord message was around 2 months ago - did he really rq? :o
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> no
16:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
16:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He ghost
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> he remakes unique race server btw
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> to ddnet base
16:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> why would he do that
16:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> urs is too old
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> pure 0.6
16:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkaStop:
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> u can't even complete commands after removing hardcoded mess on client side
16:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> :feelsbadman:
16:35 < bridge> <murpi> Chillerdragon: They aren't official ddnet servers. We only provide a prettier domain: https://trashmap.ddnet.org/. The servers are hosted by timakro

16:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpi @melo∆û omagawd what i mean is that those are not heavily modded servers with features such as server side bots "official" might be the wrong word. I did not want to say "vanilla"

16:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> its fine chiller <3

16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the video
16:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he had 1 sub and 1 video from 15yrs ago im sure he will upload next week
16:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i wont miss it
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ping him somehow
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and ask him if freeze-ng is freeze next gen
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do your usual ping magic
16:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ping him on some 1990 svn repo somewhere in the darkest of the dark nets
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1725807595.png
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he already did
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know that guy xd
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe i asked him to ask xD

17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Any idea why Vulkan cannot be found anymore when building ARM64 and x64 Android?
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> --  * Vulkan not found
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> -- To run the tests, you have to install GTest
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:714 (message):
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3>   You must install Vulkan libraries to compile the DDNet client
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Building ARM and x86 works. Changed min API to 23 since curl does not compile with min API 21.
17:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like old API versions simply do not support Vulkan...
17:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like old API versions simply do not support Vulkan with 64 bit...
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quite possible that they don't
17:20 < bridge> <robyt3> ok, API 24 works
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epyc anti-backward compatbility moment
17:22 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the min api slowly keeps increasing lol
17:22 < bridge> <robyt3> but it seems like it was never that low to begin with
17:22 < bridge> <robyt3> never worked with those versions
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.5 prediction code be like
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1725808961.png
17:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "Note: tested with gcc5 under debian8, report, if older versions don't work"
17:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> guess who am i quoting here
19:24 < bridge> <qiworzzz> GG
19:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> are ddnet binaries compiled with modern compilers?
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> it would be a pitty if its old cuz u lose new opts
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway, use gentoo
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are build with old ones
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and perform basically the same xdd
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

20:39 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> ddnet virus?
20:43 < bridge> <qiworzzz> what's this?
20:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my language :justatest:
20:48 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> It says to me that ddnet is a virus, is it true?
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends where you downloaded it xd
20:50 < bridge> <qiworzzz> No, it's a regular game.
20:51 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> oh
20:54 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> okay
20:54 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> but I downloaded from the official website and it says that it is a virus
20:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> what antivirus program are you using?
20:55 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> virustotal
20:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/18ce070e04ea379fe9884b93f0fc763838083ab668e0e57aaffb0882a4d3ae25
20:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
20:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> virustotal says ddnet is fine :)
20:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you sure you downloaded it from https://ddnet.org/
20:56 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> yes
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> if downloaded from the official website its an obvious false positive - ddnet is open source: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> on the other hand - closed source bot clients are malware infected
20:57 < bridge> <robyt3> https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/250d15aba811b235621330e57fb94db53d36cff5f7b7f89cd73b4b1874da701e

20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> you can probably ignore whatever DrWeb is
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> looks like it detects our crash dumping as something bad, which makes no sense
20:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> ` DDNet-18.5-win64 (2).zip ` gotta respect you downloading it for the third time now :P
20:59 < bridge> <isofile2_21041> but when I open the file, it says that the PC may be at risk of a virus
21:00 < bridge> <robyt3> If you downloaded from ddnet.org or from Steam then it should be safe, Windows shows a warning for all files downloaded from the internet
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt think it would show it for steam
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the Mark of the Web is only applied to files downloaded with a browser AFAIK
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the Mark of the Web is only applied to files downloaded with a web browser AFAIK
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> DrWeb xddd
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds so trustworthy
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> I think it comes from dr mingw
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least they already had proper freeze skins :lol:
21:48 < bridge> <zakharkosh> hi i have problem is there anyone here who can guide me?
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we all have problems, maybe you can say what your problem is
21:49 < bridge> <zakharkosh> Thank you for your answer
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Np, i am waiting for yours
21:50 < bridge> <zakharkosh> if i want to define a function that goes from the start menu to the Settings > Information menu that I created  where and how should I express it?
21:50 < bridge> <zakharkosh> When we click on the setting in the start menu, it will be transferred to the setting sectio
21:50 < bridge> <zakharkosh> When we click on the setting in the start menu, it will be transferred to the setting sectioÿØ
21:50 < bridge> <zakharkosh> When we click on the setting in the start menu, it will be transferred to the setting section

21:52 < bridge> <zakharkosh> @jupeyy_keks
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't know by heart, i'd probably need to do a global search over the code and find how other things do it too
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so guess i am not really a help
21:55 < bridge> <zakharkosh> i was also looking for it but I didn't see any work that    i could do to move it to the place i want
21:55 < bridge> <zakharkosh> Dont know anyone else to help? @jupeyy_keks
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno just wait and maybe someone answers.. And while waiting just read the code a bit, maybe u are lucky and find the answer
21:57 < bridge> <zakharkosh> .
21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> idk off the top of my head
21:57 < bridge> <zakharkosh> ok sure , ty ‚ù§Ô∏è

22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> reference the enum in CMenus (menus.h)
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> (e.g):
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> enum
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û>     {
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û>         PAGE_NEWS = 1,

22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> see how the page is setup, what it calls/gets called to, what is happening when case == PAGE_INTERNET etc.
22:28 < bridge> <zakharkosh> what about setup?
22:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> how for example page_internet is structured, how it's rendered etc
22:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> That should give you the knowledge on creating your own
22:30 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I know how they work and i tried them one by one but still my page is, blank
22:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> We would need to see your entire code to know why :feelsbadman:
22:31 < bridge> <zakharkosh> I just can't figure out what to replace it to go to the page i made
22:31 < bridge> <zakharkosh> üòÇ
22:32 < bridge> <zakharkosh> actually i create  one function on menus.cpp
