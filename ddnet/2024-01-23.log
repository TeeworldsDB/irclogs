03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> Arch Linux package testing tool 'namcap' reports that DDNet is built without shadow stack flag:
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> 
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> ```
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> Checking ddnet-18.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> ddnet W: ELF file ('usr/bin/DDNet') lacks GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_1_SHSTK.
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> ddnet W: ELF file ('usr/bin/DDNet-Server') lacks GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_1_SHSTK.
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> ```
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> 
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> I've read about it ([specially this GNU Lib C mail thread](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/glibc/patch/20180508204021.31845-4-hjl.tools@gmail.com/)), but I'm still not sure if that's a flag DDNet should have set on build time.
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> 
03:27 < bridge> <.rafaelff> Does anyone know?
03:28 < bridge> <.rafaelff> This check was recently added to namcap, reason why it is showing now and not before.
04:26 < bridge> <Ewan> shouldn’t that flag be enabled before the pkgbuild is even involved?
04:26 < bridge> <Ewan> like fortify source
04:26 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet pkg shouldn’t have to involve itself
04:26 < bridge> <Ewan> cc @ryozuki
04:29 < bridge> <.rafaelff> Hi Ewan. There are flags set by default in Arch, but -z shstk to linker is not one of them.
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> I see
04:30 < bridge> <.rafaelff> These are the currently set: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/pacman/-/blob/main/makepkg.conf?ref_type=heads#L45
04:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i would look up ldflags for common pkgs
04:30 < bridge> <Ewan> see if they do it
04:31 < bridge> <.rafaelff> Since it is a new check of the namcap tool, It might not have many. Hard to search. But I'll take a look around. Thanks
04:32 < bridge> <Ewan> someone else here is arch enthusiast but i cant remember who
04:32 < bridge> <Ewan> theyre all asleep anyway though 😃
04:32 < bridge> <.rafaelff> deen, I think.
04:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i was thinking of heinrich, would be surprised if deen was cuz iirc all ddnet servers run debian if he gets to choose host os 😃
04:34 < bridge> <Ewan> could just be for the sake of pkg availability tho
05:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> I'll try soon xd
05:47 < bridge> <Ewan> gross
05:47 < bridge> <Ewan> not worth
05:47 < bridge> <Ewan> imgui sucks
05:48 < bridge> <Ewan> if ddnet should have a new ui it should be designed to work in retained mode and have a proper layout system instead of splitting rects and stuff
05:48 < bridge> <Ewan> but it won't happen
05:48 < bridge> <Ewan> don't see why you would want imgui in the game
06:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If there were a good amount of opinions or just no bad opinions spreaded to the devs for the beta branch regarding the UI changes, then releasing it shouldn't impact negativity
06:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Unless the whole community doesn't care about playtesting / reporting their opinion on changes. This happens 80% of the time and those people are totally clueless on what was happening to the UI. Lets hope that **now it has brought good attention**, you guys can identify what needs change and what can be kept
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> > now it has brought good attention
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> talking about it in the discord is not good attention
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> make an issue if you think it's a big deal
06:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Still most of the community is here, including variant other communities
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yes but it gets forgotten within hours
06:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Idk, some are stuck in convos about it
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> make an issue on gh as to avoid repeating yourself 100 times
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> seen: accounts issue
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> talked about on at least 10 different occasions in this discord. lots of cool insight from all parties. unfortunately nobody remembers what they said because it's miles of scrolling!
06:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But, im not complaining or highlighting an issue here. Im here to see if anything I mentioned is true or not
06:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> rather than me highlighting these issues myself cuz a developer has actually pushed aside the problem, causing discontent amongst people who care, why not highlight yourself this problem to the devs in an enviroment where only devs can see and let them make polls about the changes regarding UI. Aside from the fact that UI is a fundamental part of a game experience, changing an everyday-interactive panel needs more communication towards players
06:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> More, than just pushing it to the beta branch and let it sit for a day, waiting for responses. It needs more and more attention, but one man cannot do it, whos job aint to spread this awareness.
06:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (ok enough ranting :owo: )
06:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> More, than just pushing it to the beta branch and let it sit for a week*, waiting for responses. It needs more and more attention, but one man cannot do it, whos job aint to spread this awareness.
06:44 < bridge> <Ewan> gwaan gwaan gwaan
07:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih imo every player that cares and want to shape the game and influence ui changes should follow what is happening on github. Otherwise you would need someone who feels responsible  to repost stuff from discord somewhere else
07:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> still most people argue about it on discord, which is the annoying part
07:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github has a clean userinterface. All the text is plain english and very descriptive. Ui changes are full of screenshots. Everyone that cares can follow. If you think people miss it then you can do it your self and pick all interesting parts and repost them on discord
07:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you can copy back the replies on discord as a github comment and now you have become the human bridge between github and discord :D 
07:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If you want to be heard reply on github.
07:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If you want the latest news activate github notifications.
07:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> as I mentioned, not my job to repost or spread what has been posted already. I'm only bringing awareness that these types of changes need to be brought to the people more interactively, as in using a poll where different kinds of questions need to be collected to know if you guys head to the right direction designing good UI
07:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its not a locked up place. Nobody is excluded. (except chinese axaxax)
07:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> poor chinese
07:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed
07:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> prob 20% of them would actually share their stuff here too
07:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so what do you suggest to do then?
07:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where should the poll be?
07:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what kind of poll?
07:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who is doing the polls?
07:51 < bridge> <zhn> default gui is okey
07:51 < bridge> <zhn> the way its used is no
07:51 < bridge> <zhn> t
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the type of poll where rating from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), let the user express their answers through questions like
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Seeing the screenshots, would these changes excite you?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> [ Upon checking out Beta branch]
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Did you find the UI more interactive?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Should the old UI and the new UI be toggleable?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Did this UI change affect your way of navigating?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Does this UI change be more understandable for you?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> this is like 1/3rd of what I would ask guaranteed
07:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay and where should the poll be published?
07:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and who should do these polls?
07:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only for ui changes? 
07:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> on a separate room, like how you guys did the 2023 best map poll
07:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what that was. i did not use discord in 2023
07:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> with the bot, apply questions and answers with buttons, record who reacted, make a list out of it in a day and you have a list of people with accurate info
07:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
07:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> thats how I would do it in dc :kek:
07:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> at least, if I would have still be part of Teeworlds Data, heck I would've done it all for you all
07:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if people do not care enough to open github. Why should anyone care about their opinion?
07:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> this... is a bad take?
07:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea maybe
07:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it's like: Yeah, people don't care what I say on the internet, so why are we using these websites to communicate in the first place?
07:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> "Seems worthless to do, maybe effective in a long term, but now useless"
07:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
07:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think a good solution would be to take polls from the ddnet client itself
07:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But to me it sounds like some ddnet mod/admin/dev has to do those polls. It takes time. And then you get a bunch of opinions from casual discord users and trolls that maybe play since 1 day and just vote because they can. I dont see how the result of such poll could be even taking seriously
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> mmmmmmm.... more work for devs, they would 100% deny it lol
07:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah but you forget, the ones who would actually make it would be with the current system
07:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih the thing here is. If you want something you do it. Not if you want something you ask others to figure it out for you.
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, those are an issue for the right person who is responsible. I was there once with this issue
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If you want change you have to lead it
07:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> .-. bruh
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what bruh
07:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> refer to this
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to what
07:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are you using discord replies?
08:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm just concerned on the way of communicating with the community
08:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> where every single way of communication nowadays need to be pushed to gh
08:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ye :kek:
08:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im telling you if you dont come with a concret plan or ideally some actions nothing will come out of your "concern"
08:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ya need to implement that feature too chillerdragon
08:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> an idea would be to use the ddnet.org website/forums since that has **acounts**
08:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih too much effort
08:01 < bridge> <zhn> ddnet forum is kinda old for mobile users
08:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 🐢
08:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 whats wrong with github
08:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 🐢 tutel
08:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nothing's wrong with it other than I got a chance to mention **accounts** ftw
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> accounts :gigachad:
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> me when no accounts:
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/sleep-wake-up-wake-up-in-night-ren-and-stimpy-gif-24104879
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ||https://tenor.com/view/sleep-wake-up-wake-up-in-night-ren-and-stimpy-gif-24104879||
08:04 < ChillerDragon> you can create polls on github. You have to do that your self nobody will do it for you i think @cellegenrih then you can post those in #general or wherever
08:04 < ChillerDragon> and then all users can vote if they care. And heinrich can ignore their opinion the same way as he ignores opinions of the developers axaxax
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - I'll ask for moderator perks on DDNet dc
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Get rejected
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - I'll donate another 200€ if they accept
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Get accepted
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Make the poll
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Profit
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :EZ:
08:05 < ChillerDragon> why do you need mod
08:05 < ChillerDragon> just do it as regular user
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ahm, yeah about that
08:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm not that kind of person nowadays, where I do requests for anybody and doing free work for people
08:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I began tired after the Teeworlds Data incident
08:07 < ChillerDragon> so you consider creating polls so much free work that you wouldnt do it? Thats why you post here so someone else can do it?
08:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O what happened?
08:07 < ChillerDragon> i dont think this is going anywhere
08:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I can do it professionally with the available tools and right moderation
08:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> examples are on Teeworlds Data cuz cagent didn't delete every one of my works
08:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eh
08:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> agreed
08:08 < ChillerDragon> why do you want your work deleted :c
08:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> me? I don't
08:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that Cagent threw me out and literally took over the Discord server
08:09 < ChillerDragon> "cagent didn't delete every one of my works" whats the issue with that?
08:09 < ChillerDragon> > 08:08:24        bridge | cellegenrih: agreed
08:09 < ChillerDragon> agree with what?
08:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> most of the work I did was security standards (against bots, spammers and other awareness)
08:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the UI issue is not going anywhere so I leave it there lol
08:09 < ChillerDragon> ye
08:10 < bridge> <zhn> another teedrama™?
08:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> basically, the server is vulnerable against every single thing in existence
08:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> what's the difference between skins.tw and teedata.net?
08:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @gerdoe :justatest: no drama here
08:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ugh, I guess teedata.net was supposed to be the new Teeskins website with a new interface with better stability
08:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but it still has quite a lot to be done
08:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah makes sense
08:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for me, that new look does look more professional and I'm glad I was there to help with some assets
08:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 👍
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> 😆
09:43 < bridge> <zhn> this one goes hard xd
09:48 < bridge> <zhn> can relate

09:59 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:04 < bridge> <murpi> @jupeyy_keks Aliveclan
10:05 < bridge> <murpi> why down :(
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The server or the http?
10:08 < bridge> <murpi> Your website
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> who is alive clan
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah I got banned so often recently because of reflection attacks. I'm not 100% sure if my php code or other Apache 2 stuff allows pinging servers. But the last report mentioned an IP that I already blocked by iptables.. Kind of annoying to deal with
10:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you ask me. They simply spoofed the IP of my server
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I don't want to track all traffic. The vps is already trash xd
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi do you need something specific?
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1190383357759062016
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Latest fng server is uploaded here
10:16 < bridge> <murpi> I guide ppl to  https://aliveclan.de/#downloads since many are not familiar with compiling the fng on their own xd
10:16 < bridge> <murpi> and I occasionally use your demo renderer
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi use this then
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> we are getting this issue too in unique
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Discord won't go down so often xd
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can host that on a Google service
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> u can appeal on abuseipdb
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but it sorta goes away
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> we had reports only 2mo old now and they are gon
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> gone
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> vps is content
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/72.204.22.162>
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The vps hoster is simply too restrictive. They get abuse e-mails and handle them too easily as abuse
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps u can show them this
10:19 < bridge> <zhn> discord link tend to die for whatever reason
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> how we experienced the same reflection attacks and solved it
10:19 < bridge> <zhn> links*
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh OK. I can try
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only if the original resource was deleted
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Afaik
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone ever used c# json
10:20 < bridge> <zhn> afaik discord started limiting such a behaviour
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> how u can just magically serialize an object as if it was js
10:20 < bridge> <zhn> they don't want people to use discord as fileshare
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> MH in worst case I can host them on gh
10:20 < bridge> <zhn> you can add github actions btw
10:20 < bridge> <zhn> if you want to tho xd
10:20 < bridge> <zhn> too
10:21 < bridge> <zhn> to
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone know of a library which lets udo this
10:21 < bridge> <zhn> too too
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have them, but only works for six month
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> in cpp
10:21 < bridge> <zhn> why
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because GH decided to only last artifacts for 6 months
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> are u talking about static files
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I can create a release
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> u can set up a gh pages org and use the site repo for resources
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> u can set up a gh pages site on an org and use the site repo for resources
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> which do not expire
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can ddnet host a github.io page?
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> can ddnet host a github artifact?
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then I can also upload the demo viewer there
10:22 < bridge> <zhn> wtf
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> idk wat u are talking about
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> 👎
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> microsoft moment
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On GH u can also host websites
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> wait you can do releases can't you
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ye it's called pages...
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But dunno if u need premium
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> no!
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> one free pages site per normal user
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> or one per org!
10:23 < bridge> <zhn> they'll not be deleted ig
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i said it already
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah. Maybe I should
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But they can contain JavaScript?
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> of course
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as it's client
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then I'd say u have infinite pages xd
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont have dns so it's sorta limited
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but yes
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and repo has no unusual filesize limitation
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's a problem
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The wasm module is like 20mb
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> why is it a problem
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh I missed the no
10:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has no (unusual filesize limitations)
10:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not
10:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has (no unusual filesize) limitations
10:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> associativity not included
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> u can just host vast oceans of static content. even generated stuff like web frameworks make, as long as u don't expect the server to process anything further than a normal http server would.
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> hi heinrich
10:26 < bridge> <murpi> @jupeyy_keks Can't you publish the pre-compiled binaries to your releases on your github fng repo or does github not allow manual uploads to there?
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds fine
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> u can preprocess most stuff
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I never did that, so dunno
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> if u are dedicated
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i believe it's a webhook
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> that u can control from anywhere
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> dont quote me
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean I have GH actions
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just never created a release xd
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> u used to have to manually upload artifacts
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> so we used some gha thing to do it manually for us :troll:
10:28 < bridge> <zhn> !
10:28 < bridge> <murpi> afaik artifacts expire after certain amount of time
10:28 < bridge> <zhn> do it japjupjopsti
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On mobile I don't have access to my github tho. I'll do it later
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yea, artifacts expire
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> u need to publish them
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> and we used some custom github actions thing
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning its 6:50
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i keep waking up early
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i missed this chat a bit
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> late for me but idk because I’m actually coding
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> late for me but idc because I’m actually coding
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U in murica?
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or in the ocean? Xd

10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> he is in argentina or whatever
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> only American in the continental sense
10:58 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I'm pretty sure that he's not in asia 😄
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> say that again
10:59 < bridge> <diariesvexar> can't
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Look behind you
11:01 < bridge> <diariesvexar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199292770196660276/image.png?ex=65c2036e&is=65af8e6e&hm=c2fa8743dd47b9f605a2a636d78d80c1718f11e84bdc988b89e9c623c550590f&
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Not here man
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> why
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> you can apply line wrap to a text input pretty easily
11:03 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I added a few feature that need an input with bigger height to have space to edit easier like website share post form
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah man should be pretty ez
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it already has everything u need
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> just need to glue it together
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Some day when using HTML + CSS is not bound to JavaScript anymore, and isn't overcomplicated to embed
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then I give u ur textarea
11:04 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I'll wait until that day then 😄
11:04 < bridge> <diariesvexar> and i have another question about using .gif file on DDNet
11:05 < bridge> <diariesvexar> it's not possible right ?
11:05 < bridge> <timakro> stupid question but if I install the ddnet client on gnome it trabs my cursor and windows key doesn't work to switch apps
11:05 < bridge> <timakro> stupid question but if I install the ddnet client on gnome it traps my cursor and windows key doesn't work to switch apps
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gifs suck for games. Like all video formats
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U are bound to fps
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For an in game TV OK. But not for animations
11:06 < bridge> <diariesvexar> hmm I tried to add intro video for DDNet client but it's a bit hard to play mp4 or any video format
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And your question is, if it's gnome fault?
11:06 < bridge> <diariesvexar> no gif for menu and UI
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Answer is yes
11:06 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Wtf voxel 2 dropped
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see. Well doesn't exist right now
11:07 < bridge> <timakro> wait, so ddnet always traps your cursor on gnome? no way around it?
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That the meta key does not work is a bugntho
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But yes it traps it always
11:08 < bridge> <diariesvexar> check your DM
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it traps the cursor on every OS
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We once had a mode that doesn't. But windows isn't ready for that
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bcs it creates black screen when tabbing out
11:10 < bridge> <timakro> oh i can tab out 🤦‍♂️
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> f1
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> not a real fix tho
11:11 < bridge> <timakro> what does f1 do?
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It releases mouse
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> console gives u os mouse back
11:12 < bridge> <timakro> ah thats great thanks
11:13 < bridge> <timakro> @mpft /top5 works on your race servers
11:13 < bridge> <timakro> should i test creating a new rank as well?
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yes pls
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> meybe we can read but not writr
11:16 < bridge> <timakro> @mpft it works, I didn't change anything ^^
11:16 < bridge> <timakro> maybe it was whatever that attack was
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> is the db on a common port
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe host or isp will close coming db ports as a security concern if its being attacked
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe host or isp will close common db ports as a security concern if its being attacked
11:18 < bridge> <timakro> both race servers on your vps are up now
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> wonder what the issue was
11:19 < bridge> <timakro> all gameservers connect to the same port, i believe the default sql port but not sure
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i see
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog timakro alive
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Always been
11:20 < bridge> <timakro> what funny bridge are you connected to these days, chiller?
11:20 < bridge> <timakro> matrix?
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he is on irc and matrix but he recently joined a call in discord
11:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> o yea weechat and the web thinf
11:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @timakro its irc with a selfwritten web frontend that looks like discord xd
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
11:22 < bridge> <timakro> thats cool :D
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706005333.png
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @timakro how is life?
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are you up to these days?
11:22 < bridge> <timakro> i actually got to run to a lecture now :D
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok mr busy
11:23 < bridge> <timakro> i'm studying in penultimate semester
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> computer science?
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> argentina xd
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> at a gym kek
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> so cheap
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan is timakro hosting servers for u or wat?
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> other way  aorund
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i assume you host and write to his db
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
11:31 < ChillerDragon> i didnt know you are into racing
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> race is epic
11:32 < ChillerDragon> you want us pinged servers in unique land i assume
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i lag so bad xd
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude im literal sherlock holmes
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see right through you
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> we had canada but it was 60-80 ping for me usually
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> still unplayable
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> esp w messed up grenate prediction
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is not even player interaction race is like the best mod for high ping, after city maybe xd
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> some ppl used to it
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> benz plays in can from mx and has for a long time afaik
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but i cant do that
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fudgy is canadian right?
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> he host can
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> sherlock holmes
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see unique is bring your own server network
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> scalable
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i would do for ddnet but i dont think ppl want a usa 28
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would do it for ddnet but i am not allowed :c
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> y not
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't davide do a lot of it
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think risk of me hacking the database or something
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> do u have a bad history
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> actually not i hosted a shit load of servers for others so far all happy c:
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i think deen just doesnt need it
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i ask him every year :D 
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> @timakro how did u connect to usa servers o_O
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> may not be in the masters anymore
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope u were not thinking of can servers when u tested?
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxax can = usa
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As Obama already said
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, we can
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> So i can use nlohmann json and go out of my way to include a somewhat unnecessary api or i use someone else’s parsing code which idk if i should trust
12:03 < bridge> <timakro> Oops that's exactly what happened
12:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i having a hard time compile my source on a old debian machine.
12:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```bash   
12:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>        Updating crates.io index
12:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>        Fetch [==============>                                        ]  28.57%
12:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
12:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> omg lmao
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> timakro racist confirmed
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> waiting on network
12:36 < bridge> <cipy29> It looks like you're compiling rust, just wait another 10 minutes and you might get to 28.58%. Stay strong 👊
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes use FreeBSD for better network axaxaxa
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> No
12:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks like your rust is old and is not using the sparse index yet. Make sure to install the latest and greatest rust with rustup. It’s much faster in this stage. Not the rust from Debian apt
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> Updating package manager package list
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> y shilling debian rust also gonna be modern
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199317374139105320/IMG_4837.png?ex=65c21a58&is=65afa558&hm=92aeec5565b1b0e42ccec9e5a9cf1ea1eb50869ae1fd1102ec3a5f37be1cc188&
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> me when i have no idea what I’m talking about
12:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> True Debian is known for its bleeding edge software repository
12:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Legend has it that you can already install jopstis dd-pg2 in apt. Because apt is so new they also include software that is not written yet
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Yea
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> https://tenor.com/view/smile-smirk-try-not-to-laugh-gif-20026966
12:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Package driven development should be a thing. First you release in apt. Then you start writing the code.
12:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> debian distros ftw (antiX, devuan etc)
12:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yes love ubuntu
13:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ubuntu != debian
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> devuan != debian
13:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> devuan = debian - systemd
13:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> antiX = debian - systemd
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> ubuntu = debian + money
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> what is ur point
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> devuan is debian just as much as ubuntu is
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not wrong to call ubuntu a debian distro
13:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ubun6u has more recent versions than debian
13:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ubuntu has more recent versions than debian
13:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> debian distros are slow to update and use stable packages vs arch which uses the bleeding edge
13:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> imho it is. You could call it debian based (which imo is correct) but it's not debian (the repos are vastly different)
13:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can you please remove those rust code in ddnet src ?
13:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Chiller: kinda like empty (only README.md and LICENCE) git repos which have gpl xD
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> why
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it's the future
13:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's annoying to compile on old machines, take ages to fetch and build, it took me 30 min just for crate.io fetching
13:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I agree that rust is probably the better choice in writing software onwards but in this case rust doesn't do anything
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> not at the moment it doesn't
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> but it will
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> eventually
13:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and the rest is just took 30 s
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> I also kinda agree that if we aren’t using it we should remove it. It’s just a compile time cost for no benefit right now
13:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> we are not in the future
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> we should be able to disable it
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> but not remove it
13:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hey, can you remove that modern c++ as well. can you rewrite everything in C99. thanks
13:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 👴
13:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if you make a flag for it, im cool with it
13:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> anyway
13:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why sometimes my server won't show up on server lists ? but players can join
13:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i put sv_register in my autoexec
13:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sv_register ipv4
13:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and it won't show up on server list
13:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> do you have some kind of firewall?
13:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah nvm that wouldn't make sense
13:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cus the players can join ? 😄
13:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye. I got confused for a moment and I thought the heartbeats to the server were on a different port
13:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> we have a shitty connection here in iran, i think it's the reason
13:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but on some vps's it just working like a charm
13:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> tell me if you know a work around that won't involve contacting your isp
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> u can get a vpn
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> route all traffic thru somewhere more well known
13:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> that's sounds nice
13:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye. I got confused for a moment and I thought the heartbeats to the masterserver were on a different port
13:33 < bridge> <zhn> im still waiting for unique rus approval xd
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> yo ryo

14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can say about duck duck go what you want but it doesnt have the "it works on my google" issue :) privacy gives your reproducible searches for free
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You meant not using cookies
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's still Bing that gets the requests
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet with you if u use ddg the whole time, a ai can identify you by the style you write. When you do the requests and how fast you type following requests
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> google gives more relevant info on such topics tho
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> i can't use ddg whole time
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> still sucks xd
15:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea sounds reasonable
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just need to give you legal advises as your lawyer 😏
16:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi everyone
16:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i make 1 function for anti spam everything
16:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i need a anti spam in my shop, i put sounds on my emotes and need anti spam for the sounds, and many more
16:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't mention the broadcast spams
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Disable chat xd
16:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> another idea
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There should already be a rate limit
16:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> none of these involve chats
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then copy the one from chat for whatever u need
16:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> everything i made so far is spam free, but i made a variable to make it not spaming
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Emotes have spam protection too
16:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> everything i made so far is spam free, but i made a variable for each to make it not spaming
16:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sv_emoticon_ms_delay 0 i make this zero, and my emotes have sounds
16:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's funny, and annoying
16:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's really satisfying to spam a emotes with sounds
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then set it to 1000
16:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's more annoying to wait
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Und off
16:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you mean that one which make you mute ?
16:25 < bridge> <sedonya> How to protect yourself from such bots? (connecting)
16:25 < bridge> <sedonya> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199374345760407622/image.png?ex=65c24f67&is=65afda67&hm=8de7a044651b79dea9e0e83ab6a27dddc714e518edef04406ed51c4158dd9240&
16:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think the only way is either dont pulish server's ip or turn off the server
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can ban known vps & vpn ips
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That should at least make it harder
16:33 < bridge> <yekrm> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1178067041706590280
16:35 < bridge> <yekrm> You can execute a ban cfg and put there all the IP ranges of spoofing connections
16:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i am gonna asume that you tried sv_max_clients_per_ip 2
16:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> then you can do nothing, maybe make a white list ?
16:46 < bridge> <zhn> you are wrong, sadly
16:49 < bridge> <sedonya> bots via proxy..
16:51 < bridge> <yekrm> https://youtu.be/AwibOq49Dd4?feature=shared -> If you put the server in debug you will see the IP's
16:52 < bridge> <sedonya> WoW
16:52 < bridge> <sedonya> I knew about the debug, but I didn’t think there was such a thing in it
16:52 < bridge> <sedonya> thx
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hello guyz
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> someone from ddnet team against me using github.io?
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> perfect
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who is x.github.io expert?
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it take a while until the site is reachable?
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe a few seconds yeah
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Or maybe a bit longer if you are creating it for the first time I guess
17:58 < bridge> <teero777> big bot client
17:58 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199397679457898526/image.png?ex=65c26522&is=65aff022&hm=a56bdf460418009bd1854611992ca471d00cac7de01eafd330bbcc22dbedebca&
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what did i do wrong then:
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet.github.io
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i followed this guide
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://pages.github.com/
17:59 < bridge> <robyt3> It's missing the deployment, so much is obvious
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that a manual step?
18:00 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess yeah, go into Settings > Pages
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like i dont have any rights to do that xd
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> lol, how did you create the repo then, can't see the settings button at all
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i can create repos
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but apparently dont have setting rights then xd
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 give me admin rights for
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet.github.io
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> please
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but as far as i see this is simply an alternate way to create such a page
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i created one without theme
18:04 < bridge> <robyt3> you can customize the deployment, for example you can deploy one repository to a different path on the server
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> seems like only Owners on GitHub can do it, I'm still a normal Member there

18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> There will probably be a discussion whether or not to use x.github.io at all I presume :owo:

18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well, we don't need to use it for anything official
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can host some tools by community for example
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i go swimming now, cya later
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you get admin rights robyte, u can ofc also do it 😏

18:13 < bridge> <robyt3> > Add LIT_MEM define to use more memory for a small deflate speedup
18:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Slightly faster map loading 😏
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath will hate it 😬
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> using more ram
19:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks maybe you just need to make a commit
19:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to trigger actions
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Page is live now, but it doesn't work for me in Firefox and Edge
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Uncaught ReferenceError: SharedArrayBuffer is not defined
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3>     <anonymous> https://ddnet.github.io/DDNet_map.js:1
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
19:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you'd probably need to set some headers to fix this
19:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but u cant set headers on gh pages :santatrollet:
19:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like ddnet.org might be the better place
20:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> blank page on firefox 115 ESR

20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> question is, does .htaccess work? xd
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well if somebody wants to add it to ddnet.org
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the repo is there
20:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, .htaccess doesn't work on any non-apache webserver
20:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> including github pages and nginx
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/josephrocca/clip-image-sorter/blob/main/enable-threads.js
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like this could work
20:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> uh, weird
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can i flush the site?
20:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Should update automatically now
20:53 < bridge> <robyt3> works
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> works
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic gamer moment
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi https://ddnet.github.io/load_map.html
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just for u
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
20:54 < bridge> <robyt3> there's a flashing colored "letterbox" but left and right, how do I go fullscreen?
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its a normal ddnet client
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go out of demo.. but dunno if that works
20:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean fullscreen my browser
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199442296790323210/image.png?ex=65c28eb0&is=65b019b0&hm=bcc25634cd3baf86e3246ebf49c238a6527556d6c8b4285da8f18a2acd02506b&
20:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I can't press F11 anyone when the game captures it
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's what happens if i enable fullscreen
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/e404/htaccess-for-nginx
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> There is teeeechnically a plugin for nginx 😄
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, desktop fullscreen works for me
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it also links an explanation of why this is a bad idea
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, not saying you should use it 😄
20:59 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> thats cool! - curious tho, going freeze doesnt display as freeze, how come, if its basically just a ddnet client
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not latest ddnet
21:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> pistol shots aren't rendering aswell :D
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since sdl is on like sdl3 i also dont have motivation to keep the scripts up to date
21:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but not complaining, it seems to be a big WoP
21:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> cool stuff
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess then newer demos are not downward compatible
21:00 < bridge> <chairn> damn, that's actually pretty fast renderer for maps
21:01 < bridge> <chairn> seems way more fast than the one currently on ddnet.org
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's simply ddnet client
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> compiled to wasm
21:01 < bridge> <chairn> is it possible to have entity mode?
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess so
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> page up
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me on an old demo they work
21:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh this is running on 15.9.1
21:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> makes sense then :D
21:02 < bridge> <chairn> damn, where servers ?
21:02 < bridge> <chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1199444156888662026/image.png?ex=65c2906b&is=65b01b6b&hm=468c3f217f04cf9c3019ebb96e59da2361f0f80fda348d6139481fe5f73e9e56&
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/web_preview
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u want to update xd
21:03 < bridge> <chairn> where sound in demo as well?
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly curl doesnt work
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it compiles, but doesnt work
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe certs missing or smth
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds work for me
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chromium
21:04 < bridge> <chairn> ok, sounds work, maybe other demo was broken
21:04 < bridge> <robyt3> `[serverbrowse_http]: no working serverlist URL found`
21:05 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> so latest demo's wont render correctly, demo's prior to 17.4.1 seem to work just fine, i wonder why that is
21:06 < bridge> <chairn> some change in demo format?
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, @heinrich5991 might be able to tell you
21:06 < bridge> <chairn> it uses ddnet 15.9.1 apparently
21:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug
21:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> yes.
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> could you file an issue, @blaiszephyr?
21:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> to this i assume?
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's ddnet client xd
21:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh wait
21:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :kek:
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah wait
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check whether it renders in latest ddnet, too, if you can
21:08 < bridge> <chairn> where ninja skin for frozen tees?
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Isn't this expected for demos to some degree? Each client gets the messages for its current version when the demo is rendered, but the demo doesn't contain all the backwards compatible snapshots
21:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Isn't this expected for demos to some degree? Each client gets the messages for its current version when the demo is recorded, but the demo doesn't contain all the backwards compatible snapshots
21:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> render's just fine on latest
21:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> thats what i meant when i said it doesnt render correctly, it wont even render freeze state, it just looks like you're in super :D
21:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> thats what i meant when i said it doesnt render correctly, it wont even render freeze state(live freeze), it just looks like you're in super :D
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway if somebody wants to update to latest client the branch above is touching relatively few ddnet code.
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only problem is building all libraries (dependencies) because i didnt checkout any stable version in the scripts, so the lib build scripts need to be updated at least
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't find it worth it for now xd
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i never used it in the past 2 years xD
21:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but a cool thing to play around with nontheless :D
