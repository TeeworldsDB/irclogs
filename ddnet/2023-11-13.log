00:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sharing bot compilations in official ddnet dev channel axaxaxax
00:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ? You mean itâ€™s not symmetrical? Should it be? Symmetric is boring and from what I understood the original isnâ€™t either.
00:59 < bridge> <reitw> chillerbot
00:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No proof
01:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @_voxeldoesart: honestly not sure what your images mean. You gotta use words to explain it. Btw I placed one really ugly hack as Easter egg for you to find in some of the tiles
01:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> >symmetric is boring
01:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> boring =/= visually pleasing
01:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 
01:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> >the original isnt either

01:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Uhm
01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay yea maybe you have a point there :D
01:04 < bridge> <reitw> how many tees do u have ingame lmao
01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go send fix pr mr artist
01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yes
01:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok one second
01:05 < bridge> <reitw> which matrix client do u use on phone ?
01:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Element and FluffyChat
01:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> iOS
01:05 < bridge> <reitw> why both
01:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk
01:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To enjoy all the bugs
01:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok for one im going to steal your bolts because i dont know how to make it myself
01:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat is a bolt

01:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @_voxeldoesart: ?
01:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat is it
01:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1173414583684300830/image.png?ex=6563de7d&is=6551697d&hm=adb9f55f8c216396059a66ffc027a6cee394b4fdc14f440954c3611172046216&
01:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The whole thing is a bolt?
01:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or only the smaller ones inside
01:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Arenâ€™t you the artist? You donâ€™t know how to make those? o.0
01:17 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im not skilled enough to make utter jank
01:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah
01:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Guess Iâ€™m ArtistDragon now then
01:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> More skilled than voxel
01:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Check out my artworks https://www.deviantart.com/chillerdragon
01:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> chiller do you want the tiles or not
01:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://tenor.com/view/squidward-eyes-open-t34gii-gif-23188408
01:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> the fucking what now
01:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> JK itâ€™s not my deviantart profile xd
01:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im fixing chiller's unhooks
01:22 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ok i can sleep
01:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea please if you think you can pixel perfecelize my work please adapt it and pr your improvement:)
01:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> halfway done btw
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice Iâ€™ll sleep now. I will check your pr tomorrow :)
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks for doing it
07:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart tbh the vanilla ones look buggy with those broken edges
07:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Do you think it was intended?
08:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Put me as reviewer by chance
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What broken edges?
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t even see the changes haha
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Sry i meant corners
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The corners of the inner quads
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Top left corner to be precise
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It looks bit cut off
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But to me chillers look more correct
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> trollerdragon
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
09:43 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª opsi didnt see ur message and alr merged
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: we actually have a rule that, if something fixes vanilla stuff we can keep it
09:43 < ChillerDragon> i still do not know what you mean
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok wait
09:44 < ChillerDragon> overall voxels thing is way better checkout my comparison gif
09:44 < ChillerDragon> but yea maybe you are onto some little something
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1173544034036367462/Screenshot_20231113-094434_Chrome.png?ex=6564570d&is=6551e20d&hm=c0e8c7c95345cab3b3fe6c1f12ff31bcb79ea7d1ba8a1071b7bda41ff593706e&
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd say both versions have some stuff better
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok when jopsti pr with best of both worlds
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok so which edge you like better?
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i like your corners more. but your big quad is bit worse than voxels
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it has some weird offset between inner and outer quad
09:47 < ChillerDragon> I like voxels corner more
09:47 < ChillerDragon> his is more correctly matching and id arge it is not a bug
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but why is there a random rounding?
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but why has vanilla this rounding xDD
09:47 < ChillerDragon> you can also see it while tilting those in editor
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> to me that looks completely random tbh
09:47 < ChillerDragon> they are not symmetric
09:47 < ChillerDragon> makes them swag
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah i understand that vanilla has those. but why xD
09:48 < ChillerDragon> you wouldnt understand you are not a artist
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok, so only for swag, i c
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah true
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> my brain only knows symmetry
09:48 < ChillerDragon> symmetry is lazy
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and perfection
09:48 < ChillerDragon> perfection is not best looking
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> german engineering
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜¬
09:48 < ChillerDragon> :D 
09:49 < ChillerDragon> makes it more organic
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but unhook is metal
09:50 < ChillerDragon> you are mental
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's meant to look unorganic
09:51 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1699865516.png
09:51 < ChillerDragon> get one of those in da editor and press the rotate key :D
09:51 < ChillerDragon> its pog
09:52 < ChillerDragon> i dont see how a corner like that happens by accident but im pretty sure there is some genius artwork behind
09:52 < ChillerDragon> who even made the tileset? landil?
09:52 < ChillerDragon> its masterpiece
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> LMAO
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart read all this, i need your art brain to judge. but try to be objective in a sense that you don't look as vanilla to be the best one
09:54 < ChillerDragon> @_voxeldoesart i take all my bolt bullying back you are truely one of the artist. I u fan now
09:56 < ChillerDragon> jopsti thing is it looks good like a dynamic shadow
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah he is really good
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> almost as good as an AI
09:56 < ChillerDragon> creating such a corner is more work than spanning a perfect rectangle
09:56 < ChillerDragon> it was to be placed intentionally
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah dunno. brain  = symmetry
09:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20344300/205356641-7c205d8f-4751-4248-9806-0cd15ed89aa4.png
09:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is a bug
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff
09:57 < ChillerDragon> wat now
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which texture is that
09:57 < ChillerDragon> cloud9
09:58 < ChillerDragon> idk one of the clouds
09:58 < ChillerDragon> i fixed it in my submission dont worry
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok, maybe it was a artist genius moment
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe you broke it
09:58 < ChillerDragon> omg trol
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok i rq now, cya later.always good to talk about art

10:49 < bridge> <teero777> helo
11:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks what are good resources to learn vulkan? :D
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i have 0 idea
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i read https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> especially for the setup code.
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but once i had all this stuff used once, i got a feeling for how vk works.. then i mostly used the vulkan docs indeed
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what 100% helps are validation layers. and always fix the errors it says. because that makes some stuff clearer in your head
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also what is important to note is. Knowing OpenGL 3.3 doesn't really help
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Opengl 4.4+ probably more.
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vulkan is not a global state machine like opengl 3.3
11:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks :owo:
11:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yee.. vulkan aint for grugs :pepeW:
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, stuff like glEnable(BLEND) or smth in vulkan (at least if you don't use dynamic rendering) is really setup code already
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u need to know what your app will use in advance ðŸ˜„
11:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i never know it
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rip
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anyway, it's mostly just tryhard
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u should not give up if you debug a single thing for a whole day
11:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i feel like it will be a fun journey ðŸ˜¬
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it is xd
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i went full tryhard back then xDD
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i stood up, worked on it, went to sleep
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i miss those times ;~;
11:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wanna forget everything and relearn again :justatest:
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd also recommend to use the c headers to learn
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but later switch cpp headers or in rust to ash
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's not fundamental different, but it helps you a bit to make fewer stupid mistakes you make because c sucks to work in xdd. be it ptrs or stuff like that
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imo that helps to make you understand the higher level header files a bit more and get a feeling how vulkan returns error codes etc.
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and also, don't copy paste too much xd
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if you do an own project you are forced to actually understand what you are doing.. that's worth more than just reading code
11:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just want to understand how graphics work :justatest:
11:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all these fancy ahh words
11:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and such
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> graphics work like this:
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u have triangles
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u rasterize triangles
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u have pixels
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u colorize pixels
11:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fair
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what exactly you want to learn
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vulkan removes the driver overhead. it wont make your GPU run faster
11:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I just want to understand ddnet code
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's very important to understand
11:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> In 3 weeks.. i didnt understand much :justatest:
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. for ddnet it's much faster bcs the memory model is MUCH more explicit
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i can control when to flush memory. i can say if i want coherent memory etc.
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but GPU wise vulkan doesn't run any faster. it's really mostly CPU wise
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> see the problem is, reading ddnet vk code is probably not a good idea to learn.
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I can give you a very quick summary what the idea of the backend is:
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - streamed memory is always batched, flushed at once before work is submitted to the GPU
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - in-use memory is always bound to the frames, so cleanup is delayed until the frame gets in use again
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - render threads are just there to collect draw calls. they don't mutate vulkan state
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - there is a memory heap that classifies between buffers, staging buffers (buffers that are used to copy content to images or vertex buffers), textures (which have sub classes, depending on the texture requirements & streamed buffers (per frame filled buffers)
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if you see these concept in the code, u understand what's different compared to opengl backend
12:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Im not reading ddnet code to understand vk code, i wanna take a look at vk to understand ddnet vk code XD
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok, anyway, i'd recommend to not look too much into the setup code. most important is simply to understand that there is no real global state.
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so you will not find something like changing texture wrap mode on fly
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's all done in setup code.. later it's only like an array access
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> pipelines[MY_BLEND_MODE_INDEX][MY_WRAP_MODE_INDEX]
12:10 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> hi sometimes i get this error in the console and server shuts down
12:10 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1173580658187186256/err.png?ex=65647928&is=65520428&hm=7f187d6512adcf220dff9449613e282d386173d9d6765f7ff280354a446a8566&
12:10 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> someone help?
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is that windows?
12:15 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> yes
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1. dump from %appdata%/DDNet/dumps would be nice
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2. is this latest DDNet-Server or custom server?
12:18 < bridge> <teero777> read the src :justatest: :justatest:
12:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fair
12:19 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> i installed it on ddnet.org
12:19 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> and
12:19 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> can i share dump
12:19 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> here?
12:21 < bridge> <teero777> yea.
12:21 < bridge> <teero777> try not to leak ips if you share.
12:21 < bridge> <teero777> yea.
12:21 < bridge> <teero777> try not to leak ips.

12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thanks, if you have a github account you could create an issue on gh repo.
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Else i do it later if i don't forget it
12:25 < bridge> <kahvebardagi.> okay thanks
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i drink coke zero sometimes
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> coke is too sweet
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> also makes u fat
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sweeteners often make u hungry
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i dunno if that helps
17:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whats blake3
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the successor of blake2
17:51 < bridge> <louis> ye but technically then u can just eat healthier food ðŸ˜¹
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> exactly.. sweet drinks are always a problem
17:51 < bridge> <louis> diet coke > coke zero though
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs drinks don't make your body fed
17:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what does blake3 do
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u could say it's basically alternative to sha256
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u ever heard of that
17:52 < bridge> <louis> it is a cryptographic hash function ðŸ¤“
17:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think? ddnet uses it maybe
17:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh ok
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet uses it for file identifying
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. your downloaded map
17:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when replace with blake3
17:54 < bridge> <louis> wasn't there that one time zombietroll used the map scraper to upload a funny map
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats the diff
17:55 < bridge> <louis> idk diet tastes better imo
17:55 < bridge> <louis> better aftertaste
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when we still used CRC instead of sha?
18:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 could I maybe move the https download URL into community json?
18:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that way you don't have to do string concatenation to extract the actual URL
18:42 < bridge> <robyt3> So you specify the full URL for every community object individually? Fine for me, though I don't think the string concatenation is a problem in itself.
18:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, that's what I mean
18:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem I see with not doing it is that every consumer of this JSON has to implement it on its own
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Hm, yeah, I suppose it's better if the json is standalone
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Would also be easier to change URLs in the future then
18:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
18:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only one nightly version with this has shipped so far?
18:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no official releases?
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think we need additional compatibility for those few
18:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> while I'm at it, I'd also remove the `"ranks-key": ""` if it's empty
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to distiguish between empty string and non-existent value
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would that also be okay?
18:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for the amazing PR btw ^^
18:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was a lot of good stuff and I'm only nitpicking here
18:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems fine to use default `""` if it's missing, but you also have to adjust the validation because the entry would otherwise be considered invalid
18:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd consider the empty string a valid key then (no longer treating it special)
18:48 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean differentiate between missing key and empty key? What would the empty key be useful for?
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Right now the community entry is only considered valid if the attribute exists and is of type string, is what I mean with validation
18:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're not going to use it, but I find it weird to special-case the empty string
18:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> theoreticlaly (we're not going to do it), you could use the empty string as the key for the community ranks
18:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, conceptually leaving the key out or using `null` would be cleaner
20:39 < ChillerDragon> any admin up for dms?
20:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> do tiles behind clipping get rendered and then hidden or does the game not bother rendering them at all
20:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they get clipped by the GPU
20:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so they vertices are called
20:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but they fragments are filtered
21:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> jup isnt there a way to fake rotation in a fragment shader
21:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> just realizing
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u either do a rotation or u dont xd
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or what kind of fake rotation does come into your mind
22:29 < bridge> <axel_vestin> aaaaaa

22:30 < bridge> <axel_vestin> whats the issue :pepeW:
22:31 < bridge> <robyt3> `& ` -> ` &` is one clang-format issue, we also capitalize variable names (but not prefixes), so `NameIsTaken` and `OtherImage`
22:32 < bridge> <axel_vestin> yuck
22:32 < bridge> <robyt3> If you use Visual Studio then you can also run Clang-Format directly in there
22:33 < bridge> <axel_vestin> im trying out clion :^)
22:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be possible to use clang-format in CLion, but maybe you need to install/compile clang-format separately
22:35 < bridge> <axel_vestin> Do All Variable Names Really Need To Be Like This?
22:36 < bridge> <robyt3> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development#Code_conventions
22:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Single letter variable can be lower case, e.g. `i`, `x`, `y`
22:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Single letter variables can be lower case, e.g. `i`, `x`, `y`
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> even if it's not the best casing for variables (which is completely subjective) it's still best to have consistent casing schemes for different keywords
22:41 < bridge> <axel_vestin> ive seen worse is ok
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
22:50 < bridge> <axel_vestin> i mean that its very ugly but ive seen worse
22:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you said you can't rotate things inside a fragment shader, right?
22:56 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAIR you can but then there would have to be another stage in the shader for it. Having the images pre-rotated is more efficient
23:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Hm, I guess so.
23:30 < bridge> <robyt3> @axel_vestin You should consider configuring your git user name and email so they are linked with GitHub user, it currently doesn't link your profile on your commits

23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> You can squash all your commits in #7451 and then rewrite the author of the current HEAD commit with `git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>" --no-edit`
