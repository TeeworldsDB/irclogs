08:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Forgot my laptop in italy, so I guess no http masters this year :P
09:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Wait what?  ðŸ˜‚
09:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
09:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll be in turkey for 1-2 months, with no laptop ðŸ˜±
09:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Buy a new one
09:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will if my father is willing to pay the price of my stupidity
09:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A new laptop isn't in my own budget :P
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> No need for a super laptop
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 use ur smartphone, ssh into ddnet and code there
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coding on a phone sounds horrible, never say such things again
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen ppl do it
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on reddit
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh no, I cant ssh to my server on a new laptop
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fuk
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u can get a big device better
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> I did it
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> But pretty hard xd
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its easier if u have a portable keyboard
09:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Especially on a such small screen
09:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Yeah
09:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast I have coffee and food
09:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598047917311262721/JPEG_20190709_090835.jpg
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> muhondo
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Oh nice
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was so planning to code the next 2 hours
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> But
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to find something to code in ddnet
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> How did u forget ur laptot even? xd
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki discord rich presence?
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they dont ship linux libs and the sdk is closed source
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 i woke up late, so I rushed out the gate
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ahha xd
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i could have a reference linux app
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> What do you wanna do with discord rich presence ?
09:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> show ur race time, team and map
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Oh yeah
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we partner with discord we could add "join game" button aswell
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> are you at a airport rn?
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> This would be pretty cool to have
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But no discord gamesdk for linux
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Sure?
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum I'm in another italian city
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hmm
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its a 2 hour round trip
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if I go back for it I miss my flite
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if you scream allahu akbar at the top of your lungs in a crowded area i pay u a new laptop
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So not worth getting detained
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to be studying anyway, better no laptop
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Lmao
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Are u ok @Im 'corneum ? ðŸ˜‚
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stupid math analysis 2 is ridiculously hard
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Analysis :pepeH:
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how far would u go learath
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> In my school everyone hates math analysis
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum I wouldnt go far at all, my father is a softie
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is he with u
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 only thing good about analysis is that they shorten it as MAnal
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 these are all windows lib right
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598050004485275649/unknown.png
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum no, but he is the one thats going to pay for a new laptop
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki dylib is macOS
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> foken shit
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bundle is cocoa iirc also osx
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> .lib is windows
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 ðŸ˜‚
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So stupid that they have libraries at all
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should have used a socket like everyone else
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure the socket is used in the sdk
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its closed source
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll browse reddit for 2 hours
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shit companies
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki hmm could also be using shared memory under the hood
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not doing this if its windows only
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman wouldnt be happy
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :toptri:
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Old discord sdk did have linux support
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they'll stop being dickheads and port the new sdk over aswell
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old sdk was also open source
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a sdk not being open source
09:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is retarded
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the whole platform is closed source
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really dont approve of discord, only reason i use it is peer pressure
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> m2
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets go to irc
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> See one thing irc is horrible at is mobile
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No good irc clients on mobile
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I think it'd be pretty hard to code a battery efficient one
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nimda is not giving me voice
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant chat on ddnet irc
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i think nimda broke
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dont think so
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless u use electron
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nimda has been broken for long
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> has ddnet updated to debian 10?
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the protocol requires you to reply to pings on irc @Ryozuki
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598052616991408128/unknown.png
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> except Brazil failed because the hoster is providing a broken image that fails to boot after upgrading to Debian 10
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really background friendly
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what was broken with the image btw?
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and the hoster just told me that they will not fix it and we should switch to their most expensive "cloud" offering instead
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uhh
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't boot anymore, I can't see anything, even on VNC
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there lot of ppl in brazil sv
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> They claim they see " relocation error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_files.so.2: symbol __libc_readline_unlocked, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference", but I'm not sure where
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What a shitty service
09:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its brazil
09:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not even sure what kind of a VPS this is, maybe something OpenVZ based
09:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does anyone here have a rpi4
09:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> In South Africa I also couldn't reboot, opened a ticket and they literally fixed it in 2 min
09:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I'm thinking of getting one for a media center kinda thing
09:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im also planning on getting one
09:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can choose 1 2 or 4 gb ram
09:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll make the older rpi a magic mirror as soon as I learn how to wood
09:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i just bought a brand new expensive tv and found out it only has 100 Mbit/s ethernet, so no luck streaming high quality content...
09:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wow what a letdown, is it an 2019 model?
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 100 mb in 2019
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 2018, but they still do the same in their 2019 model
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah not having a gigabit port in an 2019 model would be sad
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even in 2018 a non gigabit ethernet port was uncommon
09:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> So now I have to move my router/wifi access point through half the apartment because their wifi antenna is also shitty and that's the only way to get a stable connection
09:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today my upload is slow :troll:
09:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598054038529114112/unknown.png
09:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd return it to be honest with you
09:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually @deen try a chromecast ultra
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm very pleased with mine
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u even watch tv
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> wait
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> fast.com is powered by netflix? xd
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I cast netflix, youtube, twitch and anime to tv :P
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> the trick is that fast.com uses the same servers as netflix so the isp can't throttle netflix without throttling the speed test
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also have spotify permanently on
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u live alone righty
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt watch anime in my tv xd
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> it looks like its broken for me xd
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> it shows 240 Kbps
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I live alone ye
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good internet
09:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> and isn't moving
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> One of the benefits of living alone is you no longer need to be concerned with what others think of what you are watching
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> whereas speedtest.net i have 100 Mbps for both upload and download
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 hi captain obvius
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean took me a while to notice
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 well i dont have to pay my internet
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nor the apartment
09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> â˜º
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well technically I dont pay either my parents do
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast as long as I'm studying
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u will study until 30
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could, but I'd feel bad
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think I'll bother with a masters degree tbh
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm already getting bored of bachelors
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Some companies require Masters though even you'll never use anything you learned there
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
09:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598055485983162377/Srp8OV6HDOM6gpCMe2yEb1Xuh7YwbnC6nJD7VqUZ3CQ.png
09:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
09:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen does it usually matter what kinda masters? Could go for a mba
09:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki RIP
09:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a dumbass asking around our exam question for algorithms and programming in ##C
09:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get to fix our code after the exam and submit the working version
09:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> We usually have requirements like "University degree (Bachelor or Master) in computer science, physics, mathematics, or comparable"
09:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Horrible
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I guess it depends on what you apply to though
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll have to do a masters
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Nah ðŸ˜„
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 they don't send your laptop to turkey by package post?
09:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont even know what I want to work as nowadays
09:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b it's in my house, locked, I dont really know how I could get it posted to me
09:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how did you decide?
09:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Your house in ItalyðŸ˜®
09:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> how did I decide what?
09:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to do gamedev but those people are overworked to death, web/app development is an easy job search but I think I'd get bored in a week
09:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I just pretended we still have a Diplom, which was basically Bachelor + Master, so just kept going
09:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 so go for systems development?
09:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does a systems development person do? What kind of systems are we talking about? :P
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look at this
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598058573695680513/D_A10q1XYAA77kF.png
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I meant as in how did you decide what to do after your degree
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki l m a o, fukin windows
09:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I did a cycling trip and camped close to Walldorf, which reminded me that SAP is headquartered there, so I decided to apply. 2 weeks later I had a job offer ðŸ˜„
09:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds about like what I heard from others
09:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems that these things just happen on their own
09:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and they convinced me that they're doing cool stuff. Modern C++, high performance code, working together closely with Intel etc to try out new hardware and optimize for it, generating code at runtime for the execution engine etc
09:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> lots of fun stuff to get lost in for a few years
09:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not as boring as I imagined initially ðŸ˜„
09:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That actually does sound fun, some kind of c++ jit?
09:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and competent colleagues, I think about half of them have a PhD
09:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I cant even imagine working through a phd
09:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> We have a C++-template based DSL that is embedded into the regular C++ code that we translate into our own LLVM-based language on the customer site
09:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so that we can optimize their queries better
09:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You were doing database stuff right?
09:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, it's the HANA db
09:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never thought about it, but do databases really require such high performance?
09:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Well, our customers already buy dozens of TBs of RAM so they can hold their entire business data in memory, so I guess they want performance
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using ram as storage
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we're an in-memory db, so yeah
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah ram is blazing fast
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think even the best ssds come close
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc not
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Intel has some NVM storage which sits inbetween RAM and SSDs in performance
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a nvme ssd
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> that's something different
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah uses like 8 lanes of pcie
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Talking about optane right?
10:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i see
10:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I guess they renamed it to Optane.
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wait so your are working at SAP @deen ? And its FUN c++ ?! le nice
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I mean C++ is still crazy, but you can use it more reasonably, for example no explicit new/delete, no C strings etc
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No explicit new? How else do you do allocations? Only smart pointers?
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and RAII
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Smart pointers are so cool, very low overhead
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if the code contains new, you can forget the delete
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but if you use RAII or a unique_ptr you can't
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Never really used RAII with anything
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> And we use C++17, but have our custom STL implementation with extra features
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You really do live on the bleeding edge :D
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm barely caught up with C++14
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we even have some experimental features implemented and usable that are planned for C++2a ðŸ˜„
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you also write proposals for the c++ standards commitee?
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, unfortunately we don't have anyone there I think
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I guess since we're not really bound to what the STL does anyway
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess having your own stl is nice
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it closed source?
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, and not really useful outside of our use case
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon e.g. the team masks
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut said it was even easier to support vanilla than ddnet client and i dont thinnk we have to support all old ddnet versions we can tell them to update for betert expierence
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was ofc easier to support vanilla
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do those masks work? are they like these bit masks having one bit for every tee?
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vanilla has no features
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah they are bitmasks per tee and per team
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats why there are max 64 teams
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I see
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how fokkonaut handled those, I'm guessing arrays but that would be a hit to performance
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And a lot of ram usage
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe bitfields
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do we even need more than 64 teams? I dont think so
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well one team per tee is what we need so every tee can have a team
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fro what? for solo?
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the very least half max clients so people can dummy
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im fine with 128 slots
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and 64 teams
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still need larger bitfields anyway
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for what cases?
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we use two masks?
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is also a mask per tee in teams
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Each team has a mask that indicates which tees are in said team
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt a long long 128 or something like that
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not guaranteed to be
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe a lib?
12:02 <@deen> wait, you're adding 128 players?
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thinking about it
12:02 <@deen> Why not 256?
12:02 <@deen> :D
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe 128 is easier xd
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a lib? Dont need a lib c++ has bitfields
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no for 128
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah might aswell go for 256 while at it
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i remember sqlite had some own datatypes
12:03 <@deen> gcc and clang provide __int128_t
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but is that portable enough for our taste? Dont think we use compiler specifics anywhere
12:03 <@deen> If we're just using them as a bitfield don't really need it
12:03 <@deen> can just use an array of uint64_ts
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but makes the indexing weird
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Accessing it directly is undefined behaviour as you arent allowed to shift > CHAR_BIT * sizeof(type)
12:05 <@deen> There is a 128players branch already btw: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits/128players
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Accessing as a big int I mean
12:05 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c5a191cfeb1cce72bf0b8f411bb8dfbcb0fcdac7 and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/919066e89f94cd8450caf6ce09c179d35650fb75
12:06 <@deen> looks like I didn't do that much :D
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The scoreboard prolly becomes a mess with more then 64
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need my glasses to read 64 at native resolution :P
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxd
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean who bothers to read all names in 128 servers anayways maybe set a max of 64
12:09 <@deen> I'm not sure if you can get away with staying single-threaded
12:09 <@deen> 64 players already puts some CPUs above 50%, both client and server
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Client can just clip a little, should help with the performance
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at this point just do unlimited player numbers
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bit masks aren't really used IIRC
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> For server, yeah itd be tough for our weak servers
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add some "policies" or whatever to call them instead
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. NOT_CLIENT(id), TEAM(nr), EVERYONE
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unlimited players would be a lot of work with hard to predict performance
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lots of arrays of size MAX_CLIENT to change to vectors
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would mean adding a whole lot of stl code into the codebase
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's more performant than arrays, probably
12:13 <@deen> feel free to add stl code
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. we're wasting a shitton of memory in the server browser because we pretend every server has 64 clients
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I highly doubt that the vectors are more performant then arrays
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> More memory efficient sure
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> At best they can match arrays in performance
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can be better because they know how large they are and we don't need to allocate so much memory
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, not a lot by todays standards, but roughly 25MB are wasted in the server browser because we use arrays and not vector
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or a heap)
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said, they are surely better in memory footprint
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and thus better in performance, if stuff fits better together ðŸ˜‰
12:17 <@deen> Learath2: but then you end up caching lots of useless memory and that hurts performance
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also maybe O(1) insertions depending on implementation
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 hmm I wouldnt really call a lower memory footprint better performance
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see deen's message
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm really skeptical that the bad cache performance is that significant, with these things you generally never know until you try
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you were the one who called out vectors having bad performance ðŸ˜›
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (i.e. you were starting the cycle count competition)
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didnt say they had bad performance, I said I doubt they perform better then arrays
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. I didnt state anything with any certainty, if I had evidence I'd call them out, as I dont I just state my hypothesis
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh okay, sorry ^^
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I base it on the fact that arrays are just blocks of memory we access directly while vectors are bound to have some stl overhead
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stl has little (no?) overhead over malloc
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk lunch
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can at the very least imagine an extra comparison to check bounds of a vector
12:23 <@deen> use [] instead of at() and you get no bounds check
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are comparing cycles that is
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh great, I got off at the wrong station
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha #dev too interesting
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hate the stupid metro in milan skipping stops when it feels like it
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean they do announce it in italian, but I dont speak much italian let alone conductor italian
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll start looking at laptops
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sent that message like hours ago
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks mobile discord
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the laptop one?
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you mean discord messed up ther order of messages? or am i not getting the context here? xd
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord didnt just mess up the order, i guess it had some exponential backoff, so it completely forgot about that message
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> XD
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im late
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++20 best
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spaceship operator
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <=>
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spaceship operator is sth i've been looking for for a long time
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it my botclient or your new sys that make my client lighttheme all the time @Learath2 ? :c
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea wym
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL there is nfc in passports
14:11 <@deen> you can put your passport in the microwave and turn it on for a few seconds. Then you get to act suprised at the airport when they wonder why it's not scanning anymore and instead you get a 2 hour questionning for free :)
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will buy the new .dev domain to be cool
14:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The machine readable stripe still would scan deen
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But i guess itd be a redflag that the chip is fucked with no visible cracks
14:50 <@deen> This is the story I was referring to btw: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/14/germans-are-so-scared-of-surveillance-they-microwave-their-id-cards/
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This will be very very offtopic
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But wtf is wrong with european people? Why cant they use toilets properly?
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ur mixing something up with india
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seriously havent seen a single clean public bathroom in europe
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah wait they dotn have any toilets
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean still better then turkey, but as the peak of civilization they should know better
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think europe is the peak civilisation
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 you are in italy right
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i went to rome, i found the city to be really really dirty
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and so i hoped i came back to barcelona all days
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki rn ye, but ive been all around eu
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> look at korea and japan.   arent japans toilets knows for being extravagant
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> look at korea and japan.   arent japans toilets known for being extravagant
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japans shittiest toilet was better then the toilet at my house
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> japan toilet has a stream of water going upwards ur ass
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to clean it
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats just a bidet
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nono
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a toilet
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trust me
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> have u been in France
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Korea too, fuckin train station toilet so clean you could sleep on it
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk im not really far into the toilet lore
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Im 'corneum they got all sort of tech
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598148714611343364/japan_toilet.png
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in their toilet
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> this is urs
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum asian countries use a toilet+bidet combination
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/598148787172671521/11.png
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they clean ur ass
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lmao
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> do they make you gay and want to watch anime?
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> in my life i encoutered 2 fully shat on, like absoulutely destroyed toilets. but i think the pictures are nsfw
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Havent experienced such side effects
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In highschool there was a guy that shat on the floor for a week straight
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We never found out who it was
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it looked lik ethe person couldnt hold it any longer and just opened the door and shat in the rough direction of the toilet
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that sounds like the guy who didi it posted it on 4chan later as a greentext learath xd
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its the only interesting story i have from highschool thatd be worthy of greentexting
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nothing like that happened at our school.   one teacher got crazy and it was rumored she went into a mental hospital that the director came into every class and said it wasnt so.    still seems kinda fishy to me
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nothing like that happened at our school.   one teacher got crazy and it was rumored she went into a mental hospital so the director came into every class and said it wasnt so.    still seems kinda fishy to me
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> typical philosopher teacher
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had teachers smoking with kids on lunch break
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what age
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very illegal to smoke on school premises
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> bcs thats normal at my school too
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but were all 18+
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Highschoolers obv
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not 18+
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ok
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its hot as shit and they are making us wait in a bus with no ac...
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hate this airport but it costs 70â‚¬ extra to fly out of the other one
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> take off your shirt sexy
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ðŸ˜—
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Inb4 they deny my boarding coz no shirt
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> are male nipples illegal?
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Female nipples arent illegal either
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Being topless is inappropriate wear for a plane
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> just write somethign a NPC would say on your chest and if you get kicked off the airplane the media is on your side so you can fly for free and the airport director gets hanged publicly
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides the airline reserves the right to deny you boarding for any reason as long as they refund you
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym by NPC
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast in eu
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sjw?
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> dont u know the npc meme
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqqwTgk8ri0
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> orange man bad means china bad?
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no thats just a thing a NPC would say
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for example
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird meme
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get it
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> murican politics
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then i have sad news
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ur a npc
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Trump is orange
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because of all the artificial tan
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not into murican politics*
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just know that trump doesnt know what a dog is
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/01/does-donald-trump-know-what-a-dog-is-a-twitter-inv.html
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aaand I get the old ladies next to me
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They'll talk all the way to istanbul :(
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> All around meh day
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> just sleep
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> like drink 20 coffees less an hour and youre getting tired
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have too much coffee in my blood to sleep rn :/
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> take a sleeping pill
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish, they dont give em otc in italy
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need a prescription
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or use your chloroform for yourself this time xd
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shhh dont tell everyone
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that knocking someone out with chloroform is ridiculously uneffective?
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially through chloroform vapours from the lung
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh tell me more while i sign up on the fbi whistleblower website
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd take 5-6 minutes to knock someone out
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'd have a better chance with hypoxia if you are strong enough
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why is it hard to get sleeping pills. or why are they dangerous
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are apparently addictive
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> huh
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently they can cause the brain to stop regulating the sleep cycle properly and start relying on the drug
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (More insomnia, more drugs, repeat)
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> arent there dealers on the airport
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What kinda moron would deal drugs near an airport?
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its chock full of LEOs
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> who would buy drugs on an airport
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye that was dumb
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of ppl
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> xd
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> no one would
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who wouldnt be stoned on the airplane 10 hours
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe i meixed it up with train stations
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coffee shop
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think if there ever was dealers on airports it stopped after 9/11
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what I did is, I only added serverside support for 256p (even 512 and so on works, but gets laggy at about 300 if i remember correct). I have 64 teams only atm and what made this whole thing so complicated for me was that I wanted to have normal IDs to send to the client if there are <= 64 players. so the fakesnap stuff gets activated for ddnet clients whenever the clie <message clipped>
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can make a pul request to support this, client support can come later
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then, old ddnet clients (all under version x) will get this, and new clients not, because they obviously support 256
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> One thing is ofc the teams, but we could disable teams on 256p servers _for now_, and only make some server 256. Then we can play Stronghold or some other maps on it
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> That is a good idea
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> An old lady told me about the energy in the universe
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What do you mean
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>

19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> CLIENT CRASH
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ALERT
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i connected my dummy (i wanted) on stronghold 3 and my client crashed
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> was far
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> luckily timeout protection is on
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut i added 256 player support server side to my fng2 server, and i can tell you, you are missing quite a few things, e.g. the eventhandler has a flag that is limited to 64players, bcs of 64 bit, so you need a datatype that handles 256bit
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Which would that be?
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u need to create an own
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 256 bit doesnt exist in cpp standard
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok then I will probably have no clue xd
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can also change the whole implementation, away from the flags
21:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hope its clear that 256 also uses much more CPU server side and client side, but if u only want it for ur own business ok ;D
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Go up in this channel, it is discussed
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For the DDNet servers
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen could you as a hotfix disable teams on the tourney servers? So we have at least 64 slots. And the teamers can play on all the other servers
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you should remove your dummy if you care about this
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> huh?
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> your dummy is blocking 1 slot?
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my dummy is in t0
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nd activly playing
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but blocking a slot for someone
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> please dont troll
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> chiller always plays with dummy
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> Iâ€™m serious
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if you care so much about blocked slots, then let someone have your dummyâ€™s slot
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> true
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to maximise the team size i am playing with
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and most people want that
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> a real player can take over
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i understand what you mean
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i can understand that it can be seen as unfair that i as one human block 2 slots
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but that dummy is still worth more than a team player who could also play in his team on another server instead
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> what if its not a team player?
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> and itâ€™s still selfish to block a slot with a dummy while complaining about teams blocking slots
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it is selfish
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but another topic
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would prefer 32 active players and 32 dummys in team 0 over 50 players in team 0 and 10 players in team
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> this isn't logical
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why?
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 32 active players over 50 active players?
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> this is dumb
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is about playing with the biggest amount of tees possible
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah but no
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you are not playing with 32 useless tees
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you are never playing with so many tees anyways
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dummys arent useless lol
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> they are useless as long as u play with ur main
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> with other tees
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> there will never be 63 tees around you
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we all play together tho @jao
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in different groups
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but if you dont kill you see most of the groups over time
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ye but not together really
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if its less groups you spend more time alone
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Agreed disable dummy on maps like stronghold, back in time etc.
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Those people are causing the stupids fails and then claim it wasn't their fault.
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you can't disable dummies
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut mh i'd like to see some serious benchmarks tho(frame consitency etc.), 256 is much more, weaker pcs will get to their limit, but qoute me where someone said 256 is no problem, i can't find it^^
