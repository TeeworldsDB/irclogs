05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it is already 3 for both
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and checkbox isnt checked
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> its 3 for both for me and the checkbox is checked
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably because it doesnt affect the checkbox
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Does anyone know where there is a city mod (that works in new versions)?
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i set gfx_opengl_minor 0 and it became unchecked

11:13 <+ChillerDragon> Yo @deen i spend my morning crashing gnome and my conclusion is that cl_shownotification 1 + latest gnome crashes since https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/3244eba39d30af42d2f9002ffe21c55cf6ae0054
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> so revert this or blame gnome i guess xd
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: So disabling borderless fixes it?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> didnt test yet but i highly assume it will test after lunch
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds like a gnome bug tbh, did you report it there?
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> not yet
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> ill try to debug gnome later
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> ok fullscreen + non borderless still crashes
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :tee_thinking:
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> ``m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter`` is NULL at all times on the ddnet bridge servers but not on actual 0.7 servers :/
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> why is that?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Find where it‚Äôs set and figure it out I guess. I could be forgetting an object
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Is there any easy way to make request to database from client
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I want to download stats
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Points (for exact player) / Maps (all) / Maps (finished by player)
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Includes map's server and stars
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> And finishes amount
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://info.ddnet.tw/info?name=deen has the last, the other info no
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I want to try make a "Profile" tab in the client
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like https://ddnet.tw/players/deen ?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> So you don't need to use site for that and can see what maps are recommended to you now
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen yeah, almost
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> + recommended maps (filter unfinished by points + finishes)
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Personally I think website is better suited for that than inside of client. Maybe others disagree
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôd agree but we might be thinking too much like developers not enough like players
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If something like above were to be implemented I‚Äôd suggest we expose the information in json form from the website. We already query the db for the information, no need to put more strain on it for information we already have
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if only I knew css and html, then I could make something for web version xD
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> because it's not really comfortable to use
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è I think it‚Äôd be unlikely we‚Äôd want a profile page in the client, atleast until there are accounts imho
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there will never be accounts
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> you'll stand for that)
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> basic css and html is not too hard
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> anyway implemeting requests for maps and points are necessary
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i rly dont understand tw networking btw how is ur dissector doing?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> because it will be needed for showing player's points in game
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and that's useful for lots of features
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon it can do the low level parts of 0.6 for now
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> omg 0.6
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> but nice 
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had 0.7 working too but trying to fix some other thing I broke it
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> meh
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> im rly waiting for this
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I noticed I really don‚Äôt have time to be goofing around with teeworlds stuff this year
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> wow
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> omg 
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> what could matter more than tw?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, idk actually graduating from uni and getting a job so I‚Äôm not a burden to the community?
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> ur not a burden to the tw community
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> we value ur efforts
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That‚Äôs the only community that I have a net positive effect on üòõ
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> and if ur uni or job does not value ur tw contributions fuck them
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> make tw ur job then :)
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Send 2k‚Ç¨ a month and I will
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> add paid skins to ddnet and community will send the money to u
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> so its a temporary uni thing or when will u be active in tw again?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I clear this semester and/or feel confident for the next semester I'l be here more often
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently I only take a look at night if I'm not tired
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> get some sleep mate
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> i wish i could donate some time
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> i have so much time
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sleep exactly 8 hours, I set up my day that way
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could study for me and I could do tw
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> i suck at study tho
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> also how can i study for u
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> doing tw for u would make more sense
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only there was a way, I hate studying...
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> ask musk
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> crack some brain chip into ur head
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> doritolink
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> wait is that even funny
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> still did not get the chip vs fries thing straight
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, teabreak over. Back to Mathematical Analysis II
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> oof
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> i even red the extensive docs on snaps and still dont get where the issue is
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c08acbe115fc9e88d1ab8ea39a47651264a08ba9/src/engine/docs/snapshots.txt
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are you looking for?
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> why ur bridge server nulls my client local char
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_pLocalCharacter is populated by the gameclient, not the snapshot code
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FIgure out where it's being set
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> but it says something baut snap
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It finds it in the snap
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> ye tjhought so
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cmon it's set on a single line in the entire client
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon, I can't debug it for you but I imagine it'd be something about SpectateInfo
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 3 reasons for my theory, 1) I remember a PR about it 2) I vaguely remember looking at SpectateInfo and saying "I'll figure it out later" but it just worked so I never did 3) I see a check into specinfo right before the single set to `m_pLocalCharacter`
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, tea break actually done now, that should be enough for you to go on
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> ill just put somne dbg_msg everywhere xd
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> seems like m_Active is false
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> i dont see where the server sets m_Active :/
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> > is there a way for see the time in minutes and not in hours?
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @Kenzoo .
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> auto updater broken?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just says "15.1.3 is out"
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I borked the website version and shipped it without auto updater
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> reep
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 15.1.3 has it fixed though, so once you have that it should work again, until I break it in a new way üòÑ
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it enough to just replace the executable
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gamecore changes
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Smells like map breaks
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> what about turning off teams on the multimap server since its kinda full and non t0 players can play sinngleplayer
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no cus then u cant /team before sstart to avoid blockers
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> my new map can't upload on trashmap
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768172875320393778/164d1c422dcfd0f66ee59b3d7dcff503.png
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> your chat containers looks bad now omg...

20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Why
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> make chat like in 0.7
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ez solution
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> big f4
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> u
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> how to fix map ?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> someone send me a city mod
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Spyry ask here:
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> http://discord.gg/NUfhgTe
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <√ëAM> https://discord.gg/gcJCWCY
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è are we on differrent versions or smth, bisides that they always looked bad, mine are much rounder, than on ur image
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è are we on differrent versions or smth, besides that they always looked bad, mine are much rounder, than on ur image
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @murpi wouldn't i be banned from it if i asked that?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> idk, not familiar with the server
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> but anything city related you should be able to ask there no?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @murpi I wanted a mod for a server, but I don't think on the internet, the ones that have are very old
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Jupstar ‚ú™ that was on version I just merge from ddnet-master with your pull
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> are there any official hashes of the client for mac os?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> has anyone managed to compile uTown?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ the only thing that annoys me a bit about the new chat is that it has more spacing between the lines. but maybe that's something I can get used to, not sure yet
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> will be it fixed ?

22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen turn off tees and background?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ but then it looks worse üòÑ
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i dont get ur problem xD, you mean more space compared to what?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I want my cake and eat it too. Show background, tees, but same spacing
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can play around with the values in chat.h, if u want to try out some things, but probably a smaller font size is too small üòÑ
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, maybe just my opinion and it might look overloaded
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is chat changes in steam beta?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in nightly tomorrow
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> once per day
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> MESSAGE_PADDING_Y = 0

23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but no more roundings of course
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen i like it more, but i also hate these round background xD
