14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> make an `/afk` command, so you can go afk whenever you want so team0 sees it
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ppl would bind that to wasd just to troll others
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling there is a bug in the updater
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `int CUpdaterFetchTask::OnCompletion(int State)` Couldn't it happen that the "last file" isn't actually the last to finish downloading? (e.g. it is a very small file)
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought you only ever download one file?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh there is m_FileJobs
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so might be right but not sure
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it used to be like that because I only ever had a single worker in the worker pool for `CUpdater`
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that we share the worker pool of the engine, I don't think that's necessarily the case actually
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, that's not good. wasn't aware of that
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why m_aStatus doesn't flicker though
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> > ppl would bind that to wasd just to troll others
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @murpi just make cooldown then
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> We already have a reliable system for afk's
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> So how could I mention that I'm afk right now, so nearby team will not fail relaying on me
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you tell me, how does a person tell nearby people that you're afk?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> or tell me what does /afk do
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> or tell me what /afk does
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> right now with the current system in place, if youre are not moving for specific period of time you gain the the Zzz emote which tells people you're currently unavailable
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and it works pretty well
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the abuse with doing /afk anyway? You can already spam emotes
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People thinking you are afk when you aren't doesn't give you any advantages either
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> spamming is still different
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they always popup again
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> tune player_collision 0 buggen on test server, normal tile bugged on public server üòÑ i think we need to fix this
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> tune player_collision 0 bugget on test server, normal tile bugged on public server üòÑ i think we need to fix this
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> tune player_collision 0 bugged on test server, normal tile bugged on public server üòÑ i think we need to fix this
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can regulate the "afk" emote however we want
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it's not about the advantages
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I personally hate when people bind emotes to their w a s d keys, it's annoying
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's much better if red small "afk" text will popup over nickname when someone is afk
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so you can tell he's unavailable right now
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They can already bind normal emotes there
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and you can not touch him if it's dangerouss
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and you can not touch him if it's dangerous
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> tune player_collision 0 bugged on test server, normal tile bugged all the time üòÑ i think we need to fix this
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and you will not touch him if it's dangerous
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well just rate limit the /afk command to 1min
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its fine xd
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 min is waaay waaay above even the old emote delay we had
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> btw can you remake afk system to show text instead of emote?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oof
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but why would u spam /afk more than once per minute xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thats even worse
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I think it's not that hard
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @C√∏ke can you show me what's wrong with it?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g I'm afk somewhere, someone highlights me, I hear it by chance, I get back to my computer, type something out, I leave again
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then 20seconds
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Text for afk is very meh
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> k, emote is fine, just make me that command already
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do you need the delay is confusing to me. If there should be any delay it should be exactly `g_Config.m_SvEmoticonDelay` seconds
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs afk Zzzz stays
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è lol, make it yourself. We aren't slaved
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> slaves*
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt go away after 2 seconds
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, you are worried about people moving around with the zzz. Why not just say that at the start? üòõ
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :kek:
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well trolls will just fake afk or smth
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fail team, say thjey were afk
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about you can only go afk if you are completely still
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> just keep the current system, it works well
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> something like this
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > Ah, you are worried about people moving around with the zzz. Why not just say that at the start? 
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea, it also stands out visually, since its positioned differently
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi it doesn't work for dummies, it doesn't work for going afk real quick
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @murpi you don't need to remove the current
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it's only really important on maps with a shit ton of hh
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't show up if you alt tab
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it's only really important on maps with a shit ton of hh parts
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont alt tab
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mod+1-9
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux rise up
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very nice contribution to the discussion
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *1-0
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> learath vs ryo, always instant popcorn
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: Can you think of any pitfalls with a static member integer?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (in a multi threaded environment)
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thread_local is the thread storage
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't need a thread_local
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need a static member
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> static is not thread safe
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 it doesn't work for dummies?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> operations with variables are not atomic
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly need to learn more multithreading
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly interesting stuff but complicatedf sometimes
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually static is rarely nice to use
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only tw spams it everywhere xD
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, so I need to synchronize around it like with any other shared piece of memory
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> an alternative to the /afk thing is to just /spec or /pause if u have to go
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i first found out about channel synchronization in golang, it even has syntactic sugar for it
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or make it std::atomic
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> since most ppl dont use sleepy eyes when playing and /pause gives u sleepy eyes then ppl know u arent paying attention
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, I managed to turn the idea around so I only need to access it in one thread
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis yeah that's the best workaround available right now
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm really using so much willpower not to use fallthrough in a switch case
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/fallthrough
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heinrich doesn't like them üòõ
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> balance out the fallthrough with a `goto end`
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: `std::vector<std::atomic<bool>>` or `std::vector<bool>` and a lock?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `std::vector<bool>` is specialized so it takes less space
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you might have to lock less often if you touch multiple values
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the first will most likely be faster
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what u working on?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atomic bools on x86 are special
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finishing up the data integrity thing, but it required the updater, so I'm also cleaning up the updater and getting it ready to do "partial" updates
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the main thread I loop through them and only read them all. On the worker threads I only ever touch one bool (the one assigned to the thread)
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess I'll do the first one
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like 695 atomics is too large in the worst case
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its just for the updater
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it probs doesnt matter too much anyway
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, in this case it really doesn't, was more of an academic inquiry üòÑ
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 700 bytes for the updater doesn't sound bad
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you know how I could test the updater?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Set it to another update server if you really need to
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what I usually did was set a lower version
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and use the normal update path from that version
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there a reason you didn't include the ability to cancel `IJob`s?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess setting a lower version should work, thanks
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 best trick is to get lower version and call it DDNet_
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it wont get overwritten xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Vasten100 Thoughts about this? ^
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if we should try `SetThreadAffinityMask`
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> under windows
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the code for queryperformancecounter says it returned times from the past
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or maybe use std::chrono or smth
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44020619/queryperformancecounter-on-multi-core-processor-under-windows-10-behaves-erratic
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and this says we should set that mask
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen imo that would be cool but u should also be able to do a normal jump off of someones head if u hold jump before landing on them
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis that works actually with my change, i probably worded it wrong
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL you can't have a vector of atomics easily
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well since its the updater the performance isnt critical anyway
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its also in a different thread anyway isnt it
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL a friend declaration doesn't constitute a forward declaration
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why can't you have a vector of atomics?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 how would you cancel generic IJobs?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs no copy constructor
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but probs makes sense
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you need a copy constructor for things in a vec?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vasten100> > @Vasten100 Thoughts about this? ^
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vasten100> @deen yess please
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the vector can increase
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 hm, I was only thinking pending ones
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that would work
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no specific reason there
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One issue remains, wtf do I do with progress
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> progress?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With there being more than one engine workers doing the jobs, it's possible that two downloads happen simultaneously
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I first made the updater there was a single worker dedicated to the updater, so only one file could be downloaded at a time
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (so the progress was shown for the only file downloading)
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 found gold
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764139345249697812/p8p3tg3vo2s51.png
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 can we go back to only having 1 download?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After I rewrote the entire  thing to accomodate for multiple downloads happening?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure we can, but not today. I'll go bake cookies instead and pick it back up tomorrow then üòÑ
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki A modern day Flowers of Algernon üòÑ
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for*
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ok, then just show total progress for number of files and not for each file I guess
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÄ
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I have an idea
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess there is no harm in CUpdater having it's own job pool, is there?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, no way to change the number of workers in a pool
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why must life be so full of pain and suffering?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't htink having more job pools is the sane thing to do
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there any harm in multiple files being downloaded at the same time?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> except the progress bar being broken? üòÑ
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make multiple progress bar
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enter the matrix
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, except that üôÉ
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> none that I can think of
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm yeah, could show all files and a progress bar for each, but needs much more space
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Much more space and would look ugly imo
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> progress bar for single files is useless anyway
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would need one progress bar for all files
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we don't know how large the files will be
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> current progress might be interesting
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not until we start to download a file
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'll get it to download one file at a time again
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not interesting to the user that we have 4KB/4KB for the new skin file
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what might be interesting is the current download rate and maaybe the current file
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but total download amount would ofc be better)
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we can't know the total download amount, barring having a script on the server report it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I realize
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that does not stop me from realizing that current file amount is pretty much useless to the user though
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I guess % of files and download speed are good enough
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen do you use the update diff tool?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can I update it to include file sizes so we can show a total?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, I use it, but I had to change it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check the version in ddnet-scripts (or on server)
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You'll need to calculate the size for each platform, but I guess
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> each file should be enough, no?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the client knows which files it needs
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as long as you add each binary, yes
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that works
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you propose we get the sizes? An extra file with all of them?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering if there isn't some commonly used open source autoupdater solution that lives as an outside process.
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could take a look at TUF, maybe they have sth like that
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There probably is, but can we please not increase the scope further?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > @louis that works actually with my change, i probably worded it wrong
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen  you sure? seems like it only double jumps
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, you're right, because it doesn't count as grounded
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I'm wondering if there isn't some commonly used open source autoupdater solution that lives as an outside process.
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes, its called pacman :monkalaugh:
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Sure, sorry üòÑ
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen can you point me to an example JSON again?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://update5.ddnet.tw/update.json
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got it, sry
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you prefer, an extra array sizes or a new version with files as json objects?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://update6.ddnet.tw/update.json
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> files as json objects?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {"name":"DDNet", "size":1234}
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An extra array with the sizes would be better imho. This way I need to keep track of the latest size for something I'm downloading
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What would be even better is if you could PR this feature yourself :/ I really need to finish this and take a break from all the ddnet stuff so I can study
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Preferably before it's too late to study this time
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k, then just show file no and current speed I guess?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I'll show total percentage and current speed
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon @ChillerDragon are u online?=
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be trivial to fetch the total size and show current total/overall total later
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> ye @Jupstar ‚ú™
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just read github
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll just cherry pick @ChillerDragon , bcs i only need ur first commit
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> sounds complicated
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> why not base on my branch and merge in there?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u have game.png 2 times, and the second commit isnt needed
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> well if u have a plan that does not complicate future merging then go for it
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u'll still be the author of the commit üòÑ
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> oh thats nice
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> ima collecting these contributions
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> btw guys where is the code that serves the update.json ?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/update/diff_update.py
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> so fast thanks :)
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you remember why you clamped the percentage returned by the updater?
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> so @Jupstar ‚ú™ do  have to resolve conflicts or do u cherry pick me and then we close my pr? (btw does the ping w spaces work?)
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> anyone else raging on github for adding a cookie note?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use your ad blocker
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> wait should ublock catch it?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can easily block it yourself, or alternatively, there's a filter list for you
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like work
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lol no
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> also i have so many browsers im to lazy to install adblocker everywhere
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its time to switch to another git provider
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like this kind of lazy
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> need to change quite a bit of stuff
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll close ur pr, once u happy with mine ;D
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> k
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, full tutorial, ChillerDragon
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see the popup
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> click the pipette
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> click on the popup so you get the whole popup
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> devtools pipette or what?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ublock
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> hm seems like ublock is not in my private firefox?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then lick on the #.hx_cookie-banner--show‚Ä¶
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> how do i get the cookie banner back
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you disable ublock while private surfing?
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> idk 
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check you addon settings
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the default
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ublock origin please, not ublock
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you shouldn't
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> yes ofc origin
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, ublock origin, obviously, sorry
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> seems modifying version.h doesn't recompile quite enough, might be a cmake issue somewhere there
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you managed to follow my instrucitons?
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> seems like
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> probably should sync my ublock settings 
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> where are they even stored?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://adnauseam.io/
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now you can do the same on other websites with more elements that annoy you
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't block the cookie banner

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: there's even a filter list built into ublock origin that blocks cookie notices specifically
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it also supports the github one afaics
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> nice where to buy it

18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this a known issue on linux?
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> wow so nice @heinrich5991
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> yay 1 out of my 100 browsers is cookie banner free hurray
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> its kinda cool but i actually prefer staying away from sites that do something like that
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah never knew there was a feature like that
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> there is a updater on linux?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I wonder if this breaks any websites though which require the cookie consent to work
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> i guess it depends
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you want to block the cookie consent? It's a good thing you know
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> its annoying i dont want to read it
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> also popups make me nervous
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the US had it right since the beginning, people don't give 3 shits about privacy üòõ
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Did GDPR cause those?
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> was around that time 
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> how to update ddnet client on linux @Learath2?
18:13 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon nobo the updater is ur pkg manager
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> ye ikr
18:13 <+Ryozuki> ah i need to theme weechat with dracula theme too
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> but im just curious where the button is
18:13 <+Ryozuki> i have some ugly dark bars
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> so do i lol
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you compile with `-DAUTOUPDATE=ON` you'll get a version with the updater
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> also in tmux
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> something fucked up my colors latley
18:14 <+Ryozuki> oh true
18:14 <+Ryozuki> u cant see offtopic in discord
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> oh

18:14 <+ChillerDragon> :p
18:14 <+Ryozuki> what website u want
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> ryozuki.xyz
18:15 <+Ryozuki> k
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> i made a issue on a github repo yesterday but it was my arch update lmao @Learath2 xd
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 the thing about the cookie consent is that ignoring it *should* decline everything
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> but decline everything could result in not being allowed or able to use the site
18:16 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon <https://ryozuki.xyz/downloads/desktop.png>
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> he actually did it lol
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> thanks tho
18:16 <+Ryozuki> why wouldnt i
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> NOT SECURE
18:16 <+Ryozuki> gotta find a use for my web
18:16 <+Ryozuki> not secure?
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> ur tls broke
18:16 <+Ryozuki> its secure for me
18:16 <+Ryozuki> idk whats wrong

18:17 <+ChillerDragon> 404
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: It's probably the same exact arch update, did someone push out a fix?
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> rebooting the machine did the job for me
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> i thought ur on macos? xd
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm back in italy, with my nice computer
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well nicer anyway
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> what wm u use?
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> when fix @Ryozuki
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga it probably does? I doubt it would be legal for them to use any cookies before you accept them
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: bspwm
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> ur so dependent on discord u cant even post pictures xd
18:19 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon can u see the website?
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> nah its 404
18:19 <+Ryozuki> i use i3-gaps
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> ik
18:19 <+Ryozuki> 404???
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602260310.png
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki: learn2nginx nobo
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well many sites still dont really give you the option to decline cookies
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:20 <+Ryozuki> my access log tells me its 301 you
18:20 <+Ryozuki> or someone with mac
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> thats one of the reasons i rq
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> github did a nice job its kinda gentle and the reject all button is 1 click
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> i use arch btw
18:20 <+Ryozuki> ok there is one 404
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga US sites boot you off if you decline them usually, I personally haven't really had any trouble yet with other sites
18:20 <+Ryozuki> ah
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My problem with the cookie consent popups: In the very beginning I was reading them and trying to choose the "send me the cookies that are required for the site to work but not the ad stuff" setting. So I avoided clicking the big green OK button they want you to click on. But half of the time this takes you to a website saying "well sorry, you can't read this article then". This is really annoying so I've just grown to instinctively hammer 
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't really get why I should have a choice there anyways? From what I remember reading of the GDPR the only cookies that are allowed are the type of "cookies that are required for the site to work" anyways
18:21 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u use ipv6 right, i might not have it configured for ipv6 for some reason
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> uhm i use ipv6?
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> hacker wm @Learath2
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> yes it took me 5min to look it up
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> gnomemasterrace
18:22 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon try now
18:22 <+Ryozuki> ctrl f5
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> ctrl r
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> i closed it xd
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice got i
18:22 <+Ryozuki> works?
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> so good
18:22 <+Ryozuki> @Patiga can u try? i guess u had ipv6 too
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aye works now
18:23 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 hehe im a pro nginx now
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> go buy apache2
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> or bashwebserver
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> nginx sok
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 the failure to remove gets printed, but it's expected so no error
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> also tmux > hackerwm
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm still on xmonad but I want to move away from it in the future because of the haskell config. I'm interested in qtile, spectrwm, i3 in that order
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't remember what bugged me about bspwm
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> the name
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is it a dwm fork?
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> obv
18:25 <+Ryozuki> i want to make my own wm in rust
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> nerd
18:25 <+Ryozuki> but idk if worth the effort
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> i fund u if u use posix shell instead
18:25 <+Ryozuki> it would make me totally badass too
18:25 <+Ryozuki> next i would make my own irc client
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like a pain in the ass to maintain
18:26 <+Ryozuki> the path to not depend on external software
18:26 <+Ryozuki> full nerd
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> just sell ur pc
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> go into the woods
18:26 <+Ryozuki> and then what
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> no dependencys
18:26 <+Ryozuki> u depend on food
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> did u call me fat?
18:26 <+Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:27 <+Ryozuki> ups
18:27 <+Ryozuki> make the bot translate emojis
18:27 <+Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> ur irc client does not support emojys?
18:27 <+Ryozuki> its rly easy to implement btw
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> ik
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> i did it drunk
18:27 <+Ryozuki> it supports unicode emojis
18:27 <+Ryozuki> but not custom server discord ones obviously
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> my font doesnt
18:28 <+Ryozuki> my fav font rn is Jetbrains Mono
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> i have cheap font from alibaba
18:28 <+Ryozuki> looks rly good
18:28 <+Ryozuki> everywhere
18:28 <+Ryozuki> they released it this year
18:28 <+Ryozuki> https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/
18:30 <+Ryozuki> pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono
18:30 <+Ryozuki> :wink:
18:30 <+Ryozuki> üòâ
18:30 <+Ryozuki> oh both work

18:32 <+ChillerDragon> indeed

19:01 <+Ryozuki> if anyone wants to idle/chat and praise stallman join #hentai, we actually own the channel lmao
19:03 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't understand how the autoupdater was ever working on linux...
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never quite understoood what `GetBinaryPath` was ever supposed to do anyway, but it returns an absolute path, which `CStorage` won't let you open with `IStorage::TYPE_ALL`
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> TYPE_ABSOLUTE should work though?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If `GetBinaryPath` always returns absolute paths, yep
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (which I doubt, since the autoupdater works on windows)
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when can we replace system.c with cpp to use std xd
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, I forgot storage has no concept of config_directory
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro yea, these kidn of cookie consent boxes are likely illegal, declining optional cookies must be as easy as accepting them
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it's not limited to cookies ofc, and cookies needed to display the site (e.g. for storing whether you consent to ad cookies or not) are always okay)
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was explained to me, that the problem is that enforcement is (seemingly) intentionally slow in ireland (because they like being a safe haven for companies because it brings taxes), but that the eu parliament tries to fix that loophole
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just nuked an hour of work with a `rm -rf *`
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 no git commits inbetween?
20:53 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> did any1 of u ever aliased rm to mv trash or something
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm doing half-hourly snapshots of the file system to prevent mistakes like that
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> haven't made such mistakes since then, so I don't know if it'll work
20:57 <+ChillerDragon> ``cd / && git init && screen -AmdS while :; do sleep 1; git add .; git commit -m "yeet"; done``
20:57 <+ChillerDragon> oop forogot screen name
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No commits :/
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I think I'm back to where I was
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen seems you missed the removal of `"data/shader/bordertile.vert"` in update.json
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Autoupdate from any version before it's introduced fails with a 404
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't figure out how best to make Storage config_directory aware, so I stopped for now
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm a little tired of this whole thing tbh
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Just downloaded and compiled ddnet source code and I have everything starting with `CNet...` undefined
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764225464478203934/unknown.png
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> missing project reference or smth? any ideas?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> build it
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's not helping
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe you don't have python? cmake runs one to generate network object classes
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've never had problems building ddnet
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I had 4 of them, but it caused error for CMAKE 'cause it found oldest one. So I deleted everything and reinstalled newest 3.9
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> > I've never had problems building ddnet
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Pure_luck I always had )
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I use rather recent one 3.8
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764227415005331507/unknown.png
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> looks like something fundamental is wrong
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Now yes
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> are you using gcc or clang?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also: linux or windows?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also: have you tried cmake in console?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 1. idk
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 2. win
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 3. no
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... windows. Cannot help you sorry
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I've rebuilt it with cmake, now it's only some "unable to open ..." errors
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I think you can try console cmake and gcc
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok we will wait for windows dev then
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> are you using vscode btw?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> with cmake-tools?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> with cmake-tools extension?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ok, no, it just did not found any of them yet
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> visual studio. Not code
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> 2019
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> dunno, I've used vscode and cmake-tools extension
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> worked like a charm
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Vscode is just a text editor, not IDE
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> It's ok for some javascript, but not cpp
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Show us the output of CMake
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Text editors are more than okay for C/C++, most of us here are using them
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Vscode is just a text editor, not IDE
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> :troll:
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è it looks like cmake didn't find python
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's exactly missing the stuff generated by py
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's what I'd guess ^^
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok, then it found it but was unable to build
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> mb
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> show us the log ^^

22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 thanks, fixed
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yeah, maybe you're right, some Dependencies seems to be missing
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, looks all good
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only problem I see is that it finds py2, not py3
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Where.
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> It should not, but I'll check
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, thought when we specifically looked for Py3 it wouldn't take 2, @heinrich5991 is it possible for us to error out if it can't find a py3?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è 3rd line from the bottom, it finds `C:\Program Files\Python27`
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Strange, ok
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> als ofurther above
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> What should I do to help it find the right one
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> lol, better
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there is NO python27 folder in c:program files
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmmm
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764230713045286942/unknown.png
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems weird
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> :3
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try with normal explorer
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that application might be in 32-bit compatibility mode and not showing hte correct program files
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> lol, no, not the case
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> explorer shows the same?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ofc
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> this is probably a known bug, but if you click Connect/Disconnect Dummy and quickly press escape it doesn't work, next time you press escape it instantly disconnects dummy
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So cmake is finding a python that doesn't exist, that seems very unlikely üòÑ
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it may look in env variables for the path
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and find something old, eat it and accept
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you run the Visual Studio somethingsomething c++ something command prompt and check `where python.exe`?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently it's called "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" in this decade
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'm reinstalling python now
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Found PythonInterp: C:/Program Files/Python39/python.exe (found version "3.9") 
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Looking for WavpackOpenFileInputEx
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Looking for WavpackOpenFileInputEx - not found

23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> works now
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh @heinrich5991 can you help me with #2754 not building on CI?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> data_hash.h generates just fine on ubuntu-latest and on my computer, it doesn't anywhere else
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't see the error
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where is it?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> builds fine on macOS-latest?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Can you tell me where can I find any UI classes or methods?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> builds fine on ubuntu-latest and arch linux with gcc10 and clang10
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```

23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see this
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è ui.h has most of them, render.h has some helpers
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on macos latest
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah pushing a "fix" for that I think. I couldn't figure out what's wrong on windows and ubuntu-16.04
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I think you need to manually declare dependencies for generated source headers
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 where?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw, should we opt-in to hacktoberfest?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you have to opt-in?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought every project participates automatically
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This year they changed it, I guess some projects got spam
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least I got my hacktoberfest completed email 10 minutes after it started üòÑ
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then yes, opt in
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you need to add it to `ENGINE_UUID_SHARED` @Learath2
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it knows that it needs it for the engine compilation
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe rename it to ENGINE_SHARED_HACK or so
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I thought `GAME_GENERATED_SHARED` should be enough for that
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, engine doesn't depend on that
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> MSVC is such a PITA
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get it, C89 and C99 both define a `hexadecimal-constant` C++11 defines it as a `hexadecimal-literal` which seems to have the same semantics. Why is MSVC choking on my 0x prefixed data?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyone on windows or have a windows vm at hands reach?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I think it stumbles on the filenames, not the 0x
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `{"data/arrow.png",{0xd2,0x79,0xb3,0x93,0x15,0x3a,0x42,0xcb,0x3d,0xf1,0xe7,0x3c,0xf6,0x10,0xff,0x5e,0x17,0xb4,0x2c,0xeb,0x80,0x88,0x29,0x4c,0x00,0x75,0xa5,0x0e,0x60,0x4b,0xe5,0x4b}},` uhm I don't see how
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (also I think DATA_FILE_COUNT is not needed)
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well I need a constant length to create the bitsets
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could use the COUNT_OF macro
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, ok
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11837078/initialize-a-constant-sized-array-in-an-initializer-list
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some say it doesn't work in VS2012, not sure what version github is using
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> MSVC 19.27.29112.0
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's VS2019 iirc
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's also the latest on godbolt
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I know
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DUH
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows paths have \ as the separator, I need to escape that üòÑ
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hah, told you it's the paths
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but didn't think of the \
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be enough to replace all \s with \\ right? üòÑ
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with two backslashes?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah with two backslashes, TIL discord does escapes too
