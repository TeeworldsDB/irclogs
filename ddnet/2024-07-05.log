01:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 the import paths for teeworlds-go look cool huh? xd I invited you to https://github.com/teeworlds-go/econ
01:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> awesome ðŸ˜„ indeed they do
01:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its your repo go nuts! push to master or heck rename to main. Use snake_case and import third party libraries xd
01:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> D:
01:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what one would use varint for
01:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be interesting outside Go. like the one in the standard library that's used for protobuffers.
01:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> was my first thought
01:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> is fine
01:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> outside tw you mean?
01:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> yes
01:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> anyway. gotta sleep
01:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok sure i can create you the repo too but i cant promise i will use it in protocol or something like that
01:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you want it to be called "varint" ?
01:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> yeah
01:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the main thing was a joke btw xd
01:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pls use master -.- i did a little trap for you
01:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
01:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> I will keep it consistent
01:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the setup instructions in varint say master https://github.com/teeworlds-go/varint
01:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> I prefer consistency over imaginary people's feelings
01:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the one in econ say main <:justatest:572499997178986510>
01:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so be careful
01:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
01:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> thought you were chillerdragon
01:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> that doesn't look chill to me D:
01:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?xd
01:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> stay calm, keep cool, chill
01:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> e sure
01:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> we can do that
01:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> worst case, in the second try
01:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> on
01:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or 4th
01:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like 2.0.0 release
01:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or was it 5?
01:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> I did not count
01:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you get emails for every rls?
01:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> cuz I stayed cool
01:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> my github account is linked to my spam mail account which i don't read
01:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> so
01:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> dunno
01:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> mainly use the fasthub android app
01:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> for checking for updates on followed projects
01:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
01:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> gn8
01:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Gn8
01:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> was a trap

12:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Does the proof layer need to be visible, when opening up the tileset for selection? (space)

12:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Idk if it's a bug or an unintentional action
12:31 < bridge> <timakro> What's the current state of rust in ddnet? What parts are implemented in Rust? What types of features would be suitable to be implemented in Rust vs. C++ in the future? Is there maybe a wiki/doc page I missed about rust in ddnet?
12:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> rust.
12:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, you can say it's... **rusty**
12:46 < bridge> <timakro> Rust bindings have only been created for very low level stuff in src/base src/engine right?
12:49 < bridge> <timakro> So if I start work on fastcap support I shouldn't consider rust, right?
12:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In your fork you can do what you want or what do you mean.
12:50 < bridge> <timakro> i'm considering adding fastcap support to ddnet
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yea in the official code base rust is not really used. Itâ€™s more there ready to be picked up. I think heinrich has some plans for it in his bigger projects. Like quic
12:51 < bridge> <timakro> i see
12:51 < bridge> <timakro> i feel like i have to catch up on a lot of work from the past couple of years
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea hm. That would be a first then. I think some were concerned that not everyone is comfortable with rust.
12:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure if there will be back lash.
12:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think basically all active devs had contact with rust already anyways or are major rust fans
12:53 < bridge> <timakro> deen said he'd be in for it if it's done cleanly and i commit to maintaining it, which sounds reasonalbe
12:53 < bridge> <timakro> deen said he'd be in for it if it's done cleanly and i commit to maintaining it, which is reasonable
12:53 < bridge> <timakro> there was some discussion on something heinrich is working on with rust soon
12:54 < bridge> <timakro> something about compatibility code
12:54 < bridge> <timakro> but i didn't get what it was about exactly
12:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea but you would be working on core gameplay thatâ€™s a bit different imo
12:54 < bridge> <timakro> i'm just curious what he is planning with rust
12:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think Heinrich wants to fully extract all 0.7 bridge code
12:55 < bridge> <timakro> i see
12:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He has libtw2 ready to be used for ddnet
12:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can checkout some of his rust prs
12:55 < bridge> <timakro> oh, the idea is to import libtw2 into ddnet?
12:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> quic for example and I think there was some rust proxy stuff
12:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thatâ€™s more an assumption of mine
12:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This imports libtw2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6961
13:17 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> does any of the original creators of teeworlds work at ddnet?
13:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who still counts as original for you?
13:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would consider heinrich a teeworlds creator
13:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But only to some degree
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> None of the true original creators are around as far as I know
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> No not really, the original group is pretty much gone
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But that was before my time anyways
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> matricks showed up a couple months ago and gave us a bit of nostalgia
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t even know who the original crew was
13:21 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> oh ok
13:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I saw some old images with a bunch of ppl but not sure how many very actively involved in the very beginning
13:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That was 2001 bro @borsmatyas02
13:23 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> oh im intrested tho
13:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Timeline
13:24 < bridge> <meloÆž> omg Voxel is in that screenshot!
13:24 < bridge> <meloÆž> i miss him frfr
13:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Omg, he's gonna sue us now :poggers:
13:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but ye we miss em
13:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I wish i could tell him.. that... I use rust
13:33 < bridge> <meloÆž> i couldnt tell him that i use arch for months now, i feel.. empty (i'm joking, i hope he's doing well)
13:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use debian btw
13:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i had to edit prod db without backup because my version of pg_dump is too old :pepeW:
13:52 < bridge> <zhn> sadly no photos from snowy mountains xd
15:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do we compile ddnet with mingw or msvc
15:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean the official binary and steam
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> mingw probs
16:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yes
16:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> They are cross compiled by @deen
16:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok
16:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thanks
16:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> love you @fokkonaut
16:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> love you too
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> TIL about `glob-expand-word`. You can do `C-x*` (the default binding for it) to get bash to expand a glob
16:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I got two srokes trying to read that
16:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I got two strokes trying to read that

19:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> LOL
19:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I just found a GitHub Webhook Bug
19:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8561
19:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Issues created on the mobile app don't trigger webhooks
19:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And closed aswell xD
19:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Not a mobile bug, the webhook seems broken in general
19:39 < bridge> <robyt3> https://www.githubstatus.com/
19:40 < bridge> <zhn> why my beloved free sans bold is so cursed being rendered in ddnet ðŸ˜­
19:40 < bridge> <robyt3> can you send a screenshot?
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> i mean (afaik) its teeworlds 0.5 font and its kinda different from what i remember
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258840318057386096/screenshot_2024-07-05_20-40-42.png?ex=668981e7&is=66883067&hm=0b6e14fece6c28f0851a906a1efb6a99147c975460309e77714ffeae83aa4cc3&
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> i know 0.5 had some font atlas script
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> Bold smells like it would have issues with the outline
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, nvm that looks extracursed
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> but it shouldn't be so tiny imo
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> its bold xd
19:43 < bridge> <zhn> website preview looks fine too
19:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Where did you get the font file from? I tried a random website and it looks better for me. Seems like not all unicode is supported, but for example the number-sized space before the client IDs in the scoreboard is rendered correctly (i.e. empty) and not as a replacement character for me.
19:49 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258842167879798905/screenshot_2024-07-05_19-48-21.png?ex=668983a0&is=66883220&hm=839e2db6c1eb1d6b72bc0f36a02197e8cf2ee0645a6d6896b0538d268f91f93c&
19:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> LOL
19:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Somehow your issue travelled in time
19:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
19:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> the webhook felt insulted after reading your message
20:18 < bridge> <zhn> there https://fonts2u.com/free-sans-bold.font, can you provide more reliable source please?
20:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, I used the same file. How did you add it to the client?
20:45 < bridge> <egyt> By the way, it didn't get into the client :^(
20:46 < bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258856426139418796/db41186b3d634dd7.png?ex=668990e8&is=66883f68&hm=e0d49d4be89ff7cb45778c1efb588fcb4951515f63998354b110ee391617426d&
21:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> if I update thst everyone gets notified
21:07 < bridge> <egyt> Oh well
21:07 < bridge> <egyt> Oh well, then it's not really worth it
21:08 < bridge> <egyt> Planning on supporting Ukrainian l10n for now, maybe will even do something for other languages too
21:39 < bridge> <zhn> pasted into `data/fonts` and redacted `index.json`
21:39 < bridge> <zhn> changed `default` line
21:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you also add the font filename to the list of files? The value for `default` must be the family name of the font (`FreeSans Bold`)
21:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess it shows the fallback font for you since it can't find the default font
21:44 < bridge> <zhn> huh wait seems i typed family name wrong
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> The correct family name should be printed as debug message to the console if your loglevel is high enough, when you add the font file to the list
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> `D textrender: Loaded font face 0 'FreeSans Bold' from font file 'fonts/FreeSansBold.ttf'`
22:03 < bridge> <zhn> so yep seems problem was with fallback font
22:05 < bridge> <zhn> thank you! free sans bold feels so much better to use
22:06 < bridge> <zhn> it misses a lot of unicode symbols though xd
22:10 < bridge> <zhn> xd
22:10 < bridge> <zhn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1258877697204027543/image.png?ex=6689a4b7&is=66885337&hm=096d67d98da5e88574d96b55c25b40524d2566e699a8eab3a649b432eb9fdfd8&
22:50 < bridge> <learath2> I thiiink we have either a way to fall back for symbols or maybe a tool to patch fonts with atleast our ui symbols
