00:03 < bridge> <murpi> Do routers typically have UPnP enabled by default nowadays?
04:12 < bridge> <RadziSzop> I don't think so
10:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
10:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they do
10:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> it highly depends on which provider
10:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont use provider routers
10:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tthey bad
10:32 < bridge> <ReiTW> I mean ISP
10:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah u use a custom router
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @ReiTW the one they gave me i think went OOM when i torrented, cuz torrent likes to open 200 connections and it couldnt handle it xd
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i bought another and it works charm
10:34 < bridge> <ReiTW> usually I fix this by not doing torrent
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol thats not an option
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> torrent or any p2p are awesome
10:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also i download anime via torrent
10:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 1gb per episode
10:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> max quality
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i buy legal
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nobo
10:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the ones i watch arent available
10:35 < bridge> <ReiTW> I never torrent, better, I buy
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your hentai xD
10:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont watch hentai rly xd
10:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> only thing I've downloaded was Hokuto No Ken
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well anyway, torent is really risky for illegal stuff
10:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Classic
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also torrent can be used for legal things
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u always also upload the content
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> arch linux offers iso download via torrent, and its way faster
10:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> classic wut
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wish all distros offered that
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz their dl servers are always slow
10:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can download the arch iso at 70mb/s
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ;~; 70mb/s wtf
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> germany just invented the stone axe
10:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> steam also reaches that speed for me xd
10:38 < bridge> <deen> Switzerland so close, yet so far from here 😄 https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-04-23-fiber7-25gbit-upgrade/
10:38 < bridge> <ReiTW> I reach 96Mb/s with direct download on arch
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096716148936028270/image.png
10:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have 600/600 contract but i could get the 1gb one xd
10:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh 25gbit now
10:39 < bridge> <ReiTW> tbh it's useless af
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the funny thing is, i especially want ur upload
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats the biggest shit about DSL
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 250mbits down.. not good but ok
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 40mbits up
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like wtf
10:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why u dont have fiber
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs germany is in the stone age of internet
10:41 < bridge> <deen> I don't think that's a technical limitation, just what the ISPs set
10:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in spain, its odd to have dsl now
10:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not the other way around
10:41 < bridge> <deen> because most people care about high number for down
10:41 < bridge> <ReiTW> here in france we can have 10gbps but shared
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but this is such a german problem
10:41 < bridge> <ReiTW> how much do u pay for that
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too much xD
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me see
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > In terms of fiber optic penetration in homes, Spain has the most in Europe, with more than 70%, only behind Belarus. With 60% and more, there are Sweden and Portugal, while Romania and France touched 50% in 2021, as seen in the graph below.
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 54,95€ apparently
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/telefonica-will-achieve-100-fibre-coverage-in-spain-by-2025-and-lead-the-implementation-of-5g/
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> according to telekom website
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
10:42 < bridge> <ReiTW> lmao I pay 49€ for 1gb/s down & 400mbps up
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they all greedy and bad in ger xd
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> high speed internet is the basic of modern society
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its such a game changer
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am surrounded by old ppl xD
10:44 < bridge> <deen> If you switch every 2 years between Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, you should pay around 25 € / month average
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, but vodafone has no dsl rights here
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i am forced to the monopolist
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i defs dont buy cable internet again
10:45 < bridge> <deen> I thought Telekom was forced to open their DSL to all competitors
10:45 < bridge> <deen> This is probably Vodafone who don't want to sell you DSL but give you Cable instead?
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i can buy 16mbits from the city
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> possible, or they are speed limited?
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, vodafones cable internet sucks so hard xD
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ping jitter of 10 pre programmed
10:46 < bridge> <deen> Existing customers are always treated like dirt. Sometimes it helps to call them and say you'll cancel the contract, and they'll reduce price by 50% (and bind you in a new contract for 2  years again)
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
10:47 < bridge> <ReiTW> damn same in france
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to move to bulgaria where i get 1gbit for 8€ / month xD
10:47 < bridge> <deen> It might depend on the age of the telephone cable, but everywhere I lived all DSL providers were possible
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ~1980 probably
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we had make the router as  close to the street as possible to even get 250mbits xD
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i really dunno why they dont have DSL here
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096719643453964298/image.png
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe i should call them and ask
10:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> are u sure they even offer ftth
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd be happy with DSL for now too ^^
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> FTTH wont come here soon
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except the city will do it or a compatitor
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but telekom wont do it
10:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> damn bad
10:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096720186696024214/image.png
10:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :frozen:
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao and the telekom ppl that scam all ppl here
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> she ringed, and said they sell fiber internet (but they obv mean fiber to the cluster, not FTTH)
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me this was clear.. but defs scam, bcs in germany we usually only say fiber internet when we mean FTTH
10:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well everywhere xd
10:57 < bridge> <ReiTW> google's speedtest is bad lol
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it changes a lot by which sv it pickss xd
10:57 < bridge> <ReiTW> with speedtest.net I reach the max

17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie yo are you at new work or what did i miss bro
17:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe, i forgot how updated this channel were
17:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i work at here now https://netvios.163.com/
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks cool xd
17:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye. but this is still a pretty small company with unjustified expectations for their projects.
17:20 < bridge> <murpi> Is that a game?
17:20 < bridge> <murpi> VR Game?
17:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i'm getting paid so it's a million times better than the last company i worked for lol
17:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they are a VR game publisher for the chinese market.
17:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Wait, did that ping?
17:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I got pinged
17:21 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
17:21 < bridge> <murpi> Ah, a game publisher
17:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they do want to make in-house titles so that's why I'm hired
17:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Ohnoes
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What's your role? network again?
17:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> full stack game development i guess?
17:22 < bridge> <-StormAx> :poggers2:
17:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> same as the last one tbh
17:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they just hire like one or two guys and expect to see a full game in 5 months
17:22 < bridge> <Learath2> The fact that people can ping roles from matrix sounds concerning
17:22 < bridge> <murpi> #
17:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ban abusers maybe
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🧐
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> @everyone incoming axaxax
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah thought u like network designer, bcs u always shared prediction code between multiple clients 😄
17:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye cuz that's the core stuff the game needs
17:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this company still wants multiplayer games, so i guess it really didn't change a whole lot for me
17:24 < bridge> <uwu> i hope they expect hypercasual quest game from 90s :greenthing:
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but are you developing the game, or the engine or both ? 😄
17:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gotta love companies with 0 scaffolding to just hire someone and expect to ship a game in less than a year
17:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we use unity (yes, again)
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok 😄
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip :/
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least u are through that time now
17:26 < bridge> <murpi> Oh no, another game platform
17:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol the new company still have no accumulated code base tho so I'm building stuff from the ground up again
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'm always impressed how many game studios are out there 😄
17:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> plus VR game is not very well established so I got more stuff to build this time around lol
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are you at least considered senior now hehe
17:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> junior title and salary with senior job probably
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, even tho you outclass them all
17:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we do have a technical leader, but he don't code that often, the just guy steering everyone. and I'm one of the only two who actually develop games in the companies. so... yeah, i'm probably at the top percentage in terms of experiences and skills lol

17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> were you paid upfront?
17:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym upfront
17:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> like you get x money to do project in x months
17:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> or still monthly
17:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, I'm an employee, so I just get salary
17:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> aha
17:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> because when your company gets a project
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if he got money at all

17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragores: do i get it right. you use IRC because u dont want to use JavaScript matrix, just to use a JavaScript plugin in your IRC?
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh hi
17:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's been like two years since the IME stuff in teeworlds i think?
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> minimum 😄
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we need more asian contributors
17:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sorry i've been captured by money
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> same
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Money money money, must be funny
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i open up my editor in non work hours, then i that think "do i rly wanna be coding rn in my free time or play games"
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and close the editor
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> about 5 times a day
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we all know that feeling bro
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> aw shit jopstr
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> nah
18:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ha, I really don't know what games to play so I don't have that problem
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> on my desktop i still run ssh to chat xd and run weechat no js in use
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a mmo, it will suck ur lige
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> life
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im addicted to ffxiv
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> but on my gaming raspberry pi i run a js standalone client but raspi is fast enough it can run all the js
18:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I watch youtube for like 10 hours during the weekend
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> social life: 100/100
18:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I've been trying to turn my personal projects into sellable products. but it's been almost half a year without any progress.
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its luck or intense click baiting and spamming
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> choose your side
18:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> The one thing I finished is a Unity editor extension. but Unity Asset Store rejected me three times already, every resubmit takes a week :cammostripes: .
18:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Unity is like, indirect link is not allowed. And I only had one link which is my discord invite link.
18:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and they reject me cuz it was discord.gg/code not discord.com/invite/code <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
18:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol what
18:06 < bridge> <uwu> :monkaS:

21:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> `CPlayer` copy assignment has gone after adding `m_UniqueClientId` duh
21:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> making object pool with forward iterator seems to be hard xd
22:12 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://godbolt.org/z/z971ojEhx ended up with this
22:16 < bridge> <gerdoe> can't figure out how to pass `Value()` as rvalue
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where do u pass it?
22:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> in `operator*()`
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its a temporary object
22:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah i understand it
22:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> but i don't know how to make its lifetime longer
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can only do that with const_reference
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cpp treats that case different
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use rust
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for mutables its not possible
22:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> huh
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in Value() itself u must return a reference already
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it would work
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks can u make a invalid reference  in cpp?
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what a question
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how would that work
22:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> how i supposed to tho
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have a gun, ofc u can shoot urself xD
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> XD
22:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> rewrite ddnet in rust pls
22:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> i beg you
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> zwelf has worked on that
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply destroy the object
22:34 < bridge> <k2d222> what is that? `new (sizeof(Type), &m_Data[ObjectId]) Type(std::forward<TArgs>(Args)...);`
22:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> constructing object on `&m_Data[ObjectId]` address
22:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> with size `sizeof(Type)`
22:35 < bridge> <Chairn> cpp metaprogrammation
22:35 < bridge> <k2d222> wow ok never seen that XD looks like mallocs
22:35 < bridge> <gerdoe> placement new
22:35 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/365887/how-do-malloc-and-new-work-how-are-they-different-implementation-wise
22:35 < bridge> <k2d222> that syntax is ugly imo
22:35 < bridge> <k2d222> not as bad as function pointers though
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> good enough
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> anyway question is open xd
22:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> how to prolongate `Value()`'s lifetime if its just kind of alias of `m_pPool->Get(m_Id))`
22:37 < bridge> <gerdoe> and actually appears to be `(Type *)` which is `T` for iterator
22:37 < bridge> <gerdoe> so pointer can be nulled
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use rust
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sry i woke up troll today
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well its night already
22:41 < bridge> <k2d222> why do you need the iterator class to be generic? what is the role of T?
22:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> sometimes i think that your vocabulary fits in `{ 'use', 'rust' }` xd
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> function pointer types exist in rust
22:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> cuz i don't want to make another class to write const iterator
22:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> compiler does it for me
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `myhandler::<extern "C" fn () -> c_void>(sdadasdsa)`
22:42 < bridge> <k2d222> since your iterator class is nested in CObjectPool you already have access to the `Type` template parameter
22:43 < bridge> <gerdoe> thanks cap
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     x + y
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let mut x = add(5,7);
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> type Binop = fn(i32, i32) -> i32;
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let bo: Binop = add;
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> x = bo(5,7);
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
22:43 < bridge> <k2d222> ah ok sorry
22:43 < bridge> <k2d222> learn to read
22:44 < bridge> <gerdoe> its last thing to solve xd
22:44 < bridge> <gerdoe> then i can just replace new statements in ddnet code and delete old macros
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do u need the reference in the for loop
22:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> i don't need
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are the dummies real objects?
22:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> `for (auto &pPlayer : m_apPlayers)` kind of
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> isnt auto kind of another footgun
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like the bad kind of type inference
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> auto &x, auto x
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what if x is a reference already
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weird stuff
22:46 < bridge> <gerdoe> `m_apPlayers` is array of pointers
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah im not talking about ddnet
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cpp in the general sense
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let does the same
22:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> cpp is like python after rust
22:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> same feeling after switching between cpp and python
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even for cpp this was an insult
22:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> it is xd
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm idk
22:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> use c instead
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust type inference is way better
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and it fits with the algebraic data types it has
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c++ doesnt have real sum types
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ADT are like a basic feature any modern language needs
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions, coproduct types or variant types)
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway @gerdoe for what u programmed i dont really see a chance
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd sry for my ted talk
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd rewrite it a bit probably or dont use a refernce in the for loop
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its good 😉
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> its okey the main thing that it needs to be done xd
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since it's always pointer don't return reference in the operator overload
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Simply return T
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But honestly the solution is a bit weird
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe don't iterate over raw pointers at all
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> References on raw pointers
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno xd
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As function parameter sometimes useful
22:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> `CObjectPool` should imitate iterating over `CPlayer *m_apPlayers[MAX_CLIENTS]` so thats why iterator is added
23:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> actually if `auto &pPlayer : m_apPlayers` and `auto pPlayer : m_apPlayers` is the same i can just walk through code and replace it
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes. But in your case it's more dangerous
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> T& would be a pointer to a temporary even in the for loop
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So a future dev might accidentally do this
23:01 < bridge> <gerdoe> compiler prevents it anyway
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> u can do that
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> ```cpp
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> T m_value;
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> // ...
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> reference operator*() { m_value = Value(); return m_value }
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> ```
23:02 < bridge> <k2d222> but don't i guess, it looks fishy af
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if the warning is on
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and not thread safe
23:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> don't think so 
23:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```
23:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'Dummy*&' to an rvalue of type 'Dummy*'```
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what exactly did u do
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean in the for loop after replacing the references in the iterator with T
23:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah oopsie another one
23:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'Dummy*&' to an rvalue of type 'CObjectPool<Dummy, 128>::iterator<Dummy*>::value_type' {aka 'Dummy*'}
23:03 < bridge> <gerdoe>   122 |     for(auto &d : Dummies) {
23:03 < bridge> <gerdoe>       |                   ^~~~~~~
23:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think u get me wrong
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> reference operator*() { return Value(); }
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gets
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> T operator*() { return Value(); }
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> reference operator*() { return Value(); }
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gets
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> T operator*() { return Value(); }
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u cannot return a reference anyway
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the way objectpool is built
23:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah fair
23:05 < bridge> <gerdoe> but T is always Type *
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:05 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah got it
23:05 < bridge> <gerdoe> so programmer can't get `auto &a : abc` working in that case anyway
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe if the objectpool is built differently
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i think as is, u cant
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u could maybe do it rust like and iterate over Optional<Dummy&>
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its basically the same as nullptr then
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but even then the for loop stays a problem with auto&
23:17 < bridge> <Teero> are those draggers not predicted clientside?
23:17 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096907262116761651/image.png
23:18 < bridge> <Teero> it seems like it
23:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, did you guys fix the staggering issue on ddnet mapping tool when saving? It feels nice now, but I don't have an indicator now whether I saved or not 😄
23:37 < bridge> <deen> another bug that became a feature
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
23:40 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :feelsbossman:
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Now make an text "Map Saved!" appear, when saving and it's a feature :lol:
23:41 < bridge> <エピツクゲーﾏー> does someone know how do i get rainbow commands and other shits in lan servers?
23:41 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Now make a text "Map Saved!" appear, when saving and it's a feature :lol:
23:42 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> similar to block servers? I think block servers have server side configurations, but I can be wrong here, if you use another client, it can also have configurations like that too
23:44 < bridge> <エピツクゲーﾏー> ye, like kog servers have a rcon commands that can make players rainbow, explosive etc xD
23:44 < bridge> <エピツクゲーﾏー> i've been trying to figure it out so hard
23:44 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @deen Also a good HUD feature would be to be able to see the name tags better by fading out other players' texts that are not near the middle point of the camera and be customizable by changing the visibility
23:45 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Wanted to make an issue of it on Github, but I'm lazy and nobody would react to this other than you anyway xd
