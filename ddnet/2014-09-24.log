07:56 < Nimda> HURT by MarvinProductions just released on moderate at 2014-09-23 22:22 : http://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate/#map-HURT
10:06 < pause> Hello there
10:10 < EastByte> hi pause 
10:30 < laxa_work> testing something on nimda
10:32 < Nimda> test
10:32 < laxa_work> !config test enabled yes
10:32 < Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
10:32 < laxa_work> oops
10:32 < Nimda> test
10:33 < Nimda> test
10:33 < laxa_work> !config test enabled no
10:33 < Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
10:33 < laxa_work> grmll
10:33 < Nimda> test
10:59 < pause> !config laxa enable brain
10:59 < Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
11:29 <@deen> !config laxa enable brain
11:29 < Nimda> This plugin doesn't exist.
11:29 <@deen> I knew it!
11:38 < EastByte> laxa lacks of brain :D
11:48 < laxa_work> Why so mean !
21:43 < laxa> !help
21:43 < laxa> !seen pause
21:43 < Nimda> I've last seen pause 4 hours, 32 minutes and 14 seconds ago in #ddnet saying "uid=1002(pause) gid=1003(pause) groups=1003(pause)".
21:46 < laxa> !php die
21:46 < Nimda> die - Equivalent to exit ( http://php.net/die )
21:47 < EastByte> hm server providers should be forced to prevent ip spoofing
21:48 < EastByte> I think this is the weakest point of the internet
21:48 <@deen> oh, datafabrik didn't throw me out
21:48 <@deen> they just won't give me an ip address^^
21:48 < EastByte> haha
21:48 < EastByte> so how do you connect?
21:48 <@deen> ipv6 is still kind of working
21:48 < EastByte> cool
21:48 <@deen> connecting per ssh takes 20 seconds...
21:49 < EastByte> that might be a different problem
21:49 <@deen> I'd guess ssh is setup wrongly
21:49 <@deen> but it's default settings, so meh
21:49 < EastByte> hm
21:49 < EastByte> I wonder how that comes
21:49 < EastByte> sometimes connecting via ssh take multiple seconds
21:49 <@deen> packets lost
21:50 < EastByte> nah in my case it's in LAN
21:50 <@deen> at least for me, but it takes long to CHN and Chile for me^^
21:51 < EastByte> atleast you can keep the server ^^
21:51 <@deen> there are so many things to put over on FRA
21:51 <@deen> don't need a server without a connection^^
21:51 < EastByte> ipv6 is coming :D
21:51 < EastByte> not
21:52 <@deen> so much work moving everything to FRA
21:52 < EastByte> you should do stuff more portable
21:52 <@deen> how would i do that?
21:53 < EastByte> dunno
21:53 <@deen> setting up mail sever, all the webscripts, webserver, copying databases, accounts
21:53 <@deen> i have a guide for how to setup a new regular ddnet server
21:53 < EastByte> a chroot jail thingie for example
21:53 <@deen> but the master server has so much stuff
21:53 < EastByte> so you can move it
21:53 <@deen> but then you can't update stuff
21:54 <@deen> i don't want webserver, mail programs etc in a chroot
21:55 < laxa> I feel really bad imagining that some people are living from ddos :x
21:56 < EastByte> I hope they do it for much money so the kids pocket money doesnt hold long
21:58 < laxa> At least you should be ok on FRA for a long time deen. I doubt they annoy you for ddos.
21:58 <@deen> huh?
21:58 <@deen> OVH is well known to throw people out if they get ddosed too much
21:59 <@deen> every hoster does that
21:59 <@deen> if you're more expensive to them than what you pay, they'll throw you out
21:59 < laxa> haven't they have unlimited bandwidth ?
22:00 < EastByte> nothing is unlimited
22:00 <@deen> "unlimited"
22:00 <@deen> but without any guarantee of speed
22:00 <@deen> so they can throttle you to 1kb/s whenever they feel like it
22:01 < laxa> Hum...
22:01 < laxa> I hope this never happens
22:02 <@deen> the attackers may soon realize how to keep the servers down
22:02 <@deen> ddos 2 minutes, stop 2 minutes, ddos 2 minutes, and so on
22:02 < laxa> Are they mad at you or ddnet ?
22:02 <@deen> i don't know
22:02 <@deen> haven't heard from anyone today
22:02 <@deen> i think it's different ddosers most of the time
22:04 < laxa> that would be really weird, tw community is so little
22:04 < EastByte> hmmm
22:11 <@deen> little, but well known to be full of ddosers
22:12 <@deen> other TW projects had to shut down because of attacks
22:12 < laxa> Don't know any project that failed cause of attacks :(.
22:13 < laxa> .!calc is fixed now if you need to use it
22:13 < EastByte> http://teeserver.de/
22:13 < EastByte> oh its german
22:13 <@deen> yeah, but they had > 10 gbit/s ddos non-stop
22:13 < EastByte> so?
22:13 < EastByte> he didnt use ovh :D
22:14 < laxa> Really, fuck those terrorists...
22:15 <@deen> back when ddnet started the masterservers were also down for a few days
22:15 < EastByte> yes
22:15 < EastByte> and they bought a better server
22:15 < EastByte> minus?
22:15 <@deen> ddmax is now getting more players since GER is down and probably a ddos will soon follow, then noother will shut down ddmax for good
22:17 < EastByte> might happen
22:22 <@deen> btw, attacks still haven't stopped
22:23 < EastByte> hmm
22:23 < laxa> those ddos should have a cost, who pay them oO ?
22:23 <@deen> usually other server hosters or players who hate us
22:23 <@deen> us/me
22:24 < EastByte> maybe they ordered an attack for the whole day
22:24 <@deen> yeah, it's always packages
22:24 <@deen> for just a few dollars
22:24 < EastByte> or (which would be really bad) they know when ovh will give up
22:24 < EastByte> and try to achieve this now
22:26 < EastByte> also why would they choose a weekday for such an attack
22:26 <@deen> cheaper than weekend? :P
22:26 < EastByte> xd
22:26 < EastByte> well the might be true
22:26 <@deen> i don't know, a lot of people are pissed at ddnet recently
22:27 < EastByte> ddnet sucks, it laggs so we need to run an attack
22:27 <@deen> nah, got messages today like "ddnet sucks, i hope it dies soon"
22:29 <@deen> ddmax was ddosed
22:29 < EastByte> must be a coincidence
22:29 <@deen> no
22:29 <@deen> i think i can see patterns in the attacks
22:29 < EastByte> ^^
22:29 < EastByte> wut
22:30 <@deen> a few weeks ago we had another attack of this strength, ddmax was attacked then too
22:32 <@deen> i hate this ddos protection
22:32 <@deen> threw me out again
22:32 < EastByte> hm maybe players with ovh gra server have private access to ddnet^^
22:33 <@deen> nah, i just send too much data to FRA
22:33 <@deen> because I'm still setting stuff up
22:33 < EastByte> I mean ovh internal traffic is not going to be detected I think
22:33 <@deen> well, it should be^^
22:33 <@deen> but yeah
22:33 < EastByte> so me and laxa can always connect :D
22:34 < EastByte> if laxa knows how to set up vpn tunneling
22:34 < laxa> I have openvpn running on my server
22:34 < laxa> but I don't understand how it can be helpfull
22:35 < EastByte> well, you will bypass the ddos protection
22:36 < laxa> my server isn't at ovh, but online !
22:36 < EastByte> I thought you are at ovh
22:36 < laxa> I never was
22:36 < EastByte> okay
22:36 < laxa> my first and only server yet is : www.online.net
22:37 < laxa> it's apparently the second hoster after ovh
22:38 <@deen> btw, the threaded log writing has solved most server lags
22:39 < laxa> Any idea if the ddos are coming from foreign servers or botnet ?
22:39 <@deen> before when i did a lot of disk io the servers would always lag, now not
22:39 <@deen> no idea
22:39 <@deen> don't care
22:39 <@deen> but usually the attacks were NTP/DNS servers
22:44 < EastByte> ovh could just drop all ntp/dns packets from outside
22:47 < EastByte> east logic
22:54 < laxa> human intervention is too expensive for such server I think
22:54 < laxa> unless you can do it with scripts
23:02 < Savander> wow
23:02 < Savander> ddmax DDosed?
23:02 <@deen> yes
23:02 < Savander> so, i think ddmax will closed soon
23:02 < Savander> nother tell us smth lik
23:02 < Savander> "Next ddos, i'll close dDmax"
23:02 < Savander> co..
23:02 < Savander> so..
23:03 <@deen> =/
23:03 < EastByte> deen: I don't get kicked out ddos protection anymore
23:03 <@deen> EastByte: i do =(
23:03 <@deen> i have to work slowly on the server
23:03 <@deen> or it kicks me for a few minutes
23:03 < EastByte> xd
23:03 < EastByte> type one ascii char per second :D
23:04 < EastByte> yep, ddmax is pretty much dead
23:05 < Savander> ye
23:05 < Savander> because ddmax was on company servers
23:08 < EastByte> deen: hm ddnet tab without ger flag looks poor
23:09 < pause> Funny how people have time/money to lose just to piss someone/a community for no profit
23:10 < laxa> I told noother about the ddos, he shutted down ddracemax for the day apparently, to avoid any ddos
23:22 < Nimda> Alive by tobu. just released on moderate at 2014-09-24 23:11 : http://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate/#map-Alive
23:25 < Savander> what
23:25 < Savander> ?
23:25 < Savander> Alive doesn't exist
23:25 <@deen> the ranks page only refreshes every 20 min
23:26 <@deen> it should be on the servers
23:27 <@deen> i hope i got the synchronization of ranks running
23:27 <@deen> of maps*
23:27 < Savander> btw.
23:27 < Savander> so GER will be exist?
23:27 < Savander> or not?
23:27 <@deen> good question^^
23:28 < Savander> ;d
23:28 <@deen> after every ddos attack the server went down for 1-3 hours
23:28 <@deen> today after 5 hours it was still down
23:28 <@deen> so i asked the hoster
23:28 <@deen> he said the traffic was too much and we should switch to another hoster, and gave me a link
23:28 < laxa> lol
23:28 < Savander> LOL
23:28 < Savander> ?
23:28 < Savander> :D
23:28 <@deen> I asked if that means whether the server has been terminated, but he said no
23:29 <@deen> so i have no ip now, but the server is running
23:29 <@deen> and he's not responding since then
23:29 < Savander> he proposed you another solution
23:29 < Savander> :P
23:29 < Savander> Go out, or die
23:29 < Savander> xD
23:30 <@deen> i find that strange since he promised me ddos protection
23:31 < pause> deen: Easy to promise that as long as there is no ddos
23:31 < laxa> pause: look hangout !
23:31 <@deen> no, he's testing an anti-ddos-appliance and said we can use it for free once it's working
23:31 < laxa> guess that'll cost them too much for such cheap server
23:31 < laxa> business is business
23:46 <@deen> i'd pay twice of what i'm paying now :P
23:47 <@deen> but i guess that's no good when their entire bandwidth is just 100 gbit/s
23:48 <@deen> 5 hours non-stop attacks now
