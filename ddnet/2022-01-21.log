00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Considering that entities also removes a bit of CPU work.. Preparing envelopes, draw calls, iterating through layers. This is still way too less. Either the gl driver sucks with something specific, like nameplates or tee rendering. Or we actually have to assume it hits some weird bottleneck

06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> look what's on HN today: https://www.naturaldocs.org/getting_started/documenting_your_code/
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instantly reminded me of system.h comments. was that tool once used for teeworlds?
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of it
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this looks like it existed since 2003 so its possible someone used it
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Discord Mod
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> holy shit they never stop
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord should get their ass working on this
10:33 <+ChillerDragon> This doc tool is some AI trained on Magnuses code ;D
10:33 <+ChillerDragon> Sorry for repost but does one know if its possible in the client to figure out who hit who. Like nade hits from other clients

10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TOCTOU races are such a PITA to avoid
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah xd
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u cant event prevent it on macos
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz no api xd
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite)
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well before that version
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if thats ancient or not
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk how they fixed it but, TOCTOU is very annoying to fix most of the times
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess they use something like openat?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Instead of telling the system not to follow symlinks, the standard library first checked whether the thing it was about to delete was a symlink, and otherwise it would proceed to recursively delete the directory.
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by not following symlinks
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will just delete the symlink
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its explained there
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > To prevent such attacks, std::fs::remove_dir_all already includes protection to avoid recursively deleting symlinks, as described in its documentation:
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     This function does not follow symbolic links and it will simply remove the symbolic link itself.
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not the issue. They already had that but it's not enough
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This function currently corresponds to openat, fdopendir, unlinkat and lstat functions on Unix (except for macOS before version 10.10 and REDOX) and the CreateFileW, GetFileInformationByHandleEx, SetFileInformationByHandle, and NtOpenFile functions on Windows. Note that, this may change in the future.
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yep, openat
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.remove_dir_all.html
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 man im trying to figure out how to render sprites
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 30 mins and still dont know xdd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this quad container stuff is driving me insane
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im implementing #submissions with the image from voxel
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That makes 2 of us. I wanted to render some tees. I looked around for an hour, than I just got bored
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got everything setup even the custom assets for it
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just need to render the stuff in the hud
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try to ignore the details. Don't we have a gfx api or rendertools api call to render a sprite?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/934021896889049168/unknown.png
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> my first thought for the case of preventing privilege exploitation of that function would be to block access to editing the folder/symlink/whatever before checking it and then release it afterwards, but as someone who is not a low level programmer i dont know how practical/effective/possible that is of a strategy
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This would be the naive approach, it comes with a couple drawbacks but it would indeed work
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you allow locking files you'll inevitably have badly behaving programs that fail to drop their locks, happens on windows all the time
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> lol yeah i'm familiar with that
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> in the sm64 TASing scene the emulator we used to use for TASing wouldn't close its access to the movie files after opening them, so while you'd be able to edit them you couldn't delete them without closing the emulator lol
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 omg
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got it to render
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/934025142315659264/unknown.png

11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen\: ok one last round\:I just disabled rendering in all places

11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur msg is repeated btw
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and looks like some newlines arent there
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dont you want to take the chance and just add a new HUD thats called for ddnet onlyI guess the hearts and shields aren't useful
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The freeze timer could just get smth like ninja thing from 0.7
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Ryozuki)
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hud i added is only called for ddnet but i didnt remove the hearts
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah the bridge sucks xD
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Ryozuki)
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since the image i got shows no freeze seconds
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god this bridge is aswful

11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who draw that btw?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> voxel
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its on discord
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i added it to ur assets thing too
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks really goo
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw ur assets stuff could be made extendable way more easiily
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so clean
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i already improved it alot by using templates
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has like 4 empty new structs and stuff
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen forced me xD
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found it funny
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hate UI work bro
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh dawg bro
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just hate tw's ui concept
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we dont have a "focus, unfocus" event and stuff like that
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would make so much stuff so much easier xD
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz its immediate mode
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> thtas a nice feature! unstead of shield / heart
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> thats a nice feature! unstead of shield / heart
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/934040101061812294/unknown.png
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (spectating another)
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> if these new UI items are going to replace hearts/shields on ddrace mode servers, I feel they could benefit from being shown a bit bigger, more like the size of the hearts/shields (they're currently a little bit smaller). maybe that's just me though
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What about vertical placement near left edge? Like vertical toolbar.
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Or just go with hearts removal, so everything moves up
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Making it swap depending on gamemode would be nice
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> off for gamemodes like fng, hearts / shields for vanilla, displayed power ups for ddrace like above
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki  @heinrich5991 a GAMEINFO flag would probably be the best, so the client knows when to use DDraceHUD
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I suggest `GAMEINFOFLAG2_DDRACEHUD`
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We would probably need a bar or something for freeze then, because shields are currently used to determine the rest time of beint frozen
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and of course ddrace hud should only work if server sends a ddnetcharacter
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, i think doesnt matter actually, just the gameinfoflag
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hetzner is increasing server costs due to rising energy costs in germany
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can u ppl pls just allow nuclear reactors again?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell to the smart ppl that decided to shutdown nuclear reactors for coal mines
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wtf? No, we can build some next to your house if you like them that much
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm completely okay with that. You can build them in my garage aswell
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> learath biggest trol
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think reactors just randomly leak radiation?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Modern reactor designs dont even melt down during catastrophic failure
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then lets place some around your house
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said I'm completely okay with that. I was not kidding
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's an absolutely insane proposition when we have a lot of land far away from the middle of the city, but if you think I wouldn't be okay living next to one you are very mistaken
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I have an idea, how about you live next to a coal or LNG power plant
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the coal mines kill way more ppl in average
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even hydro energy
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are entire towns in turkey with people that are born with cancer due to living next to coal power plants
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> BORN with cancer, not getting cancer
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good video
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't come at me with "live next to a reactor than" when living next to other baseload alternatives are literally incompatible with human life
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i thought they use water energy for their servers
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Learath2)
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should it increase
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also green energy is the cheapest still
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They probably can't get all their energy needs from renewables. Most companies that say they use 100% green energy actually use non green energy but at peak contribute back to the grid green energy to make up for it
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we just need better batteries
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The LNG and natural gas crisis is hitting all the countries, it's getting sooo expensive with gasprom limiting output and island nations snatching up all the LNG
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that dont rely on lithium
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but natrium
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can make better batteries fine by me. But we can literally make nuclear reactors right now
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats true
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i thought especially water pump reactors or whatever they use dont have so much disadvantages
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see molten salt batteries, solid state lithium chemistries and oxygen based battery ideas since like I was at the start of highschool
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ofc require quite alot of space
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are expensive
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not like you just build them
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they need 10 years to be built
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and they aren't very modular
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> water pump reactors probs require a dam built, these break and killed already more people than nuclear reactors
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> solarpanels can go anywhere
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They just don't ever get there. Idk whether it's neolibs not seeing value in it or the tech not being there but these batteries are just not being made :/
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bro its germany
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Ryozuki)
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> land of engeneering
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have some trust
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet ur ppl dont trust ur engineering to make nuclear reactors
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when a nuclear reactor explodes, then the land is wasted for hunderets of years
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if water floods stuff, its gone for maybe 1-2 years
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Non-hybrid geothermal and tidal generation look very promising as renewable baseloads, but they are both so far away from being economically viable
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet more floods happened and more ppl died
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, in europe nuclear reactors are very expensive and take an insane amount of time to built
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it's unlikely it will happen now anyway
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope they complete the research on fusion reactors (not fission)
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be epic
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also i think its good that germany tries something the rest of the world doesnt want to
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Long time to build is because of lack of political will
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then we'll see if it works or not
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is it
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at china making insane engineering projects happen in mere months
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coal mines?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in germany every siungle person can delay it by years
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Learath2)
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> by protesting
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 china actually is building the largest wind turbines
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because its more efficient if they are giant
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well trying to solve the energy problem without nuclear energy and coal
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Ryozuki)
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China might be an authoritarian hellhole but after seeing them no one can tell me we cant make huge engineering feats
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/chinese-firm-announces-giant-264-meter-tall-offshore-wind-turbine.html
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it works, germany takes the lead again, if it wont work, we doomed xDDD
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is germany basing their entire baseload around hydro energy?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Would be ideal, since the hearts are useless in FNG but the shields are still used
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mostly wind in the northsea probs in future
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and alot on land
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in south solar is fine too
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you still operated massive natural gas plants
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since solar is so fucking cheap
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gas will probs stay as a side step
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What were the shields used for in fng btw?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> freeze timer
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe when we add a bar fng can use that too
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The stars popping out of you shows it, but the shields help a bit as well
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw @Ryozuki and @Learath2 i think we already discussed the problem with uranium, we'd need other reactor types anyway
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the current one will just suck the rest uranium in a few years and then rip
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> With gameinfoflags, servers would be able to tell the client to either show hearts and shields or the ddrace hud. Default Hearts and shields
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I see
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Asteroid minimg
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just shoot the nuclear waste into space
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh god no
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One launch failure and we pepper earth with nuclear waste
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just funny
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think some ppl think, its easy as that
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just take it and send to space xD
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> https://www.whereisroadster.com/
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm honestly completely okay with burying it underground in a lead+reinforced concrete structure
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just get on board with the nuclear waste and steal the car

13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Driving around in space, sounds funny 🙂
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet the future humans will spent around 2 times the energy they got from nuclear power plants to eleminate the nuclear waste somehow again xD
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Learath2)
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The earth is massive, why would they ever dig up our small nuclear waste graveyard?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs nothing remains untouched
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the earth changes
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 1000 years it might become a problem
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So they will need that small useless hole we dug in bumfuck nowhere finland?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In 20 years we gone from nothing to everyone having internet etc
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In 1000 thinks will change a lot
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Years
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> internet
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wow
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its actually p big ngl
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even in 1k years, why would they ever want to dig up the waste :D
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I understand that the world changes but why would you ever unearth sealed nuclear waste?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it gets into water for example?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why do you thing that all nuclear waste is sealed so well?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most is just in some random mine
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs they had no better idea
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I gueeesss it's perceivable that it could maaybe start leaking but these structures we engineer with expected lifetimes far above the 1k years we are talking about here
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we talk about 1 million years anyway
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> until then earthquakles probs destroyed most of these caves
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not talking about the idiocies of the past. If we are going to throw it like that I'm also against it
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We know a lot more nowadays, and we can engineer structures resistant to all kinds of situations
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think its more likely we use fusion power in 20-30 years than better nuclear energy, but lets wait and see xD
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok both is nuclear energy
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but you know what i mean
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 20-30 years is on the lower end from what I've read, but hopefully we'll have fusion by then. It'd be great
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that will defs change the world alot
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the next step for society xd
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel 100 ghz using 1 terrawatt/h
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt our processing power is limited by power consumption at this point :D
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but we just create supra conductors locally xd
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the cooling probs expensive xD
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dumb
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry, but imo u have a very wrong picture of this
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057816/processors/processor-utilities-and-programs.html
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because that ruins the planet even more, and it will leak through, just because it takes your, or a few human lifetimes doesnt mean the problem is solved
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways, the world is fucked
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so i would not be surprised about this staying non-solved
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are some theories about producing real green energy, without side effects, but those cost a lot and people are afraid to invest before getting the results
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Omg, please stop writing about energy.
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Hetzner now wrote me an email that they have to raise the current rate because energy 
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > The current dramatic rise in energy prices in Germany is leading to a significant increase in costs. Energy costs play a particularly important role for servers.
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > Since the calculation of these servers does not allow any leeway to absorb this coverage gap, we are unfortunately forced to make a price adjustment. Depending on the server, the prices will only be raised as far as necessary.
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > - Hetzner 21.01.2022
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Thanks @Learath2 & Jupstar 😄
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> coincidence, i doubt it
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will leak through? It WILL. Are you god or do you have some numbers? As far as I'm aware modern nuclear waste containment structures are engineered rated for multiple thousands of years
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and what happens in multiple thousands of years?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Omg, please stop writing about energy.
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Hetzner now wrote me an email that they have to raise the current rate because energy gets more expensive in germany now

13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Thanks @Learath2 & Jupstar 😄
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> coincidence, i doubt it
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the whole world is one radioactive sphere
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Avolicious\: that was the begin of our talk too \:D
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> scroll to the top bro
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> great 👍
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> learath also got an email
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Fuck, why do you get emails faster than me 😦
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Omg, please stop writing about Hetzner
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Received it after your talk
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (sarcastic)
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It starts eroding a bit? Just because they are rated to stay completely intact for multiple thousands of years doesnt mean it instantly dumps it's contents afterwards
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what about nuclear fusion? why do you want nuclear fission so bad?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it solves all problems
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because fusion is like atleast 5 decades away?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aha, and why do you want fission so bad if we can also use other methods in this timespan?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Germany at least will not re-activate any nuclear power plants
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and thats very good
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will reactivate the coal mines
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chinas record breaking fusion experiment still was at a whopping -60% efficiency
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao this is an endless debate
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just because something isnt as efficient as other methods doesnt mean they are bad
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Other methods such as pumping millions of tons of co2 in the air?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i kinda doubt hetzner pays so much more energy tbh
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nah, coal mines ofc are also not good
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and germany will also break the coal mining
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i hope they use the money to built 100% green energy
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said -60% you put in 100 energy to start the fusion, the fusion generates 40 energy
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And you know what @Learath2, these debates were happening 30 years ago already. It's sad that the most people dont care.
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw we also have another problem
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, you mean it that way
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a literal net loss of energy and this is like the PEAK fusion generator humanity ever made
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> independent of what energy we will use, just building all the power plants will also generate alot of CO2, bcs we dont shutdown what we have now
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think like 60% of our budget goes to that
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think its senseless to discuss this here btw^^
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> humanity and the earth are fucked, no matter what
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i am happy i dont live a few generations further
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they will have to deal with many problems that we are just pushing backl
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they will have to deal with many problems that we are just pushing back
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt humans will die out bcs of this, but there will be useless wars again xD
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats not what im saying
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably, look at russia and ukraine
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway fokko, dont be so pessimistic, we should just try and see
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but if nobody tries, lol..
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if we then fuck up we've to accept it anyway
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah bcs we always debating that's true \:D
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And thats a false pov imo, i dont want to accept things where i did not put 1 cent into
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its sad
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's also why i'm not against germanys way, if it works, china will follow
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs doesnt want to loose against anybody
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> china ^
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, china is a fucked part of the world anyways
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean its working
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but its fucked
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they defs dont like to accept that a democratic land did better than them
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw jupeyy why u not on disocrd anymore?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imo nuclear reactors push away the problem the longest. Please gimme a call when you find a solution that pushes it away more or entirely removes the problem within this decade
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> votez lfi
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats probably not possible, but as you say, "push away the problem the longest", this is not my mentality
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs chillerdragon invited me here, and in discord i get so many tags about GL drivers not working xD
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@fokkonaut)
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go make some food, need a break from all the nuclear haters
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Mdr
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont like that at all
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> XD
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> xddddddd
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pushing away problems is just stupid imo
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @iParano stop laughing come gores
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> im at work u dummkopf ❤️
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u dummkopf
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> New photos? :kek:
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not making anything interesting, just a grilled cheese
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> grilled on your reactor? :P
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> :justatest:
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iparano xDDDDDDDD
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> 😄

13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeyeye
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> im on your side actually )

14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bigger icons and no health
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> very very nice
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Ye
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @Ryozuki  Shields can spawn only when frozen
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thats cool, but i feel like shields should still be displayed
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> to see precisely when you unfreez
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> to see precisely when you unfreeze
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shields are not precise
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to add a loading bar kinda type
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> who uses shield to know when unfreeze?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> They are not xdd
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> without shield icons you dont see if you hit freeze if
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i need the graphics
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> like
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> if youre getting hooked from above, to unfreeze under freeze
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @bencie btw with stars around u you can know too when unfreeze
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> then i actualyl look at shield icons
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually stars are more accurate
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will see 64 stars if ur frozen 64 seconds
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks funn
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> really? xd
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i never look at stars, but now that you mentioned it thats actually really useful
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i never noticed :dDD
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i never noticed :DDD
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yeah lol
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> a freeze bar coulda ctually look really cool
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> yes +
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta remember this
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Do we need every symbol shown?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It would be clean with only used/active symbols
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i like that theyre all shown
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me too
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i want to add the freeze timer
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the thing missing
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Could be an option to only show active powerups
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more settings = bad
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should try to avoid them
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right @heinrich5991
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How did you implement it? Via gameinfo flag?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut no i just added a return to the health render
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I would have removed lower left points, totally unused, instead of shields
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im adding the flag rn
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I would have removed lower right points, totally unused, instead of shields
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki maybe add a flag for both: Hearts and shields and one for the ddrace hud; if both are active, render the ddrace hud below the hearts and shields
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and defaultly only send the ddracehud on ddnet
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway thats for later
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can say in my mod definitely both would be usefull at the same time
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I heard™ that focusing on nuclear for 2050 is too late anyway, it's mainly a future investment
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. building new nuclear reactors now
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are assuming the usual european speeds of building stuff
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has to be built in europe 😉
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we had actual political will we could do them much faster
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you mean you could accelerate it a bit without sacrificing other stuff
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> projects that span longer than a political term is not a thing politicians care much to speed
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imo
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could accelerate a lot if the government gets involved in the process and the people don't get in the way because they agree
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if my wording makes sense xd
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China could do it in 5 years back in 2015, as far as I'm aware they only got better at it since then
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They also get it made for very cheap because state monopoly
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the kurzgesagt video claims that it's also lack of knowledge on how to build these things
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so unless you let china build them in your country, it might be hard to do so
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> knowledge about nuclear reaction stuff is still kept hidden or smth?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cold war stuff
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not particularly against china building them, but the only reason we are so bad at this is because we ignored them after the chernobyl disaster
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Events like this really make me question how much good democracy does in extremely niche fields like this
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does the average person know about the risk profile of a nuclear reactor?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the reason why we're bad at building nuclear reactors isn't really relevant in the discussion of whether they'd help
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the risk profile of a covid vaccine, in another niche field
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 in spain, most politicians are "allied" by energy companies, so it wouldnt be a surprise in germany is kinda the same, and these energy companies probably run coal and dont want nuclear
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> s / by / to
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> True, so you are saying we just don't have the technology anymore? It is possible that we fell too far behind to make them anymore
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the energy companies in germany got a lot of money because the state forced them to close the nuclear plants IIRC
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In that case we can pay china. Their state monopoly is much more efficient than any private company anyway and they are always happy to knock off a couple million for political leeway
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unrelated to nuclear energy or not, pushing problems away the furthest sounds like a good strategy to me
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what oy would say xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> solving problems sounds good
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> solving the problem is even better, but lacking that option, this sounds good
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> accepted
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since this is such a complicated problem
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but someone also has to test new things out, else we'll never know what the best way could potentially be
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but we dont lack that option xD
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we just dont really know
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah we have options
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> carbon capture will also be important some day
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we also need to suck the CO2 out again
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, so do you have the battery technology that'll make baseload renewables a possibility?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw if either batteries get feasible or tidal energy generation makes a massive technological leap, I'd ofc prefer those aswell. I propose nuclear because 2 decades passed and we still don't have a response to replace baseload coal/gas/nuclear
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> batteries are expensive, but investing more money usually also improved it in the long term goal
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I heard™ that carbon capture is worse in every way than just not emitting the carbon
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> especially ones that don't need lithium
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah the first goal is not emitting it ofc
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@heinrich5991)
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut what is that option?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but trees are sadly pretty uneffective
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nature generally isn't built to work so fast
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we just throw even more energy to it xdd
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lithium and Cobalt mining is absolutely devastating for nature too, they are also horrible socioeconomically
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparentyl `std::filesystem` is also affected by this, but it's allowed by the c++ standard (?!)
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go is also affected, python not
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That'd be so C++, just avoiding the issue by leaving it UB
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess technically for C++ it depends on the vendor of the stdlib/compiler
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/s8ok0h/possible_toctou_vulnerabilities_in/hti8jyt/
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-ion_battery
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since they are more heavy than lithium, they could especially be good for stationary stuff \:D
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, does this not make std::fs pretty much useless? It's quite silly that they've made this decision
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when will someone invent a new type of operating system that focuses on security and speed
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to see my no ring, direct memory access OS
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually the way thinking about kernels could be rethought too
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok there will still be some kind of core kernel, but everything is more direct
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Direct memory access, no rings?? You are looking for TempleOS
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since no userspace
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in a secure manner ofc \:D
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you looked at micro-kernel architectures? I quite like them
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but they are slow
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well in your ringless architecture there wouldn't be context switches, so you can have very performant micro-kernels 😄
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah exactly
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's why it might work in this case
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe i should have said, current ones are usually slow
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt windows also micro kernel?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, "slow" also depends on the application. Nintendo's game consoles have been running micro kernel architectures since the nintendo ds
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently what the NT kernel does is called a "hybrid kernel"
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> test
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true, i just think this is a big chance for rust
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs this is what rust can do while not trading for performance
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> microsoft developed smth like this in c# as something experimental i think
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> let me find it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system)
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i doubt it could beat a well written one in rust
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think the bridge died
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C# kernel? How? I thought C# wasn't even compiled, what does it run on?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nah its not a c# kernel in that sense
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its really just an abstraction, so fuse everything into one big mess
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also dunno if they aimed to be performaned, but i think they wanted to eleminate the way of seperting userspace from kernel
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could be quite interesting especially in applications where extreme performance is wanted like servers
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do wonder how much benefit can be had nowadays though. In the past things like in-kernel webservers were tested and they were indeed very efficient, but with modern syscalls and things like futexes, I wonder how much performance we can get from avoiding the remaining context switches
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think just for research this might already be interesting, rethinking stuff sometimes also helps develop better stuff generally, e.g. other kernels could profit (maybe)
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sure linux is already insanly fast
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe completly new processors would profit from it
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was just about to say that ^^
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> for this thing here it would be really cool if it would be possible/not too much work to only show the icons needed for map?

16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> or do i misunderstand the feature a bit? XD
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4626
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vote for proper namespaced enums!!!
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine being in 2022
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using the enum type on the function signature would make life easier for new and old coders
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does enum class allow values outside the specified ones?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u mean that if a func takes a EMyEnum it accept e.g the magic value 4?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, if it allows EMyEnum::FLAG1 | EMyEnum::FLAG2
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> declares a scoped enumeration type whose underlying type is int (the keywords class and struct are exactly equivalent)
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whether they're still essentially ints
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the underlying type is int
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i guess yes
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "I guess" is bad in C++
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be UB ^^
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You need to write your own overloaded operator| (and presumably operator& etc.).
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Flags operator|(Flags lhs, Flags rhs) 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     return static_cast<Flags>(static_cast<char>(lhs) | static_cast<char>(rhs));
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 found it
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32578638/how-to-use-c11-enum-class-for-flags
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Conversion of an integer to an enumeration type (scoped or not) is well-defined as long as the value is within the range of enumeration values (and UB otherwise; [expr.static.cast]/p10). For enums with fixed underlying types (this includes all scoped enums; [dcl.enum]/p5), the range of enumeration values is the same as the range of values of the underlying type ([dcl.enum]/p8). The rules are trickier if the underlying type is not fixed - 
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found this blog post https://walbourn.github.io/modern-c++-bitmask-types/
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love how c++ looks so ugly
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```cpp
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enum FLAGS_FOR_MYFUNCTION
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {

17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the modern way
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What about this approach?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> #define COLORS {red, green , blue}
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> enum Color COLORS;

19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> But one hot encoding style still too be decided.
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Monthly reminder to buy some more Bitcoin …
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't do it
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially not by advice from random people on the internet
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why would you call chillerdragon random? wtf
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know chillerdragon well enough to take investment advice from him
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> buy eth so mine goes up in value
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i hope no one listened to you last month
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/934194171424686080/unknown.png
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> BUY THE DIP ♿ ♿
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hey it's not investment advice but I did make almost 3k euros just buying random dips 😄
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the trick is to actually not hold on to it 😄
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (remember to pay taxes if you hold bitcoin or similar for less than a year, in DE. can't speak for other countries)
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> (I am not a registerd financial advisor)
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> lul
22:44 <+ChillerDragon> why would you hold bitcoin less than a year? diamond hands
22:45 <+ChillerDragon> @ZombieToad grep irc logs and plot my advises on a btc chart
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when would you sell though?
22:45 <+ChillerDragon> when im 60 and want to buy a house
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then your advice can't really be evaluated until then
22:46 <+ChillerDragon> Im just letting ya guys now that btc is still a thing had a 3 months down trend and 10% drop today so its nice opportunity to take the dip in case anyone of yo forgot that btc is still a thing
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll buy a massive amount of bitcoin and if it goes down I'll sue you for my losses
22:48 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks for the official financial advice chiller :3
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> fak
23:03 <+ChillerDragon> btw i take the grep logs and plot on btc graph back i just did it :D

23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> this kind of code isn't complicated, nor is it ugly imho, but it's still the kind of code you would write as a library writer.
