00:49 <+coffee> hi there :_
00:49 <+coffee> eeeee: I saw your work on teewebs.net
00:49 <+coffee> it's an amazing thing
00:49 <+coffee> thanks is the network layer based on websocket ?
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> coffee: probably yes, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/56c42c3c31aa6cc0838d4d5f0eaefe688d13a211 )
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÉ
00:51 <+coffee> it's really fast for a TCP client :)
01:34 <+eeeee> coffee: yes it's currently using websockets but i'm trying to port it to webrtc
01:35 <+eeeee> not sure i'll have enough patience though, webrtc its a massively overengineered solution for tunneling raw udp
01:40 <+coffee> did someone success in this task ?
01:40 <+coffee> :p

18:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #831: Add CMake config option `PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS` (master...pr_ddnet_cmake_prefer_bundled) https://git.io/v74ln
18:43 <@deen> github unusable right now
18:44 <@heinrich5991> it works for me surprisingly
18:44 <@heinrich5991> https://status.github.com/ < this still shows 0% reachability
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> lovely unicorn
19:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: it seems you deleted the freetype binary for mac again
19:09 <@deen> i did?
19:10 <@heinrich5991> you need to execute git submodule update instead of adding the submodule after you updated your local git repository
19:10 <@heinrich5991> in commit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c6a5a7dcb3bc1825d0c533859dfd6841d2d80b81
19:10 <@heinrich5991> (you can probably view the commit locally if github doesn't work for you)
19:11 <@deen> i never touched the ddnet-libs file
19:11 <@deen> that's not even a file, that's a directory
19:11 <@deen> so i need to take special care of updating the ddnet-libs submodule every time i make a commit?
19:11 <@heinrich5991> yes, not touching it and adding it to a commit (or using git commit -a) reverts the change
19:12 <@deen> that seems like a pretty stupid design to me
19:12 <@heinrich5991> (unless you use git submodule --update)
19:12 <@deen> before each commit?
19:12 <@heinrich5991> yes, I haven't figured out why it is that way either
19:12 <@heinrich5991> (yes @ design)
19:12 <@deen> So now I need to run 2 commands every time to build ddnet instead of 1 and also 2 commands to commit instead of 1
19:13 <@heinrich5991> you should check what you commit or use git add to specify what you commit
19:13 <@deen> seems like we're moving in the wrong direction
19:13 <@deen> why should I check when I remember what I changed?
19:14 <@heinrich5991> because it's a good idea anyway? even when you have no submodules
19:14 <@deen> actually after each change I need to remove the build directory or can cmake auto-update it?
19:14 <@deen> well, i don't expect git to make changes on its own
19:14 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't make changes, it doesn't update the submodule automatically
19:15 <@heinrich5991> we could add git submodule update to the cmakefile, it's probably a good idea anyway
19:15 <@deen> so just make the submodule follow master, always?
19:15 <@deen> nope, that's not a good idea
19:15 <@heinrich5991> why not?
19:15 <@deen> the build tool should not change the git repository on its own
19:16 <@heinrich5991> that doesn't change the git repository
19:16 <@heinrich5991> so, what a submodule is: another git repository, within the folder structure of the bigger one
19:16 <@heinrich5991> you can check out your own branches etc., commit stuf
19:17 <@heinrich5991> git submodule update checks out the revision that the parent wants
19:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: and no, you don't need to remove the cmake build directory, especially not after https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/821
19:19 <@deen> ok, so just 4 commands to test if a change builds: cd build && cmake .. && make -jx (no autodetection of number of cpus) && cd ..
19:20 <@deen> compared to "bam release" previously
19:20 <@deen> or even just "bam"
19:20 <@heinrich5991> if you want, you can do cmake . && make if you want
19:20 <@deen> ah, some cmake projects gave me errors when i did that
19:21 <@heinrich5991> or just cmake --build build
19:21 <@heinrich5991> if you already have a build directory there
19:21 <@deen> and having to list every single file instead of glob is also terrible in cmake
19:21 <@heinrich5991> yes
19:22 <@heinrich5991> but I think that's a design tradeoff from supporting things like IDE projects
19:22 <@deen> it's not that expensive to scan a directory sturcture and check if some files were added
19:22 <@heinrich5991> no, but the build tool has to support it
19:23 <@heinrich5991> (cmake doesn't drive the build, it generates config files for other tools)
19:24 <@heinrich5991> but I think that's on of CMake's upsides, you can just generate your MSVC++ 20xx project and press compile
19:24 <@deen> yeah, that's their design mistake
19:24 <@heinrich5991> previously, you had to fiddle with the command line on windows
19:24 <@deen> well, i don't care about msvc++
19:24 <@heinrich5991> well, I care for the different systems equally, even if I don't use them
19:24 <@deen> so how do i fix the ddnet repo again now?
19:25 <@deen> ddnet-libs looks like a directory
19:25 <@deen> the .git file tells me some other path, but not sure what to do there
19:26 <@deen> git submodule update does nothing
19:27 <@heinrich5991> git checkout master in there
19:27 <@deen> ok, done

19:29 <@heinrich5991> now it's even older. git pull master
19:29 <@heinrich5991> (think of it as a git repository)
19:29 <@deen> git pull origin I guess
19:29 <@deen> yeah, but my point is that I don't want to keep track of 2 git repos at once
19:29 <@heinrich5991> yea, that
19:29 <@deen> I just want it to always stay at origin/master and get auto-updated

19:33 <@heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/a/37383406/870079 < if you want to hack your way around this
19:51 <@heinrich5991> deen: btw, you don't have to re-execute cmake
19:52 <@heinrich5991> it will re-execute itself on `make` if something changed
19:53 <@heinrich5991> (so it's just `make` then, if you want an in-source build)

22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Anyone want to work on the emoji PR?
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @CookieMichal ^
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @CookieMichal is out of home for few months
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> So, someone else can fix it and we merge
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> if there is interest in this emoji stuff
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Personally I don't care much either way, but people will probably like it
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <EryX> Ingame?
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes, in chat: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6313377/26085953/04686d70-39e8-11e7-95e0-1f481a224718.png
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <EryX> Pls don't add too many üò¶
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> xd that will look so weird for old clients
22:44 <+Socialdarwinist> Are you willing to implement Complex Text Rendering then too? That is more important, so localizations and chats in Thai, Hindi etc. are possible. For nobody needs Emoji, but you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúNoboy needs Thai or Hindi‚Äù.
22:46 <@heinrich5991> there are definitely people who want to have emoji
22:46 <@heinrich5991> just as there are people who want Thai or Hindi
22:52 <+Socialdarwinist> The emoji is stuff is only invented by Unicode to promote their actual script encoding. Offering scripts is paramount ‚Äì what people want is like always the product of delusion.
22:53 <@heinrich5991> emoji stuff was added because it was contained in some japanese encoding
22:54 <+Socialdarwinist> That would be too trifling a reason for such a marketing campaign that surrounds the emoji issue.
22:55 <@heinrich5991> marketing campaign? from unicode? I doubt it
23:03 <+Socialdarwinist> The money flows from the Adopt-a-character program, which results in almost only emojis being encoded, to script encoding: http://blog.unicode.org/2016/06/encoding-mayan-script-your-adopt.html
23:14 <+Socialdarwinist> Look at the press coverage: Emojis are what journalists can catch about encoding. It has been crucial for the public portrayal of the Unicode work, because journalists in the Western world are generally college dropouts and pseudointellectual punks who can get nary an idea about context-sensitive shaping or the problems of bidirectional text, and even if they can, do not have the dexterity to express it because of their 
23:14 <+Socialdarwinist> addiction of breaking all down to 140 characters, and because it is easier to appease advertising clients which such rather than the General Punctuation block.
23:32 <@heinrich5991> without looking at the press coverage, I know that a lot of people use emojis
23:32 <@heinrich5991> so even without trying to insult journalists, one can see that emojis apparantly carry some importance
23:36 <+eeeee> no it's a unicode conspiracy to infect your brain with emoji. repost this 10 times to warn your friends
23:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> REPTILIANS!!!!
23:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> lol
23:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> obama was a shape shifting lizard
23:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hi @Learath2
23:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hi @Ryozuki
23:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Socialdarwinist> Surely, a Zionist plot to mock the prohibition of pictures in Islam, making people support icons before they support Arabic writing. That is at least the story I could sell Press TV. Because they‚Äôre journalists.
23:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why are you talking about this, on dev channel?
23:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> GO to tv
23:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Socialdarwinist> It is about what to implement first üò¨
23:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> phaha
23:41 <@Learath2> @Savander do you not believe in shape shifting lizards setting the agenda?
23:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2, I'm one of them, tsii
23:42 <@Learath2> deen is also a shape shifting lizard trying to slow down the ddnet project so we do not discover the ultimate truth
23:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nobody knows
23:42 <+eeeee> Ô∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑Ω
23:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i don't have a font that can haz those characters on my computer

23:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I stay above the law
23:45 <+Ryozuki> @heinrich5991, oh now that you are here, i can with cmake but i get an error when executing the server/client, here is a diff between bam and cmake (bam works) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/341237096742125568/DIFF.txt , this is the error "could not find entry point of the process "_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringlcSt11char_traitslcESalcEE9_M_createERjj"
23:45 <+Ryozuki> i can compile with*
23:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ryozuki, you tried after last commits?
23:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> with mingw
23:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I saw, that they changed something in cmake
23:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> not related i think, sec i try
23:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Ryozuki: that exact error happened for me after a gcc upgrade, they changed the C++ linking couple of versions ago
23:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> : O O
23:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> see¬™!
23:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> had to recompile many libraries with the new ABI
23:47 <@Learath2> GCC 4.7 to be exact
23:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Socialdarwinist> DDNet could get banned in the KSA or other countries for implementing emojis. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3571462/Islamic-preacher-BANS-text-emojis-Muslims-angels-don-t-halos-don-t-know-devil-really-looks-like.html You could excuse yourself by supporting Arabic script first.
23:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> -- The C compiler identification is GNU 5.3.0 -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 5.3.0
23:48 <@Learath2> might be our bundled libraries linked with < 4.7 gcc
23:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is there a fix? or i have to get back to 4.7
23:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :(
23:48 <@Learath2> hey i have no idea if that's the problem
23:49 <@Learath2> that's the problem i had
23:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> back to windows 95 then üò¶

23:54 <+Ryozuki> sry :P
23:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you sure, you ccloned libs to? üòõ
23:55 <+Ryozuki> yes
23:56 <@Learath2> Ryozuki: you sure you have python in your PATH?
23:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> something went wrooooong

23:56 <+Ryozuki> Python 3.5.3
23:56 <+Ryozuki> im sure :P
23:56 <@Learath2> Ryozuki: if you are using mingw are you also using MSYS?
23:57 <+Ryozuki> not that i know?
23:58 <@Learath2> are you using windows cmd?
23:58 <+Ryozuki> yes
23:58 <@Learath2> that's garbage
23:58 <@Learath2> never worked well
23:58 <+Ryozuki> im using cmder
23:58 <+Ryozuki> but that doesnt change anything
23:59 <@Learath2> try MSYS included in mingw or Git Bash it also includes MinTTY with MSYS which is great
23:59 <+Ryozuki> git bash? ill try
