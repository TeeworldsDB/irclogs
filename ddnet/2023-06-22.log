00:16 <+bridge> <chairn> did github just change its look ?
00:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> earlier today or a few days ago for me
00:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps a gradual rollout?
00:18 <+bridge> <chairn> just got it right now
00:18 <+bridge> <chairn> where's dark mode ?
00:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/settings/appearance
01:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> is dark dimmed new
01:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> i don't really like the dark look on github but i might use that
08:42 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yep
09:18 <+bridge> <reitw> Is it up-to-date?
09:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no.
09:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah oops
09:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> my bad
09:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> for some reason placed spectator_info in loop xd
09:38 <+bridge> <gerdoe> teehee
09:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah no
09:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> still the same
09:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give example code that gives the error?
09:57 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust

13:06 <+bridge> <cauldron1> @jupeyy_keks hi I am asking you directly, because I know you are familiar with the demo render. I want to render a demo similar to this video: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxaatQ8twQC4FBRugJImdzcJogwhhG_dMB
13:06 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Is this possible with the current release?
13:06 <+bridge> <cauldron1> The background is: i am trying to finish the map notelebro right now and have a lot of failed attempts saved as a demo. (I have bound my kill bind to stop recording, kill and start recording a new demo). If I have a succesfull run, I want to render all the unsuccessful attempts into the successful demo too. How to do it?
13:13 <+bridge> <cauldron1> My initial idea is to make the demo render capable of rendering ghost. Then convert the failed attempt demos to ghosts, and then make it possible to have multiple ghosts rendered at once.
13:16 <+bridge> <totar> I was working on this for a little bit, it's quite annoying with the current demo system but not impossible
13:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Tldr without video ?
13:17 <+bridge> <totar> Rendering more than 64 tees would be hard unless they're ghost files
13:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah so many tees at once
13:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah ghost files probably easier in this case
13:19 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Will ghost files render in demos?
13:19 <+bridge> <totar> I was thinking demo files would be easier but maybe not
13:19 <+bridge> <cauldron1> And can I have multiple ghosts? (Yes right?)
13:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If not forcing that is probs still easier
13:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Than process multi demo at once
13:20 <+bridge> <cauldron1> But how to convert a demo into a ghost
13:20 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Its a manual demo, recording starts after respawn, not after racestart
13:22 <+bridge> <cauldron1> I could also change my client to save a ghost when I kill (not just finishh)
13:22 <+bridge> <learath2> (There are no tools for this and the formats involved are not very easy to parse, it'll take a lot of work to chop up a demo of many attempts into many ghosts of single attempts)
13:22 <+bridge> <learath2> You'll have a better time modifying the client to record a ghost per attempt at the first place
13:22 <+bridge> <cauldron1> And then render the ghosts in the demo
13:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean u could maybe load demo. Skip to a specific moment render all tees. Close demo go to next etc.
13:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But even that is not easy to implement and probably show
13:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Slow
13:24 <+bridge> <cauldron1> I have a lit if demos, now I am better and don‚Äôt fail a lot anymore.
13:24 <+bridge> <cauldron1> I have a lot of demos, now I am better and don‚Äôt fail a lot anymore.
13:24 <+bridge> <learath2> You can render with a green background, invisible map tiles and ghostify in post üòÑ
13:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What about rendering the background without tees then all demos same free cam coordinates and let a video edit software do the magic ?
13:25 <+bridge> <cauldron1> This would only work with a static view. Like zooming out. But with a moving ‚Äúcamera‚Äù the tee will be inside walls
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> You could do it somewhat easily if you:
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> 
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> Save camera movement from one demo
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> 
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> Record all the other demos with that camera movement and don't render the background or the map.
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> 
13:25 <+bridge> <totar> Combine them in a video editor
13:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Export the camera move yeah
13:26 <+bridge> <cauldron1> How to do free camera coordinates
13:26 <+bridge> <learath2> Anyway, no matter how you approach it, very annoying to mildly annoying problem
13:26 <+bridge> <totar> lol all 3 of us typed the same thing
13:27 <+bridge> <totar> Setting the camera position to a ghost should be doable without much work
13:27 <+bridge> <totar> Then render demo files
13:28 <+bridge> <cauldron1> That‚Äôs why I am asking you, to find a not annoying way
13:29 <+bridge> <learath2> I would use the camera move from the finished best run.
13:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Render all other demos with that camera move but everything transparent except tees.
13:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Render the good run with only bg, then only tees.
13:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Layer them together
13:30 <+bridge> <learath2> That's the least amount of coding I can imagine this project entailing
13:30 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Thanks
13:30 <+bridge> <cauldron1> I‚Äôll try that
13:31 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Do I have to edit the demo file directly to hide stuff or can I do that in the client?
13:31 <+bridge> <learath2> I'd export the camera move as a list of coordinates per tick btw
13:32 <+bridge> <learath2> You'll need to code those. I think with the vk renderer you just need to change some shaders to get invisible bg and tiles. @jupeyy_keks right?
13:33 <+bridge> <totar> just remove render map layers it's like 1 line
13:34 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Couldn‚Äôt I ‚Äúspoof‚Äù the map of the demo and remove tiles
13:35 <+bridge> <learath2> You can try. Patch out the crc check and use an empty map with green bg, but then you'll need to chroma key out the green
13:36 <+bridge> <learath2> I think editing the shader or jjst removing the map layers render line is easier
13:36 <+bridge> <learath2> s\/jjst/just/
13:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With ogl it's probably easier ^^
13:40 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Couldn‚Äôt I ‚Äúspoof‚Äù the map of the demo and remove tiles
13:41 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Ty anyway Ill show you my results
13:42 <+bridge> <learath2> With vk you don't need to recompile though. Why do you think gl would be easier?
13:46 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah the vk shaders are compiled, right
13:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah VK only knows spirv
13:51 <+bridge> <learath2> nvm, this is easier in code, we use the same shader for stuff like map items
13:55 <+bridge> <hus3h> empty entities asset + cl_text_entities 0 + green background might do the trick without editing the client or demo
13:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Isn't the camera movement the biggest problem?
13:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It has to match in all demos
13:57 <+bridge> <learath2> You still get stuff like map items, doors etc
14:00 <+bridge> <hus3h> indeed that will still need to be coded or edited in the demos if possible
14:01 <+bridge> <hus3h> oh didn't think of that
14:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> spirv best
14:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm has spirv target too iirc

16:06 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how to solve this
16:08 <+bridge> <deen> This PR fixed it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6730
16:08 <+bridge> <deen> Are you up-to-date?
17:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Interesting why this was needed all of a sudden
17:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/error-windows-ok-loading-gif-16959051
17:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> windows
17:45 <+bridge> <deen> VS update in github's windows agents
17:46 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah but why in the new version of vs we need to link to ntdll explicitly?
18:04 <+bridge> <texnonik> would like to select many groups in editor .... sry if it's not possible .
18:17 <+bridge> <deen> Maybe the old version linked to it implicitly
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> svelte is better than react btw
19:11 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yo amigos anyone know what im doing wrong with the CMakeLists here? It gives me this error even though as far as i can tell the files are sorted and all in the cmakelists file
19:11 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1121487599857578187/image.png
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it sadly doesnt use the directory like sorting
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but instead purely ascii based afaik
19:13 <+bridge> <BillionRay> hmm but isnt it in the right place still? since behavior... starts with a 'b'
19:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the items in itself
19:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks bot alert
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> VULKAN=OFF triggers me more here
19:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> ahaha
19:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> my old ass pc doesnt even support vulkan
19:15 <+bridge> <BillionRay> got an amd gpu from like 2012
19:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never heard of that year
19:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2012 wow
19:16 <+bridge> <BillionRay> AMD Radeon HD 7770 D:
19:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> also thanks, i got the order right finally. Bit of an annoying way to list source files IMO, though I'm not an expert on cmake
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not cmake related
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> someone simply decided it like this
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah just accept, its easier xd
19:21 <+bridge> <robyt3> it just stops unnecessary bike-shedding discussions about the correct order if it's forced to be sorted
19:22 <+bridge> <BillionRay> @jupeyy_keks what do you think of doing like this vs having a CMakeLists per directory?
19:22 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i see
19:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, sounds annoying too
19:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to find them all

19:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> ^ currently a bug
19:40 <+bridge> <louis.place> ninja cooldown indicator still isn't fixed
19:41 <+bridge> <louis.place> i believe it's still in the top left
19:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's by design (?)
19:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you link the issue?
19:41 <+bridge> <louis.place> it's impossible to see when you're focused on your tee
19:41 <+bridge> <louis.place> idk if there's one, will check later
19:43 <+bridge> <louis.place> making the ninja countdown with the bar might be hard
19:44 <+bridge> <louis.place> making it as usable as it was with stars
19:45 <+bridge> <murpi> Theres a PR which moves the below the tee IIRC
19:45 <+bridge> <murpi> Theres a PR which moves the bar below the tee IIRC

19:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> xD
19:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> good bug
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what "standard" binary serialization formats are there? which should I use when?
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also know ASN.1 and protobuf
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Values are encoded in a format that is suitable not only for transmission over a network and persistence to disk, but also for zero-copy in-memory traversal. That is, you can completely skip serialization and deserialization! It's in this sense that Cap'n Proto is "infinity times faster" than alternatives like Protocol Buffers.
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ASN.1 is standard but incredibly looked down upon for reasons I don't know
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://capnproto.org/encoding.html
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cap n proto is made by the guy who made protocol buffers
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and left google
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so when should I use capnproto?
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is there tooling support? can I read it without a schema?
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. can wireshark decode capnproto?
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rpc
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like protocol buffers i guess
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just found it out thanks to a coworker
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so calls between different programming languages, basically
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ?
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> or over the network? or both?
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> both i guess
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont know
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Like Data, but the content must be valid UTF-8, and the last byte of the content must be zero. The encoding allows bytes other than the last to be zero, but some applications (especially ones written in languages that use NUL-terminated strings) may truncate at the first zero.
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> weird to require null termination. I guess this is so that C can use the stuff with zero copies
20:31 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> is there a way to not render any bullets
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> Did he leave google because they made protobuf too bloated?
