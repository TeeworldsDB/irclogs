11:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 ae78518 def: Another fix for mariadb 10
11:40 <@deen> Somehow the /rank query is really slow (0.5 seconds)
11:47 <@deen> got it down to 0.0
11:48 <@deen> looking good again
11:48 < meow_> and buggy i think, maybe it was a temporary bug caused by anything, but as i wrote rank after i finished FaCe with laxa on one day it displayed 1. rank. after a few days it displayed 12. rank for me and 35. rank for laxa, dont know why.. :<
11:48 <@deen> meow_: did you play on EUR?
11:48 <@deen> i should just have fixed that, see the ddnet-commits message above^^
11:48 <@deen> i switched to mariadb 10 for EUR and somehow my old queries are buggy with it
11:50 < meow_> kk, if you already fixed it now its ok nevertheless

11:51 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 0a9b0b1 def: Significantly improve performance of /rank
12:00 <@deen> I guess I didn't notice /rank being slow before because our database was much smaller
12:04 < meow_> Its usual things seems to work proper and with good performance before they have to organize such big amount of data like ddnet
12:05 <@deen> it's not that big, the calculations is just stupid^^
12:05 <@deen> we have about 300,000 ranks
12:24 < meow_> never worked with github, first of all i have to became acquainted with it
12:43 <@deen> i can decrease everyone's ping by 5 ms but ingame it's shown 5 ms higher

13:01 <@deen> any suggestions about how to fix the ping display?

13:44 < laxadedi> go smoke with me
13:44 < laxadedi> if you have a smartphone we can webca xD
13:45 < meow_> how ?
13:45 < laxadedi> skype ?
13:45 < meow_> viber?
13:45 < meow_> lol.
13:45 < laxadedi> Hu ?
13:45 < meow_> my 3G isnt that fast
13:45 <@deen> Comparison: http://ddnet.tw/old.png & http://ddnet.tw/new.png
13:45 <@deen> Look at pred value, Prediction margin and Gametime margin
13:46 < laxadedi> meow_: too bad, it would have been fun to smoke at the same time xD
13:48 < meow_> i only see a change @pred, whats different on the other values? 
13:48 <@deen> they're less jumpy
13:48 <@deen> more constant ping
13:48 < meow_> ah nice, you mean the graph
13:48 <@deen> yes
13:48 < meow_> indeed less waves
13:48 <@deen> now i have to find a way to fix the ping in scoreboard
13:49 <@deen> it has always been wrong
13:49 <@deen> when i lag more, my ping is shown lower
13:49 < meow_> whats shown on scoreboard when your ping (pred) is like 34 like in your case?
13:49 < meow_> lol
13:50 <@deen> i think it shows 38
13:50 <@deen> but actually my ping is 24
13:50 <@deen> or maybe 30
13:50 < meow_> strange
13:51 < Maple> hi
13:52 <@deen> hi
13:52 < meow_> hi
13:52 <@deen> anything wrong, Mr. Maple?
13:52 < laxadedi> hi
13:52 < meow_> but if you get the correct ping why cant you display this on the scoreboard?
13:52 < Maple> ehh
13:52 < Maple> what could be wrong
13:52 <@deen> this isn't the ping, it's the prediction
13:52 < meow_> what means prediction ?
13:53 <@deen> Maple: I changed a lot of server stuff, i thought they might be misbehaving
13:53 < Maple> nah
13:53 < Maple> all good
13:53 <@deen> meow_: it means how far ahead your client predicts your own movement, so how delayed you see other tees moving
13:53 < Maple> im preparing the tournament map i was talking about 6 months ago
13:53 <@deen> Maple: haha
13:53 < Maple> its a work of art
13:53 < Maple> transcends a meaning
13:53 < Maple> in my opinion
13:53 < Maple> its some kind of contemporary maps
13:55 < Maple> whats special about this
13:56 < Maple> is that i mapped the map
13:56 < Maple> over two distincts periods of time
13:56 < Maple> so my mindset evolved
13:56 < Maple> the maps gets disturbing
13:57 < Maple> anyways youll get what i mean
13:57 < Maple> hopefully you wont think i did random shit
13:59 <@deen> no idea, i don't test maps anyway :P
13:59 < Maple> oh damn

14:00 < Maple> ttyl
14:50 <@deen> hm, can't update the block servers, they haven't been empty in the last 8 days it seems
14:51 < meow_> sounds good xD
14:52 < meow_> just do a quick broadcast and tell'em that there is a update which requires a server restart or something like that ?
14:53 <@deen> i prefer automatic restarts. it's nothing important anyway
14:53 <@deen> just wanted to see how much of a difference my changes made
14:53 <@deen> because cpu load has dropped a lot i think
15:26 < KinG_> hellow
15:26 < KinG_> deen: a question
15:27 < KinG_> deen: with a ubuntu 14.0.4 64bit and a website running on it (apache,xamp)is it possible to to run  ddnet on it? with gui
15:28 <@deen> yeah, should be
15:29 < KinG_> deen: it's not my vps it's my friends and now installing ubuntu on it can u install gui and xamp apache server or site stuff and ddnet on it? :D

20:12 <@deen> NICOS: it's annoying when you write useless comments in IRC, forum PM, forum threads
20:13 < Maple> deen is trying to tell you you're a worthless piece of trash, sorry
20:13 < NICOS> xd
20:13 < NICOS> yea, i know, but i trying to begin more poupular XD

20:21 < NICOS> beh.. bye XD
20:27 < Maple> i dont get why i get banned but people like that dont
20:30 <@deen> Maple: who bans you?
20:30 < Maple> people sometimes
20:31 < Maple> once welf was trolling me and then we got in a fight
20:31 < Maple> and i ended up getting banned
20:41 < Maple> sad story
20:43 <@deen> you seem to have survived it quite fine
20:43 <@deen> i haven't heard any complaints yet about the higher ping in scoreboard
21:00 < o_be_one> Maple, you are a level designer ?
21:00 < o_be_one> sometime Maple you play like if you was alone on the map, i've already told you about that ...
21:01 < o_be_one> some noobs like me wants to try, to learn ... be a little more patient ^^
21:04 < o_be_one> or ask to let you do it cause it takes to long time
21:04 < o_be_one> i think you can understand when it's a novice map ...
21:04 < eeeee> there really should be bonus points if you finish teamed up with a noob
21:05 < o_be_one> deen, i think your community seem to going a little elitist i've seen
21:05 < o_be_one> eeeee, yeah it's a good idea
21:06 < o_be_one> ive tried your sound feature, thats AWESOME :D
21:06 <@deen> o_be_one: ddnet always has had a large elitist subcommunity
21:07 <@deen> but you get points for finishing maps, no matter how quickly, so many are also nice and play with a bunch of noobs
21:08 < Learath2> uhm is this NICOS guy healthy ?
21:09 <@deen> he's just a kid i think
21:09 < Learath2> how old do you presume ?
21:09 <@deen> 12-14
21:09 < o_be_one> last time i was angry about a "pro" player on a novice map
21:10 < o_be_one> just doing fast and letting you frozen ...
21:10 <@deen> pro players that don't want to help should go into a team
21:10 <@deen> then they don't disturb the rest
21:10 < o_be_one> in some minutes, we was like 3 or 4 tees telling him is not a good player by dont helping just the time is here
21:10 <@deen> Learath2: there are worse people I'd say: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=647
21:10 < o_be_one> so he has helped after that.
21:10 < Learath2> its not their responsibility to help you
21:11 < o_be_one> deen, he was playing with his dummy
21:11 < o_be_one> i havent problem with pro going faster than us
21:11 < o_be_one> i have just a problem when a pro doesnt help when hes next to you
21:11 <@deen> o_be_one: tell him about /team next time, he'll be happy to know
21:12 < Learath2> dont know if you have a rule about that but he just doesn't have to help you
21:12 < o_be_one> Learath2, on novice server i think it needs a more "coop" mind
21:12 < Learath2> deal with it ...
21:12 < o_be_one> and its in the motd and "say"
21:12 <@deen> ddnet has no rules i think
21:12 <@deen> they definitely don't have to help you
21:12 < o_be_one> i have not really problem with that, my skills allow me to finish maps with only my dummy on novice serv
21:12 <@deen> as long as they don't block you, it's fine
21:13 < o_be_one> just i hate when a pro is hammering me to go before me when he came after me on a part
21:13 < Learath2> eh thats just rude
21:13 < o_be_one> i hate that effect of "move your ass i'm pro i have priority on you."
21:13 < o_be_one> deen, so change your server say telling to dont let noobs alone or frost
21:14 < o_be_one> you have some messages to fix.
21:14 < Learath2> used to have people like that on encore servers back in 0.5.2
21:14 <@deen> o_be_one: what?
21:14 < o_be_one> i only play USA DDrace
21:14 < o_be_one> DDNet
21:14 < o_be_one> and there is some message rotation telling to dont let noobs in back of us, etc.
21:15 < o_be_one> and these messages invites to play in coop
21:15 <@deen> o_be_one: those messages on the bottom are not rules you must follow, they're just what i consider reasonable and how i would WANT people to behave
21:15 < o_be_one> yes thats the mind you want on your community
21:15 < o_be_one> and i'm totally agree with that
21:16 < o_be_one> its not a rule yeah, it cant be have some rules cause there is no admins, only players can moderate
21:17 < o_be_one> deen do you need a Canadian server or FRA server more ?
21:17 <@deen> Are there many Canadian players?
21:18 <@deen> I wouldn't want a Canadian server just for you and Maple
21:18 <@deen> And about FRA: I think GER and EUR are good enough
21:21 < o_be_one> lol sure
21:21 < o_be_one> but i like Maples skin :D
21:23 < o_be_one> deen, i can give you a cad vps, and try its free ...
21:24 < o_be_one> you have nothing to lost, only some time
21:24 < o_be_one> nothing to loose* (tired :D)
21:24 <@deen> lose*
21:24 <@deen> It's a good day when USA gets 30 players at a time already, hmm
21:25 <@deen> ask Maple what he thinks
21:25 <@deen> I don't have much to do with the North American community anyway
21:27 <@deen> oh, nicos actually uploaded his new skin: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=657&p=5747
21:27 <@deen> old one for reference: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=644
21:29 <@deen> oh wait, he made another thread: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=656
21:29 < Maple> i dont mind playing alone in a canadian server lol
21:29 <@deen> so yeah, that's what I mean by spam
21:29 < Maple> i always wished for a good ping
21:30 <@deen> ok then, let's set it up, o_be_one 
21:30 <@deen> it's your responsibility to find new players for it, Maple!
21:31 < Maple> ayt
21:31 < Maple> ill bring all my fanboys with me
21:31 < Maple> o_be_one: the reason pros hate noob is history
21:31 < o_be_one> i'm your fanboy Maple :D
21:31 < Maple> xD
21:32 < Maple> pros started nice and willing to help
21:32 <@deen> and then the war happened?
21:32 < o_be_one> deen, wich OS you use ? Debian 7 ?
21:32 <@deen> o_be_one: yes, perfect
21:32 < Maple> everything changed when the noob nation attacked
21:32 < Maple> they killed the pros in races
21:32 < Maple> and they lost hope in them
21:33 < Maple> so now they consider them as a source of danger
21:33 < eeeee> sounds like the only way to end the conflict is to get a pro princess marry a noob
21:34 < Maple> hot
21:34 < Maple> lets go get kayumi
21:34 < Maple> definetly the proest girl player
21:35 <@deen> Maple: what about booni and kati?!
21:35 < Maple> nope
21:36 < Maple> kayumi
21:36 <@deen> i heard you weren't invited to her gB meeting :P
21:46 < Maple> hahaha
21:47 < Maple> racism is no joke
21:48 < Maple> kayumi used to like me
21:48 < Maple> but now she hates me
21:48 < Maple> because i hate saavik
21:48 < Maple> oh drama
21:58 < o_be_one> deen, what spec you need ?
21:59 < o_be_one> lol eeeee nice, you need to produce a movie :D
22:01 <@deen> o_be_one: 1 stable core, 512 MB memory, 10 GB disk, stable network
