00:13 < eeeee> deen: yeah sometimes i wonder if porting tw to sdl2 first would be easier
00:14 <@deen> i did that a few times already
00:14 <@deen> but never ended up with something that made me 100% happy
00:14 <@deen> and then i get tired of all this sdl stuff
00:14 < eeeee> i got tired of it before even starting

15:17 < o_be_one> hiall
15:19 <@deen> hi
15:20 < o_be_one> how are you deen ?
15:22 <@deen> Fine, finally released https://github.com/def-/nimes
15:23 <@deen> and you?
15:23 < o_be_one> you live for nimes i think ^^
15:24 <@deen> hm?
15:24 < o_be_one> i'm a little tired, but it's weekend now. Today i must work on a monitoring solution for my company, i'm trying a new product from "SavoirFaireLinux" Montreal, named Kaji and based ok Shinken, Nagvis, Grafana, InfluxDB ... If it's awesome how i hope, i'll put it on r0x.fr i think
18:40 <@deen> eeeee: teewebs shows no servers?
19:24 < Learath2> broken for me too
19:43 <@deen> maybe I should try fixing it myself? I think the server was running on GER2
19:44 <@deen> probably just have to restart it
19:45 <@deen> Hm, better not destroy anything
20:16 < savander> by ip you can join

21:09 < seymour> deen, what OS do you use?
21:11 <@deen> Linux
21:12 < seymour> what distro and desktop env though?
21:13 <@deen> Gentoo, Archlinux, Debian, with xmonad as window manager
21:18 < seymour> ah, ok. Another cool nim post - hope you make it to HN front page again :D
21:21 <@deen> Looks like I'm there already, thanks =)
21:35 <@deen> It's weird how HN likes my blog posts and hates my github sites
21:35 < eeeee> oh noes
21:36 <@deen> Tried submitting the github site twice, 0 upvotes, blog post worked immediately
21:36 <@deen> eeeee: I also linked to teewebs.net in the post :P
21:45 < eeeee> deen: fixed now
21:45 <@deen> Great
21:46 <@deen> Haha, I like the comment on HN: "Let me get this straight. We have an emulator for 1985 hardware that was written in a pretty new language (Go), ported to a language that isn't even 1.0 (Nim), compiled to C, then compiled to JavaScript? And the damn thing actually works? That's kind of amazing."
21:47 < Learath2> Let me get this straight. We have an emulator for 1985 hardware that was written in a pretty new language (Go), ported to a language that isn't even 1.0 (Nim), compiled to C, then compiled to JavaScript? And the damn thing actually works? That's kind of amazing.
21:47 < Learath2> omg :D
21:47 < Learath2> i copied the exact same comment to send here :D
21:51 <@deen> I put it on top of the post :P
22:15 < savander> i decided to install linux next to windows 7. Good decision? 
22:15 < savander> I'm tired of windows... everywhere problems :D
22:17 < fstd> welcome to the 2015-style linux, then -- everywhere problems, too ;)
22:20 < savander> yes!
22:30 <@deen> fstd would recomment FreeBSD instead?
22:36 < fstd> depends somewhat on the use case
22:38 < fstd> (i primarily run NetBSD though)
22:40 <@deen> savander: any idea why mod_command doesn't work on zcatch?
22:40 <@deen> savander: i do "mod command status 1" and it still doesn't work
22:48 < savander> i fodun!
22:48 < savander> found!
22:48 < savander> a solution
22:48 < savander> mod_command status 2
22:48 < savander> 2 is setted to mod.
22:48 < savander> 1 to admin i guess
22:48 < savander> but 2 works
22:48 < savander> :P
22:48 <@deen> aaah!
22:48 <@deen> thanks!
22:48 < savander> :)
22:50 < savander> https://github.com/savander/zcatch/blob/zCatch/src/engine/console.h#L22
22:50 < savander> look
22:50 < savander> SUBADMIN (?) o.O
22:50 <@deen> like SUBHUMAN
22:50 < savander> haha
22:50 < savander> but what is it, i don't knwo :D
22:51 <@deen> it's just sth between admin and mod
22:51 <@deen> so you have another set of permissions
22:51 < savander> but you can't set it
22:51 < savander> you don't have something lik
22:51 < savander> sv_rcon_subadmin
23:04 < savander> ubuntu 14. perfect choice for guys who never used a linux ;P. (not counting VPS ;c)
23:05 < savander> Wish me luck in this adventure.
23:05 <@deen> No idea about perfect choice, I started with Gentoo (after removing Windows) and it took me a week to see a GUI again^^
23:06 < savander> haha, but i'll install it next to windows
23:06 < savander> i play often, so i need windows
23:06 < savander> btw
23:06 < savander> Adobe support linux?
23:08 <@deen> What's Adobe?
23:08 <@deen> flash, pdf?
23:08 < savander> photoshop, after effects
23:08 < savander> premiere pro
23:08 <@deen> nope, but they work in wine i think
23:08 < savander> oh, ye. i forgot about wine
23:08 < EastByte> woudln't count on that
23:08 <@deen> so lots of fun hacking around
23:09 <@deen> EastByte: I would, they sound like some of the most wanted Windows programs ever
23:09 < savander> those are commercial programs.
23:10 < savander> So maybe that's why it's not for linux. because, for what :D
23:10 < savander> better do it for windows and OSx
23:10 < EastByte> well photoshop seems to have gold rating on winehq
23:11 < savander> wish me luck, i don't want to destroy anything.... ubuntu next to windows... oh gad. brb
23:11 < EastByte> wait...
23:11 < EastByte> nvm
23:41 < Savander> lol, weird trouble
23:42 < Savander> i need to restart installation when i want to install ubuntu next to windows
23:42 < Savander> (installation restarting computer)
23:42 < Savander> then i need to again select everything,  then again restarting computer
23:43 < Savander> and over and over and over again. wtf.
