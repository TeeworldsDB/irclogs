15:49 < o_be_one> hi all
18:38 <@EastByte> but he seems to lazy for that
18:38 <@EastByte> ooh hi deen 
18:38 < savander> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2750-L2792 <- Here is mine loop? (Client)
18:38 < savander> Run()
18:39 <@EastByte>  while (1)
18:39 <@EastByte>  {
18:39 <@EastByte>      //
18:39 <@EastByte>      VersionUpdate();
18:39 <@EastByte>      // handle pending connects
18:39 <@EastByte> yep
18:39 < savander> ohm, so it's point to limit  fps 
18:40 <@EastByte> not sure
18:40 <@EastByte> search for thread_sleep
18:40 <@EastByte> there throttle is implemented
18:41 < savander> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2805
18:42 <@EastByte> g_Config.m_DbgStress has a different purpose
18:43 < savander> above
18:43 <@EastByte> oh didn't realize that
18:43 < savander> i highlighted wrong line
18:43 <@EastByte> net_socket_read_wait(m_NetClient[0].m_Socket, g_Config.m_ClCpuThrottle * 1000);
18:44 < savander> yup, only here throttle is used
18:44 < savander> m_ClCpuThrottle
18:44 <@EastByte> blocks until the timeout passs (g_Config.m_ClCpuThrottle * 1000) and skips on network activity
18:45 <@EastByte> didn't notice it was changed
18:46 < Learath2> huh doesnt vsync already lock your fps to 60 ?
18:46 < savander> Learath2:  ye, but input got big delay
18:46 < savander> mouse input
18:46 < savander> so, i can't use it.
18:47 <@EastByte> Learath2: I am playing without vsync aswell and cputhrottle only has a static timeout
19:13 < savander> <hehehe>
19:14 < savander> I added this: http://pastebin.com/sWKEaPxB below this https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2785 for test..
19:14 < savander> and i have 60 fps
19:14 < savander> :P..
19:19 < savander> but screen jerking sometimes
19:19 < savander> vsync  fixes it i guess
19:21 < savander> or maybe im wrong? EastByte ?
19:21 < savander> ^^.
19:31 < hannibal> hi
19:31 < hannibal> deen?
19:44 <@EastByte> savander: can't check it out right now
19:44 < savander> okay:c
19:45 < savander> i know where is problem. Frames are desynchronized 
19:45 < savander> between game <-> monitor
19:56 <@deen> Looks like the Autoupdater isn't working again
19:56 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1418&p=13836#p13836
19:57 <@deen> Can anyone test if it works on your systems?
20:00 < Learath2> deen: doesnt work for me either
20:00 < Learath2> i think its smth about the 7.6 update specifically
20:01 < Learath2> maybe you forgot to put the actual updated executable there deen
20:01 <@deen> Oh, the DDNet-win32.exe isn't updated
20:01 <@deen> haha
20:01 <@deen> but why?
20:01 <@deen> I haven't changed the update procedure in forever
20:02 <@deen> Ouch, compilation on windows failed
20:02 <@deen> i should've noticed, but it was 2 am^^
20:03 <@EastByte> haha
20:03 < Learath2> :D
20:03 <@deen> the DDNet-7.6-win32.zip has no exe
20:03 <@deen> hm, no
20:03 < Learath2> deen: anything i did failed the compilation? 
20:03 <@EastByte> can it be that this is really bad?
20:03 <@deen> in my windows WM it says "bam: done"
20:04 <@EastByte> so we literally removed ddnet from nearly all users
20:04 <@deen> nah, they still have 7.5 :P
20:04 <@EastByte> ah
20:04 <@EastByte> fine
20:04 <@deen> hm
20:05 <@deen> Something is wrong with the zip implementation on my VPS
20:05 <@deen> it doesn't extract the exe files?
20:05 < savander> deen: nnot works
20:05 < savander> on windows
20:05 <@deen> hm, no
20:05 <@deen> i don't understand what's wrong
20:05 <@deen> somehow the old exes ended up in the new zip
20:06 < savander> oh, my bad
20:06 <@EastByte> your bad? it's savander's fault?
20:07 < savander> or not, but now works ( i guess, 7.6 is)
20:07 <@deen> hm no
20:07 <@deen> in the zip there's the right version, the date is just wrong
20:08 <@deen> (because my windows VM has wrong date^^)
20:08 < savander> ddnet have 64bit version?
20:08 <@deen> so everything seems fine with the exe
20:08 <@deen> i think the updater is just broken
20:09 < savander> oh gad damit
20:09 < savander> fuck me again
20:09 < Learath2> deen: well how could it be working for 3 updates and just be broken the next ?
20:09 <@deen> Learath2: because i changed stuff?
20:09 < savander> i just run my own complicated version ( where i testing fps limiter) mhm..
20:10 <@deen> Try to add back WinXP compatibility for autoupdater (untested)
20:10 <@deen> that commit especially
20:10 < savander> So don't expect what i said before. ;p.
20:17 <@deen> Learath2: could you take a look please?
20:29 < Learath2> uhh i really am busy studying for maths exam
20:29 <@deen> alright
20:29 <@EastByte> I wrote mine today :)
20:30 < Learath2> deen: can say it fails to replace the file
20:31 <@deen> Learath2: so it fails for you with win7?
20:32 < Learath2> yep
20:32 < Learath2> letme check
20:38 <@deen> ok, i can reproduce the problem in wine
20:38 <@deen> ouch
20:38 <@deen> i see the problem
20:39 <@deen> if(m_IsWinXP) should be if(!m_IsWinXP)
20:39 <@deen> the pain
20:39 < Learath2> you sure its that ?
20:40 <@deen> not sure, i'm still reading
20:40 < Learath2> while testing i dont see any calls to fopen(du.bat) nor any attempt to move DDNet.tmp
20:40 <@deen> sounds consistent with how i understand the code

20:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 6f259c7 def: Version 7.6.1
20:41 < Learath2> it oh yep
20:41 <@deen> But of course now no one can update to 7.6.1
20:42 <@deen> everyone has to download it by hand =/
20:42 < Learath2> thats the thing with autoupdaters :/
20:42 <@deen> Yeah, you should never change them :P
20:42 <@deen> make sure they work once and be done
20:42 <@deen> well, the addition of curl was a good idea
20:42 < Learath2> yeah it turned out to be quite some trouble :/

20:47 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 a3ac203 def: Fix autoupdater on non-Windows
20:49 <@EastByte> meh
20:49 <@deen> That also explains why it didn't work on my system. I just thought my system is weird as usual^^
20:50 <@deen> I'll give it a final test on Windows
20:51 <@deen> hm, would also be a good idea to test it on XP
20:51 <@EastByte> deen: btw. do you have older version archives left on the server?
20:51 <@EastByte> would be easier to test then
20:51 <@deen> what are "olver version archives"?
20:52 <@EastByte> previous version of the game
20:52 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/downloads
20:52 <@deen> but no idea how that would help
20:52 <@EastByte> oh didn't notice that ^^
20:53 <@EastByte> you can only test the updater if you are running an older version
20:53 <@deen> no, you can NOT test the updater if you're running an older version
20:53 <@deen> you have to SIMULATE being an older version
20:53 <@deen> so I'm compiling on windows and pretend to be 7.5 now
20:53 <@deen> and check if it updates to 7.6
20:53 <@deen> and if that works I compile 7.6.1
20:54 <@EastByte> simulating would require knowledge of the updater code
20:55 <@deen> ?
20:55 <@deen> i don't know what you're talking about
20:55 <@deen> I know how to test the autoupdater, I just usually don't do it^^
20:55 <@deen> takes me 10 minutes to click on the UPDATE button in windows VM
20:56 <@EastByte> I'm talking about letting random people test the autoupdater on their machines
20:57 <@EastByte> but I get your point
21:12 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-update-win32.zip
21:12 <@deen> Download it, extract it, run the autoupdater. It should restart and show version 7.6 after restart
21:13 <@deen> Works for me in Wine
21:13 <@deen> and on Linux of course
21:16 <@deen> anyone can test?
21:16 <@deen> EastByte, Learath2 ?
21:16 < Learath2> back 
21:17 < Learath2> i can give it a test gimme 10 mins
21:17 <@EastByte> works on my xp vm atleast
21:17 <@deen> EastByte: great, thanks
21:17 <@deen> Now I just need 1 confirmation from a real Win7 machine and I'm happy
21:18 <@deen> works
21:18 <@deen> I'm releasing 7.6.1
21:19 < Learath2> before i could manage to even build it :D
21:19 <@deen> you shouldn't build it
21:19 <@deen> only download that file and follow the instructions^^
21:19 <@deen> but some other guys did already
21:20 <@EastByte> yea works on my win7 vm aswell
21:21 <@EastByte> so people are now having 7.5? :/
21:21 <@deen> no, why should they?
21:21 <@deen> that zip is not what i released
21:21 <@deen> they have 7.6.1 now
21:21 <@EastByte> " the autoupdater didn't work in 7.5 and 7.6. "
21:22 <@deen> yes, they are stuck on 7.6
21:22 <@deen> 7.5*
21:23 <@EastByte> will take months until most have updated
21:23 <@deen> Not sure
21:23 <@deen> For starters, some people never update anyway
21:23 <@deen> and those that use the "autoupdater" have to manually click "UPDATE"
21:23 <@deen> they may get annoyed when it doesn't work and figure it out
21:24 <@deen> or read the announcements I wrote everywhere
21:24 <@EastByte> okay
21:25 <@EastByte> wow pypy is fast
21:26 < eeeee> compared to cpython, that is :P
21:29 < savander> http://git.io/vUL5H
21:38 < savander> no idea how to synchronize frames
21:38 <@EastByte> eeeee: is there any advantage in cpython not having a jit?
21:40 < eeeee> not having a jit makes it easier to integrate with existing C and whatnot code i guess
21:40 < eeeee> other than that, dunno
21:40 <@EastByte> hmm
23:52 <@EastByte> deen: got the ms compiler running under wine
23:52 <@EastByte> extracted from visual studio 2010
23:52 <@EastByte> quite happy right now :D
