12:13 < bridge> <Nouis> Why?
12:15 < bridge> <bencie> ~ helped in #bugs ~
16:12 < bridge> <Nouaa> does ddnet support 0.7 clients nowadays?
16:19 < bridge> <Chairn> i believe so
16:24 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Was broken as of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949#issuecomment-1287698965 (Oct 22, 2022) but no idea if it was fixed after that (and still survived further refactors).
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea that pr progressed a lot actually. You have a pretty playable expirence on 0.7 servers with this ddnet client now. But it still can not load 0.7 maps so its kinda useless :D
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> expirence omg dislexic chiledreguhn
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the stuff you said on the pr do I have to do them? Like the tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1 addresses? And I would also like some more pointers on the removal of the inheritance you seem to exactly know how to do it i just do not.
