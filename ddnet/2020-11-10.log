17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> a very old bug that has never been fixed : if the hook was off and on again the screen starts to jerk when you get hooked. the same with collision off and on, if someone touches you the screen jerks. the bug does not come every time but too often
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> unfortunately I cannot record a video because you would not see it
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> but i think many old players know this bug
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> a very old bug that has never been fixed : if the hook was off and on again the screen starts shaking when you get hooked. the same with collision off and on, if someone touches you the screen is shaking. the bug does not come every time but too often
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes i know there is a recording of it in an old aoe video
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> you could avoid this bug by using tune zones, but many people don't know this and the test servers are bugged. you can have a look at the map doomworld 2
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> @plsplsplslol maybe post this video?

17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> when you click the video
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Cøke this might be fixed in 15.2-rc2

18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> wtf you reacted to your own message
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i open voted  just
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if you agree click F3 or yes or..
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> how would this even work
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and if you want more customization then use 0.7
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> > how would this even work
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Souly  like hat santa but larger
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but sant hat is separate skin
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> not just hat itself
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 nice options you gave to vote. If you agree, click F3. If you agree, click yes, If you agree, click thumbs-up. 😄
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :bluekitty:
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> > but sant hat is separate skin
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Souly  i think its this not impossible put skin (hat) up other skin instead of make other skins with hat
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> I have solution for this
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> play 0.7
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @hussainx3 but what about skins that already have hats?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i play with last update
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> > @hussainx3 but what about skins that already have hats?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Souly  not should be  it seems appropriate 100%
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> f3 add hats layer to skins
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was not i can't not put
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was not i can not put
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> I can search for other else or to  not put anything
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> now that i think about it
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> why not overally make ddne use 0.7 skin system
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 0.7 skins suck
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> old skins would work fine
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> fake news
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they ruined coala
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> both coalas look bad
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or are you talking about that bear one?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was not work with some skin just don't put it
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  or search for other hat
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Summary
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> great idea
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Not impossible
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 0.7 coala ruined
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> how is it ruined
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :trollet:
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the noouis coala is the best
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just lookat the coala in 0.7
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> compared to 0.6
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/775784527561752586/unknown.png
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it actually looks like a koala now
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmaoo
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes thats bad
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but its just build in skin
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you can still make old coala
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and use it
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> lmao
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> why do you use coala skin if you dont want to look like a koala
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just use gray brownbear
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> brownbear weak outline
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> did they change brownbear too
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> no
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> just highier resolution
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> uis
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> the marking of friends in the chat is coloured differently than in the spec list
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> resolutionuis
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> can i change both ?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> the marking of friends in the chat is coloured differently than in the spec list, can i change both?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> the marking of friends in the chat is coloured differently than in the spec list, can i change both? its weird i want blue hearts
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 🤩
