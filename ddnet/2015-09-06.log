00:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame closed pull request #325: added Kenney_Stones: png by RaiNy,  rules by DoNe (master...master) http://git.io/vGbte
00:45 < eeeee> can we have another vanilla server for usa? there's only one and it's full sometimes after all that steam hype
00:49 <@deen> eeeee: sure!
00:50 <@deen> eh, it's running already^^
00:50 <@deen> i just forgot to add it to the ddnet server list
00:52 < eeeee> kk, thanks
01:13 < Savander> deen,  what is "map_version.txt"
01:13 < Savander> in ddnet?
01:13 < Savander> i mean, for what?:p
01:14 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/WRu0D28y7857
01:14 < Savander> 24h
01:40 < Learath2> played 200 mins failed \o/
02:00 < laxa> deen: nice ddnet on greenlight, who made the trailer viedeo ?
02:00 < Savander> Aoe
10:15 <@deen> ACTom: hi
13:50 < dhkmt> hello, could anyone help me in git?
13:55 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #326: Proposition: Extend the protocol using NETMSG_NULL (master...pr_extendprotocol) http://git.io/vZfLX
13:55 < Learath2> dhkmt: sure ask away
13:58 < dhkmt> i cloned a project from my gitlab account and when i push something it should push it to my account and when i wanna fetch/pull it should do that from another repository on github
13:58 < dhkmt> how i can do this?
14:00 <@heinrich5991> not sure if you can do that automatically like you describe
14:00 < Learath2> well both git pull and git push accept a remote as an argument
14:00 <@heinrich5991> but you can add a remote ^^
14:00 <@heinrich5991> just like learath2 says, listen to him
14:01 < Learath2> dhkmt: add that other repository as a new remote with "git remote add remotename repositoryurl"
14:01 < Learath2> after that you can pull/fetch with git pull/fetch remotename
14:02 < Learath2> and if you cloned from your own repository origin should already be set so "git push origin branchname" should be fine to push
14:02 < dhkmt> ok and when i fetch/pull it will merge theirs with mine without any big problems?
14:03 < Learath2> you should do your own work on a different branch then master
14:03 < dhkmt> how?
14:03 < dhkmt> i mean.. where's the difference when i keep working on master
14:04 < Learath2> if you keep working on master when you pull from the upstream you will get merge conflicts
14:04 < dhkmt> isnt that right when i wanna fetch the newest version to merge with mine?
14:05 < Learath2> well gives you more flexibility is all ofc you dont have to do it
14:06 < dhkmt> its hard to decide because im not that familiar with git
14:07 < Learath2> and if you work on master your pull requests will no longer be a fast forward
14:07 < Learath2> that depends on ofc if you are contributing to a project
14:13 < dhkmt> its a private project
14:13 < dhkmt> xd?
14:36 <@EastByte> Learath2: the extended protocol msgid unpack should also be on the client side, right?
14:38 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: why don't you comment on github :D it's more persistant there
14:41 <@EastByte> right right^^
15:27 <@heinrich5991> deen: I think "what does ddnet mean?" is perhaps not a good anti-spam question, it wasn't immediately obvious what you wanted for me..
15:36 < Learath2> EastByte: yep forgot to commit it
15:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: propose a better question that everyone who played on DDNet/TW knows
15:38 <@heinrich5991> I see, that's a problem :(
15:39 <@heinrich5991> deen: perhaps "what are the characters in the game called (they're looking kirby-like)?"
15:39 <@deen> Maybe something like "What does your tee shoot when you right click?"
15:39 <@deen> at least we only had a single spam post since i added that anti-spam :P
15:40 <@heinrich5991> that's impressive
15:40 <@deen> there's an alternative question "What does TW mean?"
15:43 <@deen> Ok, changed it:
15:43 <@deen> Q: What are the characters in the game called? (They're round and look a bit like kirby)
15:43 <@deen> Possible Answers: tee and tees
15:43 < Sadale> or just T :)
15:44 <@heinrich5991> haven't seen someone call them T so far ^^
15:47 < Sadale> Tworlds :D
15:47 <@heinrich5991> guenstig_werben: hello
15:47 <@deen> i hope everyone knows that they're called tees =/
15:48 < guenstig_werben> is some dev here which have time to do a mod with me/other
15:48 <@heinrich5991> the game is called teeworlds after all (?)
15:48 <@deen> the DDNet question was supposed to be super-easy because the answer was right in the logo on the left side
15:48 <@heinrich5991> and you're "nameless tee"
15:48 <@heinrich5991> mh ok
15:48 <@deen> heinrich5991: well, we have 10 year olds in the ddnet forum and not sure if everyone knows that ddnet is a teeworlds mod
15:48 <@deen> or how they call tees in chile
15:49 <@heinrich5991> guenstig_werben: are you that person who posted on teeworlds.com/forum an hour ago or so? :)
15:50 <@heinrich5991> deen: perhaps you could keep the old question and add the new one like this: "what does ddnet mean? (if you don't know that, please answer the following question instead: what are the characters ...)"
15:51 <@heinrich5991> could be too complex though..
15:51 <@heinrich5991> guenstig_werben: what will your mod be about?
15:53 < guenstig_werben> controlling server networks, balance server, maybe feature new maps, a supervisor. would be nice if it will be used on ddnet. only drawback is, it sticks to Linux. because of performance.
15:53 < guenstig_werben> @heinrich5991 I posted on tw forum
15:54 < guenstig_werben> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11545
15:54 < guenstig_werben> or otherwise a German version on teeworlds-friends.de
15:56 < guenstig_werben> or better said not Linux, it would use Unix domain sockets. that would make running on Windows difficult
16:01 <@EastByte> a supervisor for managing tw server/mods/maps ?
16:02 < guenstig_werben> yes
16:04 < Learath2> heinrich5991: did swap the int for 4 bytes
16:04 < guenstig_werben> original purpose for balancing block server, but it might be interesting for ddnet
16:05 <@EastByte> what do you want to balance?
16:05 < guenstig_werben> mostly player count
16:06 < guenstig_werben> some maps like BlmapNewMvg are really bad with more than 15 player
16:06 <@deen> just set max players to 15?
16:06 < guenstig_werben> others are cool with ~25p
16:07 < guenstig_werben> no... that was like in old days... max 16p.  my vision is to dynamically start new server and balance the players
16:07 < Learath2> what do you even mean by balance
16:07 <@heinrich5991> so you want to split the server up into two servers if the player count gets too big?
16:07 <@deen> so players can't choose with whom they play?
16:08 < guenstig_werben> example
16:08 <@deen> they just get auto-balanced on another server?
16:08 < guenstig_werben> of course player can choode
16:08 < guenstig_werben> I thought about doing it with voter
16:08 < will__> hello?
16:09 < guenstig_werben> hi
16:09 < will__> hello?
16:09 < will__> oh
16:09 < will__> well i have a bug
16:09 < guenstig_werben> So at start there will be a vote and it should be ~50:50
16:09 < guenstig_werben> and later example vote menu
16:10 < will__> So if i turn antiping on, and uncheck antiping for players and restart the client, ddnet will not remember that I unchecked antiping for players
16:10 < guenstig_werben> but it's just a suggestion
16:11 < will__> Well thats all
16:11 < will__> I want antiping to exclude players but can't!
16:11 < Learath2> guenstig_werben: well balancing the players require a client side modification
16:12 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: depends on how you do it I guess
16:12 < guenstig_werben> no?
16:12 <@heinrich5991> you could use a proxy that forwards the packets to the right server
16:12 < Learath2> heinrich5991: well either that or the overhead of a proxy
16:12 < guenstig_werben> that's the point why I want to use Unix domain sockets.... you could name it "local proxy"
16:13 <@heinrich5991> yea, but the overhea is not big if you host the reverse-proxied servers on the same machine
16:13 < guenstig_werben> I don't want to use a udp proxy.... that's 1. binding a port which is not in use.... and 2. it's the udp overhead
16:16 <@heinrich5991> I guess the bigger part is implementing the actual proxy (bigger than worrying about which socket type to use for local communication)
16:16 < Learath2> not sure if there is a way to get the client to gracefully switch either
16:17 < guenstig_werben> mmm not sure....  can't you simulate a reload to the client and then send just other data?
16:18 < Learath2> no idea im just speculating
16:18 < Learath2> could probably abuse a map switch
16:18 < guenstig_werben> or if you want to keep player position, just silently add or remove player data
16:18 < guenstig_werben> or let them left "for the client"
16:20 <@heinrich5991> map switch is probably workable
16:21 < Learath2> i guess the proxy would be mostly a pass through up until the point you send a player off to another server
16:22 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:22 <@heinrich5991> the hard part might be the connless communication
16:22 <@heinrich5991> i.e. how do you tell which IP sent the server info request for this answer
16:23 <@EastByte> a map switch is usable for that
16:23 < Learath2> well it would be a serverinfo request for the whole proxy i'd guess
16:23 <@EastByte> whoops didn't scroll down
16:24 < guenstig_werben> what I would suggest, is just an implementation of Unix domain sockets to literally pass the data sent from the clients to the corresponding server and not touching anything....
16:25 < guenstig_werben> but server info would be handled by the master
16:25 < Learath2> serverinfo is handled by the server the master is just a list of ips
16:25 < guenstig_werben> I mean not that master
16:26 < guenstig_werben> I meant the supervisor as master of his slaves
16:26 <@heinrich5991> ah, yeah
16:26 <@heinrich5991> just passing data on doesn't work, you lose the source IP address if you do that
16:26 < Learath2> well if its okay for all the servers to appear as one thats fine
16:26 < guenstig_werben> and, of course If no one is on a map, not starting it. that would be great for ddnet
16:27 < guenstig_werben> you handle each map as slave and if you vote for a map you join this  /and or a new slave with this map
16:28 < guenstig_werben> So each server location has many server which are mostly down because no one playing
16:31 < Learath2> well i'd have n proxies in front of n servers so i can keep the serverinfo requests and also have the capability of moving people around but thats even more overhead  :P
16:32 <@heinrich5991> just make one proxy with n sockets :)
16:32 < guenstig_werben> yeah
16:32 < Learath2> or one proxy with n sockets and pretending to be n servers :)
16:32 < guenstig_werben> "virtual server" in front of the real
16:33 < guenstig_werben> I never wanted that explicitly, I would have. suggested a lobby system, but you can do that as well
16:34 <@EastByte> the implementation of such a software is pretty time-consuming
16:34 <@EastByte> I have some similiar project
16:35 < guenstig_werben> sorry, a simple lobby system similar to teleporters
16:36 <@EastByte> so you want to place teleports ingame and let them cause a redirect on a different server?
16:41 < guenstig_werben> In the lobby
16:45 < devnull> bye guenstig_werben
16:45 < devnull> oo
16:45 <@EastByte> yo devnull 
16:45 < dhkmt> yo devnull
16:46 <@EastByte> yesterday in Naufrage 3 I went with a ~10 people group and got quite far
16:46 < devnull> ouh nice
16:46 <@EastByte> maybe reached 40%
16:47 < devnull> oh nice
16:47 < devnull> maybe we can try it later
16:47 < devnull> it should be possible
16:47 <@EastByte> well I'm usually the one getting pulled
16:47 < devnull> shut up
16:48 < devnull> thats not true :D
16:48 <@EastByte> yea sometimes I need to rescue failed teammates
16:51 <@EastByte> and if everything goes wrong... TEEBOAT!!!
16:55 < Learath2> its a nice map
16:56 <@deen> EastByte: map still has 64/64 server
16:56 <@deen> !twp deen
16:56 < Nimda> deen is currently playing Naufrage 3 on server : DDNet GER - Brutal [DDraceNetwork].
16:57 <@deen> CPU % of a single 64 player server is only 13% of one core, that's nice
16:57 <@EastByte> yes, pretty insane
16:57 <@deen> I'm in a 15 player group at 120 min
16:57 <@deen> we merged with multiple other groups along the way
16:59 <@deen> i remember a single 64 player server having 50% of a core, maybe my optimizations helped or this cpu is just stronger
17:15 <@deen> too bad Naufrage 3 wasn't a tournament
17:16 <@deen> testers said the map is too bad =/
17:20 <@EastByte> hm
19:08 < Nimda> Slime by TyxpekCZ just released on Moderate at 2015-09-06 19:06
19:46 < dhkmt> do anyone have experience with sqlite?
19:54 < dhkmt> nvm, i'll use mysql
20:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: are issues like https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/328 ok or should I investigate more before posting them? (had a dirty working branch and didn't want to abort it at that time)
20:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: not a big problem, still better to check before
20:05 <@heinrich5991> ok, will check next time
20:09 <@deen> there are a few more warnings if anyone wants to fix them nicely
20:09 <@deen> can easily see them in the nightly build log
20:09 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly.log
20:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: is that compiled with clang?
20:36 < guenstig_werben> is it right that you are hosting tobiis blockZ and infZ ?
20:57 <@deen> guenstig_werben: right
21:15 < guenstig_werben> is the source code available anywhere, or can I have your server DIR including config and maps?
21:15 <@deen> it's not i think
21:16 < guenstig_werben> hmmm
21:16 < guenstig_werben> and I can't host some as you do
21:16 < guenstig_werben> because someone said "they are down" and wants me to host them....
21:17 < guenstig_werben> he thinks your server are down... or he cannot access them
21:17 < guenstig_werben> just copy your setup.... would be the easiest
21:25 < guenstig_werben> deen? can't I just copy your setup?
21:26 < devnull>  dhkmt
21:26 < devnull> @dhkmt yea, what do you wanna do?
21:27 < dhkmt> devnull: wanna know something about performance.. the database could be very big xd
21:28 < devnull> then use mysql
21:28 < Tobii> guenstig_werben: these mods are not mine
21:28 < devnull> than*
21:31 < dhkmt> i will
21:46 <@deen> guenstig_werben: no, coffee didn't want me to distribute the source code
21:47 < guenstig_werben> Oh... sorry
21:48 < guenstig_werben> but Tobii du bist hier? Was ist mit uddrace? In 2 Monaten 1 commits...
21:48 < guenstig_werben> yeah... coffee I know him
