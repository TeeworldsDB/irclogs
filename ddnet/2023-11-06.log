06:22 < bridge> <Iza> if it only were that easy
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ❓
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> It will work for now
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean it's like 5 lines above where it tries to find all entities in range
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There is a parameter for range

10:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Am I missing something or did you not realise that this has been a feature in DDNet client for a while? Enable "Show Info" to see this mode where you can drag the quad animation points.
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah I also did not know that! That’s cool
13:33 < bridge> <teero777> wait what?!
13:33 < bridge> <teero777> Since when is ddnet client so amazing?
13:43 < bridge> <robyt3> It's a well hidden feature, I only found out about it when I ported the bezier curve support. Though I don't think it makes sense to hide this feature behind the "Show Info" setting.
14:14 < bridge> <teero777> we have to spread this xd
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> i still can find it. xd
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> this showinfo?

16:21 < bridge> <kaffeine0> How other mod admins 'll know about it? Only @mpft expressed some interest and there is no reaction from DDNet. (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7419)
16:22 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> If you open a ticket with the reason "other" then admins can take a look and they might forward it to the oder devs and fix it, but sharing all their strategies and informations here will reveal the fix that might be applied.
16:23 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> The attackers might see this and adjust their way of attacking/spammin severs.
16:23 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> The attackers might see this and adjust their way of attacking/spamming severs.
16:24 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It was clear for me, I made a choice. I want to share the info with all admins, including non DDNet and there is no other way to do it right now.
16:25 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Well sharing it publicly also means making them work around the fixes, but its your choice, I just gave you my opinion.
16:26 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Well sharing it publicly also means making it possible for them to work around the fixes, but its your choice. I just wanted to share my opinion.
16:29 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It is super curious why they have those "problems" in the first place but let's giggle silently and not discuss it.
16:36 < bridge> <itube.> cant wait
16:42 < bridge> <kaffeine0> As I understand, it is also DDNet position to clearly communicate "you're a spammer, we kick/mute/ban you". From the efficiency point of view, shadow ban would work much better and save admins/moderators resources.
16:59 < bridge> <yekrm> It would be useful but unfortunately they use very wide IP ranges
17:01 < bridge> <yekrm> Here is a range they are using too many available IPs "57.128.0.0-57.131.255.255"
17:03 < bridge> <kaffeine0> If we'll ban 1 IP per minute, how many time it would take to ban all IPs? At this pace we'd ban 1000 IPs in an half of a day.
17:03 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I think that range bans are not needed, and I think that the attackers have just a dozen IPs, maybe with an option to rotate the IPs *manually*.
17:08 < bridge> <yekrm> Another problem is that they are also using ISP ranges. Many players would be involved without doing anything
17:13 < bridge> <yekrm> https://cleantalk.org/blacklists/as24961 -> Maybe a solution would be to add the IPs flagged as abuse
17:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Maybe they use bot malware clients and it is the player fault? Anyway, I don't see it as a real issue for the idea: if we'll globally ban spammer IPs (short bans for 48 hours would also work for our purpose) then the spammers 'll run out of IPs even if they have a lot of addresses. Even if they use ISP with dynamic addressing, they won't be able to spam the servers at the rate they spam us right now.
17:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
17:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> How many IPs you seen? I have 16 IPs recorded. Maybe my server is super lucky but it gives me impression of a very limited spammers capability. Maybe they has IPs from wide ranges but how many IPs they have?
17:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
17:20 < bridge> <kaffeine0> How many money they do invest in your opinion? We don't need to make spam impossible, we just need to make it not worths it.

17:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It does not help individual servers because even if we ban all IPs "today", the spammers still succeed on many other servers for the rest of the day, and (relatively speaking) on the next day the spammers can come with new IPs and spend another thousands messages.

19:54 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> yes
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao discord down for me
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the first parameter of TakeDamage says `Force`
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's probably what u want
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. after `* Strength` you could probably do \* 5.0f
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it would be like 5 times stronger xd

20:07 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> vec(0.f, -1.0f) - this is Force?
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uhm, have u ever coded before? xd
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the whole expression is one argument
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's the argument passed to the corresponding parameter `Force`
20:09 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> yes, i am beginner in c++
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:09 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> I'm confused
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's the whole argument until the `,`
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `(vec2(0.f, -1.0f) + Temp) * Strength`
20:09 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> okey
20:10 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> What needs to be changed to make the player fly further when hit?
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd highly recommend to do some cpp tutorials first tho
20:16 < bridge> <robyt3> You don't need to change code just for stronger hammer though, you can use `tune hammer_strength 5`
20:18 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> this parameter changes only in Y, but I need it in X
20:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you familar with vectors from mathematics? `vec2` is a vector in 2D, for example `vec2(0.f, -1.0f)` point straight up, as the X component is zero
20:22 < bridge> <robyt3> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector
20:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you familar with vectors from mathematics? `vec2` is a vector in 2D, for example `vec2(0.f, -1.0f)` points straight up, as the X component is zero
20:24 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> I’m not familiar with vectors from mathematics, I’m in my 1st year of college) I haven’t done this yet. If it’s not difficult, can you tell me how to do it the way I need?
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Change the `0.f` to something else, like `2.0f` or `-2.0f` and see what it changes
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> It should cause the hook strength to have more effect in the X direction
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> It should cause the hammer strength to have more effect in the X direction
20:28 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> it changes, for some reason only in one direction
20:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Which one? It currently applies most of the force upwards because the vector `vec2(0.f, -1.0f)` points up. If you change it to `vec2(2.f, -1.0f)` then it should apply twice as much force in X direction as in Y direction
20:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> if I set the value to more than 2, then it only goes one way, that is, if I stand to the right of the player and hit him, then he hits me, and if I stand to the left of the player and hit, then he reclines normally
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like this will always apply the force to the right. You need to consider the relative X position of the tees, i.e. `Dir.x`. You should probably learn some C++ to understand this. Or copy the function into ChatGPT and tell it what you want to have changed.
20:51 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> I asked ChatGPT to do this, but it didn’t work(
20:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> What are you trying to do?
21:06 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> change kick height in X

21:52 < bridge> <stormaxd> even with `#include <game/client/gameclient.h>` is wont work
21:57 < bridge> <kekomonter> m_Afk is gameclient variable?
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:58 < bridge> <stormaxd> tru
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to do `GameClient()->m_Afk`
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a member
21:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> IDisocrd don't have GameClient field or getter
21:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> How I remember
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> CDiscord is a component
21:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> This just interface for discord RPC and all data transfering with arguments
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> nvm
22:00 < bridge> <stormaxd> so how can i include this to code?
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not a component so you will have to request the client interface
22:01 < bridge> <stormaxd> hell
22:01 < bridge> <stormaxd> way harder than i thoughtj
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> wait it's not a gameclient member lol
22:07 < bridge> <furo321> I would recommend adding another argument to the `SetGameInfo` function, that would contain the `m_Afk` bool. Just remember you also have to check whenever the `m_Afk` bool has changed, and then call the function again.
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> just need smth like this 
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan>     IGameClient *pGameClient = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan>         if(pGameClient) {

22:09 < bridge> <Ewan>         }
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> just need smth like this

22:09 < bridge> <Ewan>     }
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate writing code in discord
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i would recommend just requesting this interface the first time you need it & storing it in a member
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> And remember that `m_LocalClientID` can be negative in the demo player, so you also want to check for `m_LocalClientID >= 0` or you might get a crash in the demo player
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> may want to disable this behavior entirely in the demo player
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like `CDiscord::SetGameInfo` is only called when online so it should be save
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like `CDiscord::SetGameInfo` is only called when online so it should be safe
