18:42 <@deen> Damn, GER looks pretty overloaded today
18:42 <@deen> load of 3-3
18:42 <@deen> 3-4
18:42 <@deen> I'll run a tournament server on GER2, just in case it will lag again =/
18:44 <@deen> and we have 0 empty servers on GER as well^^
18:44 <@deen> that's a problem for running tournament servers
19:49 <@deen> Livestream should be on ddnet.tw
19:53 < Learath2> deen DDNet GER - Tournament #1 reports 54/64 but says full
19:54 <@deen> reports 64/64 to me
19:54 <@deen> weird
19:54 <@deen> i guess you have some packet loss
19:55 <@deen> and one packet of players got lost :P
19:55 <@deen> GER #2 has 53/64
20:03 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

20:59 <@deen> hi Mile 
20:59 <@deen> So, what about Shorefire?
21:05 < Nimda> Red Avenue by Bixes just released on Moderate at 2015-05-17 19:58
21:08 < Mile> what's up with you guys?
21:09 <@deen> hi Mile
21:09 < Mile> why is he mad at you?
21:09 < Mile> hi x)
21:09 <@deen> Hm, it's difficult
21:09 < Mile> well
21:09 <@deen> what does he say?
21:09 < Mile> why does he hate you?
21:09 <@deen> because i run ddnet
21:09 < Mile> there must be a reason though
21:12 <@deen> He's running his own servers
21:12 <@deen> and he doesn't like that he has no players
21:12 <@deen> DDNet is growing and growing
21:12 <@deen> taking away most of TW's players
21:12 <@deen> concentrating them into a single place
21:12 <@deen> adding more mods
21:12 <@deen> and of course not everyone agrees with our (lack of) rules
21:13 <@deen> and he doesn't always hate me/ddnet
21:13 <@deen> his opinion seems to fluctuate a lot
21:14 <@deen> sometimes we can talk reasonably, and another day he's totally mad at me
21:23 < Mile> ok
21:23 < Mile> anyways, thanks
21:28 <@deen> no problem
