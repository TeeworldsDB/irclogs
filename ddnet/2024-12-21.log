00:00 < bridge> <From Europe> doesn't hurt to have better tooling to playaround with i think
00:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk I for one enjoy doing things
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see, so he has your trust to lose at least. Do we know when this thing is publicly tested?
00:02 < bridge> <totar> Well we can all enjoy doing things but I think there's simply a time limit now. Before I was a little skeptical there was a chance they could never do it, but they've proved now that's its only time. Who knows how much
00:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Like not even by us, just by anyone
00:02 < bridge> <From Europe> ~~can AI generate blender constraints and switch drivers and animations, cuz im still learning that~~
00:03 < bridge> <totar> https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough
00:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If I *have* to produce code with transformer assistance to make it in the workplace I might seriously consider switching profession
00:03 < bridge> <totar> They tested it on semi private benchmark
00:03 < bridge> <totar> Also it won their competition
00:03 < bridge> <totar> But that's small news compared to cf2700
00:06 < bridge> <From Europe> idk what that means, im like 99% sure managers and business does not care about how you get things done (in the workplace) and im pretty sure a lot of people can get things done better than an average new grad with copilot.
00:07 < bridge> <From Europe> the main concern is probably whether the workplace still exists if business people is convinced a $500/month devin is better than a $3000/month engineer
00:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no but I mean if these things are seriously good I'd imagine matching the productivity of someone with actual skills using AI without using assistance at all would be really hard
00:08 < bridge> <totar> In 5 years you will get 100 Devin's for $500
00:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They won't be convinced for long as their shit breaks down
00:09 < bridge> <totar> Devin is bad tho
00:09 < bridge> <totar> Its not even worth $0
00:10 < bridge> <totar> Its just a scam to trick executives
00:10 < bridge> <From Europe> software engineering is not just coding you know... and i'm like pretty sure a lot of senior roles don't even have time to code cuz they get so much werid tnings to do
00:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Need to make it to senior first for that :)
00:11 < bridge> <From Europe> i mean
00:11 < bridge> <From Europe> i got senior on day 1
00:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> fun
00:11 < bridge> <From Europe> :kek: :kek: :kek:
00:11 < bridge> <From Europe> ye, and i bankrupted the first company and lead a failed product in the second
00:11 < bridge> <From Europe> so don't do that i guess
00:12 < bridge> <totar> :justatest:
00:12 < bridge> <totar> Don't put that on your resume
00:12 < bridge> <From Europe> honestly, probably not my fault but it's hard to tell
00:13 < bridge> <totar> Well yeah they wanted something that was probably always going to fail
00:13 < bridge> <totar> Common story
00:13 < bridge> <From Europe> but hey, a failed product is still a shipped product, it is hard to get this in games
00:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I feel like I might be a bit safer from the AI scourge as a technical artist?
00:14 < bridge> <From Europe> like for games?
00:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah
00:14 < bridge> <From Europe> remind me to hire you if i got money
00:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> People said creativity would be hard to copy, now they're saying that logic is hard to copy, and that role is the intersection of those two :P
00:14 < bridge> <totar> Probably yes tbh
00:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so it should last at least a few years longer
00:15 < bridge> <From Europe> i wouldn't say software eng does not have any creativity.
00:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can't exactly run diffusion on your shader code to make it look prettier lol
00:15 < bridge> <totar> I am biased because I do tech art but I think depending on which type you do it's safer than regular software development
00:15 < bridge> <totar> Only a little tho
00:16 < bridge> <totar> o1 can write pretty good shaders
00:16 < bridge> <From Europe> if only game industry is not running down hills
00:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And even when were required to use assisting software there will still be (some) jobs
00:16 < bridge> <totar> but it's not very good at making shader soup which looks good like a real tech artist
00:17 < bridge> <From Europe> can't really beat a shader graph wizard in terms of variety and just pure directivity from designers i think
00:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for standard things of course
00:17 < bridge> <totar> Ehh
00:17 < bridge> <totar> Its pretty good
00:17 < bridge> <totar> I wouldn't say it can't do anything specific enough to describe to it
00:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It'll be a long while before an AI can understand an art director well enough to make required changes to your shader code or whatever
00:18 < bridge> <totar> sometimes it puts the functions in the wrong order but it usually takes like 4 seconds to fix that and it compiles first try
00:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unless the art director lacks strong vision I guess
00:19 < bridge> <From Europe> honestly, now that i think about it, probably still down to how well it can take directions. like it is really often the shader graph person gets a director just pointing at their screen and say things
00:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unless the art director lacks strong vision I guess and just says okay to whatever the bot produces
00:19 < bridge> <totar> Shader Graph is :cammostripes:
00:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> kinda agree
00:20 < bridge> <From Europe> but shader graph is artists job
00:20 < bridge> <From Europe> not tech arts
00:20 < bridge> <totar> Some artists write raw shader code
00:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nahh I hand write shader code screw the artists they can go through me
00:21 < bridge> <totar> Good artists* 😄
00:22 < bridge> <From Europe> try that when you got 3 days to optimize the renderer and 5 artists are pushing new stuff and the game is set to submit for review in 8 days
00:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :justatest:
00:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like to pretend I won't have to deal with real life
00:22 < bridge> <From Europe> i like to run everything by me
00:23 < bridge> <totar> You're optimizing the render because of all the garbage shader graphs
00:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't know if I'll actually end up doing game dev professionally, it sounds kinda nightmarish
00:23 < bridge> <From Europe> then i get 19hr days like regularly for 6 months
00:24 < bridge> <From Europe> nah. we were cpu bottlenecked
00:24 < bridge> <From Europe> but to be fair i am not tech art but i still do tech art job cuz we don't have one
00:25 < bridge> <From Europe> 4 artists 3 dev 1 designer, 6 of them are intern on their first job
00:25 < bridge> <From Europe> i really tried
00:27 < bridge> <From Europe> and they gave us a "hard" deadline of 6 months to do a full (mobile-adjacent) game with client, server and web components and we do our own SA.
00:27 < bridge> <learath2> My C++ algorithms have gone very rusty from all the Go use :pepeW:
00:28 < bridge> <From Europe> no way
00:28 < bridge> <aegisub> get it?
00:28 < bridge> <From Europe> how long have it been
00:28 < bridge> <learath2> I actually forgor how `std::remove` worked completely there for a second
00:28 < bridge> <learath2> 7 months of nothing but golang
00:28 < bridge> <totar> Do you like golang
00:29 < bridge> <From Europe> but i mean... just for a second is not that bad
00:29 < bridge> <learath2> It's honestly not bad
00:29 < bridge> <learath2> The GC is a shame though
00:29 < bridge> <totar> This feels like the common opinion
00:30 < bridge> <totar> How so?
00:30 < bridge> <learath2> I expected it to be much much worse at the very least from all the talk inside this channel in the past
00:30 < bridge> <From Europe> at least you only works in one lang.
00:30 < bridge> <From Europe> :justatest:
00:30 < bridge> <learath2> It's a decently modern GC but it's still GC. You need to be careful not to leak things around all the time and you have to accept that your "real time" worries can't really be satisfied by this language very well
00:31 < bridge> <learath2> Say you have 16ms budget for a frame, gc randomly kicks in, wastes a random amount of it
00:31 < bridge> <learath2> Now you get a frame skip
00:31 < bridge> <totar> You're using it for game or something else realtime?
00:32 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not, that's why it's been pretty enjoyable, but it's still a weak point of the language and gc in general
00:32 < bridge> <From Europe> ye, if it is not realtime i would worry about gc like that much.
00:32 < bridge> <totar> Yeah fair
00:32 < bridge> <From Europe> ye, if it is not realtime i wouldnt worry about gc like that much.
00:32 < bridge> <learath2> There are other GC algorithms that are more suitable for that kind of stuff too, but go's one isn't customizable iirc
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> You can have a MarkAndSweep GC that gets a fixed budget of time, so you can make it constant overhead
00:33 < bridge> <From Europe> what lang has customizable gc
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> nim has multiple options
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> nim has 7 options to be exact
00:33 < bridge> <From Europe> i've never seen nim oof
00:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Clearly the solution is writing code that never dynamically allocates so you don't need the GC ;)
00:34 < bridge> <From Europe> meanwhile unity's .net GC is still garbage
00:35 < bridge> <learath2> Which is possible but pretty hard to do in Go, since everything will accidentally leak stuff unless you are extremely careful
00:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's not like avoiding allocations and deallocations isn't a good idea in general
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> If Rust was a little easier to use I'd honestly just flat out replace almost all of my languages with Rust
00:36 < bridge> <totar> This is really annoying in many languages
00:37 < bridge> <totar> Before I knew cpp I was blind to the garbage I was making, now it's like paranoia
00:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I need to stop getting heebie jeebies from Rust so I can enjoy it and stop complaining
00:38 < bridge> <learath2> C++ is really getting much better recently. I love that we have proper `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr>` now
00:38 < bridge> <From Europe> :justatest: maybe i've been working too long, i can cope with terrible langs
00:39 < bridge> <learath2> Also `std::ranges::contains`
00:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like esoteric and difficult to use languages but I can't accept JS
00:39 < bridge> <learath2> Also `std::erase_if`
00:40 < bridge> <learath2> TS makes it a little more bearable
00:40 < bridge> <learath2> Also `std::fmt`
00:40 < bridge> <learath2> Also `std::format`
00:41 < bridge> <totar> I just wish JS had real number types
00:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> TS gets points for being funny jank workaround but immediately loses them for being related to JS
00:41 < bridge> <learath2> Now it's your turn to tell your favourite C++20/23/26 feature is
00:42 < bridge> <From Europe> ever since we managed to ship a VR game that runs at 72hz locked on a 5 year old soc in unity, i just stopped worry about terrible gc altogether. cuz no way the intern's code would survive me for the second project if it doesn't just run ok with all the jank we put in it.
00:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> People actually know C++ features? :justatest:
00:42 < bridge> <aegisub> string_view/span are cool
00:43 < bridge> <From Europe> not me
00:44 < bridge> <From Europe> i barely know c++
00:45 < bridge> <aegisub> also modules in theory but lol modules
00:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> all those views
00:46 < bridge> <learath2> C++26 is probably getting `std::linalg` with portable linear algebra. So when it's implemented in 2 decades maybe it'll be great
00:47 < bridge> <From Europe> :justatest:
01:14 < bridge> <From Europe> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363727
01:15 < bridge> <From Europe> malicious DMCA is so outdated, do malicious fraud report
01:55 < bridge> <kebscs> std::format 👍
02:30 < bridge> <_qey> Aww, I missed a good AI discussion. Bummer.
02:31 < bridge> <_qey> Actually ChatGPT helped me go through DDNet code base. Instead of manually looking for things, I just asked it and then rewrote the parts I need.
02:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> how long did it take you to debug it
02:32 < bridge> <_qey> I’d say many of those worked the first try.
02:32 < bridge> <_qey> There was one issue I couldn’t resolve, then I asked ChatGPT and it couldn’t either, so that’s where is sucks. But overall a great tool.
02:33 < bridge> <_qey> Not certain about replacing us programming folks in the next 6 months entirely, but it definitely will replace some.
02:35 < bridge> <_qey> It’s still too stupid to write a full-fledged app just by receiving a two-sentence prompt, but if you already good with algorithmic thinking, it’s capable of shorten your time spent on the project by 3-4 times.

02:36 < bridge> <_qey> I actually straight up ‘outsource’ half of my work to ChatGPT, worth the $20 a month I spend for the paid plan.
03:29 < bridge> <zhn> reflection
03:32 < bridge> <zhn> or did they move it for another release

07:30 < bridge> <louis> yikes
07:30 < bridge> <louis> im in the ai has a plateau camp so that's not great news 😹
08:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its all just big number go boom to me
08:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like, ive seen so much of "AI NEVER SLEEPS" that its becoming very tiring
08:06 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like, ok? yea sure a new modle is better than the last one. tell me something thats actually exciting
08:27 < bridge> <totar> if you don't think beating 168924 out of 169074 codeforces users is "exciting" then idk what is.
08:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wtf is a codeforce
08:51 < bridge> <teero777> https://codeforces.com/
08:55 < bridge> <teero777> @totar you should host the next problem xd make them solve aip
08:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> make them write a fifo script for evelyn
09:04 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon have you ever thought of making an anti-cheat , which when the next user is sent an advertisement for a cheat we all know , then this person just bounced back on the IP
09:06 < bridge> <DeFreddie> basically leetcode with chess rating. but to be fair the problems hey have are much better than leetcode for sure.
09:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://github.com/furo321/ddnet-bombtag/blob/3a3cb526fbe0b8ae29e4a091047d01995e8d0258/src/antibot/antibot_bombtag.cpp#L117-L184
09:11 < bridge> <DeFreddie> found my codeforces account from highschool, 1451. that's like the default rating isn't it:justatest:
09:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> should i sign up ? :o
09:12 < bridge> <DeFreddie> if you enjoy timed ACM, maybe. i honestly don't.
09:12 < bridge> <woidless> I use ddpp
09:12 < bridge> <DeFreddie> ~~you have to do it live and catch events, which might not suit most people that has actual jobs~~
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> and i sent you exactly what you want <a:Scared:1132025669115727962>  - ask chiller nicely to add it if he wants
09:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> our school let us do every out of timezone codeforces and make us stay until 10pm just to catch an event. maybe that's the reason i don't like it tho
09:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> :justatest:
09:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> our school let us do very out of timezone codeforces and make us stay until 10pm just to catch an event. maybe that's the reason i don't like it tho
09:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> we often sleep in the classroom after that just cuz it is so late
10:49 < bridge> <ikove_> ><
12:13 < bridge> <DeFreddie> @blaiszephyr i think you might have mislead someone into making "all" and "me" accepted by all interger args and got merged :kek:
12:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Huuuuuh
12:22 < bridge> <DeFreddie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9415#issuecomment-2558084274
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno the exact problem
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but IMO it's better to not mix integers and string arguments.
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we need a `tp me` command it might as well be `tp_me`
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if this creates more commands in total
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> such extra cases are easily forgotten anyway
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet most ddnet players don't know that you can type `/team -1`
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply bcs they are no developers
12:24 < bridge> <DeFreddie> we have victim arg type for exactly all and me. and the original issue really isn't a bug
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or `/top5 -5`
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 did you by chance try out to move the best ranks into it's own table to see the performance improvement already?
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We discussed this a while ago.
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I sometimes join the linear servers and the commands are just super slower, and ppl request it often enough to create some kind of queue that never clears up xD
12:30 < bridge> <kebscs> The issue was commands could only take 1 victim arg, no more
12:31 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i know
12:31 < bridge> <DeFreddie> either way that PR is just bogus
12:31 < bridge> <kebscs> Bad "fix" pr
12:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> GG I baited :cat_sad:
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah your comment is actually good
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah string to int parsing
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is also actually bad imo xD
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should just reject the cmd
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead of falling back to 0
12:34 < bridge> <DeFreddie> ~~wdym ACTUALLY good~~
12:34 < bridge> <DeFreddie> that's the whole point of having a validator, the guy just bypassed it. we did reject string
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so where do we use these `me` args in first place?
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nowhere?
12:35 < bridge> <DeFreddie> we have a special victim argument type
12:35 < bridge> <DeFreddie> that is handled by GetVictim instead of GetInteger
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol and it's not implemented for tele?
12:35 < bridge> <DeFreddie> which works fine
12:35 < bridge> <DeFreddie> not
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am surprised tbh
12:36 < bridge> <DeFreddie> ye no, tele wasn't implemented with victim arg. and one of the reason is https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1319990497938509855
12:37 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i'm like pretty sure people thought it was working just because we don't have validators and it happens to do the thing they want before. (you know, just doing client 0)
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it works in ddnet 17
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i connected a dummy and typed `tele me`
12:37 < bridge> <DeFreddie> ye that's just tele 0
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or can you simply type tele
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah it's read like tele to?
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's kinda sad but i rarely use rcon xD
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah you right
12:38 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i'm not exactly sure. but i also didn't rollback to ddnet 17 to check if it was handling victim args
12:38 < bridge> <DeFreddie> but i doubt it was
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tele <to> <whom>
12:39 < bridge> <DeFreddie> it's just you were 0 and dummy was 1, when you joins a new server so it checks out
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if whom not given, then it uses you
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so why can we only take 1 victim arg?
12:39 < bridge> <DeFreddie> someone implemented poorly
12:39 < bridge> <DeFreddie> idk
12:39 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i could make it work with multiple right now
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
12:40 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i am still sick tho, so maybe later
12:40 < bridge> <DeFreddie> it's a good thing the validation is implement so we can catch this
12:40 < bridge> <DeFreddie> and the guy just implemented a validation bypass
12:40 < bridge> <DeFreddie> :justatest:
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is still the question if the logic of teleporting _all_ players should be mixed with teleporting _one_ player
12:41 < bridge> <DeFreddie> it makes sense to me until it doesn't
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i name myself `all` you might accidentially type all, instead of my id
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno xd
12:41 < bridge> <DeFreddie> but i think handling a special case inside a con method to reject all where you don't need it but you still need me is pretty trivial anyway
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it says tele_id it's clear
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or tele_all
12:42 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i mean it is a practice command who cares
12:42 < bridge> <DeFreddie> just telecursor to where you were and learn from the mistake
12:42 < bridge> <DeFreddie> idk
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure, but the point is about how the console should behave in general
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is clear behavior without edge cases better or having such edge cases but loosing inactivity
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> intuitivity
12:43 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i don't plan on touching tele anyway. i could just fix the victim handling and someone else can decide what to do with it
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is clear behavior without edge cases better or having such edge cases but loosing
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i want your opinion
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your a gamedev xd
12:44 < bridge> <DeFreddie> sure, honestly if it is only loose in practice command i don't really have a problem with cuz people do use them like that clearly.
12:46 < bridge> <DeFreddie> if somehow a client command got victim arg then i might have a problem with it, since it wasn't really supposed to be used by everyone like that.
12:48 < bridge> <DeFreddie> practice and tester commands are used by basically everyone. we already have the telecursor teleto tele and tp mess where they do the exact same thing in some cases or version but wildly different things in other cases or version. these commands are always changing due to how people use them incorrectly.
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it's really a mess
12:50 < bridge> <DeFreddie> it's a mess cuz "everyone" jumped in and changing them on their own. kinda like this bogus PR did.
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> optional parameters are also a problem imo
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> especially if two optional parameters follow each other
12:51 < bridge> <DeFreddie> imo it was fine until it behave differently for each position depending on the number of arguments
12:52 < bridge> <DeFreddie> and if they command auto fills the optionals with a value it is basically non optional anyway
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i gotta say i generally like if there is a long version for every command
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tpme
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> teleport_me
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pros use the short one, newcomers use the long
12:52 < bridge> <DeFreddie> but if tele 1 and tele 1 0 does different things then i don't like it
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh funny, bcs it does in many cases
12:53 < bridge> <louis> "tele here" (implied me)
12:53 < bridge> <louis> "tele this here"
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you don't have client id 0
12:53 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i'm not a tester tho, i don't know half of these do
12:53 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i'm not a tester tho, i don't know what half of these do
12:55 < bridge> <louis> id rather use chat commands
12:55 < bridge> <louis> tele rcon commands for players is really annoying because i don't want to find out a characters id
12:57 < bridge> <DeFreddie> :greenthing: ~~time to make it GUI and hotkey based, and remove all tester commands~~
12:58 < bridge> <DeFreddie> @louis.place btw was the announcement a threat :justatest:
13:04 < bridge> <louis> yes, people better show up
13:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Better be a nouis monster
13:07 < bridge> <syrinok> :nouis:
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, I was going to but I noticed it was still acceptable so I didn't spend time on it
13:12 < bridge> <DeFreddie> @blaiszephyr what have you done
13:12 < bridge> <DeFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320001012878016582/image.png?ex=6768023d&is=6766b0bd&hm=36d48fa155cbeddb2f15a00e64e4394fa54fa4e051469f160e6a1c691dc6230e&
13:12 < bridge> <DeFreddie> dude is convinced
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> I'm working on some antibot improvements rn. After that I can give it a go
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is chinese btw
13:13 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i am too
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow
13:13 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i mean i saw his in game id
13:14 < bridge> <DeFreddie> btw what's that has to do with anything tho or it is just a fun fact
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i wondered if you know
13:14 < bridge> <DeFreddie> oh ye
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i assume we dont have many chinese devs
13:14 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i saw it
13:15 < bridge> <DeFreddie> we have a few
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pathos is japnese or smth i assume?
13:15 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i can count 4 in my head already
13:15 < bridge> <DeFreddie> 5
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> forgottencat doesnt count
13:15 < bridge> <DeFreddie> but if you are talking about people with Dev role here, then idk
13:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> if we just talk about code PRs then i can count 5 (like ever) without forgottencat cuz he didn't cross my mind.
13:16 < bridge> <DeFreddie> active ones maybe 2
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there was this chera guy
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but dunno the exact name anymore
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cherry?
13:17 < bridge> <DeFreddie> not in my mind either
13:17 < bridge> <DeFreddie> chera st or smth like that
13:18 < bridge> <DeFreddie> piooooo, me and the author of this bogus pr are the recent ones
13:18 < bridge> <DeFreddie> the demo rendering was a chinese guy's pr iirc. and eki added a few dummy commands which i still hate
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ST-Chara
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the demo to video?
13:19 < bridge> <DeFreddie> ye
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wasn't that hmh
13:19 < bridge> <DeFreddie> so maybe not.
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah true prioooo
13:19 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i remember a chinese dev talking about it so i assumed
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah true pioooo
13:20 < bridge> <DeFreddie> #1928 nope, our guy for sure
13:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1928
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah that guy
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i remember him
13:20 < bridge> <DeFreddie> he finished it i guess
13:20 < bridge> <DeFreddie> not active here but still active in life, we had dinners recently
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol, ez
13:21 < bridge> <DeFreddie> > still active in life
13:21 < bridge> <DeFreddie> that means have contact with me i guess. not like.. you know still alive
13:21 < bridge> <DeFreddie> cuz that's almost everyone
13:22 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i blocked this guy lol
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cancel culture
13:22 < bridge> <DeFreddie> :nouis: i kinda blocked a lot of dudes
13:22 < bridge> <DeFreddie> maybe i'm twitter
13:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> At least you're not Reddit
13:23 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i am...
13:23 < bridge> <DeFreddie> well i was
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least you are not x haha
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie leak https://github.com/orgs/TeeworldsCN/people
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then we know all devs
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hehe
13:24 < bridge> <DeFreddie> not even active
13:24 < bridge> <DeFreddie> most got jobs now and just left
13:25 < bridge> <DeFreddie> there are new guys trying to join but they just forked our private stuff and bait so i stopped trusting people saying they want to help
13:25 < bridge> <DeFreddie> there are new guys trying to join but they just forked our private stuff and bailed so i stopped trusting people saying they want to help
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> trust level 0 it is
13:25 < bridge> <DeFreddie> chn is really not good at contribute for some reason
13:25 < bridge> <DeFreddie> maybe they don't know how?
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait 20 years and most oss devs come from china and india
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait 20 years and most os devs come from china and india
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or AI
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
13:27 < bridge> <DeFreddie> idk
13:28 < bridge> <DeFreddie> most people asked me whether they can help usually just don't unless it was asking me to add support for their mods
13:28 < bridge> <DeFreddie> which is not really helping
13:28 < bridge> <DeFreddie> even though technically they suggested something
13:28 < bridge> <DeFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
13:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm guessing English hard?
13:29 < bridge> <DeFreddie> you don't need english to contribute to teeworlds**CN**
13:29 < bridge> <DeFreddie> :justatest:
13:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :justatest:
13:30 < bridge> <DeFreddie> well maybe you do since i do write a lot of stuff in english, but if they asked i can just translate them in chinese.
13:31 < bridge> <DeFreddie> but to be fair chinese is really imprecise to the point is really difficult to give instructions or directions in chinese imho
13:31 < bridge> <DeFreddie> even at work it is extremely hard to explain things in chinese
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie have u ever livestreamed in english?
13:32 < bridge> <DeFreddie> no
13:32 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i never livestreamed
13:32 < bridge> <DeFreddie> also i can yap via test. i'm not the best english speaker
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now i am interested in hearing your speaking english lol
13:32 < bridge> <DeFreddie> also i can yap via text. i'm not the best english speaker
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @forgottenabscat i still wait for your livestream btw
13:32 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i think only deen heard me speak before
13:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There's this weird dichotomy I see. East Asian culture is way more collectivist than western culture (or more like western culture is hyper indivualistic) yet somehow it appears that western culture has stronger emphasis on teamwork and East Asian culture focuses on individual performance
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @inv41idu53rn4m3 where u from btw
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u european?
13:33 < bridge> <DeFreddie> fin
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah boring xd
13:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There's this weird dichotomy I see. East Asian culture is way more collectivist than western culture (or more like western culture is hyper individualistic) yet somehow it appears that western culture has stronger emphasis on teamwork and East Asian culture focuses on individual performance
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they probs speak perfect english
13:33 < bridge> <DeFreddie> as in shark fin
13:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I have a pretty strong accent but I'd say I'm quite good yeah
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all nothern countries are like english elites
13:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Oddly enough I don't sound like I have a Finnish accent
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i go to the Netherlands and everyone speaks better than me lmao
13:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe because I heard a lot of and spoke a bit of Russian as a kid
13:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but Tele was certainly broken with me and all, which worked before I'm pretty aure
13:52 < bridge> <DeFreddie> do you want to find the code for it? cuz if the implementation wasn't changed it really have only ever worked because you were client 0 and your dummy were client 1
13:52 < bridge> <DeFreddie> could really just be a coincidence
13:52 < bridge> <DeFreddie> all and me will be become 0 for int args
13:53 < bridge> <DeFreddie> i doubt we had a victim implementation of that and changed it to int somehow
13:53 < bridge> <DeFreddie> even juppy remember it working but it is pretty easy to see what is happening https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1319992130466353256
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's like nelson mandela effect, everyone remembers it incorrectly
13:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> after one month of work i am finally able to decode the 0.6 connless packet header and the payload
14:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> lets go
14:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats what i call progress
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which lang do u use
14:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Hot
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> couldnt u have used twlib2?
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or libtw2
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or whatever
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> i could
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> but whats the point
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you wanted a small challenge
14:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i dont really like the callback and warn stuff in libtw2
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> its driving me crazy
14:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> probably just a skill issue
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have read about the warn stuff b4, but not sure if it was from u or gerdoe
14:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> nah i never talked about it
14:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320014100109201449/image.png?ex=67680e6e&is=6766bcee&hm=1d37b256f2ab466b911a5463ba1f9b4c95fd1418ed41a467c09ce89e81cf29ab&
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this?
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> well its still there
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> or is it a fork
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ig a small problem of rust is that Result is more meant for _real_ errors and these are warnings that can be ignored
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or smth
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gerdoe takes a repo and transforms it to a completely different thing
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> casual gerdoe
14:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> that was my plan
14:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> but too much work xd
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw the initial code seems like over 9 years old, maybe he'd accept a different solution
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah you can ofc also just do your own lmao
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you are interested in ddnet physics, twgame needs contributors 😬
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> ive seen it
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> looks promising
14:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> not sure how i can help
14:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont really know much about the game
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> copy the c code, paste as rust code
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> write infinite amount of tests that your port is correct
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez pz
15:09 < bridge> <murpi> Can a DDNet server potentially detect if a user is using dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) and display both IP addresses? (I'm asking if this is generally possible, not whether it's currently supported.)
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not without external services i think
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe u could identify the ip address and make a guess or smth xd
15:25 < bridge> <ItFreddie> it is generally not possible to tell if two IPs are from the same device i believe
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it need to be a server only feature?
15:30 < bridge> <murpi> It’d be primarily useful as another way to identify a user
15:30 < bridge> <ItFreddie> ye i don't think that's possible. even if you can let client self report two ips, i think there might still be ways to fake the other ip if a bad actor coded the self report themselves.
15:31 < bridge> <murpi> Sadge, alright. CGNATs are currently the bane of my existence :C
15:32 < bridge> <ItFreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866> implement the account thing already
15:32 < bridge> <ItFreddie> lol
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add secure connection
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or contribute to twgame
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you have a first class account support client
15:35 < bridge> <murpi> <a:yescat:1111857850587807784>
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> You can prevent faking by making the client do a tcp connection on both. But you can't stop the client from just not making a connection on the other ip
15:45 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i mean, can you even tell if the two ips are from the same device. idk how tcp matters.
15:45 < bridge> <_qey> Or just ban IPv6?
15:45 < bridge> <learath2> The full handshake of tcp prevents spoofing
15:45 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i'm not talking about spoofing tho
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> Well you can definitely "fake" it for some definition of "faking". But you can't "fake" that you have an ip unless you really have it
15:46 < bridge> <ItFreddie> ye
15:47 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i guess for moderating purpose it might be fine
15:47 < bridge> <ItFreddie> but again, it is definitely possible for a malicious client to just have a pool of ip available to act as a second target
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is faking even our problem here?
15:49 < bridge> <ItFreddie> might be, depends on what murpi really want to do
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the ddnet protocol also does a handshake kinda
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought it was more about hiding than faking
15:51 < bridge> <ItFreddie> if a malicious client is widely used and someone have remote control to that client, the bad actor can play on a ipv4 and report a second ipv6 that isn't theirs. if that gets banned, they can just switch around and connect with their own ipv6 and report a second ipv4 from the pool.
15:51 < bridge> <ItFreddie> they can only do it once tho
15:51 < bridge> <ItFreddie> :nouis:
15:53 < bridge> <ItFreddie> well if someone have a bot pool already, they can just use the bot pool itself so probably doesn't matter anyway. disregard what i said i guess
15:53 < bridge> <ItFreddie> :kek:
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro, coding for 2 hours and then the insight that you should git stash your shit, you took the wrong turn 😂
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hurts
16:07 < bridge> <ItFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> There is no way to actually moderate a game like this without accounts
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> There is no clever technical solution
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> AI
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> after another 3 hours i am able to respond to the connless packet
17:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320060291731427349/image.png?ex=67683973&is=6766e7f3&hm=8516481c7c2aed2e62b607d8b95f6526e1357974c038e47e9d2cb4e6b7bc10e5&
17:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> hell yeah
17:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> weird thing is that i have to convert numbers to strings
17:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320060495830585415/image.png?ex=676839a3&is=6766e823&hm=3a8e3dff7bc12e3e70292e17d1c1f9cdaa709e6b1868883887b776268b52b289&
17:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> whats the idea behind this
17:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> its only in 0.6
17:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> and not in 0.7
17:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> nice
17:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320066873462751232/image.png?ex=67683f94&is=6766ee14&hm=6f10eec649862b0a41a9d73e0e25be7164016b2c70c034969e2272a8fd50e2e4&
17:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> ban!
17:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> no its rust
17:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust = gud
17:40 < bridge> <ItFreddie> @jupeyy_keks have you tried livestreaming ddnet from a server with software renderer. do you think it is doable?
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on a desktop cpu 100%
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on a vps, not so sure
17:42 < bridge> <ItFreddie> oof
17:42 < bridge> <ItFreddie> like even if you limit fps to 60 or 30?
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, depends on if your vps is dedicated hardware ig
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can try running ddnet on a single cpu core
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my cpu is old, so modern vps could beat it
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or match it
17:44 < bridge> <ItFreddie> if you can test it that would be appreciated.
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, full hd is enough ig?
17:46 < bridge> <ItFreddie> yes
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 core vs 2 vs 4
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320070306592854147/image.png?ex=676842c6&is=6766f146&hm=da2ea406a636d8fba672b3b94d02c82b995c7bb8bda4ae6c0ed21bfef743cef0&

17:48 < bridge> <ItFreddie> ah
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with entities you can get a bit more ofc
17:48 < bridge> <ItFreddie> too bad then
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 4 cores is around 60fps xd
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> doesn't sound too bad
17:48 < bridge> <ItFreddie> ye but that's one expensive vps
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your price limit?
17:49 < bridge> <ItFreddie> price limit: CHINAH
17:49 < bridge> <ItFreddie> tbh i havent fully decided yet
17:50 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i kinda want to do a auto live stream thing where you can just call a vote in the chat to find a player and spectate them
17:51 < bridge> <ItFreddie> probably need to disable chat and names (or at least heavily censored with a chinese censorlist) since it is china
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. ARM cores are quite cheap already:
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.netcup.com/de/server/arm-server/vps-2000-arm-g11-mnz
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
17:52 < bridge> <ItFreddie> but i kinda need a pretty ok connection to china to stream it tho
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but these shared vps cpus are also often super bad xD
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dedicated ones perform much better
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also you could stream in hd ready
17:53 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i could try that i guess
17:53 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i might just use an actual small box at home instead of a server maybe
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with hd ready i hit around 50fps with 2 cores
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in entities around 75 fps
17:54 < bridge> <ItFreddie> what about without chat
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah local server, so chat is off after 5 seconds
17:54 < bridge> <ItFreddie> right
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320071997841080461/image.png?ex=6768445a&is=6766f2da&hm=9007d57204903be91a6a8380f5d8865dc5e1fd96af5b1ec5cf3c31d2f06428e3&
17:55 < bridge> <ItFreddie> 50 is doable
17:55 < bridge> <ItFreddie> the community stream at chn max out at 30fps
17:55 < bridge> <ItFreddie> you could push 60 but they reencode to 30 anyway
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can also try the opengl software renderer, maybe it's faster
17:56 < bridge> <ItFreddie> still need to encode tho. so maybe i can only know if i tried it myself
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true, but encoding hd ready is not too hard ig
17:56 < bridge> <ItFreddie> that is true
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> opengl is slower
17:56 < bridge> <ItFreddie> right
17:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> eitherway 50 without entity seems fine
17:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i can find two cores somewhere i believe
17:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
17:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> and we have spec cursor now, so it would look pretty ok i think
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:58 < bridge> <ItFreddie> thanks for testing
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does speccing dyn cam also move your camera?
17:58 < bridge> <ItFreddie> yes, but not one to one.
17:58 < bridge> <ItFreddie> smooth dyncam with a hardcoded setting is always on when specing dyncam
17:59 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i mean there are really spinning dyncam users which would make regular dyncam user sick too.
18:00 < bridge> <ItFreddie> forcing smooth dyncam for watching stuff is pretty sensible imho
18:21 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i actually have quite a few android devices
18:21 < bridge> <ItFreddie> they are probably low power enough and good enough to push streams and just use the new ddnet android
18:22 < bridge> <ItFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
19:03 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> :justatest:
19:04 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> too laggy
19:20 < bridge> <ItFreddie> they can go on bilibili just stream there
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess his tablet is too weak xd
21:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> aw man suspend breaks wifi now
21:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and I have no clue since when since it's months since I last used wifi
21:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a couple other things that aren't working perfectly too
21:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't want to deal with fixing all that right now
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> check gentoo wiki
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its there
21:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> gentuah
21:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think I'm checking journalctl first
22:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> hauk gentuah
