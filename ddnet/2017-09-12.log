02:53 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @heinrich5991 this might interest you, I think you asked me for something like this for vanilla some time ago: https://github.com/H-M-H/bundle_libs
07:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> When i vote for the maps Injection and Injection 2, the server switches to moderate with caventure map. Seems like maps are missing?
07:36 <+ddnet-discord> <ScReeNy> same goes for a lot of maps
08:45 <@deen> Apparently setting different compiler optimizations with the gcc version in debian 9 makes the server use 100% cpu even when nothing is going on :D
08:46 <@deen> heinrich5991: i think it has to advance the game state?
08:46 <@deen> heinrich5991: or you mean just stay at the same tick?
10:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: staying at the same game tick
10:09 <@heinrich5991> but I haven't measured how much CPU it actually costs
10:10 <@heinrich5991> the higher optimization levels probably exposed bugs, are there coredumps?
10:11 <@deen> probably, but I didn't care to collect
10:11 <@deen> should be very easy to reproduce
10:11 <@deen> just compile with -Ofast -march=native -mtune=native -flto=10
10:12 <@deen> I remember the first ones didn't cause any harm in the past, so it's probably -flto=10
10:12 <@heinrich5991> don't enable -Ofast, it disables standards compliance
10:12 <@heinrich5991> (and also -ffast-math)
10:13 <@heinrich5991> yea, flto might be causing it, lemme see
10:18 <+eeeee> are we clean in -fsanitize=address and -fsanitize=undefined ?
10:19 <@deen> probably not
10:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Can u guys played ddnet in a window?  I dont have fullscreen checked but still im playing with fullscreen i can check and uncheck it in settings nothing happenes
10:22 <@deen> even after restartin the client?
10:22 <@deen> and choosing a smaller resolution?
10:22 <@deen> and using the most recent client version?
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Y
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Idk
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> xD
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Wait
10:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> I got it
10:44 <@heinrich5991> debug info of course destroys the bug :/
11:33 <@deen> heinrich5991: fixing sanitizer warnings like eeeee suggested could help
11:33 <@deen> I didn't know posix has asynchronous I/O
11:38 <@deen> could be nice for logging and writing demos
11:38 <@deen> not sure how reasonable the apis and the corresponding windows ones are though
13:05 <+Learath2> deen: loading the map Injection seems to crash the server
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> or the map is missing or sth
13:09 <@heinrich5991> asynchronous IO was poor on POSIX IIRC
13:10 <@deen> Learath2: well, debug it? you have ssh access, right?
13:10 <+Learath2> yeah checking it out
13:11 <+Learath2> can't check dmesg nor know where we put coredumps tho
13:11 <+Learath2> but fear not, will figure it all out :)
13:11 <@deen> coredumps in same directory
13:11 <@deen> use root for dmesg
13:11 <@deen> Most likely it's still failing because of old server versions compiled with lto
13:12 <+Learath2> dont think i have root on GER
13:12 <+Learath2> yeah lemme check the lto thing first
13:12 <@deen> tried it on an empty new serveR?
13:13 <@deen> ah shit
13:13 <@deen> it still compiles with lto
13:13 <@deen> on GER
13:13 <@deen> let me fix that quickly
13:14 <+Learath2> deen: which script compiles the server?
13:14 <@deen> I've done that already
13:14 <@deen> cd src; ./build.sh
13:15 <@deen> I think I forgot to copy the new build.sh on GER, oops
13:16 <+Learath2> deen: also servers/test/data/maps seems empty
13:16 <+Learath2> no idea what happened there
13:16 <@deen> yeah, servers were restarted
13:16 <@deen> to fix vulnerability
13:16 <@deen> needs to be mounted again
13:16 <@deen> see run-all.sh
13:18 <+Learath2> \o/
13:19 <@deen> (I guess the mount fails when ddnet.tw is still offline so it never remounts it later)
13:19 <+Learath2> could mount it in a loop until it succeeds i guess
13:19 <@deen> or use automount
13:28 <+Learath2> does automount make sure it mounts even?
13:28 <@deen> i think it blocks access until it's mounted, but not sure
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> What techniques would you say are easier with weak hook
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> that thing where you drag someone who is above hook thrus and have to go below obstacles
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the bigger the obstacle the easier it is with weak i guess
16:29 <@deen> @Dr.Jekyll for me everything was easier with weak since I always played with it
16:29 <@deen> so you just get used to it
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> sure theres a big aspect of getting practice
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> but strong hook is objectively better at some things
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/339464841846587402/357165312631898112/screenshot_2017-09-12_16-06-22.png
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> anyone know how to fix this bug?
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> might have to do with quads and clipping
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what bug
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> needs a red mspaint circle
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> the white stripes in the middle of the screen
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> delete the quad .. ?
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> whats it supposed to look like
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> this is how it usually looks
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> borderfix/dilate?
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/357171997064560644/screenshot_2017-09-12_16-33-22.png
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what map
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/357172566093463552/run_down_the_rabbithole.map
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it is online ?
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> somewhere
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander i think unique servers had it
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Tezcan> yes
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea im there
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> i dont see the smudge
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @jao well the natural question is, when does it happen?
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> randomly on maps that have clipping and quads, not on every map
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but does it always look like that for you or do you have to move around or sth like that?
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> is the smudge fixed right there as you move or does it move with you?
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @Learath2 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/339464841846587402/357169828303208448/screenshot_2017-09-12_16-25-00.png
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> fuck
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i changed anti aliasing to 0
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and my gam ecrashed
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> have to test it
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-live
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it worked ?
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> what's with ddnet-live?
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just found it
17:40 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes, it worked
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> it just had no use ðŸ˜„
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im curious how it looked xD
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> just a video of the game
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> chat was the interface to control it
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Does it consume a lot resources?
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yeah, because intel is stupid
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe you could run it on gpu ?
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> my intel cpu has an h264 encoder included, but you can only access it through some proprietary media library
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so it only works on 1-2 linux distributions in some specific versions
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> totally ridiculous
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you run it on vps ?
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> https://hookrace.net/blog/ddnet-live/
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nope, at home
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> have you tried AMD Hardware Encoder or from nvidia ? ðŸ˜„
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nope, i don't own any gpus
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> only included intel ones
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> they are probably really bad quality for the bitrate anyway
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Hmm, understand :/ because it could be muuch faster
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> speed is not the problem, it just consumes a few cpu cores and 10 W or so
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I was using it while streaming
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i think, 3k bitrate is optimal
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for hd
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, good quality, without smoothing
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> try out veryslow compared to veryfast in x264 with 3000 bitrate and compare the result
17:49 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> there can be HUGE differences at same bitrate
17:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and that weird mosaic
17:49 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> always depends on how much cpu you want to use
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, that's right ðŸ˜‰ I never went below "fast" setting
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was too hard for my computer to stream and run game smoothly
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> there is even option "placebo" ðŸ˜„
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Have you ever bought a network card? I have to buy 1gbps one. Maybe you have any recommendation
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> why do you have to buy one?
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Intel is usually the safe guess
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Cuz, my current network card
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> doesn't support ISP's router
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> huh?
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Maybe use another cable
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which they gave me to handle fiber cables
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i tried
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> A looot things
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and the only one which worked
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Never heard about something like that
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is usign my old router
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> as a bridge
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I was talking about it a month ago
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> are you sure that's not a software problem?
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> dhcp?
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that my connection has incredibly long time to estabilkish connection
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm not sure
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I made a topic
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www.tenforums.com/network-sharing/92817-long-establishing-connection-router-windows-10-a.html
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> incompatibility between network devices should not happen nowawadays in 1gbit/s
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on windows 10 forum
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> maybe in 10-100 gbit/s
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i tried a lot things, nothing helped ðŸ˜„
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even my ISP told me that
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> tried linux?
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "hey, buy new network card"
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nope, i didn't
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know that while booting
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> network is estabilished
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then don't
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> if it works immediately in safe mode, then it's clearly a software problem
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, it works perfectly with 100mbs router
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so its weird
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> try removing the network driver
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea i tried
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i even formated computer
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and, it stopped workes in safe mode
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> as well
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> settings of your network driver
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and fumble around there
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea i tried change negotiation settings
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to force 1gbs port
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i have idea
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> try installing another driver
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i will download live linux
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and try it there
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and disabling dhcp
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I disabled DHCP. I even forced static IP
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to use routers gateway
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> etc
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> turn off all other software?
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup, i did clean run
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> only windows
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> still nothing
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and I think windows has something between safe mode and normal mode
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> where you can select which components to load and which not
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or at least old versions had that, could be used to bisect where the problem comes from
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, i disabled every external programms services
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> disabled all programs on startup
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and i have to say, that the problem were even after fresh installation
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so i bet, it's not because of external programs/drivers
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i tried at least 2 network drivers
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the built-in and those from motherboard website (asrock)
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> might be the same
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then i don't know which one i should download ðŸ˜„ D
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> PCI\VEN_10EC&DEV_8168&SUBSYS_81681849&REV_06
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> does live debian will support network connectio ?
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> debian 9.1 (y)
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> last time i used debian 7
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> installing packages on live ver, will do it to ram ?
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> what else do you expect?
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> a cloud disk?
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> would be cool
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no, i was thinking if it would store it on disk or
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> somehwere
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in CPU memory maybe
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yeah, just format the entire disk
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> cpu memory? ðŸ˜„
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> cache is not thaaaat big yet I think
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
18:33 < Savander_d> :D
18:33 <+Savander_d> it works via live Debian
18:33 <+Savander_d> i hate Windows 10 
21:59 <+eeeee> lol that guy just went ahead and ported ddnet to shaders
21:59 <+eeeee> that's gonna be a huge PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...Jupeyy:master
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> shaders ?
22:02 <@heinrich5991> programs that run on gpus
22:09 <+Learath2> damn i wanted to do that, would have been good practice
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> that is indeed funny, I am also creating some stuff to run on my gpu atm (cuda & opengl maybe also opencl later), it is not releated to ddnet though
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Nice HMH alive :feelsamazingman:
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> has someone tried http://nanapro.org and know if it's good? (gui-library)
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ocornut/imgui this one looks good :o
22:56 <@heinrich5991> both look nonnative
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yep
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> can't decide what to use :D
22:58 <@heinrich5991> you don't want native-looking UI?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> imgui is cute
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> last looks best
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nah, thosei  sent look modern
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if i would want native looking ui i would use c# wpf..
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the last one looks nice but i've never used it
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> imgui is nice for quickly whipping up debug menus
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yep, thats what looks like from their images
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> there is any gui that can be customized with css?
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :d
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> electrum or someshit like that
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> u mean electron
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and it is nodejs in a desktop enviroment
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so html
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then you don't have likmits?
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://electron.atom.io/
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (pss, i think discord uses electron)
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ; O?
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (yep, scroll down)
23:02 <@heinrich5991> qt and gtk can be customized by css I think
23:02 <@heinrich5991> and aren't even as resource-heavy as electron
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> there was some other thing that turns a website into a native app by bundling chromium with it
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> stupid stuff imho
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ^
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> discord
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> definitely is built with electron
23:03 <@heinrich5991> yes :(
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/0cg23zo785038
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's not that bad imo
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what with my domain
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it's like having a game open 200mb~
23:04 <@heinrich5991> discord is the program that uses the most memory, right after my browser
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> gotta love chromium using as much ram as Maya
23:05 <@heinrich5991> (discord uses 300MB for me)
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> the nuklear gui lib i sent is made with ansi C
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "No dependencies (not even the standard library if not wanted)"
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xD
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> a nice sentiment
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> would use that
23:06 <@heinrich5991> that must be a lie :D you can't do a UI without using winapi on windows
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 23634 lines of code
23:06 <@heinrich5991> tw level I think
23:06 <@heinrich5991> tw has ~35k?
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear/blob/master/nuklear.h
23:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hmm too many lines of code
23:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you need to #include the winapi right?
23:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i cant find any include with it
23:16 <@heinrich5991> how do you expect to make UI without dependencies?
23:16 <@heinrich5991> the C standards provides no facilities to do so
23:16 <@heinrich5991> -s
23:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i see, it is a embeddable user inerface
23:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> which means it needs a renderbackend or OS window
23:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (sdl for example)
