02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fully federated :pepeW:
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mfw we are never getting accounts because we can't settle for anything less than perfect
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: üí¶ ok, I'm sure discord is still fine for tourneys as authentication
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> fully what
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> accounts good but the season 2 stuff discussed is meh unless its really good imo
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have to rip the bandaid sooner or later
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no fix to the issue, have to just accept it and move on
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wat issue
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no way for us to identify and move 1000 peoples points to their new accounts
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well the way i see it is that without adding some new substance, the season 2 is essentially just adding achievements and setting pointcount of everyone to 0
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you forgot asia üòÑ
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> True, make it 3000
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which will be fun for a while but will just become a chore at some point
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you come up with something, let us know
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i say set points to 0, but then shove all the currently rls maps in "legacy" pool, limit achievements for legacy pool (maybe up to like get 10,000 legacy points) and release all future maps under quality rules and add new features
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just don't add accounts 4head isn't a good solution
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You still lose your legacy points and have to get them back, how does that help?
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but the legacy points are given less value
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides how is our entire map pool becoming legacy helping anyway? Most maps released meet pretty high quality standards anyway, not like mapping changed that much to justify archiving everything else
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and you can focus on new released maps, possibly with diff features or ranking system
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes well that's an issue i guess, a lot of recent maps are very high quality
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but over half of them aren't
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddmax, etc
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the way i see it is if you set everyone back to square one, you should give something new or at least slightly changed to work to
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddmax and oldschool aside which are for archival mostly anyway, I think the rest of the pool is pretty clean except for some very ugly solo and run maps
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think becoming overly strict when it comes to maps / skins is a bad thing, you just end up with less options.
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well i wrote on the github but my very radical view is remove all the jank tiles and jank maps for a new season
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think people would be more happy with a legacy point pool than not, because without a legacy pool it seems like they have to re-do all their progress
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Speeders and stoppers getting fixed up for a new season would be good imo
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Purging the entire map pool to legacy would imo be a little too radical
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i support purging a large majority and hand-picking a lot of the better qualities and classics üñêÔ∏è\
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `2130 /var/www/releases/releases` we have upwards of 2k maps, I don't think we'll realistically be able to hand-pick much here üòõ
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well depending on the criteria you could
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe like the well-known ones
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ban stronghold
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Accounts would give us some really neat ways to reward players, like account locked skins as rewards, unique server join messages, profile badges for achievements etc
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I was going to suggest removing the ability to skip through kill tiles, doors, etc. But I know there's one map that requires passing through a door using said glitch üòÖ
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> see that's why you transfer all that stuff to legacy pool
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and start off with clean tiles, maybe add in a weapon or some new (nicely working) tiles
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> encourage mappers to come back, and then hopefully all goes well
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Accounts would give us some really neat ways to reward players, like account locked skins, unique server join messages, profile badges for achievements etc
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/keynames.h
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> 
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> this list shows f13-f24 as available keycodes, but the game doesnt seem to recognize f20-f24.  Is this the case for anyone else?
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/keynames.h
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> 
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> this list shows f1-f24 as available keycodes, but the game doesnt seem to recognize f20-f24.  Is this the case for anyone else?
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it that the button doesn't seem to be recognized or if you do `bind f20 sth` it doesn't work?
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> `bind f20 echo test`
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> works for 1-19
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but is it the binding that doesn't work or is it that pressing the button doesn't trigger the bind
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> There should be a seasonal map pool
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Which could function as a sort of monthly competition
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> good point, it seems to bind it but the button doesn't trigger it
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> as in, there's no errors when binding
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> With high quality maps
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't even know how I'll test this, where did you even find a device with f20? üòÑ
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041530876397363230/unknown.png
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> lol, i use via/vial keyboard firmware, it lets change any key on the keyboard to anything.  I basically am finding "dummy keys" to put on my mouse, so I can set my mouse button to say f24, and then in game bind f24 to something
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even on this monstrosity there is not even f13
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you try to bind something to f20 in the controls menu?
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> let me try
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> nope
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> doesn't work*
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, I have no idea how to debug this, I'll investigate how I can send an f24. If I can't I'll give you a test build to see what is going on there
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> awesome thanks üôÇ
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> if you happen to have a logitech mouse, the ghub software lets you bind mouse keys to f24
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> maybe autohotkey can send them too
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> looks like razer synapse also will let you
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a logitech mouse, I'll try tomorrow
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> no rush, thanks a lot
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't care insofar that I don't use it. if someone wants to fix it (or report a problem via github issues), I'll take a look though
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what specifically should I read? I read everything, but where do yo uwant a response (wasn't obvious to me)
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> actually i think f13-15 don't work either.  16 17 18 19 do tho
03:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> f13 seems to get registered as printscreen
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> scroll lock and pause too lol.  I'll stop there but there seems to be quite a few
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> does anyone know if a player can skip a solo/unsolo tile with enought velocity?
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> does anyone know if a player can skip a solo/unsolo tile with enough velocity?
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only with ninja
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> No answer. More about what makes sense to be respected
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> f13-f15 usually are print, scroll lock and pause on "modern" keyboards
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> yeah for sure, i just figured since they're listed in that keycodes page that they'd function as is
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> yes I agrea, if season 2 will happen then all old ddmax maps should be deleted from ddnet. @Learath2  Theres no point in keeping it as some sort of legacy (trash container - if no improvements would be done to those maps).
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> It's true that adding account support is really cool, though i'm afraid it will drive experienced/old players away from the game
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt it will drive then away, and if they do its their loss
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I still don't know what's going to happen to top players ranks. Will they just disappear or smth?
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Will there be any rewards?
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> I see a simple solution to that.
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> You go into ranks and you see Season 2 ranks.
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> There would be some link or tab or "something" to make you see Season 1 ranks.
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Season 1 ranks would be only as a "text" not assigned to anyone/anything (so no rewards for new accounts - you would spend tooo much time to try to verify that person is that actualy that person also season 1 ranks were cheated by all players even those top ones).
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But they will be archived probs
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They wont be deleted as in unrecoverable
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah its hard to give rewards to pre account players
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is just too much ppl
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The website definitely needs a rework tho
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its just bad with all the scripts over the place etc
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> next issue is about season pass
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My huffman doesnt work with the tw frequency table rip
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> F
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tokyo> @deen Can this ban system come in another way instead of ip ban, I wonder if everyone is cheating

11:06 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit i just wrote 160 lines of argument parsing before actually starting to write a single line of script logic xxxxxxxxxxxxD
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> who delete link? üòÑ
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Me
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> you are C++ developer? :troll:
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> hehe
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> why delete which link?
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> the memory saftey pdf?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> yes
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Looked fishy
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> why delete o.o
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> wow
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> censorship at is finest
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> `defense.gov` looked fishy?
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> How does this link contributed to this conversation?
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> which conversation
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> we do share all kinds of things here
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> I would love to see a comment what is being send in here then instead of a random link
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> comment to what?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> "link to xyz"
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> a
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> @Matodor go do proper marketing for your link. Myserious lack of information wont do here :p
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> okay
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> In its report, the U.S. National Security Agency recommends abandoning the C and C++ programming languages, as they give hackers more opportunities to use exploits. The NSA cites statistics from Google and Microsoft, according to which about 70% of all vulnerabilities in the products of these companies are related to RAM security.
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> Therefore, the NSA recommends that organizations switch to secure programming languages such as C#, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust, and Swift. This should help prevent certain types of memory-related vulnerabilities from occurring.

11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Looks much more trustworthy :)
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh no a new mod is moderating #dev
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Time to hide my rust propaganda
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki do you use plotters to make graphs or no?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Or what's the best
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I use plotters
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ok ok
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> ryo just come to irc side no censorship overhere hehe
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We should make a new ddnet web with the backend in rust
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> No need to use rust for everything :feelsbadman:
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fake news
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> In regards to the GH discussion about accounts: Will "legacy" points be removed?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> They could just be shown as "unverified points" or whatever on profiles in the new accounts system
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is we'll have discord like account names, so "Learath2#1253" which one of the many possible Learath2's do the legacy points go to?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we could find a way to associate them to the accounts we wouldnt need to do the legacy thing to start with tbh
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Poggers
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> When do servers start reporting the new info
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gotta collect stats
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I'm gonna farm new accounts so I get my discord name and discriminator
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> :greenthing:
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You all misunderstood konsti's comment smh. It does actually work well as is. For him that is
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He wants his god given right to be racist damnit. Is it so hard to understand?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok i propose a new schematic :bluekitty:
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Given deen merged it I'll guess as soon as compilation is done
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well and the servers restar
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The only thing im wondering here is if deen will implement it all himself or will we have a roadmap
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I personally want to be involved in making this
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a massive amount of work. I'm sure we can all share some
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 true, but sometimes its easier for 1 to do it all
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Unless its organized
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> E.g we need to plan it all out before starting
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Imho
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no u shouldnt let one person do all of smth big like that
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U dont understand what i mean
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are some individual components that can be collaborated on, a central authentication server and a frontend to manage the accounts will be needed
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 a website rework would come nicely along s2
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its due imho
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesnt have to come at the exact same time as accounts tho
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think our best bet to get this done is to not expand the scope too much
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 its so frustrating cuz its hard/impossible to replicate the ddnet web locally
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And thats vital to dev
15:20 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-web-modern
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah. I have to take a leap of faith when I edit anything on ddnet-web
15:20 <+Ryozuki> i should continue this
15:20 <+Ryozuki> it uses python cuz otherwise deen wouldnt accept it ever
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Test on production gang
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd honestly be more comfortable having the web backend in a common web dev language too. Php, python, js
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Web people interested in contributing are more likely to know those than rust
15:21 <+Ryozuki> yeah
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why not react like the proto type i once shared and for scripts dont care. Json for all data
15:21 <+Ryozuki> well i would avoid php as much as possible
15:21 <+Ryozuki> im the only web people interested as far as i know
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm a weirdo that does like php, at the very least over python üòÑ
15:22 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:22 <+Ryozuki> i prefer python over php
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thats not hard
15:22 <+Ryozuki> but ultimately rust
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My distaste for python has grown to overwhelm even my distaste for Java
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But php still shit xd
15:23 <+Ryozuki> lets just do it all in js
15:23 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:23 <+Ryozuki> such a waste of cpu cycles
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OH let's make an ASP.NET backend
15:23 <+Ryozuki> ew
15:23 <+Ryozuki> c# devs think their lang is the best
15:23 <+Ryozuki> but its cuz they dont know rust
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooor a Java EE backend like all the cool enterprises
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can be a cool corporation. DDNet Inc.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> you could just show it for all <username>#<discriminator> account
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> you could just show it for all <username>#<discriminator> accounts
15:24 <+Ryozuki> i would do the backend with <https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum> and the frontend with sveltekit
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe seek some profits, turn a couple orphans into biodiesel
15:25 <+Ryozuki> i never been more confident over a type safe API before using axum
15:25 <+Ryozuki> its amazing
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could. It's technically not any worse than it is right now
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> why is it decided like this :(
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would probably go for something a little less cutting edge. Symfony and PHP for the backebd, vuejs for the frontend. Mostly because I'm more familiar with those really
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's what everyone does? Idk if you have a better idea you can add it in the github issue
15:27 <+Ryozuki> oof
15:27 <+Ryozuki> php blegh
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Steam doesn't add a discriminator at all. Riot let's you pick the discriminator. Those are the only other options I can think of right now
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> What about Go? Its syntax sucks af but it is pretty good for the use-case of a web-backend
15:27 <+Ryozuki> nonono
15:27 <+Ryozuki> if u use go
15:27 <+Ryozuki> im not touching it
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> fair
15:28 <+Ryozuki> if we use go we should use rust
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I don't really like it either
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are going to use something like Go, I'd prefer Rust
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The reason I want to stick to php or python is that it's just more likely we'll get help on it
15:28 <+Ryozuki> help from who?
15:28 <+Ryozuki> i am here
15:28 <+Ryozuki> i know u dont trust me kek
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> This is the only real Go project I have written and IMO its syntax is annoying: https://codeberg.org/Scrumplex/skinprox
15:28 <+Ryozuki> but ive been here for 9 years now
15:29 <+Ryozuki> and im sure there are lot of rust enthusiasts
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Not sure if PHP is a good idea. But Python *could* be fine
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are here until I make you mad with some clippy slander. What if you disappear?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Maybe a framework like FastAPI
15:29 <+Ryozuki> im still here after heinrich clippy slander
15:29 <+Ryozuki> u just have to do what clippy says kek
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i mean it is good on discord or steam bcs u can have ur nickname but in game it is better to be unique
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Understandable. I seem to be the only person that enjoys anything about PHP üòÑ
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't wanna be referred as nori7757 or something like that
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw the discriminator we probably wouldn't display on screen
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> If there was a modern PHP runtime, that would get rid of mod_php and FPM-based hosting I would consider using it again
15:30 <+Ryozuki> Ryozuki#6969
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe only display it grey'd out when you hold down the expand chat bind?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> sounds good to me
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Also show the discriminator in tab but slightly muted
15:31 <+Ryozuki> yeah
15:31 <+Ryozuki> i actually rly wanna make a better ddnet website
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do you not like fpm? I kinda like the idea behind fastcgi
15:31 <+Ryozuki> so much potential
15:31 <+Ryozuki> imagine this https://tetr.io/
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't know it doesn't look good in game someone else can fake you if it is greyed out
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1668436345.png 
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> left side what's shown by default
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> right side when holding tab or expanding chat
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, gtg, several pages of signal analysis proofs await me. I have to stop procrastinating
15:33 <+Ryozuki> im porting ddnet huffman to rust as is
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unique names are I think a no go. Trolls will just steal all the big names in an hour
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd have to hand verify the top 400 or so players to help them get their names back
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im not top 400 anymore i think
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> F
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I mean they can do the same right now already
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> It would be a small gain but a gain nonetheless if the discriminator is minimized
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also you should keep trolls from mass registering accounts (aka using a bot to pretty much make every name obsolete)
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Also: That's how Discord is doing it here so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Friends will probably keep the heart they have now, so you can trust a friend without having to check the discriminator I guess
15:35 <+Ryozuki> ill do a repost from what i posted on gh:
15:35 <+Ryozuki> Accounts have obvious benefits:
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     it gives players more authorship over their achievements, you can keep track of their records, history, etc.
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     Makes extreme trolls easier to handle, for example, there could be a lockdown chat mode in servers where players with accounts not older than x days or minutes can't talk.
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     You can have badges that promote involvement in the community: map tester, developer, wiki editor, moderator, translator, tournament winner, donator, etc
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     Other players can't finish under your account unless you explicitly go out of your way to handle them your credentials, right now anyone can finish for you even if you don't want it.
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     Maps can be bound to author accounts
15:35 <+Ryozuki>     Skins can be bound to author accounts
15:35 <+Ryozuki> cool ideas kek
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hot
15:37 <+Ryozuki> no u
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> What about making old names claimable like how renames work? x points above nicknames are blocked and you have to prove it to claim it back
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> just a suggestion :d
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> i also have almost all my runs as demos. Could maybe use those as proof as well
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the entire thing we are trying to avoid. It's an absurd amount of work and the proofs are pretty manual
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have to hand verify demos
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> auto verify using teehostorian
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> auto verify using teehistorian
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (i dont know how long teehistorian stores demos)
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you can craft these demos btw. Technically if you want to fool us into giving you someone elses points
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Forever
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i mean everybody active also known in discord right? advantage of having small community :d
15:40 <+Ryozuki> not so small now
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> can't you just do "sha256(uploaded demo) == sha256(teehistorian demo)"?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (I have no idea how teehistorian works)
15:40 <+Ryozuki> teehistorian stores demos differently
15:40 <+Ryozuki> way more stripped down
15:40 <+Ryozuki> iirc
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teehistorian is a completely different format. And it stores entire servers at a time, not per run
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> oh
15:41 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dont think konsti will bring any useful arguments to that gh discussion
15:41 <+Ryozuki> and it will just derail the convo
15:41 <+Ryozuki> and we wont be productive
15:41 <+Ryozuki> btw
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> SCROMPLEX
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> i fan
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> kromep,euwuw
15:41 <+Ryozuki> i like scrumplex, but i dont like he likes CoCs
15:41 <+Ryozuki> kek
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> wots cos
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> OMG CHILLDRAGOON!!!!
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> daaa
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> clash of clans?
15:42 <+Ryozuki> code of conduct
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> a
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:42 <+Ryozuki> usually a political agenda
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could ban Konsti on github
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> oof
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> why
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> rip pink rat what did i miss
15:42 <+Ryozuki> can u jut make him not be able to chat in that specific discussion
15:42 <+Ryozuki> he sometimes reports useful stuff iirc
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> stop censor ping rat he  is OG
15:43 <+Ryozuki> he made his point and will jut repeat it endlessly
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know if github has that finegrained of moderation tools available
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> i big konsti fan
15:43 <+Ryozuki> not giving a fuck about arguments
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> does QuakeNet not have TLS?
15:43 <+Ryozuki> nah
15:43 <+Ryozuki> i was surprised too
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> F
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> gamers dont need tls
15:43 <+Ryozuki> we should move to libera.chat
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> mainstream
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> b-but it's free!
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> cringe
15:43 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: u are mainstream
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Maybe OFTC
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> less mainstream
15:43 <+Ryozuki> i bet you are not on rizon ChillerDragon 
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> wat rizon?
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> amd?
15:44 <+Ryozuki> there are shitload of channels there with real "free speech"
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> i use intel btw
15:44 <+Ryozuki> and its just ppl saying the n word xD
15:44 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: rizon is like the irc server of 4chan
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> a
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> no idk it
15:44 <+Ryozuki> rizon.net
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> but i play on fokkos srv and 2b2t lot of n word there
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm just excited for accounts so we can finally remove konsti
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> not cool!
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what u guys thoughts on legacy map pool :justatest:
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i can name a lot of benefits
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For an entire decade spammed racial slurs all over the place like a degenerate without any consequences
15:45 < scrumplex> woo
15:45 <+Ryozuki> i think more than a decade
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> remove multeasy :trollface:
15:46 <+Ryozuki> we should put the cryptography part of the account auth under rust code
15:46 <+Ryozuki> now that we have rust support
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> did konsti put racial slurs on github or what?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i love old hh maps and can play them over and over so
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> I disagree with konstis racism but I do like him as a player and mapper!
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> its all about the game
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1668437404.png :(
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> I am worried about have too few maps and not a lot of maps being released soon..
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> I am worried about having too few maps and not a lot of maps being released soon..
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> +1 this having rust for only rust_version kinda :D
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Qnet is ancient
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ur still able to play rhem in legacy
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its just not worth season 2 points
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah same. ive grown some skin to just ignore konstis toxic mindset
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll be honest. I don't particularly like it. A huge part of this game is it's "legacy". The old maps are not particularly any less ddnet than the newer maps
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for sure, i just think it lessens the blow on ppl who already grinded all of them / don't wanna play them again
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but people who like them can still play anytime
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> And zombieToad :monkalaugh:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we don't put them on DDNet season 2, someone else will host them and they get all the players, then season 2 = dead
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can notice that the players play a handful of maps over and over again. I think the season 2 maps won't have enough of those addictive maps to succeed at all
15:54 <+Ryozuki> i like the old maps to be there in season 2 too
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Maybe dont handpick some good maps, but handpick the few very bad maps to remove them
15:54 <+Ryozuki> i dont rly like legacy maps idea
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yeah same
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't like the idea either
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess his point is that we host the legacy maps too, they are just worth less points
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> will ddmax still stay a thing?
15:55 <+Ryozuki> probs yes
15:56 <+Ryozuki> now u invoked tsin here
15:56 <+Ryozuki> shame on u
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041728237249757214/20221114_165520.gif
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> mom come pick me up konstis calling females as "him" again
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mom come pick me up konstis calling me a moslem again
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> Why keeping thousands of oldschool, outdated maps?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> In 5 years ddnet will have over 3000 maps probably.
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> Imagine face of a newcomer that has to finish all of these long, bad designed, old maps to get a better rank. :justatest:
16:00 <+Ryozuki> they are not forced to finish em
16:00 <+Ryozuki> and imho its normal
16:01 <+Ryozuki> if you want to be in the top you gotts work for it
16:01 <+Ryozuki> like the rest
16:01 <+Ryozuki> otherwise just play for fun
16:02 <+Ryozuki> so many new ppl in dev chat today 
16:02 <+Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Is ddnet about speedrunning or completing hell ton of maps
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Both
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> Hype news in announcements :greenthing:
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Understandable
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> One is perfectionist, the other completionist
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I like ddnet as sandbox, you can literally finish 5* insane after 20 hours of tryharding and go kill some mobs in dungeons or play minigames
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and theres a third: the social
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ao much fun
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> So much fun
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ppl who just afk in maps and talk to other tees
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> some day i wanna make a mansion map with all the neccesary afk social's wants
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> tw is the best chatroom
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have an idea. How about instead of moving all maps to legacy, we also start counting season points?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finishing all maps released in a season and getting all season points would be a new goal for people
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> How long is a season though? And how many maps it'll have on average? Sounds like a fun idea to me.
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> The main issue still remains, adding season points to old points doesn't guarantee that player had this nickname before
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> right now? a season is 10 years
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> :troll:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The old points I've already given up on. They just won't be moved to accounts unless someone comes up with a genius idea
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Lets collect unique sensitive data and if user told lie we will sue them and sell his data on the internet :troll:
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I mean lie about his old nickname
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i love being blackmailed! :soulless:
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> sue them to who? ddnet police?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i better get a ddnet lawyer in that case :justatest:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> eg. Mr.Gh0s7 using this color as a skin (super sensitive data)
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mfw can't sue people for ddosing us but sue them for lying on the internet
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ur id and ur moms adress
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Exactly, we will give 10k points to world leaders so they will add new laws
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I prefer 0 id and my moms address is 192.168.1.1
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman: invalid format
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041733379479052288/shot_20221114_171537w.png
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I cant sell that id :feelsbadman:
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah bcs I own it
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isn't this same as legacy pool but just backwards
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but this is a good idea too
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly. Make new maps special without deprecating the old ones
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw id be glad to work on any map related stuff for s2 if it becomes flushed out
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Essigautomat are you still working on the material layer
16:39 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57349
16:39 <+Ryozuki> some day
16:39 <+Ryozuki> > Basically, because &mut references are unique in rust, mutations (except through interior mutability) are not actually observable. Therefore, mutation can be supported in const contexts. i.e.:
16:39 <+Ryozuki>     &mut arguments could be accepted
16:39 <+Ryozuki>     locals could be mutably borrowed (&mut expressions)
16:39 <+Ryozuki>     non-initialization assignments could be made (x = y; or *x = y;).
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hello, its happening
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> wow

17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i like the fun achievements
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or trackers
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not all is needed but maybe one or two
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My dream for a modern web shattered again
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Current web sux
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KOF> I remember teerace already had some kind of achievements in past

17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> 97 people finished 1000 runs but only 7 has 24h  playtime?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> or 20 players with 5k runs
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> and only 7 with 24h palytime
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> and only 7 with 24h playtime
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> lmao

21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks gg
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got no js web people here
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> What do you need?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kind of wanted to make a more modern website
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with e.g reactjs
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> VueJS
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Faster learning curve than React ( facebook bs lol )
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i already know react
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and reactjs is better imho
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ew
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> facebook sucks but their engineers know their stuff
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean if it were me i wouldnt use js
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would use rust compiled to web assembly
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> If you want the latest tech stack go for svelte
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats too modern
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> svelte is not latest
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but yeah i would use svelte too
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://yew.rs/
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is bleeding edge tech
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> svelte is currently top notch afaik
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> most hyped used framework
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but more ppl know react
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway the point is
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the current website is basically python print statements
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anything is better  than that
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they are scripts spread across folders in different repos
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its insane xd
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant replicate t he website locally
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just pain
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Nah, nothing is better than python :pepeH:
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Avolicious and the python print s are not even f strings
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they use old style &
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> %
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and with 30 arguments
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Okay, you fucked up with python
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> why are you doing that
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen*
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> üò¢
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen made that xd
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> xD
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Well, its still supported in 3.6
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> and upper
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> but 3.7 is recommending f-strings
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```python
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>       print >>out, u'<div class="block2 info"><p>%sDifficulty: %s, Points: %d<br/><a href="/mappreview/?map=%s"><img class="screenshot" alt="Screenshot" src="/ranks/maps/%s.png" width="360" height="225" /></a>%s<br/><span title="%s">%d tee%s finished%s</span><br/>%d team%s finished%s</p></div>' % (mbReleased, escape(renderStars(stars)), globalPoints(type, stars), quote_plus(originalMapName), escape(normalizedMapName), mbMapInfo, finishTimes
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>       print >>out, printTeamRecords("Team Records", "teamrecords", teamRanks, not country)
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>       print >>out, printSoloRecords("Records", "records", ranks, not country)
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its python 2
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even 3
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we are doomed
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Naaaah fair enough
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trust me i spend one day to figure this out
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i edited smth i dont remember now xd
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> python 2 is eol since 2020
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 2 years after is still good
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> look at banking software written in cobol
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> they support their 1950s language till 2022
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure its more maintainable
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ```
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>     Perform Varying i From 0 By 1
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>               Until i >= 10
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>        ...
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>     End-Perform
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ```
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> looks like a valid for loop
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> More text than function
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But if this works, I am gonna scream
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ```cobol
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>     Perform Varying i From 0 By 1
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>               Until i >= 10
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>        ...
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>     End-Perform
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ```
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ah nvm
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I thought discord has markdown highlighting for cobol üò¶
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> seems like no cobol devs are on discord...
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES3_WeirdSip:
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> just remake the website in a shit ton of open source libraries
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah we gotta keep it deen-like
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a thingg i started long ago
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should retake
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses python and statically generates it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> wdym deen-like
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> although i also have a project that statically generates the website but with rust
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its way faster
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-web-modern
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the rust version is not public
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (and the link i sent has not much tbh)
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> statically generated and low js
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> why though
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz otherwise deen wont accept probs
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> personally i would go with a non static website but a LRU cache
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it wouldnt have the 15 min delay either
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> personally i would go with a non static website but with a LRU cache
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or 30
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know how often it regenerates
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i mean the backend and frontend can be seperate
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats too modern for ddnet
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> bruh
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> eh if you guys need help with styling using css or some designing, i will be willing to help
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i was thinking about creating a custom theme for the current website too
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a theme is nice, but it more needs restructure
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as in the code generating it
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so the backend part lol
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I've made a lot of themes before for websites
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so im pretty confident that i can turn a shit website into art
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i personally think ddnet needs more style
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like tetr.io
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041820417620463676/image.png
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tetr.io/
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> You mean like to look like it has a connection to the game?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i just love their web design
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tetr.io/about/rules/
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://txt.osk.sh/branding/
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its too good
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> its simple, user friendly and the branding is on point
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the most famous online tetris website
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with highly competitive ppl
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah i like it
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but i dont know how you would incorporate ddnet into the website
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> maybe by having some map as background but really transparent
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041821056765268068/image.png
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ch.tetr.io/
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041821181071851610/image.png
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beautiful patch ntoes
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041821226332598393/image.png
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oh yeah
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye lets stay js-less and do the web like grandpas
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it grinds my gears xzd
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no js = no fun
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> furries
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1041821725094051880/image.png
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway t he player profile is amazing
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> did your screenshotting software fuck up a scrolling screenshot
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz i was scrolled
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the navbar sticks
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ye
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what do you use
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox right click
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> save full page
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> screenshot*
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ah okay
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i use sharex which is really nice
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> website is actually really good
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always remember it
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it leaves such a strong impression
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i imagined they did the navbar with js but its probably position: sticky
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ch.tetr.io/u/fortissim2
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> wait how much info is available in json format for current website
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is it only player data
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> do you think #5708 could be relevant for ddnet 2.0?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5708
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its nice but not directly relevant
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet 2.0 name sounds boring
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would call it "DDraceNetwork Reborn"
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> help, people misunderstood "season 2" and ask for new features now...
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ü•π
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I mean it's a big step so people are expecting big changes
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I don't blame them
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Where did I say it's a big step?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I said accounts + achievements
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It feels like a big step
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> No one said it
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think we'll find enough people to implement 10% of what people are asking for
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean it's pretty big, since a lot of people are talking about wiping the current map pool
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true xd
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the more gets planned, the lower chance that anything will get done
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen achievements itself sound like a shitload of work
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it can be gradual
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just need the account part done
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that's also fair. if i'm going to be honest i saw this whole thing as "we're finally going to be rewriting the code so it's 10x more optimized" and everything
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a good yoke
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, it can't be gradual
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the account itself not
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> season 2 only contains the items that have to be done exactly at the point of season 2 start
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean the features that use accounts
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everything else is outside of scope
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> achievements dont need to be at season 2 start
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are the main motivation now that points get reset
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway i dont think ppl expect too much
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they know people's time is limited surely
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Clueless:
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Says the guy who posted most requests üòÑ
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :D
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean i didnt post most did it
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i*
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just expanded on urs
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i only did because i misunderstood :frozen:
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this made me wonder how big games implement achievements
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at first thought they seem rly intrusive to core mechanics code to me
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like i can see it bloat the code a lot
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if they are achievements from stats that dont update often i guess its fine
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its so easy to get too excited
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/1425/
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Just like Monkey Quest Reborn? whoever remembers nickelodeon's shit will laugh at it
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like dota 2 rebornn
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when they released dota 2 with source 2
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> patch 7.0
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but they don't call it dota 2 reborn right?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> just dota 2
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.dota2.com/reborn/part1
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was such a big update
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> üò†
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the game t urned from ancient into a modern beauty
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So is it planned to make a new tw engine?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah bruv
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or just visually changing it for now?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ah ok
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just mentioned it
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yeah I see above
