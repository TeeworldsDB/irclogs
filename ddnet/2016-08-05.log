23:45 <+Ryozuki_> hi
23:46 <@deen> hi
23:48 <+Ryozuki_> i'm curious of how this will work
23:48 <+Ryozuki_> we will have no ranks when this start right?
23:49 <@deen> right
23:49 <@deen> I'll remove the teamranks temporarily
23:49 <@deen> then the teamranks are the current ranking
23:49 <+Ryozuki_> just for tourn servers
23:49 <@deen> no, all servers actually
23:49 <@deen> you could just vote Multimap anywhere
23:50 <+Ryozuki_> and if you do a better time
23:50 <+Ryozuki_> than ur actual
23:50 <+Ryozuki_> it saves?
23:50 <@deen> ?
23:50 <@deen> of course?
23:50 <+Ryozuki_> ok
