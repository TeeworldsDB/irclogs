11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> Hi all
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> :P
11:31 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna ask a question about DDNet
11:32 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna run a DDrace server on my server and connect my server to sql database
11:32 < Hamid_Jigool> but there is no table in database
11:33 < Hamid_Jigool> DDnet make table in databse automatic when conect to database or we must import .sql file firs?
11:34 < Hamid_Jigool> can any body help me? :P
12:44 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again
12:44 < Hamid_Jigool> anybody here?
13:04 < Hamid_Jigool> sql just can be enable on linux?
13:05 < Hamid_Jigool> any way to connect to sql on windows?
13:07 < Hamid_Jigool> hello
13:07 <@EastByte> hello, I'm not sure whether ddnet creates the sql tables on its own
13:07 <@EastByte> also not sure whether it works on windows
13:09 < Hamid_Jigool> it stop by code: #if defined(CONF_SQL)
13:09 < Hamid_Jigool> whats this?
13:09 < Hamid_Jigool> need some config?
13:11 <@EastByte> you need to compile ddnet using bam server_sql_release
13:14 < Hamid_Jigool> ommmmm
13:14 < Hamid_Jigool> thank you
13:22 < Hamid_Jigool> an error
13:23 < Hamid_Jigool> other/mysql/include\cppconn/connection.h(31) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open in clude file: 'boost/variant.hpp': No such file or directory
13:23 < Hamid_Jigool> whats this?
13:23 < Hamid_Jigool> when im compile
13:23 < Hamid_Jigool> this error show to me
13:48 <@heinrich5991> I have no idea how ddnet compilation for windows works
13:48 <@heinrich5991> but perhaps you could try installing the boost library

18:16 < Hamid_Jigool> sql_score.cpp
18:17 < Hamid_Jigool> so i thing some problem on ddnet source coding :D
18:17 < Hamid_Jigool> think*
18:17 < Hamid_Jigool> can you help me?
18:17 <@heinrich5991> can you show me what's in sql_score.cpp line 839?
18:17 < Hamid_Jigool> yes
18:17 < Hamid_Jigool> wait
18:18 < Hamid_Jigool> int aCuts[Rows];
18:18 <@heinrich5991> ah
18:20 < Hamid_Jigool> ommm... so what should we do? :P
18:21 < Hamid_Jigool> other code that have error unknown size : >> char newString[size*2-1];
18:24 <@heinrich5991> it seems the code uses a feature that your compiler cannot compile
18:24 <@heinrich5991> which VS version do you have?
18:27 < Hamid_Jigool> 2010
18:27 < Hamid_Jigool> can i compile with other version?
18:37 < Hamid_Jigool_> hi again
18:37 < Hamid_Jigool_> what kind of compiler can compile it?
18:43 < Hamid_Jigool_> Zzz
18:44 <@heinrich5991> Hamid_Jigool_: I think the code cannot be compiled for Windows at the moment
18:44 <@heinrich5991> (the sql code)
18:45 < Hamid_Jigool_> im sure it can be
18:45 < Hamid_Jigool_> like linux
18:45 < Hamid_Jigool_> i want to compile it on windows for first time
18:46 < Hamid_Jigool_> DDnet is not compile for windows in additional mode and this is so bad
18:47 < Hamid_Jigool_> i wanna who have windows server can be have DDnet whit Wamp server or Xamp or any mysql software on windows
18:47 < devnull> using windows as server os is just bad
18:48 < Hamid_Jigool_> this compile first show to me boost errors and C99 errors but i fix it !
18:48 <@deen> mingw on windows should work
18:48 < Hamid_Jigool_> ommm thank i have mingw
18:48 < Hamid_Jigool_> so whats the bam command in mingw?
18:49 < Hamid_Jigool_> like VS?
18:50 <@heinrich5991> devnull: why? :)
18:50 <@heinrich5991> stackoverflow runs on windows
18:51 <+Learath2> oh its the interface its just not convinient imo
18:54 <@heinrich5991> don't you run windows? ^^
18:56 <@EastByte> are you trying to defend the use of windows in server infrastructure?
18:56 < devnull> he is
18:56 < devnull> i'm running windows as a gaming os
18:56 <@EastByte> I guess he is just searching for more arguments not to use windows :p
18:57 <@heinrich5991> not sure, I never tried running windows as a server OS. have any of you? :)
18:58 < devnull> i used a windows server a few years ago
18:58 <@EastByte> I once used a windows vps of a friend
18:58 < devnull> mainly as storage server
18:58 < devnull> got it for free
18:59 < Hamid_Jigool_> oh ... how can i compile source whit mingw? :((
18:59 < devnull> thats the only reason
18:59 < Hamid_Jigool_> so hard
18:59 <@EastByte> I didn't feel any difference between windows and windows server
19:00 <@EastByte> but it was funny to use a windows 2000 interface again
19:00 < Hamid_Jigool_> can anyone compile server_sql_release on windows? o come on i wanna have points and ranks on my server... oh god :-(
19:01 <@heinrich5991> I think you can have ranks without sql
19:01 <@EastByte> you can run a linux vm on it run ddnet inside
19:01 <@heinrich5991> ...
19:01 <@EastByte> ranks but no points I think
19:02 < Hamid_Jigool_> my friend server on linux have ranks and points both of them... but i hate linux server :-(
19:02 < devnull> why that?
19:03 <@EastByte> because he is used to windows...
19:03 < Hamid_Jigool_> because all publicaly softwares run on windows dont have linux version
19:03 <@heinrich5991> except for ddnet which doesn't have a working windows version right now
19:04 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool_: you could just edit the config.lua to use 'mingw' (i guess)
19:04 <@deen> or 'gcc'
19:04 <@heinrich5991> (if you have mingw installed)
19:04 < Hamid_Jigool_> thank dear deen
19:05 <@EastByte> deen: do you know what's ironic? vali got overwhelmed by ddos attacks and his server is offline now
19:08 < Hamid_Jigool_> our server in iran always under DDos too so we have to run our server on intranet not internet so other people cann't join us :-( so i have to compile the mod for myself
19:09 < Hamid_Jigool_> if we can controll DDos i ran server on linux 
19:09 < Hamid_Jigool_> bu i wanna use wireshark to controll my server traffic
19:09 <+Learath2> wireshark is a linux program ported to windows iirc
19:09 < Hamid_Jigool_> and wireshark just run on windows not linux
19:10 < Hamid_Jigool_> realy?
19:10 <@heinrich5991> wireshark runs on linux too
19:10 < Hamid_Jigool_> how?
19:10 <@EastByte> wireshark can control traffic? it's a packet analyzer
19:10 < Hamid_Jigool_> yee it is good for DDos Analys
19:10 <+Learath2> uhm apt-get install wireshark ?
19:10 < devnull> yup
19:10 < devnull> wireshark runs on linux
19:10 <@EastByte> you'll need a desktop manager to run wireshark, most vps cannot run a graphical interface
19:10 < devnull> but wont help you to stop the ddos
19:11 <@EastByte> Hamid_Jigool_: instead you can capture traffic using tcpdump and then analyze the dump using wireshark on your own computer
19:11 <+Learath2> anyways compiling ddnet with sql support on linux is painful even with mingw
19:12 <@EastByte> but for a chilean server that won't really help...
19:14 <@EastByte> oh it was iran
19:15 < Hamid_Jigool_> we runned ddnet in iran and we was under big DDos .. we test all app on linux and all of them not help us... so i think all the servers can be under DDos and anybody cann't controll that
19:15 < Hamid_Jigool_> :D
19:16 <@EastByte> software won't help you against such attacks
19:16 <@EastByte> the datacenter of your provider needs to be prepared against them
19:17 < Hamid_Jigool_> most attacks by BotNET
19:17 < Hamid_Jigool_> BotNet is very dangeruse
19:18 < Hamid_Jigool_> BoTNet can DDos from 100 or 200 fake ips
19:18 < Hamid_Jigool_> cpu crashed
19:18 < Hamid_Jigool_> and all thing dump
19:18 < Hamid_Jigool_> :D
19:23 <@heinrich5991> Hamid_Jigool_: forum user rename complete
21:19 <@EastByte> hellow guenstig_werben 
21:20 < guenstig_werben> hey, east
