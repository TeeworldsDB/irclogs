19:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> deen won’t let me connect to db
19:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you mean mainserver right?
19:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Everything else is racism and a bannable offense
19:44 < bridge> <h11_00> any developer available?
19:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
19:44 < bridge> <h11_00> oh sad

19:46 < bridge> <h11_00> can you help me?
19:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You need an official ddnet server?
19:46 < bridge> <h11_00> yeah
19:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you don’t want a developer. What you want is a ddnet admin.
19:47 < bridge> <melon> we could host a server on pakistan if there are enough people from there that need one, didnt learath say smth?
19:47 < bridge> <h11_00> oh
19:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just throw money at the discord user with the name 0xdeen and wait 4-5 business days

19:48 < bridge> <melon> then i'd just wait :p

20:11 < ChillerDragon> oh or ddnet ger1 for that matter @davide55 sos
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> I literally only see like 3-4 people playing from pakistan, idk very very hard to justify a new server
20:20 < bridge> <avolicious> ofc
20:20 < bridge> <avolicious> why celebrate just a day if you can celebrate a whole decade
20:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> tw 0.5 pirates

20:31 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 can u meet me in game for ip exchange?
20:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 they dont play because they have high ping 🧠
20:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 send ur public key pls xd
20:36 < bridge> <avolicious> You can join a KoG server & I'll send it to Davide
20:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or that thanks
20:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im on the christmas server rn @avolicious xd
20:37 < bridge> <avolicious> Got it

20:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u didnt even join watafak
20:37 < bridge> <avolicious> Nope, I get it from a centralized session store ^^
20:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hax
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> I bet you got blacklisted for ddosing
20:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no proof
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> You had motive: to destroy all non-0.7 servers
20:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> a noble one
20:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that is correct
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> Guilty

20:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> noice
20:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried to hax davide but he to secure
20:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i rage haxxed u
20:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> what's that public key?
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your gitlab one
20:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm k
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you are as good as me at guessing gitlab names (matching discord name for you and davide xd) you can just append .keys in the gl url
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://gitlab.com/jxsl13.keys
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sadly seems like he doesnt have any wtf https://gitlab.com/davide55.keys
20:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> wild
20:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> why are public keys exposed
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea right
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why would you publish .. public keys
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon: Now guess their private keys from the public keys
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> for what purpose.
20:46 < bridge> <davide55> I checked your IP, I can't see any issues with the mitigation @chillerdragon
20:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can connect other servers just fine :c
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> they mas be public
20:46 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe transit issue? Try to send me an MTR towards my net  @chillerdragon
20:46 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe routing issue? Try to send me an MTR towards my net  @chillerdragon
20:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 i often need other ppls pub keys
20:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u dont?
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> I ask them
20:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> and I do not
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1752605277.png
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 well i asked davide and he ignored me :c 
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> often when you can just lookup it speeds things up
20:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> i find it better to not expose public nor private ones if not necessary. just find it weird that gitlab just decides to expose my public ones that I use for pushing stuff....
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its public
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 according to tcpdump i only send and never receive anything back
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im in
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whart did u do
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it works  @davide55 !!!
20:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably nearly impossible to deduce the secret key from,but I find it better not to give any hints to the secret at all.
20:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably pedantic and irrational.
20:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well we all kinda rely on crypto not to break
20:55 < bridge> <davide55> I did nothing @chillerdragon
20:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtafak
20:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was full borked for hours
20:55 < bridge> <davide55> It's probably just a routing issue? @chillerdragon
20:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe
20:55 < bridge> <bomab> give me 20x10^(1776) centuries and i will do it
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> If it were possible at all to deduce it the world would devolve into chaos
20:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> i guess it's more about control and not being given the choise in gitlab, whether or not to make them public or not.
20:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its good
20:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the only thing you can leak is your full name or shit because gitlab shows that too xd
20:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, that's fine
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait nvm
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it doesnt
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it puts ur gitlab name there
20:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> got that on gh as well and in all of my licenses
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it should be on by default otherwise you would find no ones keys
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and there is no risk to publishing public keys
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Your public keys are also public in GitHub
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/Robyt3.keys
20:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh rky
20:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even same endpoint
20:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how did i not know xd
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg wtf davide
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no keys!??ß

21:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> problem is back @davide55 xd
21:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but funnily i am still connected to kog
21:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just cant connect to new servers anymore
21:19 < bridge> <learath2> You fucked up by using Rust. You can keep the 20cents
21:19 < bridge> <melon> blame jupsti! he's on vacation so i cant even ping him about it
21:19 < bridge> <vy0x2> sup, how do i convert this into a std::any_of? its a bool array
21:19 < bridge> <vy0x2> All examples online are vectors and i couldnt get it work here

21:20 < bridge> <melon> currently trying to improve the animations editor UX wise, god have mercy
21:20 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1394760651196469420/image.png?ex=6877fb94&is=6876aa14&hm=2a8cab7cff3932d972b80a0c6bbfb18dc3458596991dcb23c0ec151e1e4c81a7&
21:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Should've used C
21:21 < bridge> <learath2> Should work on the ddnet one instead. Then you get to use the learath2dbg
21:21 < bridge> <melon> :KEKW:  ddnet-Rs's animation editor behaves completly different
21:21 < bridge> <melon> and i'm scared of touching editor code, shit looks like it'll fall apart any second
21:22 < bridge> <learath2> It would never
21:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's 3rd day and I'm still trying to understand the algorithm written in a book in pseudo code :pepeW:
21:22 < bridge> <melon> FyI - this is how it looked before
21:22 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1394761026305786017/image.png?ex=6877fbee&is=6876aa6e&hm=b30aa14c4e304efe31e9c72191c8baacebc578068426d3e4f028fdfa36bd9ffa&
21:23 < bridge> <davide55> That's weird 😄 @chillerdragon
21:24 < bridge> <melon> dont make me look up open editor issues! :kek:
21:27 < bridge> <learath2> There are none. It's just people misunderstanding the features
21:32 < bridge> <melon> ^ @learath2
21:32 < bridge> <melon> :KEKW:
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Edit or
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> The behaviour was consistently inconsistent, thus consistent. Simple misunderstanding
21:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> The real features are the bugs we found along the way
