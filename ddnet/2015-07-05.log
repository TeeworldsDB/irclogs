13:56 <@deen> woohoo, 10 players on China
14:23 <@EastByte> :D
14:24 <@deen> aaaand I'm missing the unicode confusables for 'm'
14:24 <@deen> no idea how that happened
14:24 <@EastByte> hard to figure out without demo/log
14:25 <@deen> hard to figure what out?
14:26 <@EastByte> "confusables for 'm'", you didn't talk about someone abusing confusable unicode characters?
14:27 <@deen> yeah: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/base/confusables.c#L71-L72
14:27 <@deen> notice the missing 0x006D, that's 'm'
14:27 <@EastByte> hmkay
14:28 <@EastByte> where did you get this table from?
14:29 <@heinrich5991> http://unicode.org/Public/security/revision-02/confusables.txt
14:29 <@heinrich5991> or similar
14:29 <@deen> right, and I think I had some automatic conversion script, but have to find it again^^
14:29 <@EastByte> ^^
14:30 <@heinrich5991> deen: how do you do this, though? some confusables are multi-character
14:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: those don't work, only single-script
14:30 <@deen> was fine so far
14:30 <@heinrich5991> kay
14:30 <@EastByte> single-script?
14:31 <@heinrich5991> single-codepoint I guess (?)
14:31 <@deen> in the confusables file they call it single-script, yes single-codepoint
14:31 <@deen> because you could combine multiple ones to make it look like a character...
14:31 <@EastByte> ah
14:31 <@EastByte> makes sense
14:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: I think single-script means from the same character family
14:33 <@deen> oh
14:33 <@heinrich5991> (greek, latin, ...)
14:33 <@heinrich5991> http://unicode.org/reports/tr39/#single_script_confusables
14:33 <@deen> right
15:23 <@deen> huh, i did nothing wrong, but the confusables.txt files are weird
15:24 <@deen> they just removed many confusables, which makes no sense to me
15:24 <@deen> because they're still confusable
15:25 <@deen> and the one that's used here is in no list at all...
15:29 <@deen> oh, i see why
16:25 <@EastByte> wb deen 
16:33 <@deen> thanks
16:40 <@heinrich5991> [15:24:28] <deen> because they're still confusable
16:41 <@heinrich5991> it might be because you (probably) don't do normalization before checking whether two strings are confusable
16:41 <@heinrich5991> (as specified by that confusables TR)
16:44 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, I'm also not trying to fully implement that
16:44 <@deen> it looks too computationally intensive to me, wanted to avoid that
16:44 <@heinrich5991> yea, just saying that this might be the cause
16:45 <@deen> and I just want confusable detection for ascii chars
16:45 <@heinrich5991> well, it only needs to be done once someone changes their name
16:45 <@heinrich5991> ok
16:45 <@deen> yes, but this table takes a lot of memory
16:45 <@deen> if you want to do it properly
16:48 <@heinrich5991> ok
17:10 <@deen> i even think the full unicode confusables are a bit too strict
17:10 <@deen> for example "m" and "rn" are considered confusable
17:12 <@heinrich5991> too strict doesn't hurt though
17:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vq3Dj
17:12 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 7033ece def: Update/fix confusables
17:13 <@deen> i think it does, for example if we actually have a player called Chairn and another called Chaim, then they can't play together on a server
17:15 <@heinrich5991> I wonder if there are such examples
17:17 <@deen> yep there are
17:17 <@deen> just searched for a min and found one already
17:18 <@deen> Each of them just finished a single map, but there was a player "mdm" and "rndm"
17:19 <@heinrich5991> ok
17:22 <@heinrich5991> there are some fonts that make it hard to distinguish though
17:24 <@deen> sure, but i don't want to hurt actual players, just people who fake and confuse by using unicode chars
17:27 <@deen> and the special clients that have a database of unicode chars to auto-fake
17:27 <@heinrich5991> haha
17:27 <@heinrich5991> so you just take that DB and  stick it into the servers? ^^
17:27 <@deen> then they add a few more chars etc
17:27 <@heinrich5991> and repeat :)
17:27 <@deen> that's why we have the confusables list
17:29 <@deen> There's a Football tournament right now btw: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1621
17:36 <@heinrich5991> oh nice :)
18:56 < Learath2> deen: how do i debug nim code ?
18:57 < Learath2> docs seem to mention something called endb which seems to be broken
19:14 < Learath2> debugged problem was irc.quakenet,org is dead
19:16 < Learath2> ,recall PS1=
19:16 < Learath2> w/c
19:31 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: have you tried gdb?
19:32 < Learath2> heinrich5991: tried --debuginfo --lineDir:on which gave me gibberish line numbers for async code
19:34 < Learath2> still cant get the async version of irc working but atleast the sync version works
19:53 <@deen> Learath2: gdb works, but async is a macro that transforms code very much
19:54 < Learath2> im going to make an irc bot :)
19:55 < Learath2> but yeah async kinda breaks gdb
19:55 < Learath2> gdb even showed a comment as the line it was running

20:42 < laxadedi> Hey
20:43 < laxadedi> If I am declaring a tab in the stack like this : int tab[8][8]
20:43 < laxadedi> how can I pass the adress of that table to a function
20:43 < laxadedi> if I do something like this
20:43 < laxadedi> void func(int **tab)
20:43 < laxadedi> it's not working
20:44 < Learath2> void func(int *tab) should work
20:46 < laxadedi> compiler doesn't like it
20:46 <@EastByte> also 'int *tab' would only be one dimension
20:46 < laxadedi> http://pastebin.com/V4pyUSj2
20:47 < laxadedi> also, stack memory is never reset right ? I have to memset it to be sure it's filled with 0 right ?
20:48 <@EastByte> you never can expect a memory range to be reset unless the alloc function implies it
20:48 < laxadedi> ok, it's the same for heap or stack then
20:49 < Learath2> should be void func(int tab[8][8])
20:49 < Learath2> that should work
20:49 < laxadedi> it's working but I thought I could do int **tab
20:49 < laxadedi> so, void func(int tab[8][8]) is the only solution 
20:51 < Learath2> i believe so
20:52 < laxadedi> Ok, thanks a lot :)
20:55 <@EastByte> see this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2828648/how-to-pass-a-multidimensional-array-to-a-function-in-c-and-c#2829335
20:55 < Learath2> http://c-faq.com/aryptr/pass2dary.html
20:56 < Learath2> this is what was sent to me when i asked a very close question on ##c
21:06 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: note that arrays and pointers are very different concepts in C
21:07 <@heinrich5991> arrays are not pointers â€“ the only thing why it might look like this is that `array` is syntactic sugar for `&array[0]` if array is an array.
21:12 < xRoThx> Hello 
21:12 <@EastByte> hello xRoThx 
21:12 < xRoThx> Hi deen  How are you ? :) 
21:12 < xRoThx> Long time no see eastbyte :)
21:16 <@heinrich5991> http://www.pgbovine.net/SlopPy.html
21:16 <@heinrich5991> sloppy python :)
21:18 < xRoThx> Server ownership has been given. :) Enjoy DDNet. I always loved theway of thinking / handling things from the DDNet team  ;) 
21:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
21:18 <@EastByte> Awesome! :)
21:19 < xRoThx> Enjoy guys! :) And keep on the good work 
21:19 < xRoThx> I hope the ehm, 8months or so ? of sponsoring did help you guys out a lot 
21:20 <@EastByte> well the problem with the ddos attacks stopped back then
21:20 <@EastByte> so, sure
21:23 < xRoThx> Have a nice day guys! And I hope to see you guys around everytime I check teeworlds again for the next couple years :D
21:24 <@EastByte> till later then^^
21:24 <@heinrich5991> thanks for your support!
21:25 <@EastByte> yes, definitely
21:25 <@EastByte> I gotta go, it's thundering
21:27 < xRoThx> I loved to help 
21:44 <@deen> oh, xrothx was here
21:45 <@deen> he sent me the server
21:46 <@deen> and i reduced prize from 126 $ for 3 months to 89 $ =)
21:49 <@deen> also, nfoserves allows to set custom filter rules in their ddos protection, looks nice
22:04 <@deen> really impressed with their web interface and anti-ddos solution
22:05 <@deen> it clearly informs you what kind of attack was detected and what filter installed for what time
22:16 <@heinrich5991> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=114585#p114585
22:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes?
22:18 <@heinrich5991> "DDnet has a more annoying and eye-irritating shakey antiping that instead of ghosts of prediction"
22:18 <@deen> yes, i don't consider it annoying
22:18 <@deen> the other one is annoying on ddrace servers
22:20 <@deen> because you see each tee twice
22:32 <@heinrich5991> I see
22:50 <@deen> sigh, fucking hoster
22:50 <@deen> i asked them to set reverse dns and they shut down GER...
22:54 <@deen> now about 20 people insulting me
22:54 < WolfAlex> ._.
22:54 < WolfAlex> thats bad
22:56 < Learath2> why would they shutdown a server for changing reverse dns ???
22:57 <@deen> yes, why????
23:06 <@deen> no wonder we lose players with shit like this happening
23:09 < Learath2> The chileans dont seem to happy either
23:09 <@deen> about what?
23:11 < Learath2> some of them seem to have horrible ping
23:12 <@deen> that was solved
23:13 < Learath2> you sure ? 10 seconds ago i misclicked on a chile server and 2-3 people still had around 130-150 ping
23:13 < Learath2> maybe they were just not from chile 
23:14 <@deen> yeah, south american internet is not well connected
