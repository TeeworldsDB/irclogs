19:54 < Matodor> https://bitbucket.org/Matodor/teesharp/src
19:55 < Matodor> playable version
20:52 < minus> you might want to include some usage infos in the readme
20:53 < minus> System.EntryPointNotFoundException: QueryPerformanceCounter
20:53 < minus> heh
20:56 < Matodor> xD alpha
20:59 < Matodor> i tested it only on my computer, windows 7 x64
21:03 <@heinrich5991> is that a translation of the Teeworlds code to c#?
21:04 < Matodor> yes, only server
21:04 < Matodor> now - just translate, later - refactoring
21:24 < minus> oh, i was expecting a client
21:27 <@heinrich5991> Matodor: pretty nice
21:27 <@heinrich5991> what was the motivation for doign it?
21:28 < Matodor> dont like a c++ syntax and standart library :)
21:31 < Matodor> heinrich 5991: and I got a lot of experience
21:32 <@heinrich5991> ah :)
21:32 <@heinrich5991> Matodor: that's only executable on windows right now, I guess?
21:32 < Matodor> i think so
21:33 < Matodor> maybe run with mono on linux
21:38 < Ryozuki_> "Putting the GPU into an oven and baking it for a while fixed the problem for a few days by resoldering cracked solder points, but then it returned."
21:38 <@heinrich5991> sounds good
21:38 < Ryozuki_> This made me laugh a lot xD i would never think of putting a gpu on a oven xDDD
21:39 <@heinrich5991> me neither :D
21:39 < Ryozuki_> "I didn't want to keep baking my GPU, so I used another GPU "
21:39 < Ryozuki_> :D
21:42 < minus> fwiw the word is standard (in german as well). standart is something else
21:43 < Matodor> standard*
21:44 < minus> fyi the error i mentioned happened on linux
21:45 < minus> to build it with mono just enter the directory, run xbuild, then run the executable teesharp_srv/bin/Debug/teesharp_srv.exe
21:50 < Matodor> and not supported IPv6
21:52 < Matodor> and in general there is still a lot of bugs)
21:55 < minus> teeworlds doesn't support IPv6 either
22:19 <@heinrich5991> minus: it doesn't?
22:19 <@heinrich5991> I can connect just fine to my local server via ipv6
22:20 < minus> i don't acknowledge that as proper ipv6 support
