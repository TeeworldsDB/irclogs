13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hey,
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I fixxed some other bugs and think it's ready now...

14:51 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @Laboon so I should run it again?
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> running
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I think it's buggy
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> we were just assigned to a 3on1, but no one had colors
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hmmm
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i didn't think of that
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes I can add colors to the assigned teams
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thanks for hosting
18:03 <@deen> so it's supposed to make 3on1s?
18:03 <@deen> seems a bit unfair
19:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> well it's 3on3 tournament
19:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> if you want to do 2on2 you can both go in a team
19:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> if not everyone will be assigned to a team with max 3 players
19:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but i could do a special one if there are 3 or 4 ppl
19:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> atm if there are 3 ppl everyone goes 1on1
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could fill the teams alternatingly
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> put one in team 1, then one in team 2, etc.
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hmm
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> the problem would be that if there are for example 3 players choosing team red
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and 3 other players without a team they would be put in 3 seperate teams each
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, I ment, first in team red, then team blue, then team red again, etc.
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and if people force-joined these teams, you could fill the other one?
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oh thats what you mean
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> at the moment the team colors are set during the team selection phase
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i did a class TournamentTeam with a vector of players
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> that way the teams are put
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> so i dont have "team[red].add" or smth
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> refactor!
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Interesting question
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Lets make  teeworlds code great again
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> How to split up teams in a tournament setting where there is no preset teamsize
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> what do you mean @Savander
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just joking
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ok haha
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't know c/c+=
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> im not that good at it either
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> dunno studying physic lol
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't study at all ðŸ˜¦ IM sad
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath is god of c
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ðŸ˜¦
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i want to be his guy
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but how don't want me
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜¦
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ðŸ˜¦ ðŸ˜¦
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have to steal his fire
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜¦
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ðŸ˜¦
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I'm no god of C. I'm a mere follower at the temple of C
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> How to split up teams in a tournament setting where there is no preset teamsize
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hmm
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Learath2 at the moment I do have a constant team size
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I heard, that you can make
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> some magic with pointers
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no?
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but the auto team assignment only goes for those players who didn't choose a team
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> sometimes people want to play 2v3
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Savander the magic happens when you use a pointer to a player and the server crashes when the player disconnected ðŸ˜ƒ
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Well then I guess there is nothing better to do
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Make the biggest possible teams out of the remaining people
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> anyways @deen is right I should give them a color
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but i think they will get white
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> if 2 assigned teams battle each other one gets black
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> btw are there any ddnet intern projects where i could help as well?
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i'd like to support you if thats possible
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we don't have intern projects per se
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Take a crack at any issue you want :)
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but if you want to help, I can help you with issues you encounter while coding
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Learath2  is there something like a "known bugs" list?
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you might need to learn a bit of git, but you can ask here, I'll help you
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i'll take a look into it
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes thank you @heinrich5991
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> am new to gid
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I started writing then forgot what I wanted to write...
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i know that feel
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Doing the dishes has that effect on me :P
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> being stoned for me
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> lol
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> So boring it makes my brain melt
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> haha
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> anyone any nice ideas about how to do encrypted UDP? After I've established a shared secret that is
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> look at mosh
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> they even have a paper about htis I think
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (the remote shell that supports roaming between IP addresses)
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> when i try to compile the ddnet client i get this error
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 1>------ Build started: Project: ddnet, Configuration: client_release Win32 ------
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 1>bam : error : 'ddnet-libs/opus/windows/lib64/libopusfile.dll' does not exist and no way to generate it
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i used the thread in the forum to download everything preset
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which thread?
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3061
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> while compiling the server everything went fine
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah didn't update those
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but the client gives me this error
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh.
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you also need a clone of ddnet-libs
20:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> also we prefer cmake nowadays ðŸ˜›
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon follow the readme on the repo first for cloning then building
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> download this for git I guess: http://www.msys2.org/
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> haven't found a good way to git on windows yet
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> in that console execute "pacman -S git"
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then you'll have a console with git
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> is this like the standart linux console?
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, it's similar
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I think I just aquire https://git-scm.com/download/win nowadays
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that is worse :/
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> git-scm doesn't have
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> everything
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it has a worse shell, and doesn't have all the tools (as @Savander said)
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hmm it has mintty no?
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> much better then the cmd window you usually get with msys
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Learath2 which readme do you mean?
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> which repost?
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we're not talking about msys, but msys2
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's different, I'm not sure you have seen it
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ok thanks!
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> found it i guess
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 this indeed does look prettier ðŸ˜ƒ but they did also update the one that comes with git-scm
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> git-scm is minified
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> guess I'm getting msys2 the next time on windows ðŸ˜›
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜‰
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wanted to give the cygwin versions a try but it takes so long to install that thing I just give up
20:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh also met a guy who swore by gitkraken, I'm not much for guis but one might find it useful so I'll drop it here aswell
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> seems like gitkraken is non-free?
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> noidea have just seen screenshots
