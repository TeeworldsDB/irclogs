21:29 <+Chained> 8,178 commits, man you guys a pretty awesome :D did not expect the sucessor of ddrace to become so "maintained" ^^
21:41 <@deen> :)
22:24 <@heinrich5991> it's basically all deen
22:24 <@heinrich5991> I think he has more commits than oy and matricks
22:25 <@deen> but I'm not doing much, just moving code around :D
22:25 <@heinrich5991> and fixing all the bugs in the meantime
22:25 <@heinrich5991> I find it pretty impressive tbh :)
22:26 <@deen> I also see some other big names up there: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors
22:26 <@deen> heinrich5991, Learath2, Jupeyy, HMH
22:27 <@deen> That reminds me, where did Jupeyy suddenly come from?
22:31 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
22:32 <@deen> oh, and some people would argue I introduced more bugs than I fixed :D
22:32 <@deen> see the sdl2 disaster for example
22:39 <@heinrich5991> sdl2 also fixed lots of bugs
22:40 <@heinrich5991> but those don't get reported
22:40 <@heinrich5991> sdl2 interacts a lot nicer with my wm, for example
