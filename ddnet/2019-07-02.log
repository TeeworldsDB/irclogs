07:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> Just Scroll a bit up next time 🙃
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when you login with rcon, is the password sent encrypted?
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought about a couple ways to secure atleast the authentication part, but nothing short of actually encrypting the entire connection came to mind
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> CHAP would require the server to know the plaintext of the passwords, which is undesirable
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could make sure that the client doesn't send the password out, but preventing MITM would require at least authenticating the rcon connection
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (one could make sure …)
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how are you supposed to authenticate a client without it ever sending the password nor you knowing the plaintext of the password?
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Such a complex protocol 😛
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like it's based on prime factorization being difficult
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are other zero knowledge proofs that do not rely on that
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if this one does)
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, from the first glance, it looks like it depends on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> I want to remember you all: "We havnt enough time to port ddnet to 0.7, but we are adding useless things, new bugs, trying to fix bugs and waste the time for nothing"
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> In real: " Oh we are all tired"
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, appears so
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FluffiexD be our guest, go ahead and port ddnet to 0.7
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Only if u assist me and we make a closed src and slap all people
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Adding small stuff and fixing bugs takes about an hour out of my day, at that pace I'll have a 0.7 port done in about a decade
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt anyone else on the team spends much more then 2-3 hours a day
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> i thing ddnet stuff is big enough to port it to 0.7 ez
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that adds up to a whopping 10 hours a day with a generous estimate, it'd still take a year to port 😛
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and for what? making you and @ChillerDragon happy?
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> dont write chillerdragon  in the chat
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> 0.6 is dead
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> thats the mainsreason
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 is dead
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know the best, they only get 1 server with some ppl
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its a race mod
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hilarious isnt it? teeworldsa itself is dead
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet should be standalone
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and no one cares about a pretty menu which we can debate whether its pretty
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet has way more utility than tw 0.7
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they added controller support, yeah we will do perfect pixel aim with that
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are the oens
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> adding useless stuff
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> xD
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur just biased af
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or trolling
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> us
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> dont be salty on me
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> ryomadzuki -,-
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 makes me mad
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 such a weird protocol 🙂, first half looks like a diffie hellman kex
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> why we dont rename ddnet to tw 0.8
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is 12.5
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way more versions
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than 0.7
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there u have
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can brag about a higher version number
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> :troll:
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> hes a troll
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know him
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's vali 😛
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> lol
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> you dumb? call me again a troll and you die
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> see
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> funny af
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill hack u in a min bb
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> kk
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 did you know of it beforehand or how did you find it? I remember browsing around for a while when I implemented it and not getting anywhere
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found it when I researched how protocols handle passwords
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also I had heard of zero knowledge proofs before, so it was kinda clear that something like that must exist
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just kinda sad how little it's used ^^
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know what the `u` term is supposed to prevent?
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel it should work with u = 1, and still be secure, but I'm probably missing sth 😛
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking at it quickly, it seems to be a "shared random number", i.e. a number that neither client nor server can set on its own
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's often useful
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> <food>
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> </food>
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😮

14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Not even working when using "cl_dummy_copy_moves"
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> status of my side project

15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill never  finish a thing xD
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never finish a thing either, maybe we should collab
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u wanna do
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you finish the part I don't finish and I finish the part you don't, we might end up with a full project
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> nobody finishes anything
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 you forgot +toggle in your pr
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://itch.io/jams/starting-this-month :monkaS:
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why can't things be easy? 😦
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> is +toggle necessary even?
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean +toggle doesn't support strings e.g.
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> it worked before
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I would add it
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why doesn't it support strings tho
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> because I guess the person who implemented it couldn't think of a use for it so he omitted it
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you think I should leave support for old masterservers in the client?
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uhm
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I mean support for the old serverbrowse protocol yes, support for old masters no I guess
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> what are you talking about?
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Http masterservers
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. faster serverlist reload in the "internet" and "ddnet" and "kog" tab
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but if you remove support for vanilla masters you could also break compat to old serverinfo protocol, just keep the new one
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> to reduce attack surface on affected servers
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they will eventually close the 0.6 masters
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should become standalone
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> why should they?
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.5 servers are still running btw
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway no one plays vanilla
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> sadly
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im happy
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is not true and ddnet isn't the only mod that people play
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fng is not based on ddnet e.g.
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ddnet can implement a more mod friendly protocol
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which other would follow
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the master servers
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> also thinking about a tcp implementation could be interesting
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> maybe its possible to force other mods to follow
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tcp for gameplay nope
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http for masters yes
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is tcp
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tcp doesnt make sense on game
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> if I remember correctly, mc uses tcp
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and it makes sense, at least if you think about "how to stop the ddos"
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no it doesnt
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read about tcp and udp
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why mc uses tcp but most games use udp
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't thought about the DoS protection angle, but ryozuki is right about udp being the better fit for games
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, tcp would make sense for chat but nothing else
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tcp has the "head of line" blocking problem. if you miss a single data packet, you won't get new data until that gets resent
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and why not use both? tcp for handshaking and server info, but udp for the game traffic?
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would be possible
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea forgot about the package loss problematic
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there some cheap/free protection for generic tcp services? I'd guess there only is for http
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I believe cloudflare also supports tcp. but most hoster (for example ovh) provide a more or less good protection for tcp
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would increase latency for sure
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> if you use tcp only maybe, but mixed could be interesting
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> protection involves proxying right? on udp it would increase that low latency required for gameplay
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> you forget that the for example nfo (which is used by ddnet) supports udp and tcp protections, but I guess tcp is more reliable
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they already on nfo iirc
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/ ← doesn't seem like cloudflare is offering protection for tcp/udp for free/cheap
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that's what @Kaisi said)
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DNNy1/5b56194307.png
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobys fng server is based on ddnet and its the most popular one
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @onby :GWpingSock:
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur white theme is horrible
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quoting using pictures is annoying 😛 just use ">"
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> is the http master already wip?
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 is working on it
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> @Learath2  how is your progress?
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > u
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 how am i going to flex my white theme then?
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaisi gimme a day or two and it should be ready, then give it a day or two for review 😛
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and another two weeks to fix all the bugs?
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> 😛
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep sounds about right
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/595662120729837568/a.png
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/595662258215059456/unknown.png
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> heinrich white themer confirmed
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaisi I had it mostly working, then I noticed I kinda went overboard and removed the entire support for serverinfo packets and old masters, neither could servers register on old masters
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I started again 😛
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ill gladly try to break ur api
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I feel like the review could take longer than a day or two
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will*
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will take weeks for sure
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least I might have some strong opinion on doing things right™
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 pls send your strong opinions before I finish up 😄
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but breaking the old-ish support sounds right to me? 😮
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I haven't seen it yet, how can I comment on it
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish we could remake the map format in a sane and human way
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki this is important enough that it'll prolly get a lot more attention then some other prs
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 please share some API calls, the design for registering, the IPv6 compatibility, the way forward for server pings in the client
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh IPv6 compatibility 🤔
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for some of the things that might be contentious
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 also the ability to blacklist a server ip
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> does that even require anything specific? as long as the server registers from an ipv6 address it should register just fine
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, we're not introducing a protocol that doesn't have proper ipv6 support IMO
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> just ship both ips
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. we need a way for a server to identify ipv4 and ipv6 address so it doesn't appear twice in the serverbrowser
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also it needs to register for both, if possible
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (currently it only registers for one)
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye, my ISP doesnt have ipv6 support
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't seen a single household isp that gives out ipv6 yet
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but ds-lite is really a thing nowadays, so supporting ipv6 seems necessary
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i had one that does
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> orange
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but yeah, it'd be stupid not to support it
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but most vps
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have ipv6
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like almost all
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> almost, ye
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a working IPv6
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pff, this complicates everything
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I know ^^
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got a sudden urge to drop this
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😗
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😦
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i fell u
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feel
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would one support both ips and recognize them as the same? the client would also need to request which one prefers right
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> i have seen cases where ds lite increased the ping for ipv4 by 20 ms compared to ipv6
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This sounds wrong though, the server shouldn't have to know their ip
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds very counterintuitive
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @redix ipv6 should be more perfomant
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easier routing tables
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something like that
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> i have a full dualstack now and both have the same ping
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I let the server dictate what ip they are registering with, it's no longer guaranteed that they own the ip
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I'd alternatingly heartbeat via ipv4 and ipv6 maybe
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can set curl options to say that only IPvX ought to be used
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I guess that could work, but how is curl supposed to know which ipv6 address to use as source?
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how is it supposed to know which ipv4 address to use as source? – the OS is doing that
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do you make sure curl and the server is using the same network interface?
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ipv4 cant connect to ipv6 right?
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not that common to have a block of ipv4 addresses, it's very common for ipv6 addresses
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and why not simply using something like a token/ident number so that the master knows which ips are together?
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you hope for the best(?)
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can abuse it
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, another point: please still have a way do port-forward checking, with a way to disable it on the server side
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (this should mostly fix the "invalid ipv6" problem)
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaisi yeah, that's what I have in mind, we already send a secret, so I'll use that
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> port-forward checking? do we really need this?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and why don't you ship external ipv4/v6 ip within the register packet?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we should do it, yes
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaisi then idk if the server actually owns the ip, then i need some packet to verify that, etc. way more work
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 hmm, just have the master twping the server on the given port?
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> could be abused - possibly -
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Kaisi yeah, make those 2 days more like a month or so
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a year*
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I'm bound to get way more busy with exams on september, so I guess http masters 2020?
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who keeps ddosing the masterserver anyway?
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he gains literally no benefit
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ddnet has its own sv list
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is completly dumb
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> port forward checking... what are we checking even?
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that the server is reachable
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I can just send a connless tw packet on the port, and have the server reply with it
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ye
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I'd pack the response into the next heartbeat packet though
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that way, we don't require the masterserver to listen for udp packets
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and could potentially spoof the source address of these packets if that's allowed anywhere, in order to not give away the real source)
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean we could probably get some server in a third world country 😄
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe vali would share
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any strong opinion on how I should be verifying the json schema?
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using a library
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like any sane person
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it should only be verified on the client side, what do you think?
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (the serverinfo json schema)
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. like it's done today
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 maybe I don't understand the question correctly
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the server has to drop invalid heartbeats aswell
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the server list is essentially a list of objects with a subset of the elements of a heartbeat
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so at either side I need to verify that the json is not malformed
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could just put the published object in a "info" subobject or so
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you don't have to touch it on the masterserver side
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cloudflare was down today btw
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. don't host all masterservers on cloudflare 😛
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 would you be okay with letting servers host arbitrary data on our masterservers?
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, until it is abused
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe put a size limit on it
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Things that sound like big problems to me sound like no problem to you, and things that I wouldn't even think about are problems for you 😛
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like we think in opposite ways
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the upside of not working alone on a project I guess?
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> true
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'd want this info to be as open as possible for mods, and previously they could also send any data to the clients)
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd want to strictly regulate it, so that when the client gets an "info" field it knows exactly what's in it and it's always enough to construct a `CServerInfo` object and the people that host masters know exactly what they are hosrting
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd validate that on the client side – and just skip any entries that don't conform to the client's schema (but allow extra fields)
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like restricting fields doesn't help the masters not hosting content they don't want, we have many free-form strings in there
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a size limit can reduce the most rampant abuse
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but for the extra-fields maybe implement a protocol version?
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (size limit in bytes)
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> sent by server
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then mods can't put their own fields without cooperation by the masters
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> *clients
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> the idea would be you create a protocol which could be extended but has a version number so the client always knows whats inside
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> the main problem would be the client then
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what problem with "my" system are you trying to solve? what doesn't work there?
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> imagine vers 1 has no banner url, but vers 2 has one, so the client knows that the additional field means if there is a proper version shipped with
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> imagine vers 1 has no banner url, but vers 2 has one, so the client knows what the additional field means if there is a proper version shipped with
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> so it would be possible to create fields with a general description, more or less. I hope you get the idea
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> the banner url is a good example. so you discuss on github how to implement it, just add it, go one up in the version and newer clients know how to parse the new field instead of just displaying bullshit maybe
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> extra fields aren't a problem in JSON
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> so presenting a preview instead of the url
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're just ignored by the client if it doesn't know them
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ye but I meant the parsing later
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> hmpf.
