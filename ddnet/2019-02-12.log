07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @pksol1 Br try "Reset filter"
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wat
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> why is there GetSpeed2
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Oh yeah cuz fixed
12:08 <@deen> m stands for modified, not added
12:09 <@deen> would be even nicer if we showed what changed exactly in the map
12:10 <@deen> we have the map_diff tool after all
12:11 <@deen> I think I'll hack that together now
12:12 <@deen> [22:Game] 114x240: (index: 0, flags: 0) != (index: 62, flags: 0)
12:12 <@deen> [22:Game] 116x240: (index: 0, flags: 0) != (index: 3, flags: 0)
12:12 <@deen> [22:Unhook] 114x240: (index: 0, flags: 0) != (index: 38, flags: 0)
12:12 <@deen> [22:Unhook] 116x240: (index: 0, flags: 0) != (index: 1, flags: 0)
12:12 <@deen> Might not be that useful after all :D
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen what is this fake persian ddnet?xd
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I dont have ranks and poins there but its exactly named like a ddnet server and lot people there :O
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/544846531270934537/screenshot_2019-02-12_12-42-10.png
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats profit :troll:
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @CrashtimeHD make the crosshear an svg and then convert the svg to a resized png and slap it onto the game files
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> If you want, I can make the crosshair an svg for you
13:49 <@deen> Konsti: Well, they asked me to work together but I didn't trust random Persian hosters thanks to *you*
13:50 <@deen> So they hosted it themselves with their own client as well: http://ddnet-persian.ir/
13:58 <@deen> imo they should make it a bit clearer that they are not DDNet proper, but we may also do so ourselves with somre special signal for official servers
13:58 <@deen> client-side of course
13:58 <@deen> and in the end I think it's good if we have a broader landscape of servers and not just a DDNet-official mono culture
13:59 <@deen> more servers and clients means more people get to try new ideas that DDNet didn't consider good enough, and in the end they might still be right
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> That persians are not trustable wasnt my fault lol
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Sajed was going around and randomly changed ranks from players before i even knew him
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> honestly i just excluse the word persian
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> honestly i just exclude the word persian
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @ᶰ°Konͧsti lol didn't u fuckin changed ur rank urself ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no i didnt ask Sajed to change my rank on Naufrage 3 to -8b5272527 now my legit 235minutes rank is deleted :feelsbadman:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and on Nostalgia @ᶰ°Konͧsti
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i always thought u were the hoster
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> like the only one
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and that u was the one who changed ur time
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i wouldnt be that retarded lol
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> why would i host persian server
