00:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> never go cheap on the PSU
00:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it can ruin ur billion dollar gpu
00:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
00:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i think most have it now
00:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the tension protection or smth? idk
00:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
00:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im like a noob at these things
00:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> u think that second bundle i posted is worth another $150 ryo? rly comes out to another $170 cuz tax...
00:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> murica so cheap
00:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it's another 4 cores + maybe better clock speed (didn't check) + another 32GB of ram
00:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is a microcenter thing
00:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> they have insane limited time deals
00:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think it's a really good deal
00:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was raiding at ff
00:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so i missed the convo xd
00:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> better than the 7900x?
00:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 7xxx gen is quite new
00:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> im out of work
00:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mobos are expensive
00:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> hi
00:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> hard to say, the 7900x is the worth the extra price, but i dunno if u actually need it
00:08 < bridge_> <Voxel> you guys are still talking about specs?
00:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> have u ever heard the term 'fuck it we ball'
00:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no we arent american
00:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we are europroud
00:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea that's why i asked
00:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> well
00:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> fuck it we ball
00:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 🇪🇺
00:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> 🇺🇸
00:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :monkaStop:
00:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
00:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> that flag stresses me out
00:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> which one
00:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> usa
00:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's been twisted
00:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> now i see it and i think radicals
00:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> skill issue
00:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> radicals always use the flag
00:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> i see it and think "hm. the flag for the usa"
00:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like Voxel
00:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> how i see it it's becoming more and more of a hate symbol
00:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in spain fascists use the spanish flag with the black thing
00:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> yeah im radically awesome
00:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> (what are radicals)
00:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> right-wing
00:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> extemists
00:10 < bridge_> <Voxel> oh
00:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> in usa we have many deviations of the american flag to support whichever radical niche
00:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> blue stripe = police
00:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u see this, stay away
00:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140769551362039950/bandera-tercios-espanoles_33fb0657-57d6-4820-8208-8f4b0a7bb2d0_700x700.webp
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> pretty much any other version of the usa flag means whoever's waving it is a proud buy
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> pretty much any other version of the usa flag means whoever's waving it is a proud boy
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> i.e. a trump supporter
00:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> oh yeah that
00:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> ew
00:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if you see this:
00:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany#/media/File:Flag_of_Germany_(1935%E2%80%931945).svg
00:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
00:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u lost
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> you see that some places here
00:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just use the usa flag when talking about the usa
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> same w confederate flag
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea that's kinda why i don't have the usa flag on my ddnet profile thing
00:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> luxembourg flag is much more awesome
00:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> im not that patriotic for the usa tbh
00:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is bad too
00:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140769854576656444/image.png
00:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just live here and this is the only life i will remember
00:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> until the next one
00:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> and then that place will become my place to live
00:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskriegsflagge#/media/Datei:Deutsche_Marine_Postkarte_vor_1903.jpg
00:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> germany has so many extrimist flags xD
00:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kinda sad
00:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> many countries
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> the iron cross
00:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> spain too
00:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we had 40 years of franco
00:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dictatorship
00:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> how much of the german population associates with these extremist flags ?
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> i really don't know
00:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> hard to say for the usa, i only know how it is where i am. big country
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> keywords to understand germany's history:
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> reichsbürger/kaiserreich
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nazis
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> stasi
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> np
00:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> enough education for today
00:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
00:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> im gonna get the 7900x combo i think
00:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then u also need better PSU xd
00:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - i only have 600$
00:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what even is your PSU
00:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u said
00:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/obKRiqMAt0g
00:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> did u click the link ryozuki
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140770833808240672/image.png
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> comes to $600 w tax
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i only have $600 to spend on this yeah
00:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sounds like a scam lol
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> microcenter is an established store
00:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its a good deal
00:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> too good
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's legit i promise
00:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well in murica this actually happens sadly xD
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have bought from them before. and my dad
00:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sad for us
00:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> and linus tech tippes talks about them often enough i think
00:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i've seen such deals before in murica
00:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and hardware generally is pretty cheap there
00:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> it just happens
00:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> when all industry leaders are based here
00:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in america you pay with your soul
00:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
00:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> oh puh lease
00:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> government subsidies and/or funding for base level electronics & internet since covid
00:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> i have no soul
00:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well except for the cpu architecture nothing is from america is it?
00:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ram is from EU or asia
00:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mb from asia
00:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> CPU hardware from asia
00:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u could say it's asia xD
00:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't mean parts mfg., i mean company headquarters
00:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> amd & intel (as well as nvidia if you want to get into gpus) are all from usa
00:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep
00:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but they are only half of the story
00:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
00:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> most of the r&d from these companies happens here as far as i know
00:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> but idk
00:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, be lucky u get a really nice PC so cheap
00:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'm jelous xd
00:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
00:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk the margins here but i bet it would be just as much to have someone buy it here and ship it to you lol
00:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> messed up
00:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Zoll kicks in
00:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they sadly control so that you cannot do stuff like this
00:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> what's that
00:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> tariff?
00:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> toll
00:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea i see
00:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> unfortunate
00:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe
00:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> probably good for your economy
00:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> but muh cheap hardware
00:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah xd
00:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with a very cheap flight to murica u could maybe have a better deal flying and buying hardware there and fly back XDD
00:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> ppl here do that in china
00:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a friend once bought a laptop in america for cheap
00:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> hardware is dirt cheap there
00:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> i saw this vid a few years ago. it was pretty much just a mall for tech
00:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> a several storey warehouse
00:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> everything marked down substantially compared to the states
00:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @mpft u know
00:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the truth is
00:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> america only does the final "assembling"
00:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the parts come already made
00:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh yeah i never claimed anything was manufactured here
00:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> TSMC does it
00:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
00:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Kinda insane that a single company basically builds all high end chips in the world
00:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> fwiw i have cx750
00:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> that'll be good for the ryzen 7 right
00:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> fwiw i have cx750(m)
00:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> 170W TDP for the 7900x and 180W on my GPU
00:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> i feel like that's plenty of headroom for the other components & cpu/gpu spikes, right?
00:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> that comes to 350 and i'm left with a full 400 . but i don't really know how it works
00:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds more than enough
00:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> so i don't need new psu. awesome
00:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am rly glad i bought that thing. forgot i had it too
00:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> semi-modular
00:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> makes the inside look not awful
00:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> though now i have tape on my gpu so it looks bad again
00:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> i just can't sleep with the lights. and i don';t think software can do anything
02:18 < bridge_> <sedonya> What is 'shared' and why is it necessary?

02:26 < bridge_> <sedonya> a, okay
02:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't remember but i think this might be rust related
02:35 < bridge_> <sedonya> I installed it right before launching the IDE
02:35 < bridge_> <sedonya> :c
02:35 < bridge_> <sedonya> I'll try reinstalling

04:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> disable the ffmpeg build flag
04:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> for demo rendering
04:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> don’t remember what it’s called hold on
04:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> you should be able to discover through cmake

04:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> nah not like that
04:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> try cmake -L it’ll show you
04:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh maybe that thing in the bottom corner

11:08 < bridge_> <Jurai!> is here possible to add some fixes with languages ?
11:08 < bridge_> <Jurai!> to game
11:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, just edit the language files in `data/languages/`
11:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you can then send the updated versions to deen or make a pull request on github
11:22 < bridge_> <QuiX> Hello! In the editor, when loading between maps you used to be able to copy the game group elements, to be able yo copy parts and put it in other map. I tried it but wasn't able to do It in the new version. Is it another way of doing it now or it got removed?
11:22 < bridge_> <QuiX> Hello! In the editor, when loading between maps you used to be able to copy the game group elements, to be able to copy parts and put it in other map. I tried it but wasn't able to do It in the new version. Is it another way of doing it now or it got removed?
11:36 < ChillerDragon> Indeed seems like the layer selection is gone when loading a new map. Seems like a bug @QuiX
11:48 < bridge_> <QuiX> Aah I see, okey cool, thanks!
12:18 < bridge_> <matodor> imagine commit from chilller without mention 0.7 :brownbear:
12:20 < ChillerDragon> hrhrhr
12:21 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @heinrich5991 how can i decode snapshot with twlib2? :D
12:22 < ChillerDragon> libtw2*
12:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Idk why but i always write it twlib2 :(
12:23 < ChillerDragon> no tpyos alwoed in this chanel
12:24 < ChillerDragon> im not sure if the snap stuff if usuable yet
12:24 < bridge_> <coke1465> Hope it gets fixed soon, not nice if u do a map together
12:24 < ChillerDragon> what are you working on?
12:24 < bridge_> <coke1465> The quad copy thing was also better b4
12:24 < ChillerDragon> @coke1465 agree i also like mapping "together" :D steal a bit from here and a bit from there apply a new design and call it new work
12:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Im trying to get snapshot data :pepeW:
12:25 < bridge_> <coke1465> Its the best way, both mapper do entities and put it together
12:25 < bridge_> <coke1465> So nobody has to wait
12:26 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yes but why? for what?
12:26 < bridge_> <teero777> Someone should make we version of map editor :poggers:
12:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Maybe to render a demo in browser
12:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Idk
12:26 < bridge_> <teero777> With multilayer :poggers2:
12:26 < ChillerDragon> @coke1465 whats "we" ?
12:26 < bridge_> <teero777> With multiplayer :poggers2:
12:26 < bridge_> <coke1465> Actually no need
12:27 < ChillerDragon> there is this 
12:27 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/k2d222/twwe
12:27 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> There's web version of map editor
12:27 < bridge_> <teero777> where?
12:28 < bridge_> <teero777> Oh
12:28 < bridge_> <teero777> Lol
12:28 < bridge_> <coke1465> I think it's enough if u can just copy ur game into mates game
12:28 < bridge_> <coke1465> Like it was 😁
12:29 < bridge_> <coke1465> But maybe add new feature 😁 that u can Copy all game layers at once
12:29 < bridge_> <coke1465> Tele front etc
12:29 < ChillerDragon> wasnt that possible already?
12:29 < bridge_> <coke1465> We used back then time cp's to mark the teleporters
12:29 < ChillerDragon> with selecting multiple layers
12:29 < bridge_> <coke1465> XD
12:30 < bridge_> <coke1465> Idk actually but it was not possible
12:31 < bridge_> <coke1465> I also don't like that u can't make the env thing smaller like b4
12:31 < bridge_> <coke1465> B4 there was like 4 options to make it bigger
12:31 < bridge_> <coke1465> (the working area)
12:32 < bridge_> <coke1465> B4 there was like 4 options to make it bigger/smaller
12:32 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Is there docs where described how data is laid down in snapshot. I dont want to do in c++ land 😭
12:34 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon made some docs right?
12:35 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:35 < ChillerDragon> i also have a snapitem parser in ruby
12:35 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat 0.7 i assume the only true version
12:35 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/snap_items.html
12:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> thanks :D
12:37 < ChillerDragon> I also have 0.6 but i recommend reading 0.7 since i put more love into it
12:38 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html
12:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> is ddnet based on 0.6?
12:38 < ChillerDragon> the layout didnt really change 
12:38 < ChillerDragon> ddnet is mostly 0.6 based
12:38 < bridge_> <teero777> yes
12:38 < ChillerDragon> servers can also brideg to 0.7
12:38 < ChillerDragon> and the client soon(tm) too
12:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i see, 0.7 useless :pepeW:
12:39 < ChillerDragon> more like ddnet useless
12:39 < bridge_> <matodor> true
12:39 < bridge_> <teero777> 0.7 skin system is nice. Everything else is kinda meh in my opinion
12:39 < ChillerDragon> anyways the snap items changed but the layout is the same in the 0.7 snap docs i described the layout @milkeeycat
13:14 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I opened an issue for that https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7025
13:14 < bridge_> <coke1465> 👍
13:15 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Do you mean the envelope editor? You can drag the top bar to change the size
13:15 < bridge_> <coke1465> oh rly? never tried it
13:15 < bridge_> <coke1465> xd
13:15 < bridge_> <coke1465> was thinking its fixed now
13:16 < bridge_> <coke1465> good to know

17:21 < visitOP_> Mh
18:14 < bridge_> <totar> is you ddnet libs folder empty?
18:14 < bridge_> <sedonya> No
18:15 < bridge_> <totar> it should be able to find these things just from ddnet-libs
18:15 < bridge_> <sedonya> I don't know what happened, but after restarting the IDE everything is fixed
18:15 < bridge_> <totar> clear cmake cache
18:15 < bridge_> <totar> probably
18:15 < bridge_> <totar> cleared cmake cache
18:15 < bridge_> <sedonya> U creator TClient?
18:16 < bridge_> <totar> yeah
18:17 < bridge_> <sedonya> Cool, I liked your client, it unlike cheat clients just adds convenient visuals
18:17 < bridge_> <sedonya> Especially the binds wheel

18:58 < bridge_> <totar> just donate 100k to offset the moral loss
19:20 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> my data is wrong and nothing works :pepeW: but now i know how it should work :pepeW:
19:34 < bridge_> <Skylink> This is probably not a new request but I would like ddnet to add the reset on switch option directly in the settings
19:36 < bridge_> <Skylink> Maybe it could be added as "reset movements " idk
19:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and i would like a button to sync colors with my dummy
19:37 < bridge_> <Skylink> that's a good idea actually
19:44 < bridge_> <smetanolub> how can i see my current taken cp?

20:57 < bridge_> <murpi> ASUS board :monkaStop:
20:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u got bad experience with them? xd
20:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i always thought asus is the high quality shit
20:59 < bridge_> <murpi> They got huge drama recently for frying amd processors
21:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rip
21:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rip
21:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i always go msi for mobo

21:02 < bridge_> <hus3h> someone with experience could tell us if it's usually a fixed number regardless if the employee is american or not
21:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well msi had huge drama too

21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i buy gigabyte mostly.. not bcs they good or smth. But simply bcs they have the best features most of the time
21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> USB-C when everyone was still on USB 3
21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> stuff like that
21:10 < bridge_> <murpi> What basically happened is:
21:10 < bridge_> <murpi> ASUS ships product which kills another product attached to it, ASUS releases (Beta) BIOS update with quote "Oopsie, now hopefully it wont kill the product attached to it, but also if you install this BIOS you lose all warranty regardless if it kills the attached product or the product itself"
21:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> damn
