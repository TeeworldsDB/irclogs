14:35 <@EastByte> deen: back from vacation
14:36 <@EastByte> well I guess you aren't reachable
14:45 < laxadedi> EastByte: do you know if it could be dangerous to ssh on an unknown machine ?
14:45 <@EastByte> 'unknown machine'?
14:46 <@EastByte> if your ssh client is up-to-date I don't think so
14:47 <@EastByte> but if you are paranoid you could run the client on a different user
14:47 <@EastByte> (hiding public key e.g.)
14:48 < laxadedi> I mean, can I do something nasty to someone by giving him ssh access to my server for example
14:48 <@EastByte> nope, that wouldn't make sense
14:48 <@EastByte> client accesses server not vice-versa
16:22 < o_be_one> hello :)
19:59 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: as long as you don't enter the password to one of your servers, logging in to different servers is fine
