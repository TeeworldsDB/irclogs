00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @heinrich5991 what kind of variable would be useful
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anything in that function or class would be nice
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rlh_record_in should be 3 at most and 0 at least
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that useful atall
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can we look at the value of `dist`
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or did it not reach that point
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's a large negative value
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dist?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dist
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> O_O
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess thats the problem ..
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lets add check for that
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't know if we can trust the debug info
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```        int dist = (hx * hx) + (hy * hy);
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         dist = dist ? (int)sqrt(dist) : dist;```
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i figured
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that this shouldnt be negative
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait why
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is the debug info of another binary
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it also matches this one, it's pure luck
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> f
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 4:51 PM] heinrich5991: @noby do you have any variable whose value you know?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the problem is that pretty much every variable in that function is dependant on the position of the tee and the mouse
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so if we cant tell those things then im not sure :x
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> need to wait for the next crash I guess 😦
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> D:
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why is the dbg info on this one messed up?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> was it using the older binary
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it was using the one I hadn't updated yet
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> aw
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lets pretend that the update fixes it
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 🙃
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is there any config for repeating chat counter
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> `cl_friend_messages`
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> `cl_show_ids`
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is there any other commands that can affect chat now?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is there any way friend pass that exp?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> `if (m_aLines[r].m_ClientID >= 0 && m_aLines[r].m_aName[0] != '\0')`
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Is there any way friend will not pass that exp?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> `if (m_aLines[r].m_ClientID >= 0 && m_aLines[r].m_aName[0] != '\0')`
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhhh, maybe if he has no name
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> is it the valid reason
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> to break the chat
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can also change that line, the problem was just then the chat message window itself was r == 0
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it did add ": " for me 😄
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe u can check it somehow else
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like when u are typing stuff
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> fuck it, it will just not show the heart if you're friend with player named null
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Does it look like an old chat?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766074895506866196/unknown.png
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If so, I'm ready. The only thing left is to make a toggle in game setting hud
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well the : is obv different but i already knew that 😄
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I will not fallback the ":" thing
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so yes, looks same
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> don't even ask me
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc about it btw
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> the most thing I was unsure about is heart
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just dont want code in the text.cpp xD
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs the cursor can solve all your problems
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've removed my "NewLineOffset" relaeted code from text.cpp
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've removed my "NewLineOffset" related code from text.cpp
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Even improved old code a bit
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> for chat.cpp > OnPrepareLines
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in chat.cpp change whatever u want
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Im doing exactly that
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Didn't even want to change anything else
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> but unfortunately I need width/height info of text containers
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> for my future updates as well. And someone else's I think
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 pls check repo
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Дядя Женя ok, but i'd prefer to have a proper reason to why u want it, bcs the textcursor can already return width and height
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its just bloating the already bloating text.cpp even more
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> makes a rewrite just harder and harder
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Jupstar ✪ what members exactly
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> m_X returns the current X value, so you can check it against the X value before the function call,
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> same for Y
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> aligned size gives you the exact font size
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and so on
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we can discuss this tomorrow or smth, just look around a bit 😄
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> but you didnt have any width/height of text container
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well x advances the whole lines
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i am wrong, i'd still prefer to put it in the cursor not in the text container
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Jupstar ✪ But if you're using multiple cursors to edit the same container?
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> which I do ofc
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes u can just add floats to each other if u want the full size 😄
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've made last commit, you can look at it if you want
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> and give some commentary ofc
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but not today, tomorrow 😄
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> k
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I'll just add toggle in setting menu and I'm done with chat, so that will be your problem now 😄
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> is it ok that my PR fails nearly all tests?
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Made a checkbox for old chat style in settings
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Chat is done now
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hi guys

04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> for the second time:troll:
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really hope windows puts out some update soon
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the guy in general also thought that the older clients worked
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he also has a intel from 2019
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so not some old stuff xd
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ honestly these issues occur way too often. I don't think we can just keep telling people to update drivers
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen so whats ur suggestion? block windows update, you must be aware that these reports magically happened like 1-2 weeks ago
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> before that nobody said anything
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, it's a problem with the driver version windows delivers? I didn't follow closely, I assumed it was some gl code change we did using more features
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well he has a CPU from 2019, even if i use the most exotic opengl 4.5 function it has to work xD
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah, appearently its since only 1-2 weeks, bcs then it started, and all had the same bug
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then maybe let's write a website news at least?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i've no proof, but i know that alot of ppl think that 14.7 and newer worked and the new GL code is since 14.6.2
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well you can do it, sure, wouldn't hurt
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> could you report it at microsoft?
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well since a driver update yet always solved the issue, its probably known
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah can see if there is some report for it
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be nice if you could write the news post too 🙂
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95639
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this has happened
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the past
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look this xD
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766212846731788318/unknown.png
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl get black screen right?
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they are on windows
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that a forum for windows?
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah this is windows
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u didnt even read the title
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 2015
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt sound new xd
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they may have made the same issue
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> intel is known to have alot of problems always
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not even only opengl
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i searched the internet a bit yesterday i found so many bug reports
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they have a builtin app, but cant find any other way
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah german
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes i understands
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good, bcs u have to learn german anyway
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i do c++ with german keywords
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and force it into the world
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> german words are stupidly large
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> falls(x == 0) {
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> }
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mache {
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> } solange (x == 0)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> english is  the best
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont have to press multiple keys
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to do stuff like ü
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it doesnt exist
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> äöü are one key each :p
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ñç are
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well on a german keyboard at least
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i am not good at writing, just write something like this, but in your own words xd:
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```

10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> There were a lot of reports about for bugs and crashes with intel processors under Windows lately.
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It might have been created by a windows update, which also updates the intel GPU's driver.
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> A driver update seemed to help with this situation (downloaded the latest driver for intel and update it with help of [this](//https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Notebooks/Update-to-Latest-Intel-Graphics-Driver/m-p/4457633?page=1#4457786))
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We hope that intel can solve their issue quickly, until then you can just try to follow the advice above.
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Hi, I was wondering if it would be possible to have a 2nd HD option especially for a foreground in my case (so it remains an option)
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Is it possible or not ? 😮
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> theoretically yes xd
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u really just mean that foreground would e.g. show the high details
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say it like this:
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client knows that is foreground and what is background
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it could disable highdetails for one, while the other has it on
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say it like this:
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client knows what is foreground and what is background
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it could disable highdetails for one, while the other has it on
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I mean it could be like hd, you check yes on the wanted layers
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client can already do this?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it just doesnt split foreground and background
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so the only chance is to split foreground with background option, but not in the edtior
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the editor you know whats foreground, bcs of the gamelayer ofc
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if you mean a 2nd option for the same layer
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is not possible
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only a second option to split between foreground and background layers
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> ok let me show you
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> https://youtu.be/pvR7KPCl2M0
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I'd like the foreground, not playground, to be an option
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> aslong every layer after the gamelayer would be your definition of "foreground" then yes
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else no
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> yep everything above it
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> or actually no the game layer graphics are above game as well
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it won't work probably, bcs in the client everything after the gamelayer is the foreground
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> so another HD (graphics/high details) option isn't conceivable?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would break vanilla compability
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i guess ddnet wont allow it
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> hm I thought about it but in that case, wouldn't it just display it for vanilla players ?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> only ddnet users would be able to show/hide it then
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766228447424282654/unknown.png
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> an option for these two is possible
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not single layers inside these groups
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it is possible, but i dunno if they want it in ddnet 😄
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean everything is possible somehow xD
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> yeah, maybe it's possible without breaking compatibility 🤔
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I thought I might just be the only one to use it but actually it'd be great to have a bar going from 0 to 2 (for HD 0, HD 1, HD 2) where you could decide how many details you want
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looking in the editor yes
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> and not just nothing/everything as it currently is
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it'd be possible to add it for ddnet only, i dunno how sensitive the vanilla client is, but probs it will just ignore the flag
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you could add another ~31 high detail steps as far as i can see
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Ok, I'll wait for more opinion about it
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> anyway I can't code 😄
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pipou  I think HD on/off is enough, wouldn't add more. It also means all have to be tested
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think the foreground stuff looks cool
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe make it a bit transparent to make it clear it's just graphical (if that's your worry)
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I think it might be too much that's why I wanted to leave it as an option
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I understand, but we have too many options
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> yeah it's ok then
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> here is what it looks like without hd
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/766234189221068810/unknown.png
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont even understand whats the problem of having alot of options
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we only save non defaults anyway
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's complexity
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every combination of options can fail
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only if its used more than 1 time tho
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you do 
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> int Detail = g_Config.m_HighDetails
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that is the level of detail that doesnt add complexity
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0 = no level of detail in this case
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 32=all
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like that
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, in this case. but still annoying for testers having to check all 32 levels
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> can't it be less than 32?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah was just an example
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> so people can adjust the design to their liking or pc performances
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think performance doesnt differ that dramatically. using a new feature to adjust the design to ones liking is not possible on any map released up to this point, would be another thing future mappers have to take care of
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Yes of course
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie which version is it broken on
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will pay whoever fixes the damn cmake issue on macOS where it obsessively links to our bundled libs
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie fwiw the texture UV works perfectly fine on master
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Suggestion
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Preparing a simplified map creation program
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like this:greenthing:
