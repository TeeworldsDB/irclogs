00:35 <@deen> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794166
00:37 < Chairn> why bugreport?
00:38 <@deen> That's how you propose new packages for debian
00:38 <@deen> RFP means Request for package
00:41 < Chairn> i learnt something then ^^
00:41 <@deen> that means I'm looking for some debian developer to make and maintain the ddnet package^^
01:46 <@deen> oh, and clearly it's a bug that debian doesn't have ddnet client!
03:38 <@deen> Huh, I never knew that people still use Win98 and actually get new programs working on it and have updates for the OS
03:38 <@deen> http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/152471-kernelex-apps-compatibility-list-new/
03:38 <@deen> http://www.htasoft.com/u98sesp/
03:57 < Chairn> deen: i dont understand why they still use win98
13:34 < OPX> Hi everyone.
13:35 <@EastByte> hi
13:43 < OPX> It's possible to open console at android version?
13:50 <@deen> if you can find an f1 key
13:50 <@deen> i think you can change the binds at the program start somehow
13:51 <@deen> or connect a keyboard^^
13:53 < OPX> Also, some bug: at android version HUD options does not displays properly. I can't edit anything below "Laser: Innir color". (Oysters T34, Android 4.0)
13:56 <@deen> out of curiosity, what are you using the android client for
14:01 < OPX> Playing. If i will config it for me, i think i can play properly at android. Also i wanted draw maps, but it's not comfortable.
14:03 <@deen> i don't think it's playable on Android^^
14:03 <@deen> I've only tried to make spectating work
14:03 < OPX> oh...
14:03 <@deen> can you program? you could try fixing the problems and improving the android version yourself
14:03 <@deen> I also think pelya put some more work into the TW android version, which we could merge into ddnet
14:04 < OPX> android version writen on java? 
14:04 <@deen> no
14:04 <@deen> it's the same version as normal ddnet
14:04 <@deen> we just have a few ifdefs in the code
14:04 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet
14:05 <@deen> This is how I build it: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/scripts/make_android.sh
14:05 < OPX> So... i can't fix anything :) 
14:05 <@deen> sure you can, if you can write Java, you can learn C++ too
14:05 <@deen> don't need much for TW
14:05 < OPX> C++ too hard for me.
14:06 <@deen> just find the bug in source code and change a few things until it works :P
14:06 <@deen> better than me trying to fix it without an android device^^
14:08 <@deen> the main difficulty is getting it to compile I think
14:20 < Shiki> https://www.openhub.net/p/teeworlds
14:20 < Shiki> https://www.openhub.net/p?query=ddnet
14:20 < Shiki> :(
14:28 <@deen> so?
14:28 <@deen> you can probably add it to openhub if you want
14:29 <@deen> i don't know how it works and for what it's useful
14:30 < Shiki> I suppose it helps to get a better glimpse of overall project liveliness
18:44 <@deen> hi uchar 
18:44 < uchar> hi
18:45 <@deen> that's unsigned char with H-Client^
18:45 < uchar> need reg the nick
18:46 < uchar> here is with bot or website?
18:48 <@deen> https://www.quakenet.org/help/q/how-to-register-an-account-with-q
18:49 < uchar> thx
18:51 <@deen> afk
19:44 <@deen> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=114952#p114952 <- cool
19:44 <@deen> and welcome, uchar =)
19:46 < uchar> ^^!
19:58 < uchar> the master branch is DDRace64 no?
20:02 <@EastByte> uchar: it is
20:02 <@EastByte> hi uchar 
20:02 < uchar> ei hi EastByte 
20:02 < uchar> ok thx
20:12 <@deen> so, someone discovered a new way to fly with dummy and some map was cheatable now
20:12 <@deen> interesting that people still discover new moves like that
20:13 <@deen> Reminds me of Hardcore 2, where the mapper didn't know that you can drive left and right with hammerfly, so big parts where cheatable. now everyone knows that of course
20:15 <@deen> uchar: i'm also trying to get ddnet into debian btw: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794166
20:19 <@EastByte> deen: how does this new fly look like?
20:20 <@deen> fly?
20:21 <@deen> i should probably rename the DDRace64 branch to master
20:21 <@EastByte> "fly with dummy"
20:22 <@deen> EastByte: very interesting^^
20:22 <@EastByte> I wanna see :D
20:22 <@deen> there is a map for it planned
20:22 <@deen> you can follow me, I can try to do it^^
20:22 <@deen> but haven't tried before
20:22 <@EastByte> okay
20:23 <@EastByte> deen: I don't have test pw
20:31 < uchar> what i'm seeing in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794166 ?? client/server crashes?
20:31 < uchar> not traces?
20:32 <@deen> uchar: no crashes. it's a "request for packaging"
20:32 <@deen> it means I want ddnet client/server added to debian
20:32 < uchar> ahh
20:33 <@deen> and am looking for someone to package and maintain it
20:33 < uchar> ok ok xD
20:33 <@deen> not my fault that debian does that in a bug tracker^^
20:33 <@deen> well, to be fair, we did map testing in a bug tracker before the ddnet forum existed
20:33 < uchar> idk how it work :\
20:33 <@deen> what?
20:34 < uchar> how can add a new package in to debian repo?
20:36 < uchar> all are using UTF-8 and unix line delimiter?
20:36 < uchar> or windows delimiter?
20:36 < uchar> in github
20:38 <@EastByte> uchar: probably the wrong place to ask :p
20:40 <@deen> yeah, utf8 an unix \n are common
20:40 <@deen> https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian
20:40 <@deen> but i just googled, no idea
20:49 < uchar> ok, i can try it.. but i read in the forum that "installed versions" can't auto-update beacause permissions problems... perhaps autoupdater need a update (Oh! meta-updates! xD) for work in local folder in linux?
20:49 < uchar> but.. the problem its the same... can't replace binary :\
20:51 < uchar> ok, the mantainer need update them... and exclude autoupdater in the compilation process xD
20:58 <@deen> right^^
20:58 <@deen> i don't know if you can do it, i'm not familiar with the whole debian process
20:59 <@deen> in the end it has to go through a debian developer anyway
21:05 < uchar> antiping only works with good connections?
21:08 <@deen> uchar: stable connections
21:08 <@deen> ping can be high, but if you have packet loss and lag spikes, it will not work well
21:09 <@deen> and antiping always causes tees to jump around because their movement of course can't be predicted perfectly
21:12 < uchar> oki, i'm watching a tv from internet and for this don't work good xD
21:14 < uchar> and the 'demo recording' requires that the user has installed ffmpeg
21:15 <@deen> right, and ffmpeg is pretty huge, so the idea was to have an external tool you can download, that ships with ffmpeg
21:23 < uchar> ok, made a custom build of ffmpeg with only few features or create a new tool?
21:23 <@deen> create a new tool based on ddnet client but without the gui, just to record demos
21:23 <@deen> Learath2 is working on it I think
21:27 < uchar> why other program and not with start arguments?  ./DDNet --convert my.demo this.mpp4
21:27 <@deen> uchar: so that not everyone has to download 30 MB ffmpeg
21:27 <@deen> only the people who want to convert demo
21:27 < uchar> ajam
21:29 < uchar> if he can get the buffer of the frame it's pretty easy do it only few lines to create the pipe and send the buffer
21:31 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vOtdX
21:31 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8886eba def: Update CircleCI badge
21:31 <@deen> renamded from DDRace64 to master
21:31 <@deen> makes more sense i guess
21:33 < uchar> yes, standard name 
21:33 <@deen> yeah, in the start Teeworlds was master, and we worked on DDRace
21:34 <@deen> then DDRace64 was experimental, later DDRace64 default, DDRace removed
21:43 <@EastByte> deen: since all cloned ddnet repos use DDRace64, a simple git pull won't work anymore I guess
21:44 <@deen> EastByte: i know. any easy way to fix that?
21:44 <@EastByte> no^^
21:44 <@EastByte> I mostly do fetch and merge manually
21:50 <@deen> I just edited my .git/config
21:51 <@deen> and some git branch rename
21:51 <@deen> but I'd be curious if there's a better way, like showing a message when someone tries pulling on DDRace64
21:52 <@deen> I know github redirects when you rename your repo, but apparently not the branch =/
22:09 < uchar> like that add eyes selector and info player to know if you are in solo part, etc... ?
22:25 <@deen> uchar: not sure how that would look
22:25 <@deen> but yes, some indication for that stuff is a good idea
22:26 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/198
22:29 < uchar> in my client i put a simple string
22:30 < uchar> with colors
22:30 < uchar> green - good | yellow - normal | red - bad
22:31 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
22:32 <@deen> laxa: Nimda left^^
22:33 < uchar> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30566237/imgs/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202015-07-31%2022%3A32%3A00.png
22:34 < uchar> i go to fix: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/246  ok?
22:35 <@deen> we had a discussion about this
22:35 <@deen> and it's a bit dangerous to fix it because you can't know which servers support more than 16 players and which don't
22:37 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/2015-07-30.log
22:38 < uchar> and why not best send these information on NETMSG_INFO ?
22:38 < uchar> NETMSG_INFO its a "free" package xD
22:39 <@deen> that's a hack :P
22:39 <@deen> read the log
22:39 <@deen> we do it because that's how all existing 32/64 player servers determine whether the client supports more than 16 players
22:39 <@deen> we can't change that
23:30 < uchar> ok, i understand
23:42 <@deen> I put my todo list into the issues since I'm not sure I'll do it myself in the next weeks: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues
23:43 < Learath2> deen: did give up on the recording stuff
23:43 <@deen> oh, ok
23:44 < Learath2> everything I could imagine looked really hacky and dirty
23:44 <@deen> first get it working
23:44 <@deen> then worry about that^^
23:45 < Learath2> generally thats what I do but this time I really couldnt even imagine how to make it look decent
