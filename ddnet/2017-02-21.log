11:14 < vali> hi fags. i heard you have problems with vali
11:39 < vali> heinrich5991: Tobias, bist du da?
11:39 <@heinrich5991> ?
11:39 <@heinrich5991> english pls
11:40 < vali> Hello Mr Bucher, are u there?
11:40 <@heinrich5991> thanks
11:40 < vali> np
11:41 < vali> do you have a problem with vali?
11:42 <@heinrich5991> I don't know, but it looks like a rhethorical question
11:42 < vali> point
11:42 < vali> still ddos problems @ ddnet?
11:42 <@heinrich5991> no idea
11:42 <@heinrich5991> haven't played recently
11:43 < vali> good
11:45 < vali> heinrich5991: Ist die Adresse in Berlin noch aktuell? Bin gerade in der Stadt
11:48 < Learath2> you trying to scare someone lad?
11:49 < laxadedi> This kid sounds fun
11:54 < vali> i do not get your problem
11:55 < vali> cya
11:55 < Learath2> I just dont like you in principal nothing else
11:55 < Learath2> have a nice day
11:55 < vali> Learath2: you dont know me
11:56 < Learath2> well not like i care about who you are on the inside, it doesnt affect me so i dont care
11:56 < Learath2> what you are showing on the outside is not pleasent at all
11:58 < vali> to be honest, i wonder why you tried to find vali's real life identity 
12:00 < Learath2> i didn't, but im guessing the people who did wanted to report him to the police
12:00 < Learath2> but a crude online d0xing isnt enough evidence tbh
12:01 < Learath2> oh and i know of atleast one person who wanted to knock his teeth out
12:01 < vali> lol. for what? (d)dos or bots?
12:02 < Learath2> ddos, bots are newer
12:03 < vali> vali and ddos? lol, srsly? cant believe that
12:04 < vali> well, people should go to the police then. doxing and teeth knocking is not nice
12:04 < Learath2> well i was out of the loop back then but iirc he claimed it was him
12:05 < vali> and then people lower theirself to the level of that stupid kiddo
12:05 < Learath2> the police only cares about the huge rings, at this scale no one cares enough to find the guy
12:06 < vali> easy to say when nobody handed over logs and personal data to the police
12:07 < Learath2> go ahead, what connects that fictional name vali to a real person?
12:08 < vali> some people in this channel did... via domains, VALIndur etc
12:08 < vali> and I found that interesting
12:09 < Learath2> sure you can but that hardly constitutes evidence in the eye of the law
12:10 < vali> true
12:12 < vali> ill ask vali why he is so mad
12:13 < vali> let's hope that this story ends :)
12:34 <@EastByte> we had no attacks in the past 3 weeks
12:35 <@Learath2> \o/
13:47 <@deen> EastByte: eh what? DDoS on RUS today for example
13:55 <@EastByte> deen: seems that I missed that^^
13:57 <@EastByte> I'm generally referring to ddnet ger outages caused by ddos
17:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #627: Get rid of trailing whitespaces (master...dd_pr_trailing) https://git.io/vDNxj
17:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 closed pull request #627: Get rid of trailing whitespaces (master...dd_pr_trailing) https://git.io/vDNxj
17:57 <@Learath2> did we have to follow allman style in ddnet code?
18:39 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: IIRC that is a style for braces? teeworlds/ddnet does it like that:
18:39 <@heinrich5991> {
18:39 <@heinrich5991> if (x)
18:39 <@heinrich5991> {
18:39 <@heinrich5991> }
18:40 <@heinrich5991> (disregard the first line)
19:07 <@Learath2> :( waste of poor lines
