00:08 < King_> finally ^^
00:08 <@deen> nice =)
00:08 < King_> thanks
00:08 <@deen> but no comment about the content :P
00:09 < King_> yep :P
00:21 < laxa> deen: what's difference between change_map and sv_map ?
00:22 <@deen> I don't know!
00:22 <@deen> never noticed any
00:25 <@deen> Yay, now I'm no longer on i686!
00:29 < laxa> It's about time :p
00:29 <@deen> that server was my former laptop and only 11 years old
00:29 < laxa> server ?!
00:29 <@deen> i have irssi running on my homeserver
00:30 < laxa> So you have computer + homeserver + vps server right ?
00:30 <@deen> yes^^
00:30 < laxa> Hum ok :)
00:30 <@deen> i don't want all my irc connections to go over ddnet.tw
00:30 <@deen> not like everyone needs to know who i am
00:31 <@deen> otherwise i could just run irssi on ddnet.tw
00:34 < laxa> I don't really get why lol.
00:34 <@deen> they would see my ip and know i'm from ddnet.tw
00:35 < laxa> And so ?
00:35 <@deen> that's all, i'm just paranoid
00:35 < laxa> Yeah I guess ^^.
00:37 < laxa> Well, I am off to bed, gn all.
00:37 <@deen> good night laxa

14:18 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 4133e64 def: Remove Damage Indications when entering game (fixes #29)
14:18 <@deen> I have exams
14:20 <@deen> Savander: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/28
14:20 < Savander> i don't know how to reproduce, we testing it with Lady Saavik, 
14:22 < Savander> and she have to "unmute" herself 2 times to make it work
14:22 < Savander> but,but she couldn't unmute me..
14:22 < Savander> we test it on two servers
14:23 < Savander> it was weird
14:23 <@deen> hm =/
14:23 < Savander> don't know how to reproduce ity
14:23 < Savander> it
14:23 <@deen> me neither, i tried around everything that came to mind
14:23 <@deen> and it always worked
14:23 < Savander> but i had same problem
14:23 < Savander> on my servers
14:23 < Savander> sometimes
14:23 < Savander> so idk..
14:23 <@deen> server doesn't matter
14:23 < Savander> i don't remember 
14:23 <@deen> it's a client only feature
14:23 < Savander> but
14:23 < Savander> what?
14:23 < Savander> f2 -> unmuteid?
14:23 < Savander> f2 -> unmuteip?
14:23 < Savander> soryr*
14:23 <@deen> that you mean?!
14:23 < Savander> f2 -> unmute
14:24 < Savander> YES
14:24 < Savander> THAT
14:24 <@deen> i thoguht you mean the ignore-mute in client
14:24 <@deen> haha
14:24 < Savander> NO
14:24 < Savander> xD
14:24 < laxa_work> lol
14:25 <@deen> meh, still works for me
14:26 <@deen> maybe you use it wrongly?
14:26 < laxa_work> deen: oh, I had to tell you one old bug, though don't know if it remained.
14:26 <@deen> you do NOT unmute ID
14:26 <@deen> you do mutes, then look at the mute number and unmute MUTENUMBER
14:26 < Savander> but
14:26 < Savander> you can unmute <name>
14:26 < Savander> and unmute <ip>
14:26 < Savander> my mistake with unmuteid/ip
14:27 < Savander> because i thought about unmuteip/id
14:27 < Savander> what i said
14:27 < Savander> i thought about muteid/id
14:27 < Savander> no unmuteid/ip
14:27 < Savander> -.-
14:34 < laxa_work> deen: so bug is like that : if you let a server run for long long time : like 1 month without any reboot. Then changing map wont work anymore, as I remember, server couldn't access maps anymore.
14:34 < laxa_work> that's why I set up a weekly reboot for my servers to avoid that issue.
14:34 <@deen> laxa_work: yes, i had that too on ddnet
14:35 <@deen> but haven't seen it in the last months
14:35 <@deen> maybe i fixed it
14:35 <@deen> or maybe i restart theservers too often anyway
14:35 < laxa_work> or it's because you reboot your servers too often
14:35 < laxa_work> no idea if that happens on windows
14:35 <@deen> i took quite some time to look for that bug
14:35 <@deen> and it's really weird
14:35 <@deen> the server forgets which directory it's running in
14:36 < laxa_work> lol
14:36 <@deen> and suddenly can't open anything in it anymore
14:36 < laxa_work> Yeah, looks weird.
14:36 <@deen> my guess would be that something overwrites the directory string
14:36 <@deen> but that doesn't happen anywhere in the code, so it's probably something writing way over its boundary
14:36 <@deen> i didn't investigate further though
14:37 < laxa_work> Hum ok...
14:39 <@deen> i fixed a lot of weird memory stuff, maybe it was part of that
15:27 < hamidkag> hiiii evrybody
15:27 < hamidkag> hi laxa
15:27 < hamidkag> help me
15:27 < hamidkag> :D

15:30 < hamidkag> ok
15:30 < hamidkag> wait
15:31 < hamidkag> #### # This specifies where and in which order Teeworlds looks # for its data (sounds, skins, ...). The search goes top # down which means the first path has the highest priority. # Furthermore the top entry also defines the save path where # all data (settings.cfg, screenshots, ...) are stored. # There are 3 special paths available: #	$USERDIR #	- ~/.appname on UNIX based systems #	- ~/Library/Applications Support/appname on Mac OS X #	- %APPDATA%/Appname on
15:31 < hamidkag> i put it in forum

15:40 < laxa_work> then save and relaunch
15:40 < hamidkag> ooommm

16:29 < laxa_work> In fact no
16:29 < laxa_work> I don't have iCTF
16:29 < Savander> :X
16:29 < laxa_work> I have iCTF*
16:29 < Savander> but
16:29 < Savander> what a diff?
16:30 < laxa_work> you can use stop/go
16:30 <@deen> iCTF* is made by the guy who does aimbots
16:30 < laxa_work> and some other differences
16:30 < Savander> i can just setup only iCTF and it should be work?
16:30 < Savander> meg
16:30 < Savander> meh :(
16:30 < Savander> i need simple iCTF
16:30 < Savander> :( give me! !:PP :D
16:30 < Savander> i can't found
16:30 < Savander> meh
16:30 < laxa_work> you'll find it on teeworlds official forum
16:30 <@deen> https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds.git
16:30 <@deen> I use this, branch tw-plus
16:30 < Savander> not works
16:30 < Savander> its for 0.7
16:30 < Savander> im tested
16:31 <@deen> Savander: the one by teetime?
16:31 < Savander> yes
16:31 < Savander> https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/tw-plus
16:31 < Savander> here, its the same
16:31 <@deen> Nope, it works with 0.6
16:31 < Savander> i guess
16:31 < Savander> so, why my bam
16:31 < Savander> compiled it to 0.7?:O
16:31 <@deen> maybe you're on the wrong branch or something
16:31 < Savander> no
16:32 <@deen> but i have it running on ddnet servers
16:32 < Savander> what the fuck
16:32 < Savander> :D
16:32 < Savander> ok, again git clone
16:32 < Savander> and set branch
16:32 < Savander> maybe it should works
16:32 < Teetime> tw+ should be for 0.6 i didn't ported it for 0.7
16:32 < Savander> wow, weird
16:32 <@deen> Teetime: ah, you're here^^
16:32 < Savander> hahha
16:32 < Savander> :D
16:33 < Teetime> yep, i've heard a weird highlight-sound :p
16:34 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/sIoimrIi7848
16:34 < Savander> and i can't found it
16:34 < Savander> on serverlist
16:34 < Savander> meh? what's going on?
16:34 < Savander> ;D
16:35 < laxa_work> You can make a vanilla server a iCTF one I think
16:35 < laxa_work> Using the tune laser_damage or something
16:35 <@deen> Savander: maybe you run the wrong file? it's called tw+_srv
16:36 < Savander> no way
16:36 < Savander> ../bam/bam server_release
16:36 < laxa_work> https://github.com/ProPudding/teeworlds/tree/Instagib
16:36 < Savander> [] link teeworlds_srv
16:36 < Savander> so idk
16:36 < Savander> :/
16:37 <@deen> Savander: you're in the wrong repo i guess
16:37 < Savander> 100 % correct
16:37 < Savander> but, please
16:37 < Savander> remind me/./ how to
16:37 < Savander> delete folder with files in?
16:37 <@deen> rm -r
16:37 < Savander> ah
16:38 < Savander> thanks
16:45 < laxa_work> Savander: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7138
16:46 < laxa_work> Savander: you can run it, without any feature as iCTF
16:46 < laxa_work> deen: botox is making aimbot ? I think you are talking about someone else
16:46 <@deen> no
16:46 <@deen> botox makes aimbots
16:46 <@deen> and many other bots
16:46 <@deen> he also made the server status at ddnet.tw/status though, so i shouldn't complain^^
16:47 <@deen> i just trusted TT more and the mod runs fine ever since, with only a few changes
16:49 < laxa_work> TT ?
16:49 < Savander> still no works deen 
16:49 <@deen> laxa_work: teetime
16:49 < Savander> steps what i do:
16:49 < Savander> git clone https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds.git
16:49 < Savander> cd teeworlds
16:49 < Savander> git checkout -b tw-plus
16:50 < Savander> ../bam/bam server_release
16:50 < Savander> not works
16:50 < Savander> ;D
16:50 < Savander> still teeworlds_srv and for 0.7
16:50 < Savander> :x
16:50 < laxa_work> try the link I sent you Savander.
16:50 < Savander> laxa_work: 
16:50 < Savander> the best solution
16:50 < Savander> sv_antibot = 1, 0, 1 // Automaticly ban players with [bot] in name
16:50 < Savander> XDD
16:51 < laxa_work> nice
16:51 < Savander> in this mode
16:51 < Savander> (your)
16:51 < Savander> but i want iCTF+!
16:51 < Savander> xD
16:51 < laxa_work> iCTF+ ?
16:51 <@deen> oops, teeworlds_server is the right name i guess
