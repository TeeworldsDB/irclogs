00:00 <@deen> ok, i checked m_Width, m_Height and actual size and they match perfectly
00:01 <@deen> and it still crashed with GetIndex
00:01 < Henningstone> that's what's surprising me aswell
00:04 <@deen> GetIndex() might just be wrong?
00:04 <@deen> it's only used rarely in the code
00:04 < Henningstone> but it doesn't crash on all maps, what it might be doing if it was wrong
00:04 <@heinrich5991> no
00:04 <@heinrich5991> this is c++
00:05 <@heinrich5991> you can't rely on crashes
00:05 < Henningstone> true
00:05 <@deen> could just read random memory
00:05 <@heinrich5991> or in weird cases be optimized out
00:06 < Henningstone> do you know some really big maps by heart? ^-^
00:07 <@deen> I tried with Kobra 4 and it crashed
00:07 < Henningstone> Oh that's pretty interesting, for me Kobra 4 is totally ok
00:08 < Henningstone> "Fly to the Moon" and "Chillerdragores7" for example are crashing for me
00:08 <@deen> oh wait
00:08 <@deen> my bad^^
00:09 <@deen> nope, no crash for me
00:09 <@deen> i just tried to access m_pTiles before it was initialized^^
00:09 <@deen> anyway, have you made changes to your code?
00:10 < Henningstone> no, except for calling the GetIndex thingy
00:10 <@deen> where do you call it?
00:10 <@deen> and what platform are you on?
00:10 <@deen> for me everything seems fine now
00:11 < Henningstone> I'm on linux 64 bit and I'm calling it after entering the game
00:11 <@deen> on Fly to the Moon: game layer size: 1000 x 1000
00:11 <@deen> check with gdb if m_pTiles is NULL
00:11 <@deen> that's what I had, maybe you call it too early and it's uninitialized somehow
00:11 <@deen> or pointing to the last map's m_pTiles
00:12 < Henningstone> it isn't, definitely. I also did for loops, increasing the x and y values I've checked for. Smaller values were ok
00:12 <@deen> on Fly to the Moon: game layer size: 1000 x 1000, 4 bytes per CTile entry, total returned size from CDaataFileReader uncompress: 4000000
00:12 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: have you chekced with a debugger?
00:13 <@deen> yeah, run with gdb
00:13 <@deen> bam debug
00:13 <@heinrich5991> because otherwise some weird optimization stuff might mess with you
00:13 < Henningstone> I always run in debug mode when coding :)
00:14 <@heinrich5991> in gdb?
00:14 <@deen> do you get the problem in client or server btw?
00:14 < Henningstone> gdb with "nemiver" as graphical frontend
00:14 <@deen> i tested server only
00:14 < Henningstone> ah, tested client only
00:16 <@deen> layer totally has the right size in client as well
00:16 <@deen> and GetIndex works with last element
00:16 <@deen> can you share your exact changes?
00:16 < Henningstone> really strange.. wait, I'll try something
00:22 < Henningstone> oups. I was just messing around with the position where to put the GetIndex, and while doing that I realized that I forgot another one at another position from previous tests, and that one was always crashing it. Now, when putting the my check into CGameClient::OnEnterGame() everything is fine :3
00:23 <@deen> good
00:24 < Henningstone> At the end it was my own fault, thanks very much for your effort!
00:25 <@deen> yeah, i couldn't find anything strange, except that I made a similar mistake as you did :P
00:38 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: debuggers :)
00:40 < Henningstone> yes, a very useful thing :) ...if you use it :S
01:16 < runner> hello
01:18 < runner> I'm running an ubuntu flavour and since updating to DDNet client 10.0.1 can't run it anymore for some reason. The same is the case when downloading 10.0.1. 9.3.1 however runs flawlessly.
01:19 <@deen> runner: hi
01:19 < runner> hi deen
01:20 <@deen> we updated to SDL2 so you need to install SDL2 using sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
01:20 < runner> Thank you. installing libsdl2-2.0 now.
01:21 < runner> Wonderful. It's running. Thanks a lot!
01:21 <@deen> we should probably write that down somewhere
01:21 <@deen> where would you have seen a note about that?
01:21 <@deen> on http://ddnet.tw/ , in client news or somewhere else?
01:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vwQ93
01:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master dee629a def: SDL2 in README
01:23 < runner> IIRC, in the news it said something about SDL2, but I didn't know I have to update it on the OS side. To be frank, I don't even know what SDL2 is.
01:23 <@deen> yeah, i understand
01:26 < runner> ah, are you asking where I'd have noticed that most likely? I think in the client news, highlighted in red.
01:26 <@deen> hm, yeah
01:26 <@deen> don't have color highlighting there, but thanks
