00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > "The technologies required for long operations of 100 million- plasma are the key to the realization of fusion energy, and the KSTAR's success in maintaining the high-temperature plasma for 20 seconds will be an important turning point in the race for securing the technologies for the long high-performance plasma operation, a critical component of a commercial nuclear fusion reactor in the future."

00:09 <+ChillerDragon> 100 million degrees sounds spooky ngl
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its held by electromagnetic force
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it doesnt touch anything
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if politicians didnt cut funding every year due to oil and electricity companies buying them we would have clean fusion energy already probs
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://i.imgur.com/3vYLQmm.png
00:19 <+ChillerDragon> maybe oil and electricity companys should buy fusion energy instead of politicians :troll:
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> my ddnet client freezes sometimes
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> and its so fucking stupid when im far on a map
00:21 <+ChillerDragon> why dont u freeze your client at spawn then instead of doing it far in the map?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @WAV if u got an intel, view #bugs we just talked about it
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> intel gpu or cpu?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gpu
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> nah
00:21 <+ChillerDragon> intel gpu lul
00:21 <+ChillerDragon> who has that did they even rls yet
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what else do u have then @WAV ?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> nvidia
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: integrated one
00:22 <+ChillerDragon> ah ok fair
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @WAV laptop?
00:22 <+ChillerDragon> yea
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> maybe ddnet even runs on my intel cpu
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> idk
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> very probably
00:22 <+ChillerDragon> very probably
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i'm gonna look
00:22 <+ChillerDragon> is that english xd?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can rightclikc the ddnet.exe and select the graphics processor @WAV
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it not?
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> seems like it is
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> sounds weird to me
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> i woud say "probably" or "very likley" idk
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but what if its almost certain
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then its very probably xd
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> lul
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> it sounds so wrong idk
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tbh i also dont care, non native speakers always have the excuse to be non native speakers xd
00:24 <+ChillerDragon> seems like i understand "probably" too much like "maybe" and not enough like "probalistic" or something like that
00:24 <+ChillerDragon> sure
00:24 <+ChillerDragon> but i want to learn new phrases like "very probably" :D
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i see it more mathematically: probability
00:24 <+ChillerDragon> yea
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> then it makes total sense
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> very probable
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> whats the ddnet exe called?
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> wat xd
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet.exe
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @WAV DDNet.exe xd
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> or DDNet.exe
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> oh
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u on steam u can browse local files
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then u find it
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> pgrep DDNet
00:25 <+ChillerDragon> :p
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else u can also download a zip version of the client
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-15.2.4-win64.zip
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rg
00:26 <+ChillerDragon> ?xd
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rg > ur grep
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>
00:27 <+ChillerDragon> rg doesnt replace pgrep i think
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤­
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Windows key -> ksysguard -> search the executable xd
00:28 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608938707.png
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a emoji
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
00:28 <+ChillerDragon> why isnt it ? or any other shit then
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true i guess
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt see the p
00:28 <+ChillerDragon> a few days ago i found about ngrep
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> not network grepping :D
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> so there is ripgrep egrep ngrep lul
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> and pgrep
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ripgrep is the fastest
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> mimimi
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> its not preinstalled tho
00:29 <+ChillerDragon> preinstalled > all
00:30 <+ChillerDragon> thats why bash is the best lanugage :D
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
00:30 <+ChillerDragon> and microsft edge browser
00:30 <+ChillerDragon> :D
00:30 <+ChillerDragon> defaults rule
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wow i was on windows 2 weaks ago, man thats annoying
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it opens edge in fullscreen and annoys u
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why dont we have laws against such spam xd
00:34 <+ChillerDragon> xd
00:34 <+ChillerDragon> dont we have laws against windows?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> idk, but did nobody else had it after the windows update?
00:34 <+ChillerDragon> i remember vaguely to have heard somehwere that windows 10 is illegal
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was really aggressive
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u hear lot of things
00:35 <+ChillerDragon> xd
00:35 <+ChillerDragon> regarding gdpr and data protection whatevery
00:35 <+ChillerDragon> win10 phoning home too much
00:35 <+ChillerDragon> but idk
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ddnet is not detected by nvidia, how do fix that?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont know exactly but it has nvidia settings and there is an option for opengl applications
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://i.imgur.com/b4WHqOK.png
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> smth like this
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> but ddnet is literally not on the list
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah u just need to set nvidia to opengl globally
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like in the image the first entry
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> how do i do that?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if u got the nvidia driver installed there should be an icon bottom right
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Hey guys, question. If I were to do a graphics pack that needed some support from developers is there any chance that might happen? 
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I think it would be cool if we made the graphics reflect the actual ddrace gameplay like for example having an actual frozen tee when they get frozen instead of the ninja skin and maybe a revamp of the pistol so that it looks like a pointer instead of a gun. Stuff like that.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i cant tell if the nvidia card doesnt perform worse than the intel card
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i just want my game to not freeze anymore
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can install newest intel driver @WAV
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @WAV what is ur cpu name?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can see it in the taskmanager

00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ShaneR we had some frozen skins already,but people didn't like it i think
00:49 <+ChillerDragon> @ShaneR https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2173#issuecomment-508823471 Oy is on ur side :D
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> @deen interesting, do you still have them?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I could just draw up some suggestions and see what the response is like.
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @ShaneR I think he is referring to this https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/teeworlds/blob/ddrace07/datasrc/freeze.png
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I had a play around with it. I think the main thing to get the graphic to make sense is to lose the sword.
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> 
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> The idea of using an overlay like ice or whatever rather than a separate skin has the benefit that you can see which tee is which by skin when they're frozen which is handy sometimes especially for players who play without name-tags but it might be tricky to get that to look good.
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> 
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I drew a simple one here and removed the sword and also the feet to give a visual cue that the tee can't walk. I also got rid of the stars graphic counter as the stars symbolise damage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueeB6hWxIo&feature=youtu.be

04:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i dont really get this one

04:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2
04:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> wow realy nice, i loved it the second i saw this
04:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> another (benefit?) of removing the feet is that they don't move when a frozen tee is dragged.
04:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @ShaneR i love this a lot, would LOVE if it was implemented
04:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> i'll send you the files anyway so you can play around with it.
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> thx
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Also i just noticed a flaw about the no-feet thing. can't see if frozen tee has dj or not.
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Rarely ever considered if a frozen tee had a double jump or not. But it is sometimes relevant on the more technical maps these days...
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> what sane person follows 3.6k ppl on github? is this a follow bot to earn attention like on other social media sites? xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608972122.png
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut what do you mean by warning? You only get the backtrace by gdb when the server crashes so yea it is a crash. So the whole thing is always a crash. Yould consider dbg_assert a warning but yea. Or do you mean a specific part of the backtrace?
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> where do u always get there articles?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a man of resources
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> following some subreddits, hackernews and other places
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://devurls.com/
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is also good
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that article shows that it rly is like coding
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dna stuff
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly interesting
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> ye
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ShaneR looks good to me. also makes sense that you can't move when you have no feet
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> a few people mentioned they didn't like the no feet thing. i'm on the fence about it. one thing that's bad about not having the feet is that we can't see if a frozen tee has dj or not. @deen
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, right
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's important information, shouldn't lose it :/
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we could have a vote about using an ice block to display freezing
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would need a good proof of concept first, though
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What ShaneR proposed was more minimal, removing the sword
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is true, yet I think it's more obvious what happens if you're actually frozen ðŸ™‚
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> what do you mean heinrich?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have never played this game before, it's non-obvious that ninja means that you can't move
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, we actually have multiple bad ratings on Steam with people complaining that their game got "stuck", but they were just frozen and no one was around to help them
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah, that was my initial thought too.
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> that's kind of the strange thing about teeworlds/ddrace. the graphics are for the initial game but the mod is the more popular game.
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> the pistol isn't really a gun but just used as a pointer. the damage stars aren't really damage but counters,...
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> what coding language is teeworlds written in?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C++
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> i don't know it. i know some java and C#, i wonder if it would be hard to understand some of the codebase.
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's unfortunately not documented at all
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Wasn't there a pic of a tee with an Ice block around it, I could swear I saw it before
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> i thought an animation similar to this powerup from crash bash might have been a cool alternate animation for the hammer in ddrace. i like that it clearly shows the radius and range of the impact: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpC7Z4jpLKA
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ShaneR Ravie and the guy with cyrillic name I can't type are working on fixing the damage indicators for ddnet
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah timakro referred to one above. imo it's hard to get something like that to look good.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> No I mean a better one
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> oh
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, someone else developed one too
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This one? https://ddnet.tw/skins/index.php?search=frozen
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/367283/85317906-71401600-b4bf-11ea-97c1-50dadfef1cfd.gif
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> BTW that guy even impl it
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> we might also print a big message for new clients when getting frozen the first few times on what is going on and how to kill
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen dunno, I think it looked much better, but closer to your than the gif one
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> that's an interesting idea.
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> I think the "kill" in the menu is combating the reconnection of nubs to avoid freeze but now its bad UX and nobody can inform them in chat :/
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> yikes idk making things easy to understand is hard
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> i tried replacing the stars with dots, that looked kinda neat i thought for the counter. i think it is handy to have that visible 3 2 1 countdown for freeze.
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> @deen imo this skin looks a bit unteeish dont u think
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> so far i'm not too impressed with the graphical style of actual frozen tees. i tried making some of my own but didn't like those either. that's only my personal subjective opinion though.
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> Yea I think we should not rush the choice of a frozen graphic that will be displayed all over the screen if we want acceptance of users
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Ditching the katana for frozen tees is something people seem to agree on.
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> yea sounds suddle enough
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> current client version works fine on android btw, with some minor tweaks to the GL backend
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792354814176133150/unknown.png

12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chinese player will be glad
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fancy!
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie ? would they want to play on smartphones? ^^
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> some of them already did
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> on older version
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is the android client distributed as closed src binary
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis: i think some of mobile players passed some map with that awful control scheme
12:46 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki any advice on how to display current scope like function name in vim status bar?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can probs do it if u have a LSP
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> wats LSP
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> language server protocol
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> ?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and for status bar i use lightline
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well coc is a plugin for installing lsps
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> u have sume screen?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792358155484004373/unknown.png
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what u want me to show
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u want to see function name
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608983169.png
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> down here i would like to see func name
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> like CCharacter::Reset() or whatever ur in rn
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792358411797790720/unknown.png
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here u can see how to use a function
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with lightline
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will have to figure out how to get that info urself
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz idk how
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> hm coc seems like bloat tbh
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coc is awesome
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur bloated
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> oof
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> my vimrc is not tooo bloated
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> the only bloat i have is the ymc language thingy
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ymc is slow bloat
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> i need it for reading assembly code
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> there is probably bad assembly function support anyways
12:52 <+ChillerDragon> i guess ima try to write a smol vim function
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> yo asm haxx0rs u know what is stored in rdx?
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> i mean i know the value is 0x0 but i wonder which pointer in the c++ line it belongs to
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª ooooh, that looks great. mouse plugged in? Also, another OnePlus user ðŸ˜„
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in that case i used my finger, SDL has fake mouse event for tochscreens, but i often use scrcpy to mirror the android screen, which is pretty nice ðŸ˜„
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will you make a PR for working Android version?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> working yes, but not anything android specific
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like we had before
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, that's fine
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you can connect a mouse and keyboard using bluetooth/usb and play that's already good enough
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, maybe we should make an easy chat + spectating mode
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not soimportant
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> compiling everything was easy except for opusfile xD it always fails, and i just trigger the make command a few times and then it magically works xD
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ouch
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe `make -j1` helps
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i thinik its the opposite
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it only works when using multicores bcs it then doesnt do the right order of execution
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well maybe they already fixed it, i tested it a few months ago and then lost interest
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's not @mind I think but another one, probably without Discord
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @mind good to know u know chinese ðŸ˜›
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Texas.C maybe one of the minds has to rename, otherwise it's a bit confusing ðŸ˜„
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> problem solved
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my mobile gets around 288 with GLES 3, which is the equivalent to OpenGL 3.3
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792421301239021568/unknown.png
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> @deen i have to restart my client after using events 0 ?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ok
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> nvm
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> events 0 and restart game work
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> lmao internal compiler error: Segmentation fault
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> just arch things :D
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you can reproduce that check if it's reported upstream in GCC already
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> arch just uses the upstream compilers, no patches applied
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> i assume restarting my machine fixes is doubt there is an real error
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> funny tho
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> OnePlus is great
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> yea as expected reboot helps sometimes things break when updating arch without reboot
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Can i post suggestions here?
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> they might get lost
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> try it on github.com/ddnet/ddnet
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Its going to be a mess
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Idk how that shit workd
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @den pa you can post suggestions here. no guarantee that they don't accidentally get lost
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Oksy ty
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X86_calling_conventions&oldid=995616309#System_V_AMD64_ABI
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> useful article, I always use it when reading assembly
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I hope that I'll have it in memory at some point
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I should put it into an anki deck
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Here I thought of "Skin sets" so you could save skins/color combination without needing to write them down. Also can remove and add new sets
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792436582808158208/image0.png
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just add 0.7 skin system
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> why is 0.7 skin not a thing yet.
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :realsmiley:
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong somebody redoes 0.7 skins, so the feets arent soo off and they arent bigger than 0.6 ys
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong somebody redoes 0.7 skins, so the feets arent soo off and they arent bigger than 0.6 xd
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 0.7 skin system with 0.6 skins
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we'll lose so many skins with that upgrade, who will bother chopping up the hundreds of skins into pieces?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not automatically?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. dont use all features oof 0.7 on force
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Why not keep both..
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because computer vision isn't magic? How can we decide what is a pattern, what is the body, etc?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shoving it all into body and calling it a day is such a meh solution, we might aswell stick to one piece skins
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 0.6 skins are also split
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> We can keep both format. We are probably need a exmsg for 0.7 skins on 0.6 while skinnames are still in snapshots.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> We can keep both format. We probably need a exmsg for 0.7 skins on 0.6 while skinnames are still in snapshots.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, 0.7 skins look weird, @louis pls sent ur rant
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> 0.6 skins are still there in snaps so we don't actually have a reason to nuke it before we fully moved to 0.7
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 skins split the decoration from the body
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 0.7 doesnt color outlines, which is bad xd
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the markings from the body
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> As long as people can choose which version they go with. 0.7 skin can keep being "ugly"
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets say it like this: 0.7 skin system: awesome
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 0.7's implementation of 0.7 skin system: BAD
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 skin system also makes it rather difficult to share skins
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oy said he want a way to pack images into json
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So you can just send a full skin to someone with custom images packed in
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all in all sharing assets between skins is a nice "feature" that is desirable to programmers and completely undesirable for users
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 you are right, but i think decoration could be neutralized for a few 0.6 skins and then its basically the same ðŸ˜„
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But like if we are keeping 0.6 skins
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure it can be but it's work that's not really getting us much benefit at all
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Why bother making the 0.7 portable right nkw
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Why bother making the 0.7 portable right now
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf 0.7 skins feet lopsided delete
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @louis shadow patch the skin code in robyt3's code. Oy will merge.
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> It's a joke in case it wasn't obvious
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i actually remember you posting this callcing convetion article already but i had a hard time getting information out of it :/
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pls mean it serious, so 0.7 is fixed xd
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but like it wasn't that obvious to me. I can't really see any problems other than ye it looks different.
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> And I had to admit louis maybe have the most reasonable argument for "fixing" it. But every time someone else mentioned "0.7 skin bad" they don't even agree on a common issue. Most likely they just don't like them different from 0.6 blurrier skins.
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I think vanilla heard too much about it so they just tune out of it.
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :realsmiley:
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Did louis made a proper issue for the skin thing
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think cow made a pr on it but i dont even know what happened to it
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Can't find it
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> There is a issue arguing about offsetting the feet but it is halted because there is no better way to flip the position depends on which way it is facing.
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: maybe a animation redesign can push it
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> sharing skins is not that needed when you have virtually endless customization built right in, and no need for any graphics skills to make your "own" skin
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Ye. That too. But the current options are quite limited I feel
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Plus this hasn't been decided yet https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2795
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> imo that isn't a very good solution
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> on some skins it works well but on others it's straight up weird, and we already have marking combinations that are weird :p
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I was thinking providing round versions and extended versions for each decor. And move the ear shadow onto the shadow layer instead of the color layer.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Or just update them accordingly
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean this is a nice thing to have, but doesn't solve marking-body compatibility on its own
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> It is a step forward at least. If we merge this and don't change any textures nothing is affected
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Masking the pattern is almost as good as it gets
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> And we can add more options that utilize this as we go
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But I'm still for providing extended version of some of the existing markings
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> While keeping the old one
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the best solution would be to still manually blacklist combinations that simply don't work well no matter what
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I mean if someone like ugly skins then let them use it lol
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet client has also ugly skins in it
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> You can't blacklist stupid color combination too
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I'm pretty sure it at least enables the gfx team to come up with new designs
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's a difference between ugly and straight up buggy looking
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and there is already a limit on colors so you don't make black tees or invisible eyes (things that look buggy)
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk:
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol the skins were even more messed up ebfore
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2651
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> feet still bad tho
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but it should be easy to fix
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But we already have buggy skins that doesn't cover some of the furs
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> We trade one buggy situation for another for more options.
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Also did vanilla know that hook is being cut off in game.png
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> The tip is out of the sprite
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I noticed that too a while ago
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not in game but rather on the sprite
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vanilla still suffers from incorrect sprite texture scaling
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but honestly hook rendering is messed up so bad
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only ddnet fixed it recently
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Let's compile a mega issue for gfx stuff
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes please
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if blurry skin/weapon rendering got fixed in ddnet then it should be possible in vanilla too, it's been bothering me for years
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Can it be done without gl3
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, by splitting the texture parts into individual textures
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet also does this to support higher resolutions
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> What
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and smaller ðŸ˜„
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. game.png
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I know.
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> split everything into smaller textures
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But like
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Isn't atlas an optimization thing
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt really change performance, bcs the textures arent bigger
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its the same VRAM usage
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> What about the so called drawcalls
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if teeworlds would batch vertices u might improve performance by not splitting textures
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but teeworlds doesnt do it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> You need to switch texture a lot for gl1 I think?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> On the cpu side
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the case, if it would split everything anyway, also there are other parts where u could save drawcalls for these correctness things
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont see another idea for GL 1.x support
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ™ƒ
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with shaders u can access textures by int, instead of floats
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so the actual pixel
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I guess we'll wait for radix for the gl overhaul
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Is glTexSubImage2D related
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its only inside the fragment shader
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imagine it like this
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ...
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ...
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ...
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a 3x3 texture
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you want to sample ONLY the mid pixel, u'd need to hit EXACTLY the mid of the pixel, else linear interpolation is rendering stuff from the pixels around it
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> <a:walkbert:688640120349655104>
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u could do that by removing the sub pixel on both sides, when creating the texture coordinates, but that requires to know ALL image texture sizes
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs else u add or remove too much
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also it scales the image
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so the best is to make that single pixel one texture and tell the driver to clamp the texture coordinates
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then it never goes outside the bounds
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is a emoticons.png
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792451522424078336/test.png
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 4x4 pixels
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it works in ddnet
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> What if the there are nothing at the edge of adjacent sprites.
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk:
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Which it normally doesn't.
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792451522424078336/test.png`
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie it either repeats or clamps it correctly but only for sprites that are on the edges ðŸ˜„
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the mid sprites still look wrong then
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But with how much empty space game.png currently has. Sampling outside the sprite just hits transparent pixels I imagine
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but there is another problem
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mipmaps and resolution of game.png
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u want it to be accurate, u cannot just randomly sample
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also like the idea, that the graphic designer sees exactly on the screen what he draw
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> If teeworlds camera doesn't zoom ever and resolution can't be changed on the fly. Can we down sample them programmatically during load
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u know the mipmap of the driver
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well lets say, probably
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast u can assume it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but it still scales the output then
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs u remove subpixels
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that are else used in linear interpolation
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> What if we don't use mipmap just downsample the main texture. At least for low res?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that is mipmapping xd
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: oh
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong u know the mipmap u also know the texture size
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> mipmap doesn't get load in its entirety?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as said, even if u know all parameters u cannot 100% fix it aslong you use linear interpolation
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk:
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u always remove half pixels
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs u have to hit the center of the pixel
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so going even 0.0001 to the left linear interpolates from pixels around it
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Just do something for make it better for gl1 for the time being.
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk:
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd suggest not to overoptimize things, i wouldn't even add it for GL 3.3, bcs that 5-6 more rendercalls arent worth it
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the driver works async anyway so its only a CPU bottleneck mostly
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª can you, in some way, tell the GPU that it must not cross the tiles border when interpolating?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Can we get a number like IDs that shows how strong someone is?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 with shaders u can do almost anything
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Like the strongest tee on server gets number 64, the weakest number 1
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And it changes whenever people kill or /spec
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 and for tile rendering as in teeworlds we use 2D_array textures
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but they only work if u have images of the same size
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so there is a way, but only if it is tiles
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, and 2d array textures are OpenGL 3.0 core ðŸ˜„
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so newer than the oldest we support
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 3d textures as 0.7 uses them dont have mipmaps
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you explain what that means?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know mipmaps are somehow textures in reduced scale
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the same meta-texture
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we support 2d textures for gl 1.x, 3d textures for 2.0, and 2d textures for 2.1 if extension is available, else 2d array textures xD
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, best is u open multimap in 0.7 editor and zoom out @heinrich5991
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then you get the idea
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just grabs a single pixel of each tile in the end?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead of averaging
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> different zoom levels, or resolutions want might interpolate OVER a pixel
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the screen size is too small
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> want/might?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> might
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, I see
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751510260014907412/screenshot_2020-09-04_20-33-24.png
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is a good example
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but kinda random I guess?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is not rescaled kill borders
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I see
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is actuall just that it skipped the pixels to look like the image in big xD
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that effect had a name ^^
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> found it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> what if I calculate half a texel and move uv half a texel
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes thats the way to hit the center
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that also scales the whole image by exactly 1 pixel
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> left and right half texel ðŸ˜„
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ™ƒ
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u use the current GL 3.3 renderer and the old one, you'll see it ðŸ˜„
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Gl stupid
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> At least moving uv is a option in gl1 I think
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah the uv coords are streamed the whole time
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can change them on fly
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: it's like almost 3am now
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> :zzzz:
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I'll probably forget what I'm thinking of tomorrow
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :realsmiley:
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Eitherway good night I guess
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gn8
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :zzzz:
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night ðŸ™‚
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if we remove weak u wont need it :troll:
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> remove weak
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> weak cant be removed because its necessary for bunch of physics
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> remove weak
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> remove strong
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> remove plsplsplslol
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> hi, how can I use scripts/dmg.py correctly? im not that familiar with the required tools
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @toast.tw it's only meant to be used via cmake. try calling `cmake --build <BUILDDIR> --target package_dmg`
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you trying to cross-compile or are you on macOS?
22:13 <+ChillerDragon> @toast.tw toast bimst dus?
22:13 <+ChillerDragon> if its da real toast he might be on mac
22:14 <+ChillerDragon> didnt know toast alive
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon english only nobo
22:18 <+ChillerDragon> oof
22:18 <+ChillerDragon> lern german slang
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ne
22:18 <+ChillerDragon> good
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta check if i have msgs in irc
22:19 <+Ryozuki> i should open this more often
22:21 <+ChillerDragon> and did somebody slide in ur irc dms? :D
22:21 <+Ryozuki> no sadly
22:21 <+Ryozuki> im alone in this world
22:21 <+ChillerDragon> :c
22:21 <+ChillerDragon> being active on irc is worth it
22:21 <+Ryozuki> bitcoin is at 26k $

22:22 <+ChillerDragon> no
22:22 <+ChillerDragon> almost
22:22 <+ChillerDragon> xd
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> what is hentai

22:23 <+ChillerDragon> gotta join to find out
22:23 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon maim > openshot
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> kdenlive > openshot
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> maim is a screenshot tool lul isnt it
22:23 <+Ryozuki> bindsym --release Print exec maim -s --format=png /dev/stdout | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i
22:23 <+Ryozuki> bindsym --release $mod+o exec maim -i $(xdotool getactivewindow) --format=png /dev/stdout | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i
22:23 <+Ryozuki> i use this on i3
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> openshot is a video editor
22:23 <+Ryozuki> oh
22:23 <+Ryozuki> forgot
22:23 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon olive > openshot
22:23 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i made my last video with olive
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure
22:23 <+Ryozuki> it works rly well
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> kdenlive > all tho
22:24 <+Ryozuki> idk
22:24 <+Ryozuki> i found olive cuz u i think
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> i tested openshot and olive
22:24 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/olive-editor/olive
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> ye
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> was unusable tbh
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> kdenlive sooo good
22:24 <+Ryozuki> GPL license
22:24 <+Ryozuki> love it
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> before i found kdenlive i had editiing crisis
22:25 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon any other cool free software u know?
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> i even thought ill use blender lmao
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> for wat?
22:25 <+Ryozuki> i cant figure out how to edit in blender properly
22:25 <+Ryozuki> idk
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> blender is actually nice but the video editor is hard
22:25 <+Ryozuki> idk how to add a text on a video on blender
22:25 <+Ryozuki> it shouldnt be that hard xd
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> xd
22:26 <+Ryozuki> blender is good for what its good
22:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes gamedev
22:26 <+Ryozuki> and i guess if u master its scripting u can be god
22:26 <+ChillerDragon> its best game engine lmao
22:26 <+Ryozuki> nah
22:26 <+ChillerDragon> xxd
22:26 <+Ryozuki> https://amethyst.rs/ this will be the best game engine
22:26 <+Ryozuki> just give it time
22:27 <+ChillerDragon> i want to hire @Patiga to build tw demo to blender project converter
22:27 <+Ryozuki> i think that would be too much for blender
22:27 <+ChillerDragon> there is not too much
22:27 <+Ryozuki> unless u optimize it i guess
22:27 <+ChillerDragon> if ur rich as me 
22:27 <+ChillerDragon> i can flex my render farm points
22:27 <+Ryozuki> xd
22:28 <+ChillerDragon> i render avengers in 20 mins
22:28 <+Ryozuki> doubt
22:29 <+Ryozuki> https://djharper.dev/post/2020/12/26/executable-pngs/
22:29 <+Ryozuki> cool
22:29 <+ChillerDragon> dfq
22:29 <+ChillerDragon> xd
22:29 <+Ryozuki> tldr: u hide ur program in a image with steganography
22:30 <+Ryozuki> cool idea
22:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609018028.png
22:30 <+ChillerDragon> stonks
22:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609018079.png
22:31 <+ChillerDragon> better than bitcoin mining xd
22:32 <+Ryozuki> i want to find a game that supports mods in rust
22:32 <+ChillerDragon> did u try...
22:32 <+ChillerDragon> rust
22:32 <+Ryozuki> modding games is the most fun way to improve
22:32 <+ChillerDragon> LMAO
22:33 <+Ryozuki> i learned c# in 2015-6 making tshock plugins
22:33 <+Ryozuki> fun
22:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/rusty_3d_game
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki: you could try some game/program/ with a modding C API
22:33 <+Ryozuki> :o
22:33 <+Ryozuki> do u know any?
22:34 <+Ryozuki> most games use lua or java
22:34 <+Ryozuki> and i rly dislike lua
22:34 <+ChillerDragon> java lul
22:34 <+Ryozuki> java - minecraft
22:34 <+ChillerDragon> lua is better than java
22:34 <+Ryozuki> xd
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was just a thought; wireshark supports a C API
22:34 <+Ryozuki> i would mod factorio if it wasnt just lua
22:34 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: just build the api
22:34 <+Ryozuki> factorio is such a great game
22:35 <+Ryozuki> https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/
22:35 <+Ryozuki> rip
22:35 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: just pr an rust api against https://github.com/chichilku/chichilku3/
22:35 <+ChillerDragon> :D
22:35 <+Ryozuki> u and ur weird games
22:35 <+ChillerDragon> its the good free software u wanted
22:36 <+ChillerDragon> ruby and rust communitys are similar i was told xd
22:36 <+Ryozuki> made in ruby
22:36 <+Ryozuki> dead language
22:36 <+Ryozuki> kek
22:36 <+ChillerDragon> ruby can call c and thus rust
22:36 <+ChillerDragon> well somehow every langugage can that i guess xd
22:37 <+ChillerDragon> also ruby isnt that ded
22:37 <+ChillerDragon> ruby on rails is used all over the web
22:37 <+ChillerDragon> github for example
22:37 <+Ryozuki> ruby is just that, ruby on rails
22:37 <+Ryozuki> and i think its getting less used
22:38 <+Ryozuki> i saw it on reddit
22:38 <+ChillerDragon> and metasploitframework
22:38 <+ChillerDragon> many exploits written in ruby
22:38 <+Ryozuki> they just released ruby 3.0
22:38 <+Ryozuki> and no one cares
22:39 <+ChillerDragon> i actually have a man pages tool writte in ruby in my path
22:39 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609018615.png
22:40 <+ChillerDragon> its nice i use it to document all the awesome shell features
22:40 <+Ryozuki> rust clap cli library can auto generate bash autocomplete
22:40 <+Ryozuki> dope
22:40 <+ChillerDragon> oh that sounds nice
22:40 <+Ryozuki> Auto-generated completion scripts (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish and PowerShell)
22:41 <+Ryozuki>     Using clap_generate
22:41 <+Ryozuki>     Even works through many multiple levels of subcommands
22:41 <+Ryozuki>     Works with options which only accept certain values
22:41 <+Ryozuki>     Works with subcommand aliases
22:41 <+ChillerDragon> nordvpn just calls it self to generate autocompletion xd
22:41 <+Ryozuki> <https://github.com/clap-rs/clap>
22:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609018724.png
22:41 <+ChillerDragon> its somehow cool
22:42 <+Ryozuki> is nordvpn legit
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> in line 3 it calls the nordvpn cli with the current arg and append --complete read the result into the autocomplete array
22:42 <+Ryozuki> i see it in ads of every streamer
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> they fame af xd
22:42 <+Ryozuki> i think proton vpn is better
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> idk i use nordvpn testvpn and tunnelbear
22:42 <+Ryozuki> from proton mail
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> never rly used them
22:42 <+Ryozuki> i used them once
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> tho they have a free one 
22:42 <+Ryozuki> free sucks
22:42 <+Ryozuki> u know it
22:42 <+ChillerDragon> i tried it once
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> free doesnt mean bad
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> i also used the kaspersky vpn sometimes to bypass ddnet bans lululu
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> also free
22:44 <+ChillerDragon> idk i pumped a shit load of bitcoin into my nordvpn account at some point idk what actually convinced me to use them but the support is nice and the linux cli is cool
22:44 <+ChillerDragon> i use tunnelbear on macOS and iOS and nordvpn on linux
22:45 <+ChillerDragon> its a bit cringe when yters make vpn ads and try to sell it randomly 
22:46 <+ChillerDragon> "i went to this sketchy site and entered all my credit card information. But thanks to my sponsor nordvpn i was safe and encrypted"
22:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
22:47 <+ChillerDragon> u pay for proton Ryozuki ?
22:47 <+ChillerDragon> i actually dont know if proton is a legit company
22:47 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i just did 1 month
22:47 <+Ryozuki> i dont need a vpn
22:47 <+Ryozuki> proton is p legit i would say
22:47 <+ChillerDragon> how does one confirm tho
22:48 <+Ryozuki> idk
22:48 <+ChillerDragon> yea
22:48 <+Ryozuki> asking a friend who tried it i guess
22:48 <+Ryozuki> xd
22:48 <+ChillerDragon> i am thinking about switching from chillerdragon@gmail.com to chillerdragon@protonmail.com but i feel safer at gmail tbh
22:48 <+Ryozuki> u dont have a domain?
22:49 <+Ryozuki> i use my domain
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> i do have
22:49 <+Ryozuki> looks professional
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> but
22:49 <+Ryozuki> unless ur domain name is weeb
22:49 <+Ryozuki> or
22:49 <+Ryozuki> idk
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer working over professional xd
22:49 <+Ryozuki> mine works perfect
22:49 <+Ryozuki> xd
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> u haxx0r
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://mail.zillyhuhn.com/
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> mi not
22:50 <+Ryozuki> i setup it with postfix + dovecot + mysql + opendkim
22:50 <+Ryozuki> i pass all the tests
22:50 <+ChillerDragon> sounda fragile tbh
22:50 <+Ryozuki> ?
22:50 <+Ryozuki> it havent broken yet
22:50 <+Ryozuki> and its not hard to setup if u know what ur doing
22:51 <+ChillerDragon> if u vps breaks?
22:51 <+ChillerDragon> data center might blow up
22:51 <+ChillerDragon> and u lose mail
22:51 <+ChillerDragon> i mean mail is something critical isnt it
22:51 <+ChillerDragon> missing a mail can be bad
22:51 <+Ryozuki> oh well
22:51 <+Ryozuki> it hasnt breaked yet
22:51 <+Ryozuki> idk
22:52 <+ChillerDragon> i hope it never will :)
22:52 <+Ryozuki> tho gandi.net, my domain manager has a mail system with 3 accounts
22:52 <+Ryozuki> i can always fallback to it
22:52 <+Ryozuki> if my vps goes shit
22:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea i guess
22:52 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u know u can setup more than u mail server
22:52 <+Ryozuki> and u setup more than 1 MX record with different priorities
22:52 <+ChillerDragon> hm
22:52 <+ChillerDragon> sounds hard
22:52 <+Ryozuki> pointing to different ips
22:53 <+Ryozuki> well wonder how google keeps its 100% mail
22:53 <+Ryozuki> but i dont think i lost mail yet
22:53 <+ChillerDragon> arctic mail vault
22:53 <+ChillerDragon> !!!
22:53 <+ChillerDragon> lul
22:54 <+ChillerDragon> such ddnet #developer
22:54 <+ChillerDragon> enough trashtalk sry bois
22:54 <+ChillerDragon> gn8
