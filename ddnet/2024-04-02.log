00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> my guess is it’s either been bootstrapped improperly or your usb stick has kicked the bucket
00:07 < bridge> <Ewan> did you write the iso directly with smth like rufus
00:08 < bridge> <Ewan> or did u make it manually
00:08 < bridge> <Ewan> did you make the live cd by burning the iso directly with smth like rufus
00:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> would 1gb be to less to run arch with i3wm ? - otherwise i'd just roll with Xubuntu ig
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> nvm i see it was resolved
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> why would you want a modern DE if you can’t run anything on it
00:15 < bridge> <teero777> with nothin running my system takes ~500mb
00:15 < bridge> <teero777> then discord takes another gig
00:15 < bridge> <teero777> and firefox
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> is discord at a gig now
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> last i recall it was like 600MB idle
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> or maybe lower
00:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> discord idle is taking 300mb atm
00:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> peaking at 450 while chatting
00:16 < bridge> <teero777> 780 for me
00:17 < bridge> <teero777> there are multiple processes opening when starting dc
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sort of
00:18 < bridge> <teero777> they take ~500, ~200 and another ~200
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> browser threads and prerequisite daemons
00:18 < bridge> <teero777> while chatting
00:18 < bridge> <teero777> i only use the discord app when i need to talk to smbdy tbh else i can just have it as another browser tab
00:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> it takes like nothing for me - i wonder why
00:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1224485634404520006/image.png?ex=661daa1d&is=660b351d&hm=312e8f584026de89f2b02be3aacf0bf16d0749ce3cbfec6057d6c4ffe4463d92&
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> fewer servers/channels/friends/cached media items
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> why are u running 32 bit
00:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> please dont ask me that - for i have no idea
00:30 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why the difference would be that dramatic anyway
00:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> wait is there a 64 bit version ? :D
00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s a 64 bit version like of every app
00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> what
00:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> there is a PTB version, but i dont find a stable release 64bit
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> unsure
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> not at computer
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s definitely a 64 bit version
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye i found that aswell, but nowhere is it stated as a stable release, the only thing i found was this:

00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> which was sep 2023
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> weird if you ask me tbh
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like you have to have explicitly downloaded a 32 bit version
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the “normal” version of discord should be 64 bit
00:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> for sure downloaded discord over their official website without any option to choose
01:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It is. But I check that mailbox only twice a year. I can’t check it right now. How did you get this email what spam :D
01:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Holy shit what are you doing here. I checked the discord and saw no messages so I thought you are all gone. Anyways my home server is offline because I’m not home until end of the year. When I come back I might turn it on again :D

16:02 < bridge> <archimede67> "ger kog servers" ?
16:03 < bridge> <archimede67> I don't think GER kog servers are hosted by Davide (who is the one providing hosting for GER10)
16:09 < bridge> <m_cosine> @chillerdragon.9502 @chillerdragon bring the lgl back
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> ger3 kog servers also use the ger10 verification afaik

20:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> that got annihilated
20:29 < bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> rip beyonce best mapper
21:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> is it normal that econ inputs/auth are like ~10 seconds delayed while the console outputs are instant?
21:12 < bridge> <imilchshake> using fifo pipe the inputs are instant. so i guess i could use fifo for instant inputs and econ for instant outputs?
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> No, econ is pretty much instant for me as well
21:39 < bridge> <savagenation3207> # Hot Teen & Onlyfans Leaks 🔞 🍑 https://discord.gg/esexx @everyone
21:49 < bridge> <imilchshake> hmm thats weird. Whats the 'default' way to connect to econ? Im using the rust implementation `tw-econ` right now, so that library/tool could be at fault?
21:49 < bridge> <imilchshake> 
21:49 < bridge> <imilchshake> hope its okay to post a video here: https://streamable.com/m870r4

21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> I simply use `telnet` on Windows
22:01 < bridge> <cyberFighter> yes
22:01 < bridge> <cyberFighter> whoever that was
22:01 < bridge> <cyberFighter> turn off design
22:01 < bridge> <cyberFighter> xd
22:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe the implementation buffers your messages too long, try with basic telnet command or use wireshark to see when the message is sent
22:04 < bridge> <imilchshake> oh jesus christ what ancient technologie ist that. Yeah with telenet its instant :D
22:04 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> oh i see
22:04 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> this might be a trap but idc
22:06 < bridge> <imilchshake> oh jesus christ what ancient technologie ist that. Yeah with telenet its instant :D
22:06 < bridge> <imilchshake> 
22:06 < bridge> <imilchshake> i initially tried ssh and gave up after that failed haha
22:06 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, econ is very basic, you probably shouldn't use it on an externally open port
22:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> yeah dont worry :D
22:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> thanks for you help! :)
22:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> yeah dont worry, will just do local calls :D
22:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> thanks for your help! :)
22:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like a issue you could report to https://github.com/gerdoe-jr/tw-econ if you like
22:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume the connection needs to be flushed when a newline character is encountered
22:34 < bridge> <justniceasalways> Discord game activity.
22:34 < bridge> <justniceasalways> When you leave a server it still shows the map you were playing in the discord game activity. I suggest two ways:
22:34 < bridge> <justniceasalways> 1)  Stop showing game activity
22:34 < bridge> <justniceasalways> 2) Add game activity for just playing ddnet(when you run the game it also doesnt show anything in discord).
