03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> question, i built ddnet from github with cmake (windows), but the "open project" button is greyed out
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> so i am unsure how to open it in visual studio
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799829422466662400/unknown.png
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you pressed "generate"?
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> yes, that is all that text in the bottom half
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> oh, one second, maybe i need to press it again
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> ok nevermind, i didnt press generate, only configure my bad 🙂
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (there's also the option of opening in visual studio directly, should you get stuck in your current path: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765)
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> awesome, thank you
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> sorry for the newbie spam, but how would i check if the client executes a file (.cfg)? right now I have this box on my screen, and i want it to change from red to green when i toggle a command
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799847603729596457/unknown.png
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> this is the code ive added to my client so far
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799847754545102848/unknown.png
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ctrl+t >> ConExec
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Or something
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Should start with Con if I remember. Not sure if it's for client tho
04:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> you can just search for "bind" btw
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lukas Kawalec> ok
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> Hm i build with "cmake .." no flags https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610790737.png
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait its a tool
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> yikes ddnet source base full of discord and steam libs 
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> yo git wizards I usually do ``git reset --hard HEAD^`` to delete the latest commit any idea on how to do it when HEAD is detached?
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> my git status shows something like ``HEAD detached at pull/34/merge`` and i want it to stay detached i just want to revert to a prior commit
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> ``fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD^': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.`
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> oh ok nvm the git log is only 1 commit long so the error makes sense
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: just use git checkout HEAD^ in that case
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you're detached, there's no branch whose branch pointer you oculd move
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so moving the checked out state to a different commit is all you need to do
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea the issue was the log only had 1 commit but i solved it
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh btw since ur here how do i downgrade my graphics driver
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> i tried pacman -S nvidia=455.45.01-1
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> but it only finds the current version no older versions :/
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's start with: why do you want to downgrade your graphics card driver?
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> well i had the ram issue so i wiped my arch and since i reinstalled it my graphics driver doesnt work
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> so i want to test if a older driver still works
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try installing this packet: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvidia-390xx-dkms/
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> yea ok
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> but isnt that for legacy cards
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610805413.png
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as far as I understand it, it's a still-maintained older version of the driver
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> as i understand it if i have a 980 that i need "nvidia"
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think that's true
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have a 980 you *can* use the newer driver and you should
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since it's the newer driver
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the 390xx branch was the mainline driver at some point
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> hm it depends on some old linux headers that throw 404 on install
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> I think i rly want to run ``pacman -S nvidia=455.45.01-1`` instead but have to dowgrade my package db to find it
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> normal mirrors don't have that packet anymore and that packet always depends on the latest linux version
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'd need to use the dkms-version to combine your kernel with an older driver
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> oof yikes
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> so dkms of nvidia right
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a downgrade or sth
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> hm dkms depends on kernel headers i dont have so i went with the binary
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pacman -S linux-headers?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the binary only ever works with the latest version of linux
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so if you downgrade the driver, you need to downgrade linux too
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: If you want an old package version, you need to manually download it from https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/ , install with `pacman -U filename` and add it to `IgnorePkg` in /etc/pacman.conf to prevent future updates to it
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sometimes useful when there is a bug in a newly released version
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instah the headers nobo
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen the note about old driver and new kernel still applies, you can't combine these
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> yea i managed to do it the pacman -U archive way but still my graphics driver does not work :/
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> i am really out of ideas
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you install an old driver but have a new linux? that has no chance of working
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ChillerDragon someone is going around tw botting with sash client with ur name+clan
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No pinning in pacman?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can prevent a package from updating
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, but you can’t get it to download an older one?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u usually dont want that on arolling distro :)
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to download it manually
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or use one from cache
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pacman keeps like 3 previous versions or smth iirc
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually it’s much more common to want an old package in a rolling distro. Same as wanting a newer package in stable distros
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its more common
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never did it
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3 should be good enough, very unlikely they keep it broken for 3 releases
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only thing i ever had a problem with was one kernel version
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/downgrading_packages
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/downgrader-git/
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a tool in the aur
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh @noby how u know its not me? :D
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what i said doesnt imply that it isnt u
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u use ur own name too
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> are u asking?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wasnt
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but now i am
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> i can explain...
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> haha joke
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> no i sadly didnt play tw in a few days since my graphics driver is broken :/
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> deen ban him
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rip
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea maybe a old version cant work but i assume its not the version anyways something went different after i reinstalled arch
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> i run out of ideas on how to fix or debug this
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @noby if I make a mod that keeps ddnet's antibody interface can you just run the mod with your antibot running?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @noby if I make a mod that keeps ddnet's antibot interface can you just run the mod with your antibot running?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on which server
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yeah, what mod?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: have you checked log output? what's even wrong, I don't think you told us
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> dmesg is chill jouralctl is well unrelated i guess
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> The problem is that when i install the nvidia driver only ports from my mainboard work and all ports on my gpu stop working :/ i did not find any error message anywhere
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> but the screens connected to my gpu are just blank and xrandr also only reports 1 screen that is connected to my motherboard or mainboard? idk hardware man
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> oh motherboard and mainboard seem to be somewhat interchangeable
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> well anyways i guess its a bad sign that my gpu ports stop working and i rly need the display port in there because my mainboard does only have hdmi
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> idk. Just asking about whether it is practically possible for you to run a custom mod with your antibot.<a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well yeah if someone makes a mod that keeps the interface then it could use the eyefollow / hook bot / hammer bot systems that ddnet is using
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Cool
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are u making a mod 👀
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> idk
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> still deciding whether how much effort I'm willing to put into it
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Deciding on*
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800068690649153566/689090783115faeb.png
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what kinda mod
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Some players been getting this lately. It will go away after restarting the client, but they can't download the map without closing the client.
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie doit. That was our intention with this interface
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Depends on how much effort I'm willing to put in
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably none tho
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doit and then ill trade rcon for the compiled lib :kek:
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Still trying to buy food myself
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185> Chinese New year is coming up we have some events planning to do. and chn servers started to run out of empty servers for solo/high level players.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :justatest:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I always wonder what Tom does that would allow him to burn server money like this lol.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800071202718744647/Screenshot_20210117-0205262.jpg
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> manages servers of big chn company
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> but he does buy servers
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think he contribute 250rmb/25euros a month alone.
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> We have some student servers that cost the same for a whole year. The other two chn servers are student discount servers iirc.
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But you can only buy student server for a year so we probably need to rotate the server owners quite a bit.
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @deen do you have statistics of the players who have the most time online?
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> status.tw has stats on that
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not accuratye
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800080699062222869/unknown.png
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this website came out in 2019
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it represents like 10%
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or less
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i remember something that was better at all
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it had everything about player
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> u mean this teeinfo site 
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> i forgot the name like the one that was there before status.tw
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> teestats.info ?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no snaps on waybackmachine :(
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> sad
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> idk why my name dont work, it show name on mayus
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800088158355193886/unknown.png
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie if it's less work to get a more expensive server, you can do that, and I can send you guys the money
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so should we run more servers on CHN again?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I wish I could play on CHN :sadblob: after 5 minutes of playing the lags get worse and worse over time
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, thank the great chinese firewall
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what happens if you go on CHN server and tell the truth about CCP?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The nice people hosting the CHN servers might get into trouble, so don't do that please
