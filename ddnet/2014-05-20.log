22:39 <@deen> (and some more i need)
22:39 < goo_> i have a password, let me look for it
22:39 < goo_> do you need to compile on it?
22:40 <@deen> i always do that
22:40 <@deen> takes a few seconds
22:40 < goo_> ok cool
22:40 <@deen> and i know it will work
22:40 <@deen> otherwise there are always problems with libc and stuff
22:40 < goo_> it was offline last few days, so i didnt bother giving you login, i didnt know if they would bring it back up
22:40 <@deen> ok
22:41 <@deen> so far only ddnet or the full packet?
22:41 <@deen> i have some ictf, zcatch and block servers too
22:41 <@deen> (and some more
22:42 < goo_> hm, only ddnet
22:44 <@deen> alright
22:44 <@deen> you already have the rest or why?
22:44 < goo_> sent another mail
22:44 < goo_> yes
22:45 <@deen> Can I setup zsh?
22:46 < goo_> not sure if you follow a standard and use same dir on the others, but could you use Servers/ddnet as main folder?
22:46 < goo_> you can do anything legal, and that you deem is necessary to make this a great ddnet server
22:46 < goo_> :D
22:46 <@deen> I wanted to make another user for it
22:46 <@deen> yeah, i have a standard
22:46 <@deen> all servers are setup the same way
22:47 <@deen> user is teeworlds
22:47 <@deen> ddnet servers in /home/teeworlds/servers
22:48 <@deen> and i always change the ssh port too, because i don't like reading 1000 login tries a day
22:50 < goo_> that is ok
