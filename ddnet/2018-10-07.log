00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn i can't reproduce it. have some steps or can you debug it yourself?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @deen can't compile on my machine
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i should find a way to compile it without VS
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you definitely get rid of bam?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> use cmake and vs
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't want to use vs
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then idk how else it works
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bam is not supported anymore
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh nvm, i still use old version of ddnet :ninja:
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's the debug target in makefile?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "debug" is not a target
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> after doing cmake .
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im using vs, cant help you. sorry
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it's already debug, gdb still finds the symbol
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn you can download cmake from the homepage if you don't want to use VS: https://cmake.org/
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it supports building with mingw as well
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how do you manage it that so many things just dont work anymore?
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cant vote on any server dnsbl
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut does this client freeze only happen if you are in debug mode?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum can you PM me your IP address
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @heinrich5991 i can pm u my ip address too if u want :3
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not atm
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have the same problem, @Gwendal ?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Yeah
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then please do that
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> right
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> sec
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn mingw shoulda lso work
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon release != debug
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it worked, i just had to configure cmake using cmake-gui
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it's weird that the makefile generated has no debug or release target
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can select whether you want debug or release mode when you generate the makefile
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can make two different build folders, one for debug and one for release if you want
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "you are not allowed to vote due to dnsbl" on empty server...
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you at least remove this when there's only one player?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBést> many connecting players again...

18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut i meant console + strg + shift + d mode debug. That prints all the servers found in browser to the console and that causes fps drops
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No i wasnt
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Where is the speedup code located?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen oh, it was my stopper cleanup that broke the stoppers the other day?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> how do you get on the list of the dnsbl list, cause even i am on the list atm. (i think it has to do with the fact if you have been kicked or banned)
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 i guess
