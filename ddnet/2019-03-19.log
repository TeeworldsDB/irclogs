10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 are you still working on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1417 ?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Might also consider fixing https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1490 at the same time
10:37 <+Learath2> deen: yep, will try wrapping it up today or tomorrow
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great, thanks
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum for showall and showothers i recommended the alisases /sa and /so to have lesss typign and less typos
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How do i create a Thread in ddnet 11.9 (server)
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thread_init and then just randomly access and overwrite data everywhere without any locking whatsoever
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd deen :troll:
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1320 What's up with this btw?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can I create a class, which has full access to character.h?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so like a subclass
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)
13:22 <@heinrich5991> you mean full access to the member of CCharacter?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can inherit from CCharacter
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you can have a friend class
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heinrich5991: yes
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 so with a friend class i can use all members?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a friend class has access to all the members of the class it's friends with
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and how do i create a friend class?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *of character
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> class CIdkWhyYouWouldNeedOne {
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>     friend class CCharacter;
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>     };```
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh it's the other way around in C++ i think
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Would still like to see it merged, if you don't like it close it
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut yeah you need to declare friendships in CCharacter
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> add `friend class CIdkWhyYouWouldNeedOne;` inside `CCharacter`
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> alright, thanks :)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are you adding a friend class?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It rarely is the correct solution
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i have server-side bots, which need full access to the character and for controlling them they get a dummymode, one dummymode is often multiple hundred lines long, dont want to have all that in a funciton in the character
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so the bot moves, based on the mode
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that sounds like a decent use
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so, do i need to add the friend class at a specific point in the character.h?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i call a function inside of the friend class, from inside character.cpp
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_function
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_class
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mega_cat> help the developers I have a new amd video card and after your updates ddnet freezes even with good ping and fps. when correcting I will write. Thanks for attention.
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Which version is the last good one and which is the first bad one?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mega_cat> amd videcard
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_opengl3 disabled?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mega_cat> as soon as updated today began to freeze
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try downloading 11.8 again, is that version fine?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mega_cat> Ok, I'll try in advance thanks
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @heinrich5991  I notice pnglite as part of LIBS_CLIENT. If CLIENT=OFF, shouldn't it be OFF as well? Sorry if my logic is incorrect, I'm just reading CMakeLists.txt
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> glew too, for that matter.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @heinrich5991  I notice pnglite is part of LIBS_CLIENT. If CLIENT=OFF, shouldn't it be OFF as well? Sorry if my logic is incorrect, I'm just reading CMakeLists.txt
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Heh, that x bothered me aswell
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's a bit oversized, so it doesn't fit
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so my fix is hacky
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The x's in the checkboxes are also off center btw
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, they should be higher, right?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but numbers are correctly aligned
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i found that strange
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I saw some fixes in 0.7 to the ui code, I think they fixed it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't really remember what exactly it was though
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are we rendering a text x in there? if so maybe it's the font rendering changes we have
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> apparently we switch to an icon font for rendering the X
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that probably explains it
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yep
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still looks like its a little low no?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but every text inside a button looks slightly low, so it looks consistent to that now
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like the Refresh and Reset filter in the screenshot
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh yeah true
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can someone help me setting up MySQL with ddnet 11.9
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is on the readme
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just read it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont have any sql experience, so i asked ._.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont need any
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the instructions are obvius enough
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont see any on the readme
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Importing the official DDNet Database"
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just dont import anything
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats not what i want
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but follow the instructions
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what u want
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what console is that?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should change some things to apt if u use a debian distro
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "MySQL (or MariaDB) support in the server is not included in the binary releases but it can be built by specifying -DMYSQL=ON, like cmake -DMYSQL=ON ... It requires libmariadbclient-dev, libmysqlcppconn-dev and libboost-dev, which are also bundled for the common platforms."
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u  compile with mysql first
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I don't thing mysql support works on Linux.  Maybe someone involved in the development can confirm that.
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mysql does work on linux
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt work on windows
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Sorry, I meant Windows
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should work on both
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt o nwindows last time i checked
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's not really tested
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know, I asked you to help fix it today ðŸ˜„
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ? today?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1290
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1290
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ima try
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but for me locally the bundled stuff is still annoying
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1. the c++ connector doesn't support mariadb
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2. the c connector depends on an old ssl version
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so meh
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i am not sure also of the utility of using mysql on windows
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone who hostso n windows will probably only use it on home
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i never bother helping people who wants it on windows i know it will be effort wasted
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well windows servers are a thing, and some people are just stubborn
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yteah pay for a worse thing than debian master race
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :toptri:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i sometimes bored and read some forums the only argument they have for windows server is "corporate support"
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The fact that Microsoft runs their own cloud mostly on Linux should be proof enough ðŸ˜„
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> debian is far of from "master race", it's very very outdated in most cases
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use debian testing
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its stable too
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And worst of all debian has systemd
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone complaining about it
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (trolling in #off-topic please :D)
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet i dont have any problem
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u one of those "i use arch btw" xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> arch is also systemd since forever
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so what does learath use
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> devuan?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> im using win 10 :feelsamazingman:
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure it works fine for granny and help this year be the YEAR OF THE LINUX DESKTOP, but it's an unflexible blackbox monolith
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> *several people are typing* :monkaS:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Have anyone tested mariadb's C/C++ connector (https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors). I only knew 'mysql-connector-c++'
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath when it comes to software its hard to find something he likes no surprise :troll:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Have anyone tested mariadb's C/C++ connector (https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors) ? I only knew 'mysql-connector-c++'
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have devuan on my dedicated servers and I use a very stripped down version of ubuntu for cloud servers
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF on arch mysql-connector-c++ is patched to work with mariadb, that's what I use, same on Debian I think
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For devices that are not meant to be servers I use gentoo, with OpenRC
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://voidlinux.org/
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is runit like systemd
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently my desktop is arch with systemd though, I'm using it for a couple months so I can finally tell people to sod off when they tell me I never tried systemd so I can't have an opinion on it
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh u are a masochist!
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :twinbop:
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @deen oh ok
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> runit is very very minimal, love the idea but it's hard to get right and it's pretty crude imho
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF official ddnet servers are all mariadb
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> linux sucks
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> real people use the poney kernel
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.ponyos.org/
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cmake works
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im going to build it now
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen ```\ddnet\ddnet-libs\mysql\include\mysql_connection.h(37): fatal error C1083: No se puede abrir el archivo incluir: 'boost/shared_ptr.hpp': No such file or directory````
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> missing boost i guess
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's annoying
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows is annoying :D
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the mysql-connector-c++ also is
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I was wondering whether we should just use the c connector directly
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and shared_ptr? That's standard c++...
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess that headers are rly outdated
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> depending on boost just for shared_ptr and scoped_ptr, nice one
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt boost modular tho
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but yeah nonsense
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can try installing it and windows and see if it continues
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :twintri:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will try but its pain
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> boost is only needed for the mysql version?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tried installing boost on windows once it was a mess xd
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> would be nice to have it in the super handy ddnet libs
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boost is big
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont want it if u dont need it
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea true
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I was thinking of doing the opposite and just removing mysql stuff from ddnet-libs
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah remove it
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we can tell them to use linux for mysql
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman will thank us
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if my hardrive or what but takes so much to decompress
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen is it cmake who finds boost or its just the compiler who tries to find boost? if its not handled by cmake i doubt windows will work
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since winodws doesnt have a default path to find stuff
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh wel
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it does
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Stupid github pinging me because this contains @def- : https://github.com/patchew-project/libvirt/commit/66bb371e8e76cc2863864923f0ef4e134996d8e1 ðŸ˜„

17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> ðŸ˜ƒ
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen wiht boost installed (had to configure the visual studio solution to include the boost path) i have this errors, sry for spanish:

17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks anyway for trying
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> guys is it possible to see advanced stats (like makers) in the client before hovering the demos?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> without hover
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/557610998203154436/1.JPG
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> with hover
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/557611026485346324/2.JPG
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> guys is it possible to see advanced stats (like markers) in the client before hovering the demos?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Fetch Info button at the bottom
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it takes a while if you have many demos, that's why it's not default
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ctrl-f also works
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> oh. wait a sec
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> hm but after deleting one demo I have to press it again. Maybe there can be an option to always have it on. Because when I am looking for possible demos I would like to do "fetch info" and sort by marker
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> and just delete all demos without a marker
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> watching and deleting the demo probably takes way more time than pressing ctrl-f
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> what do you mean. Ye i dont want to watch the demo. the marker thing is a great feature to have
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> I mean after i press ctrl-f or fetch info. then i want to sort by marker (from ... to 0) and just delete every demo without a marker. either in a whole (not possible i think) or just one by one. but I think after deleting one demo the order of demos change again
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> so i have to fetch info again, delete one. fetch info again. delete one
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> and so on
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So many mails from github today ðŸ˜„
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry about that, I thought it might be better style than just pushing straight to master
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it is ofc, I always had to move github mail into it's own folder, with a notification rule, just sped up that progress ðŸ˜›

20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/557649005887356928/unknown.png
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes, wtf
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so hard to fix? xd
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/557649262410989579/unknown.png
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are manual fixes
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but firefox didnt fix it oficially
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @RafaelFF I don't quite follow
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you shouldn't need pnglite to build the server (the build script will still look for it though)
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i noticed its going uphill lately for ddnet
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> mayn players are comming / comming back
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> many players are comming / comming back
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum i wouldn't go that far
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> at least i have seen a lot old pros online in the past
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen would it be sufficient to give a warning when the build type is unknown?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm a bit worried about future-compatibility)
22:15 <@deen> ok
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 client auth level needs to reset on server join or something
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because other servers don't send it
22:28 <@deen> will fix it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, lets see how well bors performs when we have a lot of prs in queue ðŸ˜›
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 theoretically, it bundles them
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's see how that works out
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen maybe you shouldn't be working on ddnet/ddnet branches and get your own fork, you are triggering all the CIs except circle twice
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> indeed: @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/staging
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we have so many appveyor builds queued up :/
23:22 <@heinrich5991> you can probably cancel them
23:22 <@heinrich5991> in the UI
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that might cause them to fail on github, which could fail bors
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at 12 minutes a piece, we have 8 queued so all the merges will be complete in 1 hr 36 mins ðŸ˜›
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, travis seems to have added windows, maybe we can try theirs to see if it's any faster
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, doesn't fail bors
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have heard these days everyone migrates away from travis
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well appveyor doesn't seem to understand github organizations too well, I don't seem to have any access to ddnet/ddnet
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we run appveyor twice anyway ^^
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think there was def-/ and heinrich5991/
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw are you going to finish #1479?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the new icon in server browser is squeezed a bit
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> which makes it look worse imo
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 dunno what to do
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 It already works, you just need to not rename the artifact but instead put it in a folder and store that folder
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I do that already
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the folder is called `artifacts`
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't there is no folder called artifacts so you end up renaming the file to artifacts ðŸ˜›
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oops
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the mkdir must've gone missing somewhen
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also the path  turns out a little too deep imho, not really important but maybe copy it to /tmp/artifacts and store that or change the destination
23:40 <+Learath2> jao: hmm, doesn't really look squeezed to me
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's fixed in one of deens prs
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didn't see it
23:44 <+Learath2> great, my github notification bell is stuck...
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why do you think my whitelist shouldnâ€™t be in the server? isnâ€™t it the same result if you do it from the script?
23:47 <+Learath2> more code to maintain, more configuration to be pushed to all servers, if we end up with a big whitelist higher server memory usage, and potential to get out of sync
23:47 <+Learath2> but yeah, they are functionally the same, so I guess either achieves the goal
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isnâ€™t the script local?
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except the script is in python and hopefully doesn't need as much code for maintaing a simple list
23:50 <+Learath2> Huh I thought we ran the dnsbl server only on ddnet.tw
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it runs on ger at least
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> also, is there a reason why pending is treated like blacklisted for votes check?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how long does it take to make a dnsbl request
