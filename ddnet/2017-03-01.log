15:34 < Learath2> Is there a way for the client to know the server version
15:34 < Learath2> ?
15:39 < Henningstone> you mean other from the version that is displayed in the serverbrowser?
15:46 < Learath2> is the one displayed on the serverbrowser even reliable?
15:52 < Henningstone> of course everybody can change it in code, but that's not really how it's meant to be used... After all, everybody can change anything in code, so you just have to trust certain things to be correct :/
16:02 < Learath2> Well faking it wont get you anything of value

19:57 < Henningstone> I first thought it might be my screen

20:53 < Learath2> i get so used to white on black, when it suddenly goes black on white its horrible :P
