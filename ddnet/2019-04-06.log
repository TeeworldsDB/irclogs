03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just use cmake ^^
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you compiled bam with the same compiler you have currently installed?
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Agressor> ye
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> so installing openssl3 on ubunshit results to install automatically ddnet-data :tee_thinking:
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> hah not openssl
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> so installing libcurl3 on ubunshit results to install automatically ddnet-data :tee_thinking:
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd like to update the translation files in two different PRs, can't do that without merge conflicts
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I just merged the PRs ðŸ˜„
15:24 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991: please explain jao why force pushing shouldn't be used unless you need too, he says he only does what git-god (aka you) does lol
15:25 <+Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 heinrich5991 force-pushed the heinrich5991:pr_ddnet_external_md5 branch from 8d073c7 to e3657ab 12 hours ago
15:25 <+Ryozuki> y
15:25 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:29 <@heinrich5991> force pushing on public branches like master is a big no-no :P
15:29 <@heinrich5991> but for PRs it's fine most of the time. it can make it hard to track changes, but if that's not a problem, you can do it
15:52 <@deen> Does github not keep the history of the PR after force-pushing?
15:52 <@deen> Seems like quite a deficiency
15:53 <@deen> My idea is to ammend and force-push to PR branch when I fixed something, but add a regular commit when I add something more
16:04 <@heinrich5991> I try to keep every commit building to aid in bisecting
17:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: can you walk me through your "handle fs failures" pr?
17:40 <@deen> heinrich5991: anything specific?
17:40 <@deen> The idea is to propagate the errors instead of losing them immediately
17:40 <@deen> and then in the end set us to failed
18:00 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991: deen im trying to save 3 more variables, do you happen to know what i have to do here after i add the 3 at end? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/save.cpp#L185
18:00 <+Ryozuki> what a weird way to save tho xD
18:24 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991: where to find gameid?
18:25 <@heinrich5991> CGameContext::m_GameUuid
18:25 <@heinrich5991> or rather CGameContext::GameUuid()
18:25 <@heinrich5991> you can format it to a string with FormatUuid, needs a character array of size UUID_MAXSTRSIZE
18:28 <@heinrich5991> (you don't have to load it anywhere, just save it)
18:29 <+Ryozuki> so i just put a \t%s at end?
18:29 <+Ryozuki> i guess yes
18:29 <@heinrich5991> yes
18:31 <@heinrich5991> `%*s` to ignore the string in `sscanf`
18:31 <+Ryozuki> %*s on load right
18:32 <@heinrich5991> yes
18:32 <+Ryozuki> so in future its easier to add new things
18:32 <@heinrich5991> yep
18:34 <@heinrich5991> (the * parameter has no effect on the return value, so you still only count the parameters that were read before)
18:38 <+Ryozuki> done
18:38 <+Ryozuki> whoever merges it should rebase xD
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 i assume .rpoject and .settings is some microsoft stuff?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its probably folders?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> talking about gitignore. Im thinking about adding a / at the end to indicate that these are folders but im not sure if this is a good idea
22:44 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/122fcef8b66e83bb65ecbb2bc820653340eeda71
22:44 <@heinrich5991> they were added here, no indication whether they're folders
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmkay
22:44 <@heinrich5991> it works without the / as well
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it does
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i like adding / if its a folder
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon add .idea/
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess if u add a / it wont hide it if its a file right?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:44 <@heinrich5991> note that it doesn't match symlinks to folders anymore if you do that
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes ryo the idea would be with / lonley
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what?
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess i will add .idea instead
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always put / for folders
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks weird
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if pothers dont have a /
22:46 <@heinrich5991> doesn't match symlinks to folders if you add a /
