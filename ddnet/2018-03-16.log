00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @heinrich5991 hello friend how are you doing?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine, you?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without modifying which functions?
02:57 <+jxsl13> any, but mostly not possible
04:53 <+jxsl13> aw, man, sqlite dbs will be so big xD
04:56 <+jxsl13> 1min -> 1mb :D
06:02 < jxsl13_m> Test
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly jxsl13
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's why I suggested to keep using files and compress them, like we do for ddnet
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> pliz fix thx    https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=6343&p=62949#p62949

16:17 < jxsl13> heinrich5991 online :O?
16:18 < jxsl13> https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/branch/sqliteHistorian/src/game/server/teehistorian.cpp#L118
16:20 < jxsl13> or anyone :D?
16:20 < jxsl13> get a segfault 11 .. don't know how to fix it :c
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you moved it into the teehistorian.cpp file ._. ^^
16:25 <@heinrich5991> you could point a debugger at it
16:26 <@heinrich5991> and check whether some of the variables have odd values
16:26 <@heinrich5991> e.g. 'this'
16:26 < jxsl13> don't know how the heck to debug c++ :O
16:26 <@heinrich5991> on which platform are you?
16:27 <@heinrich5991> windows linux macos?
16:27 < jxsl13> mac
16:27 <@heinrich5991> use gdb ./zcatch_srv
16:27 <@heinrich5991> then r
16:27 <@heinrich5991> then you can use bt to get a backtrace
16:27 < jxsl13> hm.. kk will try
16:27 <@heinrich5991> post it
16:28 <@heinrich5991> (when you're done, the backtrace)
16:30 < jxsl13> do I need to rebuild the binary with some debugging stuff :O?
16:30 < jxsl13> Reading symbols from ./zcatch_srv_x86...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
16:30 < jxsl13> q
16:31 <@heinrich5991> bam server_debug
16:31 < jxsl13> hm, doing :D
16:31 <@heinrich5991> bam server_debug_x86?
16:31 <@heinrich5991> maybe
16:31 < jxsl13> server_debug is the default for every debugging version
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
16:32 < jxsl13> still te same error, nothing to debug :O
16:32 <@heinrich5991> you need to use a different executable
16:32 <@heinrich5991> like
16:32 <@heinrich5991> zcatch_srv_x86_d
16:32 <@heinrich5991> or so
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> editor bug:  open any map.  open the server settings menu down below. go into any layer and hold down spacebar.     wtf is it
16:32 < jxsl13> ls
16:32 < jxsl13> xD
16:32 < jxsl13> thx
16:33 < jxsl13> ..../zcatch_srv_x86_d" is not a core dump: File format not recognized
16:33 <@heinrich5991> hmmmm
16:33 <@heinrich5991> can you execute it?
16:33 < jxsl13> there are two executables built
16:34 < jxsl13> Reading symbols from ./zcatch_srv_x86_64_d...done.
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum can't reproduce. what should happen?
16:34 < jxsl13> but s that it with the debugger :O? has no more output
16:34 <@heinrich5991> yes it is
16:34 <@heinrich5991> does it crash?
16:35 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/D1pKV2DW
16:35 < jxsl13> that's all the output
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991  there is a grey square comming from the upper left corner. but only for like half a second and it doesnt pop up but grows.... so weird
16:35 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/PmdfkB5X. that's what the debug executable says
16:36 <@heinrich5991> you should enter 'r'
16:36 <@heinrich5991> to execute the program
16:36 < jxsl13> ah
16:36 <@heinrich5991> or 'run'
16:36 < jxsl13> Starting program: /Users/john/Desktop/zCatch/zcatch_srv_x86_64_d
16:36 < jxsl13> Unable to find Mach task port for process-id 2715: (os/kern) failure (0x5).
16:36 < jxsl13>  (please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8))
16:36 < jxsl13> hm, need to look up how to configure gdb ._. could be a mac issue
16:36 <@heinrich5991> google that error? ^^
16:55 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/CY9bcwzW
16:55 < jxsl13> wha now :O?
16:58 <@heinrich5991> type "bt"
16:58 <@heinrich5991> or "backtrace"
16:59 < jxsl13> no stacktrace
17:07 <@heinrich5991> mhh
17:12 < jxsl13> finally thank stackoverflow xD
17:13 < jxsl13> the latest version of gdb (8.1) does not work on mac os x high sierra -> download earlier version 8.0.1 -> codesign -> run ._.

17:16 < jxsl13> heinrich5991 -> stacktrace -> https://pastebin.com/jnc1TK9e
17:40 < jxsl13> full bt https://pastebin.com/tcf1LgGe
17:44 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: well, aio is 0x0
17:44 <@heinrich5991> aka the null pointer
17:45 < jxsl13> hm k
17:47 <@heinrich5991> the stack trace confuses me though
17:48 <@heinrich5991> do you call CGameContext::CreateExplosion from CTeeHistorian::Write?
17:48 < jxsl13> not that I know 
17:49 < jxsl13> code is online tho, if you want to know
17:49 < jxsl13> most likely something in heehistorian::oninit
17:54 < jxsl13> [2018-03-16 17:54:10][TEEHISTORIAN]: pSelft==1, pSelf->m_pTeeHistorianFile=0, DataSize=16
17:58 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/3cmESjHs
17:58 < jxsl13> I'm wondering, is the ASYNCIO handle being passed incorrectly?
17:59 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/gLBhsEnf
18:08 < jxsl13> https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/commit/7e615ff5b52faa495f536ea7dcf55e3bfc4d9202/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2636 that's the passing
19:13 < jxsl13> :D fixed
19:13 < jxsl13> *whoosh and gone*
19:58 <@heinrich5991> oh :D
19:58 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: you just passed a NULL file? ^^
20:06 < jxsl13> accessed the historian file before it was actuall initialized
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> @heinrich5991 can you guys please update the sdl lib to the latest version? it apparently fixes the "mouse warp"(inp_mouseold 1 not working) issue on latest win10 version
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Were any of you people certified web engineers? I'm having some trouble with getting css to apply to jquery appended elements
21:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> heh "certified web engineers"
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, turns out it was my bad, angular doesn't appreciate direct manipulation of the DOM
22:37 < jxsl13> heinrich5991 , you got a woring teehistorian file for me :D?
22:37 < jxsl13> or anyone :O
22:37 <@heinrich5991> woring?
22:37 < jxsl13> working
22:38 <@heinrich5991> haven't you produced some already? ^^
22:38 < jxsl13> ehm, deleted :c
22:38 < jxsl13> and always breaking your teehistorian, not my sqlite stuff, tho x), when trying to refactor
22:39 <@heinrich5991> why do you hook into my working teehistorian? ^^
22:39 < jxsl13> I'm trying to put as much as possible into that teehistorian class because it's the logging class
22:40 <@heinrich5991> you could also just copy that class and put everything you want into your SqliteLogging class
22:40 <@heinrich5991> that way, you wouldn't break teehistorian
22:40 < jxsl13> :c but I don't know where to hook in the tw source
22:40 < jxsl13> or how
22:40 <@heinrich5991> revert to the working teehistorian
22:40 <@heinrich5991> copy the class
22:41 <@heinrich5991> also copy the hooks everywhere I set them
22:41 <@heinrich5991> done :)
22:41 < jxsl13> a big mess :c
22:41 <@heinrich5991> why's that?
22:41 <@heinrich5991> less of a mess
22:41 <@heinrich5991> because you don't have teehistorian and sqlite intermingled
22:41 < jxsl13> many hooks
22:46 <@heinrich5991> can I help you with splitting that up if you don't mess up my precious teehistorian? :P
22:46 < jxsl13> never xD
22:46 <@heinrich5991> :(
22:46 < jxsl13> :()
22:50 < jxsl13> wtf ._.
22:51 < jxsl13> didnt do anything, your tool didnt throw wrong magic error
22:51 < jxsl13> before it did throw the magic error :'c
22:58 <@heinrich5991> problem is that it now displays the "wrong magic" error?
23:02 < jxsl13> no, it works again ._. maybe I did a mistake somewhere
23:02 < jxsl13> or maybe most likely :D
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also if you modify th you can't get updates üòõ
23:54 < jxsl13> already done :O
23:54 < jxsl13> updates should be ok to add ._.
23:54 < jxsl13> hopefully
