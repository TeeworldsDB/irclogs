12:07 <@deen> Anyone know why it saved twice?
12:07 <@deen> I didn't see any problem with saving once
12:10 <@deen> And some more editor improvement ideas if anyone wants to implement sth: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1884&p=19793#p19793

14:46 <@deen> EastByte: here it was added: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/c24964ebcd07e1d5435393fabf600d0ff88c40d3
14:47 <@deen> Related to the new layer types
14:47 <@deen> I tried saving with those layers and didn'T notice any problems

15:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8f5812d def: Version 8.0
15:53 <@EastByte> yay
16:21 <@deen> EastByte: yay?
16:21 <@deen> waited for release?
16:24 <@EastByte> deen: neat version number
16:24 <@deen> ^^
16:24 <@deen> didn't want to do 7.10
16:24 <@deen> no other reason
16:29 <@deen> hm, the demo player behaves a bit strange with /pause now =/
16:33 <@EastByte> deen: what do you mean?
16:34 <@EastByte> oh, I should pull the changes first
16:34 <@deen> when you go pause it specs to top left corner of the map
16:34 <@deen> and stuff like that
16:34 <@deen> also with spectate i think
16:35 <@deen> because i allowed for spectating people in demos, i guess i made some mistake
16:35 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/1af5507b95e79ef80d64deebacd98f85db61be7a
16:35 <@EastByte> I see
16:43 <@deen> are you looking into it, EastByte ?
16:48 <@EastByte> currently cleaning up my room^^ demoplayer stuff is difficult to understand
16:51 <@deen> I just looked into another suggestion, but don't think it can be done
16:51 <@deen> the idea was to highlight demos with a marking in the demo menu
16:52 <@EastByte> "with a marking" ?
16:52 <@EastByte> demo markers?
16:52 <@deen> yes
16:53 <@EastByte> hmm we would need to look through all demos on every client start then
16:53 <@deen> exactly
16:53 <@EastByte> could be cached in a list though
16:53 <@EastByte> well not that I want to work on that^^

18:22 <@deen> Anyone know how to press page-up on a mac computer? (they don't have a page-up button)
18:22 <@deen> I'm wondering because people want to read the console, but can't

18:53 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 dfcb9be def: Visually tell tees apart that you can't spectate
19:03 < LeeT> hello, everyone here?
19:06 < fstd> everyone?  i doubt it
19:07 < LeeT> :D
19:07 < LeeT> I just have a little question about new features
19:07  * fstd is the wrong person to talk to, then, but ask anyway
19:10 < LeeT> How about a feature, like a Demo. But, the demo will save as .mp4, so you don't have too record the Demo with Fraps and Co. Also, that you can render/change it and upload it directly in YouTube etc.
19:11 < Tobii> deen: fn+shift+up => page-up
19:12 < LeeT> huh?
19:12 < Tobii> <deen> Anyone know how to press page-up on a mac computer? (they don't have a page-up button)
19:13 < fstd> it would add quite a lot of computational work to render and encode a demo on the fly
19:13 < fstd> that said, I wouldn't mind an external program that can take a demo and produce a video from it
19:13 < Learath2> hmm maybe a way of converting a demo to mp4
19:13 < Learath2> from a specific tees perspective ofc
19:13 < LeeT> yea, something like that
19:14 < fstd> it might(TM) not be a big deal if you hook into the right place of the demo playback code, and modify the client to render to off-screen buffers instead of to the screen
19:14 < fstd> and then shove the frames into some sort of video encoder (library)
19:16 <@EastByte> well there already is a client with webm encoder
19:18 < LeeT> where?
19:18 <@EastByte> MAP94 implemented it into his client, should also be on github
19:19 <@EastByte> but I didn't manage to get it running
19:19 <@EastByte> also requires a lot of dependencies
19:19 < Tobii> https://github.com/andi103/N-Client
19:19 < LeeT> NClient won't function, I heard? :c Too old?
19:20 < Learath2> dissect it, extract what you need, make it into a new client :)
19:20 < LeeT> I don't have any experience with Programming :x
19:20 <@EastByte> understanding the code also isn't that easy^^
19:21 < LeeT> 'cause I wanna make some Videos for YouTube
19:21 < Learath2> I might give it a shot tonight if I get bored enough
19:21 < LeeT> that would be nice! :o
19:21 < Learath2> dont expect anything soon as i work slower then a snail :P
19:21 < LeeT> yea yea ^^
19:22 < LeeT> you're german?

19:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 19a8ec9 def: Oops, add SPEC_FREEVIEW to datasrc
19:22 < Learath2> nope
19:22 < LeeT> ah, ok
19:22 <@deen> This feature is clearly wanted, but I wouldn't necessarily base it on N-CLient
19:22 <@deen> my idea would just be to make an external tool, not add it to the client (but based on the client)
19:22 < Learath2> I probably wont take it from there and I also probably wont add it to ddnet client
19:23 < Learath2> thinking of a headless client to extract frames from demos
19:23 <@deen> don't render to the screen (as fstd said), but instead pass the result to libav (ffmpeg) and be done
19:23 < LeeT> yea, that would be good. I found nothing which convert a .demo into a .mp4 or .avi etc.
19:23 < Learath2> just need to strip the client a bit 
19:23 <@EastByte> don't forget audio
19:23 <@deen> EastByte: right, something similar with audio
19:24 <@deen> but i never play or watch vids with audio, so i don't care much :P
19:24 < Learath2> anyone wanna suggest something to eat ?
19:24 < LeeT> yea
19:24 < Learath2> don't say shit please. already been given that suggestion

19:25 <@deen> EastByte: tested the new demo stuff?
19:25 <@EastByte> not yet
19:25 <@deen> Well, I'm planning to release now, so if you want to test, do it now^^
19:26 <@EastByte> wait wait wait
19:26 <@deen> compiling already :P
19:27 <@EastByte> well works for me
19:28 <@deen> also with freeview, spectating specific people and follow mode?
19:29 <@EastByte> wait
19:31 <@EastByte> yes works
19:32 <@deen> =)
19:32 < LeeT> what? :D
19:32 <@deen> LeeT: not your feature, sorry^^
19:34 < LeeT> :(
