06:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> emacs style home/end for chat?
06:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> not super useful for most people i guess
06:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> emacs style home/end for chat & console?

08:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ok apparently ppl dont know what i mean
08:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ctrl+a ctrl+e
08:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> respectively
08:47 < bridge> <Assa> ah now I totally know what you mean since anyone knows emacs bindings by heart ❤️
08:47 < bridge> <Assa> Sorry I need coffee brb
09:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ctrl-a is used
09:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> already
09:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for select all
09:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i know
09:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> it would be an option
09:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a not very good idea
09:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what is a good idea is making everything bindable
09:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you can do cursed stuff like that
10:01 < bridge> <teero777> ctrl+z gang
10:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i guess yeahg
10:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i guess yeah
10:23 < bridge> <Teero> Why would you ever want to quit the chat?
10:36 < bridge> <teero777> who tf uses ctrl-a to select all?? xd
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> everyone
10:40 < bridge> <teero777> i don't see anyone using a terminal text editor using control a
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> `C-x h` moment
10:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> barely anyone uses terminal text editors
10:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or terminals...
10:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> \\:
10:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also i use micro which does use ctrl-a for select all

11:29 < bridge> <Assa> Who doesn't?wtf
11:30 < bridge> <Assa> Time for a neural-Link? :justatest: ☠️
13:13 < bridge> <kebscs> lower/upper bound is so confusing
13:14 < bridge> <kebscs> would be much better just plain algo
13:14 < bridge> <kebscs> in the env pr
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> in the end, it doesn't even matter
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> my map renderer is tripping but it looks cool

17:27 < bridge> <TsFredium> Looks like a video genre
19:14 < bridge> <didiviene> yeah
19:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> looks like a smw kaizo hack to me
22:22 < bridge> <always> is accounts being worked on currentlly? if so where
22:28 < bridge> <louis> yeah in my basement
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> oh shit i wanna play some now
22:39 < bridge> <learath2> #6961 is what accounts are stuck on, pretty much the rest is mostly done
22:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6961
22:44 < bridge> <urg_> If I may ask will the mod apps ever be reviewed DX
22:44 < bridge> <urg_> (go ahead and delay it by another week)
22:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Yes they will be reviews
22:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Yes they will be reviewed
22:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Just be patient
22:52 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Admins have more stuff to do
22:52 < bridge> <always> is it currently being devloped i see last commit 1 month ago
22:52 < bridge> <always> is it currently being developed i see last commit 1 month ago
22:53 < bridge> <learath2> It's sadly only heinrich working on it and he is very busy rn
22:54 < bridge> <learath2> It got delayed while I worked on a tool to determine how active mods are and in what regions, so we can figure out how many and where we need mods
22:54 < bridge> <oxyzo.> accounts before deltarune chapter 8
22:56 < bridge> <kebscs> no, no trust every ddnet knows rust
22:56 < bridge> <kebscs> rust on top!!
22:56 < bridge> <kebscs> no, no trust every ddnet dev knows rust
23:00 < bridge> <oxyzo.> i love rust
23:00 < bridge> <oxyzo.> though its sometimes annoying to remove
23:08 < bridge> <Ewan> u just need acid
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly even after QUIC is done, I still have serious doubts about the complexity of the decentralized accounts for the regular layperson
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> we’d need a MVP for the login stuff alone
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> then the game integration just follows lead
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if it works then we can bother adding it into the client
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if it works in your expected failure scenarios then we can bother adding it into the client
23:19 < bridge> <learath2> You can check it out on ddnet-rs
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> theoretically
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i’m dying eggs
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> more like witnessing the dying of said eggs
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> dyeing
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
23:20 < bridge> <always> whats the eta for quic? at this rate
23:21 < bridge> <always> like a ballpark
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> None
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> because nobody is working on it
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> last commit to the branch was march 9th
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s hienrich’s pull request and he hasn’t been around in any serious capacity for a number of months
23:34 < bridge> <learath2> At the meetup heinrich implied it has about 2-3 weeks of work left on it. But it all depends on if/when he has more time to work on it
23:35 < bridge> <learath2> It mostly functions. We had a working server and client, but iirc it has lots of edgecases and polishing left
23:35 < bridge> <learath2> #9862 was one of the things missing e.g.
23:35 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9862
