00:19 < laxaa> !en-de I hate german language
00:19 < Nimda> Translation: Ich hasse Deutsch Sprache
00:33 <@deen> it's a bit funny that you run the TS server, laxaa, and everyone speaks German on it, which you don't understand
00:33 < laxaa> Yeah
00:35 < laxaa> I try to tell them to speak english when I am with them
00:35 < laxaa> the most annoying thing is to hear 'laxa' in a german sentence to be honest
13:35 <@deen> Good morning
13:35 <@deen> Any suggestion where best to put the ddnet.tw website?
13:46 <@deen> I wrote a mail to Deutsche Telekom about the ping issue, but don't expect anything to happen since it's been there for years and is part of their politics of getting peering partners to pay
13:58 < laxadedi> I think any server would be good, take a cheap vps at HH for example.
14:31 <@EastByte> hmm
14:43 <@deen> And I found 2 hosters in Frankfurt with great pings and apparently good ddos protection
14:43 <@EastByte> wut?
14:43 <@deen> one even has the link11 protection and great routing
14:43 <@deen> and they're pretty cheap
14:43 <@deen> but the companies look really really strange
14:43 <@deen> dozens of complaints about them online
14:43 <@deen> you can only get out of the contract by using a fax...
14:44 <@EastByte> yaaay
14:44 <@deen> and for the other company: I've just been in a support chat with them and the support guy just left after I stated my questions
14:45 <@deen> not sure if i should try getting into business with companies like that =/
14:46 <@deen> on the other hand i see that people on GER get the same weird routes as I do, every day
14:46 <@deen> http://www.gametekk.de/ & http://gc-server.de/
14:47 <@EastByte> wow cheap
14:47 <@deen> cheap, but weird
14:48 <@deen> apparently gametekk sold teamspeak servers with a cracked teamspeak software
14:49 <@EastByte> haha
14:49 <@deen> gc-server seems to have the accelerated ddos protection, gametek link11
14:49 <@EastByte> I saw gc-server before
14:49 <@EastByte> but dunno who mentioned it
14:50 <@deen> about gc-server, it's weird that every one of their vservers ("CloudRootServer") has 8 cores
14:50 <@deen> ..
14:51 <@EastByte> reminds me of netcup (in every cheap vps you were able to lookup 16 cores)
14:53 <@EastByte> hm I'm not sure either
14:55 <@deen> gametekk uses Oracle VM (never heard)
14:56 <@deen> ah, it's xen
14:56 <@deen> xen with a webinterface
14:58 <@EastByte> why is qemu/kvm used so barely
14:59 <@EastByte> hm I should ask proplay about that
15:02 <@deen> not so sure about the qualification of gametekk
15:03 <@deen> I'm telling them about our routing problems and they say it must be a dns issue =/
15:03 <@EastByte> definitely!!!
15:04 <@deen> and they have a "2 week money back guarantee"
15:04 <@deen> i asked them how it works exactly
15:04 <@deen> "after you log into your server you can't get your money back"
15:04 < laxadedi> xD
15:04 <@EastByte> :)
15:09 <@deen> EastByte: talking about kvm, their website looks weird right now: http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page
15:11 <@EastByte> hmm wonder how that can happen
15:11 <@deen> i transferred the ddnet build servers to qemu/kvm a few days ago
15:12 <@EastByte> ddnet build server?
15:12 <@deen> mostly works fine, but mac is a bit slow and has no working suspend
15:12 <@deen> ehm, the ones i use to build ddnet releases
15:13 <@EastByte> didn't know you are using a server for that
15:13 <@deen> it was running on my laptop so far
15:13 <@EastByte> ah okay
15:13 <@deen> but now it's on my home server, which is barely faster than the laptop
15:14 <@EastByte> so you don't have any highend systems? :P
15:15 <@deen> none as fast as the vservers we use for ddnet^^
15:15 <@EastByte> ^^
15:15 <@deen> core2duo in the laptop and a celeron j1900 in the homeserver
15:16 <@EastByte> I'm using intel core i5 first gen since abuot 5 years now
15:16 < laxadedi> wow, pretty old gear
15:16 <@deen> the celeron is from 2014, but it's a 10W cpu :P
15:16 <@EastByte> well newer processors aren't getting really faster
15:17 <@EastByte> graphicscards are more interesting
15:18 <@deen> but who wants to program for a gpu?! xeon phis are more fun!
15:18 <@EastByte> yea
15:19 <@deen> 60 pentium1 cores with huge SIMD units and 4 threads running in parallel on each
15:20 <@EastByte> looks a little bit expensive
15:20 <@EastByte> what are they designed for?
15:21 <@deen> everything that parallizes well and needs a lot of memory bandwidth i guess
15:22 <@deen> they're popular in supercomputing
15:22 <@deen> and I'm trying to make graph algorithms run on them
15:23 <@EastByte> cool
15:24 <@EastByte> do you need some specialized compiler set to write software running on it?
15:24 <@EastByte> is there opencl support?
15:25 <@deen> i use the intel compiler, but gcc apparently works as well
15:25 <@deen> you don't need opencl, that's the thing
15:25 <@EastByte> ah
15:25 <@deen> you basically write your normal code, as for any x86 computer, make sure it parallizes well (and vectorizes) and it's fast
15:26 <@EastByte> well that sounds easy
15:26 <@deen> and you can ssh onto the card, it has linux running on it =)
15:26 <@EastByte> build ddnet binaries on it then
15:26 <@EastByte> oh cool
15:26 < Learath2> Never happened before but apparently the name IStorage conflicts with a Winapi interface 
15:26 <@EastByte> lol
15:26 <@deen> Learath2: oh, probably because of the ugly defines i set
15:27 < Learath2> nah
15:27 < Learath2> its because i include curl
15:27 <@deen> ah
15:27 < Learath2> curl.h indirectly includes objidl.h which redefines IStorage
17:12  * EastByte is rebooting
17:14 < EastBite> I'm alive! :)
17:14 <@deen> congratulations!
17:14 <@EastByte> ty :)
17:50 <@deen> This list might be interesting: http://gameservercheck.de/provider/?filter=all&sort=ranking&order=desc
17:51 <@deen> gc-server has pretty good rating, may be worth a try after all. g-portal is what gametekk seems to be reselling, but they only have dedicated servers: http://www.g-portal.de/rootserver/intel-x-mas/
17:52 <@deen> and I've been pinging and tracerouting servers all day, they seem to be the most stable from the few locations i tried
17:56 <@deen> and the datafabrik server is still running. i think he forgot to shut it down^^
18:00 <@deen> Made a thread, want to know how many others are experiencing the ping problem: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=626&p=5333
19:13 <@deen> BeaR: hi
19:13 < BeaR> hey (:
19:13 <@EastByte> hi
19:13 <@deen> i liked the simplicity of round sounds, but maybe rectangular are more usable?
19:13 <@deen> You've seen how Kintaro used the round ones, that wouldn't happen anymore, i guess
19:14 < BeaR> yeah, commented on github (:
19:37 < o_be_one> hi
19:38 < o_be_one> <deen> Any suggestion where best to put the ddnet.tw website?
19:38 < o_be_one> you just need a simple VPS ... the cheaper you can find, no more
19:42 < o_be_one> HH , OVH ... Take the best, fuck the rest
19:44 <@deen> well, i don't know which is the best^^
19:44 < Teetime> do you really need a vps for a website?
19:44 <@deen> how else to host it?
19:46 < Teetime> is a simple webhosting paket not enough or does the website needs special requirements? a webhosting paket might be much cheaper and so you dont need to care about the server
19:46 <@deen> special requirements
19:46 <@deen> like http://ddnet.tw/ranks
19:46 <@deen> python scripts, other crontab scripts running
19:48 < Teetime> hm... well then forget my idea :)
19:49 <@deen> 2 â‚¬ more or less doesn't really matter
19:49 <@deen> i just want something that keeps running for a few years without problems
20:03 < Nimda> Zoroark by Zerodin just released on Moderate at 2014-11-06 19:58
20:42 <@deen> hm, maybe the ping problem isn't so big after all
20:42 <@deen> i haven't heard many complaints about it
21:18 <@deen> looks like Persian server isn't coming back
21:19 < Nimda> Easy 1 by Borup just released on Novice at 2014-11-06 21:16
21:20 < eeeee> so map, much release, wow
22:49 <@deen> ahaha, just when i say "Persian server isn't coming back"! got a mail that erfanzone might be getting a server in iran
23:20 < Savander> Hi
