23:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Tja
23:10 < bridge> <rutujek> why
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> call microsoft support
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do i look like bill gates?
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u ask me midnight how to fix windows problems
23:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 24/7 ddnet build support team
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @rutujek maybe disable ipv6
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sv_register ipv4
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only ipv6 seems to fail according to your logs
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hope i finished my karma quest with that, gn8
00:01 < bridge> <rutujek> I will test it later
00:01 < bridge> <rutujek> Have a nice dream about codes without error
00:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> Wake up, I need Windows support :kek:
01:43 < bridge> <Ewan> don't ask him about big endian...
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> btw bit fields may completely fuck this up
01:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u can also use them to pad completely arbitrarily
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ```c
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> struct S {
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> char x : 3; // 3 bits
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> int : 0; // "advance to int alignment boundary"
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> char y : 3; // 3 bits
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> };
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> this is how i know it behaves in cpp but i think c is the same in this regard
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ```c
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> struct S {
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan>   char x : 3; // 3 bits
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan>   int : 0; // "advance to int alignment boundary"
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan>   char y : 3; // 3 bits
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> };
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> this is how i know it behaves in cpp but i think c is the same in this regard
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> this shouldnt matter if u dont care about transparent C struct representation tho
04:53 < bridge> <remakepower> anyone knows what's happened?
04:53 < bridge> <remakepower> I found that status.tw has updated
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
05:45 < bridge> <murpi> #5781 can be closed
05:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5781
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> are u not a contributor on the repo? seems like a big oversight
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> are u not a collaborator on the repo? seems like a big oversight
06:48 < bridge> <murpi> No, its fine
07:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I've never used bit fields xd and I've seen somewhere that they're bad but idk
07:56 < bridge> <learath2> They are pretty rarely used anyway. I wouldn't sweat over them
08:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there a way to disable `ctrl + w` bind in firefox, every time i try to write code in godbolt, I try to delete a word and it closes a tab xd
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> honestly, i barely understand what it generates from a quick look but as long as it spits out correct answer I think it works correctly

10:30 < bridge> <learath2> Dam, now I can't contribute ever again
10:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> exactly
10:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to change git email
10:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so #10 can finally surpas your rank
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> 777
10:33 < bridge> <learath2> I should commit 111 white space fix commits
10:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yeet this into your js console ``window.onbeforeunload = (e) => e.preventDefault()``
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also use extensions or bookmarklets to auto load js
10:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it asked before closing a page, is that it? xd
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can write a firefox extension in 5 lines of json and then include one line of js with this and tell it in the 5 lines of json to only be active on godbolt
10:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://tenor.com/view/this-is-fine-fire-house-burning-okay-gif-5263684
10:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah, ye that could work
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> while at it you can also use js to let the ctrl+w do what you want it to do :D 
10:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> or install an extension which has terminal shortcuts xd
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So C structs have padding?
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> meaning i can not trust the result of `sizeof` ?
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sizeof return size with padding
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sizeof returns size with padding
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So no need to ever worry about padding right?
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``printf("distance=%ld size=%ld\n", (char *)&m_aNodes[1] - (char *)&m_aNodes[0], sizeof(m_aNodes[0]));`` this indeed prints 16 twice nice
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay then there is a bug in my debug print again... classic
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> Unless you are worried about memory footprint. In that case it might matter
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723280377.png
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i not count or is that the padding?
11:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it C repl? :justatest:
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> written in bash
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> by me
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> totally bug free xd
11:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how did I not think about it
11:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use it quite often to test stuff
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so the struct has 2 unsigned ints (4+4) one array  of two unsigned shorts (4) and one unsigned char (1) which should add up to 13 bytes right?
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sizeof says its 16 byte
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will just assume it is :D 
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would have never thought C introduces padding if I wouldn't have seen you guys talk about it
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> #developer education
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 idc memory i just need to debug my assembly code and i use the C implementation debug prints as reference and the offets were not adding up
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such bloated language this C who would even use it. Its close to machine code they say ...
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> You can use the packed attribute to get rid of padding
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C pro
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> |      m_Bits       |     m_NumBits     | short1  |  short2 | sym|   padding    |
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
11:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i guess it should be 16 because it has to also aligned by biggest value in a struct which is unsigned, so by 4 bytes
11:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe it's not true tho :justatest:
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks milkeey i will take your words as facts
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ill just add padding to my assembly struct and call it fixed
11:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> lemme check in my language how it accesses the struct fields üòè
11:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah, nvm, i dont have 4 bytes ints xd
11:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> ?
11:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have only char and short
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and ptr size
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice, u dont need more
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think if i would need arrays when call C functions ill just add a bunch of shorts and pass a pointer to first one
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 4 byte ints are my favorite ints
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ints suck
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> unsigned int ftw

11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @milkeeycat if u add 512bit ints, then you have more possibilities than there are atoms in the universe
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you not think that should be the default?
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all i need to be happy is u8
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u8 smol
11:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all those fancy shmancy 128s and 512s for nobos
11:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok, it's time to add 32/64 bit ints
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u512
11:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what would you use it for? xd
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> femto second precision
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> count all atoms in the universe
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> count all atoms in the universe twice
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u make it a f512
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet would finally work above 10000 units
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no more precision problems
11:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just looked how gcc handlers regular `float` and I think I don't need floats in my language
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so fixed point numbers?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but PLSSS make them ez to use
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is so important
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not even rust is good in that aspect
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also adding sqrt support etc is not ez
11:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i saw something about fixed point numbers when I was checking Patiga's twmap crate or smth
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so for such stuff i always have to convert between them to floats
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> suggs
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> possible he uses it in some places
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga what is your experience using them
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> Native fixed point numbers lets goooooo
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> honest
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> big integer numbers are practical for cryptography but idk what else
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> Biggest issue with fixed precision numbers is accidentally losing precision. You need to bw careful
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u have like a 512 bit prime u can have a field with it and do stuff
11:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to store someone's mom's weight
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> What if you need to compute TREE(3)?
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is tree
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Very big number. Idk details
11:27 < bridge> <patiga> in twmap, the importance of the fixed point numbers comes from representing the map values properly in types. simply because they are fixed point numbers everywhere in tw (also in snaps)
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Something about coloring a tree
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean the / 1024?
11:28 < bridge> <patiga> yea, but also often / 32
11:28 < bridge> <patiga> sometimes / 2**15
11:28 < bridge> <patiga> / 100 at one point, tho that can't be represented well
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oke yeah makes sense
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also use them in my map format, but i use them properly, like colors are normalized fixed point numbers
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and honestly i didnt really like working with it
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i remember we talked about physics using them
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not trivial enough i guess
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also GPUs ofc expect f32
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well you can use normalized fixed points there
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not custom formats i think
11:30 < bridge> <patiga> I mean they have a couple of upsides over f32, such as no precision pitfalls and no NaN
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tru
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats why i liked them for a format
11:31 < bridge> <patiga> on the other hand they give you potential overflows

12:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> is it? was also my first thought
13:08 < bridge> <rutujek> its vps
13:08 < bridge> <rutujek> with windows
13:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> the worst decision of yor life
13:08 < bridge> <rutujek> i dont know how to make in debian
13:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> your

13:09 < bridge> <rutujek> didnt worked
13:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> should continue to google
13:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> ai is shit if you don't know what you are doing
13:10 < bridge> <matodor> ChillerDragon: where i can dm you?
13:22 < bridge> <louis> windows vps for teeworlds sounds fun
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not really that bad tbh just unnecessary
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> TRACTOR
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @zillyhuhn on wire. Or chillerdragon@gmail.com on mail. Usually also on irc and in game but not too much this year.
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh or on matrix idk my nick xd chillerdragon
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> chillerdragon:matrix.org or something like that
14:11 < bridge> <matodor> ChillerDragon: chat zillyhuhn has private channels?
14:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not yet. Sometimes I think about it but not sure if it‚Äôs worth the effort
14:13 < bridge> <matodor> or maybe channel that not bridge'd with discord?
14:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chat zillyhuhn has voice channels?
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @matodor: yes \#off-topic is not bridged messages there will probably be red by less than 2 people
14:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jopsti and milkeey
14:14 < bridge> <matodor> give me register token üòÑ
14:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Forgot it
14:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs in the discord history of this channel
14:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is two secrets. One is the token which allows you to sign up. And the other is the universal password that lets you login in to any username without account xd
14:17 < bridge> <matodor> both in chat history? üòÑ
14:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think so
14:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs the universal pw I think
14:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I‚Äôll get my laptop sec

14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen Are you looking into the rest for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
14:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> :KEKW:
14:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> no, why would I?
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :c if not you who else?
14:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> I probably missed the part of why we are doing 0.7 support. Is anyone using TW 0.7?
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Not a lot because ddnet does not support it
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this pr fixes that
14:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> Probably too late to bring that up after you made a 6000 line PR
14:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> Or because Vanilla Teeworlds gets boring after a while?
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the pr did not start with 6k lines
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lots of it is json files but yes it took me a while
14:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Hm, I thought the direction we wanted to go was to split further from Teeworlds, not go back to it
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So you are against supporting 0.7?
14:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats unexpected now since you did not mention that and even said you will merge it at some point
14:49 < bridge> <0xdeen> This is so much effort to support playing with the 20 people playing TW 0.7 :/
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But its me who did the effort no?
14:51 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, but now this PR can break all the existing 0.6 support in subtle ways
14:51 < bridge> <0xdeen> and we have to maintain it in the future
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am not going anywhere
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> In january i will be doing less development but i will stay here and play the game. If you need 0.7 maintenance you can ping me
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy sh*t
14:54 < ws-client> <matodor> wish all your love for 07 could be used to develop APIs for mods <:heartw:395753947396046850> 
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I would have fixed the conflict my self if id knew you merge it woah

14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> time to rq
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dw
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when heinrich returns from afk he will send revert pr
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> the effort to support 0.7 is already done. Just merge it :0
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> press the button
15:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he did @jxsl13 
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> he did D:?
15:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> what
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ikr
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> the hell's going on
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> sick move
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> party time, I guess
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> ü•≥
15:06 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit
15:06 < bridge> <Ewan> best salesman ever
15:09 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller breaking shit in real time
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i can't believe i aborted the merge
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my ego got in the way i had to merge the conflict my self 
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> TIL u cant push after it's been added to the merge queue
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it stops the merge queue
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> or ig u can
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> just not if u want it merged
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> xddd
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Pepew. One more piece of code we have to maintain forever for the deadforkcompat
15:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe chiller will stop contributing to ddnet one day and the you will be able to drop 0.7 xd
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich is working on some translation layer thingy that should make it easier to maintain and also easier to drop
15:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> Oh? But then we probably shouldn't merge that already, should we?
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well he did not say we should wait or that he will finish or that it conflicts
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he told me to ask another maintainer if i want it merged
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i assume he is okay with it but we can also wait for him to return @0xdeen i just think if we don't merge now nothing will happen
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> by now i don't mean "now" but in the next few weeks
15:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> Mergus maximus

15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:brownbear:346683497701834762> 
15:30 < bridge> <0xdeen> @chillerdragon Is it intentional that you can't change the Tee 0.7 settings without joining a 0.7 server?
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes its a feature i suggested and heinrich and jopsti appreciated
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> originally it showed both menus at all times
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the 0.7 is hidden away to avoid confusion why 0.7 dont show
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.7 skins don't show*
15:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes, makes sense, ok for me
15:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> amazing thanks for the merge @0xdeen this was the most emotional merge for me it feels unreal ngl
15:33 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated but is there any reason u can fathom why my build would fail here?
15:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ```

15:33 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as src is added in target_/include_directories this should be impossible
15:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unedited ddnet code base?
15:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ya i think it has been a long time in the making
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> very excited for u
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> essentially
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> o can u see replies on irc
15:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got better at guessing
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
15:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what does essentially mean? does it work for unedited ddnet?
15:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you try to delete the build cache?
15:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the checksum depends on some pyson scripts
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's failing in a new and exciting way
15:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks for the feature, it seems to work great from what I tried
15:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes thanks to all the people who tested it and reported bugs
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
15:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> Odd question But did you try a Clean rebuild and it still fails there ?
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
15:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:  its mostly the easy Things
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> the real q here is what kind of shell are using when deving ddnet
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> mine busted
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ```nix

15:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> Letsgoooooo
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
15:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> Use inputsFrom = [ ddnet ]
15:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> Easier than to define all depa
15:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> Easier than to define all deps, espacially when the actual Thing is packaged
15:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i wrote it based off the default.nix on nixpkgs but many of those pkgs were not found when i was using buildFHSEnv
15:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i had it compiling earlier but it couldnt load freetype .so
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> and others
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> dont remember what it was when it worked
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> dont remember what it was when it "worked"
15:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also is there a reason to specify Fish there ?
15:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
15:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> Yeah you can do inputsFrom to get the stuff from the actual package, for development and stuff you can then Just include them seperately with buildInputs
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> im using fish
15:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> Try zsh :gigachad:
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bash best
15:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> No Idea why it fails, lgtm
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i can use right side prompt w fish

15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û>       ];
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> Thats my flake.nix, since you're using shell.nix No real Idea why its Not working
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> Hey Look basically the same
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> gmm
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm *
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> They Look basically the same, im Not Home atm so i cant reproduce, If youre still stuck in an hour i can
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i could use a flake
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> The best Dev Environments with nix are
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Direnv + flake
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Loading the deps in your nix Store once, and yeeting them Off when Clearing it. Godsent
15:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> Imo
15:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also direnv loads the Shell automatically when Entering the directory
15:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also has IDE integration
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> how does direnv work
15:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> It loads the Environment based on an .envrc File (e.g flake.nix or shell.nix) when you enter the directory with a flake.nix with an existing .envrc
15:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> So you dont have to worry about using nix develop
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
15:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> Are you using clang?
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> gcc
16:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ah yes i'm blind
16:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> :xd:
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
16:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> Try Out my flake and See If that does the Trick for you
16:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> Dumps the mysqlclient ofc
16:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> Dump the mysqlclient ofc ( doesnt Work anyway, cant Run MySQL on User Level :monkaStop: )
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> working identically to my shell.nix rn :justatest:

16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> so ill be back at some point
16:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> Wait
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it was cut off
16:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> That Looks Like a Rust issue
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> a lot
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> ya could be
16:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> Engine_shared
16:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> Can you try this?:
16:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> RUST_SRC_PATH = "${pkgs.rust.packages.stable.rustPlatform.rustLibSrc}";

16:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i won i think

16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> the scoreboard is a great example of why immediate mode UI sucks
17:07 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: Should I open an issue for various 0.7 skin settings TODOs  or do you already have a list? Doesn't seem like saving/deleting is implemented yet for example. Also, the `skins7` folder is not created automatically and should we really use a separate folder than 0.7?
17:18 < bridge> <matodor> wtf, please remove this :nouis: image many projects will need to implement support for 2 skin systems
17:18 < bridge> <matodor>

17:34 < bridge> <vania846> what to do if i got banned in ddnet and it says i will get un banned august
17:34 < bridge> <vania846> 10
17:34 < bridge> <vania846> when it is august 10 !!!
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @vania846: does it say you use vpn? Maybe \#open-ticket is your best option
17:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The only skin todo I have is this one https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/issues/17 if you have various things could you maybe open multiple issues instead of one big one? It‚Äôs nicer to work with imo. Feel free to ping and assign me
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it works in utc
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt remember naming it skins7 I also think sharing the same path with vanilla makes sense. Either I did that while testing and forgot about it or kaffeine named it skins7
17:38 < bridge> <vania846> wdym
17:39 < bridge> <vania846> where is ticket

17:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> On discord
17:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yeah btw robsti thanks again for your reviews on the 0.7 pr you also put a lot of time into it!
17:43 < bridge> <vania846> where do i check my name
17:43 < bridge> <vania846> in dnet
17:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> F1
17:43 < bridge> <vania846> ok
17:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> player\_name
17:49 < bridge> <vania846> i answered all the question and they didnt react
17:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is the vpn situation planned to stay like that?
17:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How bad is it when people are allowed to use vpns?
17:53 < bridge> <vania846> i dont have vpn
17:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I know
17:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the vpn protection bans people because of false positives. And I am questioning the need of the vpn protection.
17:55 < bridge> <vania846> how do i turn it off ?
17:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Turn what off?
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> how do I unban myself????
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but what time does it say ur ban expires
17:56 < bridge> <vania846> the vpn protection
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> you don't
17:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can‚Äôt. Neither can I. We can only ask the admins to do so
17:57 < bridge> <vania846> it doesnt
17:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which I just did
17:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pls turn it off. Thank.
17:57 < bridge> <vania846> i dont now how toooooooo
17:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The trolls using vpns can‚Äôt be that bad.
17:58 < bridge> <vania846> what talking anout
17:58 < bridge> <vania846> i didnt
17:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it's enabled on the server's side
17:58 < bridge> <vania846> so hpow i get unnn bammmed\
17:58 < bridge> <Ewan> wait
17:59 < bridge> <vania846> did what
18:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh my sweet summer child...
18:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im serious
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you see something happen that would require banning vpns? @blaiszephyr
18:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> ban evasion resulting in toxicity overload for example
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Toxicity overload does not sound bad. And does for sure not sound bad enough to justify excluding innocents from playing the game.
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is toxicity overload even? Bad words in chat? Every client has a mute feature.
18:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ban evasion can be fixed with another ban. Switching vpn is way more annoying than pressing f3 I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an actual problem.
18:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well I have to admit my opinions don‚Äôt align with the mainstream or the ddnet rules. I don‚Äôt think banning is something that should be done in the first place. So evading it does not sound bad to me.
18:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
18:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I think we can all agree on the current situation being unacceptable. Innocents being unable to play. The people that manage to find their way to discord have to wait for an unban an the others just stop playing ddnet. While causing lots of manual work for the moderation team.
18:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well I have to admit my opinions don‚Äôt align with the mainstream or the ddnet rules. I don‚Äôt think banning is something that should be done in the first place. So evading it does not sound bad to me.

18:24 < bridge> <matodor> chillerdragon: why you implemented 0.7 support? 0.6/0.7 severs with bridge support not enough?
18:29 < bridge> <matodor> chillerdragon: why you implemented 0.7 support? 0.6/0.7 vanila servers with bridge support not enough?
18:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> i can accept your disagreement but me having to handle both blockworlds and now also ddnet toxicity as part of their moderation teams vpn bans help, the day when the known **insert fitting insult for these humans in here** are all rangebanned to the point where they literally can't play anymore, i agree with you to turn it off

18:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> we have religious propaganda, doxxing, hatemail and literal death threads prevented by vpn bans
18:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> i can accept your disagreement but me having to handle both blockworlds and now also ddnet toxicity as part of their moderation teams vpn bans help, the day when the known **insert fitting insult for these toxix .. somethings.. in here** are all rangebanned to the point where they literally can't play anymore, i agree with you to turn it off

18:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bridge in the client is better so it can join vanilla 0.7 servers not only custom bridge servers. So one can play CTF with the 0.7 players
18:34 < bridge> <matodor> but you can play with 0.7 ctf players on bridge server
18:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They usually don‚Äôt play there
18:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The OG Players play on aeon server
18:35 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1271869584768634923/autoscreen_2024-08-06_00-15-05.png?ex=66b8e85b&is=66b796db&hm=c859af5a93c37c8e9b2753b433222e66b227f9ad7da4b76d704d89e3d0493298&
18:35 < bridge> <matodor> 06.08.2024
18:35 < bridge> <matodor> bridge server üòÑ
18:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea that‚Äôs a new development
18:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That bridge was built after I already finished 0.7 support in the client
18:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs jsaurus bridge right?
18:37 < bridge> <matodor> +
18:37 < bridge> <matodor> now
18:37 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1271870157735854160/image.png?ex=66b8e8e3&is=66b79763&hm=b6e4cf5696f1c0135a3ad3c64c38f22b43d2443f320f3c3c418adefb26052485&
18:38 < bridge> <matodor> some old players from [POLICE]
18:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs very Pog that they are still around
18:41 < bridge> <matodor> very pog is confuse new players using two skin systems üòµ
18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What‚Äôs to confuse
18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It shows the skins from the current settings and new players will play kobra anyways
18:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And yes I think server side bridge is not enough. If it‚Äôs also in the client you can join all 0.7 only servers with ddnet which is pretty cool for me personally as someone who plays exclusively with ddnet client but is interested in all servers
18:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Including pure 0.7 servers and stuff like 0.7 zCatch
18:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> jiggsel mentioned
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello
18:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo none of these things a ban worthy. This all sounds like chat usage. If you really can‚Äôt handle text then just mute instead of ban. But even then I am cursious if it is that bad in reality. Because I don‚Äôt see such stuff happening. And I also play on servers where there is no ban police such as fokkos BlmapChill
18:46 < bridge> <matodor> > If it‚Äôs also in the client you can join all 0.7 only 
18:46 < bridge> <matodor> 
18:46 < bridge> <matodor> just download 0.7 client and play with this 20 people )
18:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
18:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I play with ddnet client
18:48 < bridge> <matodor> okey, if i want join to 0.5 servers from ddnet, can i implement 0.5 support and merge it to ddnet?
18:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think I said everything I cared about multiple times now. Your turn @matodor I don‚Äôt understand how 0.7 causes you problems
18:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have no problem with that. Not sure if there is much going on in 0.5 that was before my time. But not sure if deen would merge that
18:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> and i still completly disagree :P - guess we just have different ideolog√≠es of freedom in videogames then.
18:51 < bridge> <louis> im pretty sure most of the heinous trolls can bypass the vps detection anyways
18:52 < bridge> <louis> vpn* -- iirc some of them have vpns that just aren't detected
18:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What religious propaganda did you see?
18:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you miss the `hamas` topic?
18:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> it was painful
18:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> people cheering the death of children
18:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Death threads might be even against German law but let‚Äôs be real here. Threads in video game chats are usually a joke.
18:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> there are people on ddnet that have been actually doxxed
18:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did miss the hamas topic what happened
18:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And vpn bans fixed the dox?
18:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> they prevent people from using free and cheap vpn services to bypass to keep on pushing
18:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.tagesschau.de/thema/hamas
18:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean in teeworlds not in general
18:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What happend in tw chat?
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> .
18:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> a
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> wishing death on israelis and the other way around etc
18:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea that‚Äôs not nice
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> these people dont deserve just a mute, they deserve their doors kicked in and dragged out
18:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Disagree
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> alright i'm getting angry at this (not at you) - so i'm yoinking myself out of here
18:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I also don‚Äôt appreciate that those things happen. But I just prefer decentralized moderation.
18:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt think there should be one admin having the power to decide who can say what. But every user should be able to decide who to mute in their client.
18:58 < bridge> <teero777> any docs on econ?
18:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not much I think what do you need
18:59 < bridge> <teero777> just connecting externaly
18:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> bind the ip with the config
18:59 < bridge> <teero777> yea i did the server config but how do i actually connect to it?
18:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ec\_bindaddr or something like that
18:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs tcp
19:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With your favorite tcp client
19:00 < bridge> <teero777> ah okay
19:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Such as Telnet or netcat
19:00 < bridge> <teero777> ‚ù§Ô∏è
19:01 < bridge> <teero777> can a server have multiple econ connections at the same time?
19:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
19:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We really need to submit the irclogs to Microsoft
19:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> gtp5 could be ddnet assistant
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> it would be biased to linux xD
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> it would be biased towards linux xD
19:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see no problem here
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> idk if microsoft wants that lol
19:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They use Linux them self‚Äôs
19:19 < bridge> <louis> u can do it without microsoft
19:20 < bridge> <louis> well idk actually, i dont think theres enough power in chatgpt4 extensions
19:20 < bridge> <louis> maybe thru some trickery with ollama
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> First week as mod and you are already bowing out damn
19:28 < bridge> <learath2> Don't take memerdragons stance on absolute freespeech too seriously. Only a handful of people take such an absolutist stance
19:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye but too lazy. But would be cool
19:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> no worries - i wont quit :D
20:27 < bridge> <arylz> in editor, why i cant select other tiles while menu is invisible?
20:27 < bridge> <arylz> do smth

20:59 < bridge> <zhn> as heinrich told me: `TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8369")` - that's all u need
21:00 < bridge> <teero777> what language? xD
21:01 < bridge> <zhn> rust
21:01 < bridge> <teero777> of course it had to be rust
21:02 < bridge> <zhn> ye because i implemented some econ wrapper in rust
21:02 < bridge> <zhn> even twice xd

21:40 < bridge> <rutujek> i switched to debian 11 again
21:41 < bridge> <rutujek> wait
21:41 < bridge> <rutujek> i didnt readed that error xd
21:41 < bridge> <rutujek> this version of Cargo is older than the `2021` edition, and only supports `2015` and `2018` editions.
21:41 < bridge> <rutujek> xd
21:42 < bridge> <egyt> Debian 12 released like a year ago
21:42 < bridge> <rutujek> but i have only debian 10 and 11
21:42 < bridge> <rutujek> on vps
21:42 < bridge> <rutujek> to choose
21:42 < bridge> <rutujek> and ubuntu

21:44 < bridge> <egyt> üëÄ
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I recommend updating to Debian 12 even if you can‚Äôt choose it as a base image you can still manually update
21:47 < bridge> <rutujek> can someone pls help me (do tutorial for me) plsü•πüôè
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can use rustup to install latest rust on Debian
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh
21:49 < bridge> <rutujek> i have rust
21:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay then delete your build directory and try again
21:52 < bridge> <rutujek> its building
21:52 < bridge> <rutujek> ‚ô•
21:54 < bridge> <hamidreza6> I think the curl is also older in debian 11 so I think u can't use both ipv6 and ipv4 for the server

22:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> Update curl
22:06 < bridge> <rutujek> how
22:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ah wait, Just add: `sv_register ipv4`
22:06 < bridge> <rutujek> .
22:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> gg
22:07 < bridge> <rutujek> üò≠
22:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> Read wiki on how to Upgrade your Debian system
22:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @rutujek: do you define sv\_register maybe more than once in your config?
22:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The screenshot does not show the entire config
22:20 < bridge> <rutujek> its only one
22:20 < bridge> <rutujek> and im upgrading to 12
22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok sounds good then don‚Äôt worry about the register thing it will solve it self with deb 12

22:22 < bridge> <rutujek> what should i choose?
22:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doesn‚Äôt matter too much
22:22 < bridge> <rutujek> too much
22:22 < bridge> <rutujek> but what do you prefer?
22:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what your provider is and what they need. But I assume you did not change the file.
22:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It depends on what you want
22:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just pick the first
22:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or flip a coin between first and second haha

23:10 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Perhaps you're using some kind of firewall? like ufw?
23:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> Add am exception for DDNet's Port udp within your vps, they Most likely have a Page that explains it

23:14 < bridge> <rutujek> you mean this?
23:14 < bridge> <rutujek> .
23:24 < bridge> <hamidreza6> If your problem isn't solved yet maybe try this:
23:24 < bridge> <hamidreza6> `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 8301 -j ACCEPT``
23:24 < bridge> <hamidreza6> If your problem isn't solved yet maybe try this:
23:24 < bridge> <hamidreza6> sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 8301 -j ACCEPT
23:25 < bridge> <hamidreza6> If your problem isn't solved yet maybe try this:
23:25 < bridge> <hamidreza6> `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 8301 -j ACCEPT`
23:51 < bridge> <0xdeen> that is tcp, you have to allow udp
