02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @Arch This error happened even with mysql-connector-c++ installed?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we shoukd handle reserved slots with a new proticol message
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> hmm

13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> If you run 'git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mysql-connector-c++.git' you download of files for this package base. Then you can read/double-check every file and build the package.   After that, build ddnet again
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> (obviously, you have to install built package...)
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> * of files -> all files
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> If you're building a DDNet package, consider adding mariadb and mysql-connector-c++ to depends, to avoid messing your dependency tree.

14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> mysql-connector-c++'s PKGBUILD added verification of the signature of the source tarball for security sake, as you can see in filed 'validpgpkeys'.  You will have to receive the keys and  trust to build.
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> You can check the keys if they are MySQL Release Engineering's using the command:
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF>    gpg --list-public-keys A4A9406876FCBD3C456770C88C718D3B5072E1F5
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> And, finally, you can receive and trust using:
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF>    gpg --list-public-keys A4A9406876FCBD3C456770C88C718D3B5072E1F5
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> For the record: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg#Signature_checking
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> No public key
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> ops, my ctrl+c and ctrl+v  failed. The right command for receiving keys is
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF>  gpg --recv-keys A4A9406876FCBD3C456770C88C718D3B5072E1F5
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> or maybe just 8C718D3B5072E1F5

14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Please try installing 'boost-libs' from official repositories and try again.
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> WOW IT WORKS!!!!
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> awesome!
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> yeah!
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> THANKS
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Welcome. Have fun!
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> p.s.: again, if you installed a package, make sure these dependencies are in "depends" array, to avoid messing your dependency tree.
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch> Okey
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Fixed the instructions on ArchWiki :)

15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> I gave a try at bridging discord and ddnet with curl instead of python :
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> https://github.com/daverck/ddnet/commit/c1cce7bb1031138e33f44afc05f427d9d23a7084
15:57 <+Learath2> @daverck I think heinrich5991 was already doing that, not sure if he finished it up though
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> good bc my code doesn't work. It compiled at some point but it doesn't anymore :p
17:59 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: here?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> nb the pb i have now seem to be this one : 
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37909563/unresolved-external-symbol-with-static-lib-that-uses-another-static-lib
18:06 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: well if you ever do come here https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/commit/53a48e8
18:07 <+Learath2> I couldn't seem to get the server to compile
18:07 <+Learath2> @daverck with the discord thing?
18:09 <+Learath2> @daverck check how I include curl.h in `src/engine/client/fetcher.cpp` and how heinrich links it up properly in `CMakeLists.txt`
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> @Learath2 I tried to link at first like in fetcher.cpp but that didn't work for me
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> maybe it's worth updating ddnet-lib
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> didn't work for me is quite vague
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> i m no expert in c++
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <daverck> i tried and it didn't work
