01:07 < bridge> <louis> does anyone know how that one server did the trick where they were able to connect players to another "instance" of the server
01:08 < bridge> <louis> i think it had smth to do with ports
01:16 < bridge> <teero777> Thats a feature right?
02:05 < bridge> <zhn> afaik thats just multiple instances of gamecontext-gamecontroller-gameworlds bundle
02:18 < bridge> <archimede67> Which version are you on? I believe this is related to the bugs texnonik reported, it will be fixed in the next version or in nightly
02:18 < bridge> <cyberFighter> uhm it was a version steam auto updated to

02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> cool error
02:52 < bridge> <mazty> i hate it
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> Too bad
02:58 < bridge> <mazty> how can i fix it
03:22 < bridge> <remakepower> When did we join the community "noby's fng"? i didn't see it yesterday (UTC+8)
04:29 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206079658781835264/anchor_test_2024-02-10_22-28-41.mp4?ex=65dab436&is=65c83f36&hm=9d07fbbbfe2335ad6f34ffe2b66e3dcd1fb4eb1f2a4672b67fc81fb219e6869e&
04:30 < bridge> <louis> spawn anchor tile
04:30 < bridge> <louis> proof of concept thing, some other platformers have features like this
04:31 < bridge> <louis> could be a nice alternative to 'antifail' setups that traditionally use some janky switch + dragger combination
04:37 < bridge> <remakepower> Why ddnet could write read-only files?
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fred its year of the dragon!
07:31 < bridge> <teeffs> Hi, Dear DDNet Developers, I hope to join my server community in the Community Filter of DDNet, What should I do to apply to you
08:10 < bridge> <louis> ah okay interesting
08:10 < bridge> <louis> so just another instance of all three for each server?
08:11 < bridge> <louis> i curious if its possible to do between two separate server instances
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes you can redirect newer ddnet clients to another port on the same ip
09:42 < bridge> <kekomonter> Multi-worlds
09:42 < bridge> <kekomonter> Just one server and multiple gameworlds, collisions, maps and others
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fng2
09:43 < bridge> <kekomonter> Or multiple gamecontexts
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @louis.place https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElmkTep2vXw
10:34 < bridge> <robyt3> See #7660, you likely use the wrong rust version
10:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7660
10:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Can it? Which files do you mean? At least it can't on Windows as far as I know.

11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/too_hot_to_reload.mp4
11:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> the jump to 2k, would've cost me 400€ more on MediaMarkt

11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> perfect screen for scrolling low quali vines
11:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> my third monitor can be flipped 90°, i cant scroll through reddit on a normal screen anymore
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao imagine needing a high hz screen just to scroll feeds. Bois dont get spoiled.
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Stay based like me gaming in 60hz since decades
11:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> my third monitor is not even full HZ with 59hz and 5ms wtf
11:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> my third monitor is not even full HD with 59hz and 5ms wtf
11:10 < bridge> <matodor> I have been using a 4K monitor since 2017, two months ago I changed the monitor to 2K + (ultrawide) 165Hz, I will say this, after two months I hardly see smooth movement from 165 hertz, but every day I see soapy pixels from 2k resolution...
11:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> that fucker cost me 50$ on ebay, and it made me a happy man
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> haha right @matodor px > hz i agree
11:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest: dont make me spend another 1K on new monitor's, please - my wife gonna beat you up
11:15 < bridge> <remakepower> I made ddnet-info.json read-only even unreadable, but ddnet made it read and write
11:15 < bridge> <remakepower> On Linux
11:16 < bridge> <remakepower> Wait why it isn't reply?
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u have a wife watafak @meloƞ ?
11:16 < bridge> <matodor> cool, not many people agree with this, I think it depends on the vision, but overall I liked the ultrawide resolution, for me one monitor is better than two, now I can do this:
11:16 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206182040500703302/image.png?ex=65db1390&is=65c89e90&hm=5322a764e8fd4cb33f454263680df88f39acf9e8b12f5420aa35f0c161d3d8fb&
11:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i got her on discount!
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
11:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> :owo:
11:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> imagine ultrawide with a good hyprland setup :pog_fair:
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything below 100 hz feels like shit
11:19 < bridge> <remakepower> I think it's like a windows 11 XP
11:19 < bridge> <matodor> and this is also true, now looking at 60 hertz you can immediately see the difference)
11:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> switching from 60hz-144hz you didnt really see the difference imho - but going down from 144hz to 60hz? damn i couldnt play without my eye twitching
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's like day and night
11:20 < bridge> <matodor> :poggers2: oled ultrawide 6k resolution 512hz
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in both directions
11:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> ikr
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first time i ever used 144hz, 60hz was dead
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stone age
11:20 < bridge> <robyt3> DDNet first deletes the old file, then renames a temporary file to the real filename. Maybe on Linux you can delete read-only files.

11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess the prompt was added by the ``rm`` so if you as software do not check the flag your self nobody is stopping you
11:43 < Flower> May I ask where I should apply to have my server community join the community filter
12:17 < bridge> <deen> Thanks @xeaexmrk !
12:53 < ChillerDragon> Flower left btw in case someone wonders
12:56 < Flower> im still here btw
12:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah how
12:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I saw you leave
12:59 < Flower> fake news
12:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wtf
13:00 < Flower> so what is the answer
13:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am not aware of any public statement on how this works. That’s why I recommend you to stay available for dms
13:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s your community?
13:01 < Flower> TeeFun and Mid·Night(Both in China
13:02 < bridge> <remakepower> *So we named it "MidFun"
13:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
13:05 < bridge> <teeffs> Meets the conditions or has sufficient scale, or is reliable enough
14:10 < bridge> <chairn> what would be the use case ? killing restarts timer, so doesn't really fit ddrace imo
14:18 < bridge> <patiga> what is the difference to teleporters?
15:40 < bridge> <zhn> idk about old clients but newer ddnet ones should be able to
16:04 < bridge> <mazty> i  downloaded it from rust-lang.org
16:28 < bridge> <louis> could have use in ddrace contexts
16:28 < bridge> <louis> im sure the timer could just be kept
16:29 < bridge> <louis> teleporters wont save u from kill tiles, you cant make some unfailable parts with teleporters (such as hammer hit parts)
16:30 < bridge> <patiga> ah right, you can trigger a kill manually
16:31 < bridge> <louis> well i am going to use it for a mod anyways but i thought it was an interesting idea for race modes 🤠
16:49 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tf2 payload but with block gameplay

16:55 < bridge> <astramast> Thank you
16:56 < bridge> <astramast> very cool update tho
17:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Which compiler are you using? Run `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` if you use GNU, or run `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` if you use Microsoft Visual Studio
17:25 < bridge> <mazty> i fixed it
17:26 < bridge> <mazty> i installed now the gpu
17:26 < bridge> <mazty> rust
17:38 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7660
17:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> Seems Like we should fix #7660 at some Point
18:12 < bridge> <louis> is there source code?
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the switching of the internal servers is inside fng2
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can also give u access to the tournament mod itself if u want to
18:14 < bridge> <louis> if you don't mind :owo:
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, but the code is not really the cleanest and i made that like 8 years ago xd
18:16 < bridge> <louis> np
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's ur gh account again?
18:16 < bridge> <louis> l-ouis
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you have an invite, dunno how u accept it, i guess u got an email
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't abuse rcon pw
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
18:21 < bridge> <louis> ty lmao
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> we don't even have alive servers here
18:45  * aaaa slaps ws-client around a bit with a large fishbot
18:48 < bridge> <pouriiia> Hello friends, I am planning to make a special launcher for our server, how should I do this, can anyone help me?
19:58 < bridge> <ikeed> can anyone lead to me how the colors in frinds tab work in server browser?
19:58 < bridge> <ikeed> its green brown and blue now
19:59 < bridge> <ikeed> its green, yellowish-brown and blue now
20:01 < bridge> <zhn> green shows an actively playing player, yellowish-brown shows inactive but connected player, blue shows your clanmate afaik
20:01 < bridge> <ikeed> ah
20:01 < bridge> <ikeed> ty
20:02 < bridge> <ikeed> ah i see it now, ddrace kind of inactivity
20:02 < bridge> <ikeed> `yellowish-brown` doesn't account for ppl in specs
20:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> @mpft sry for the ping but you're a windows G - have you built ddnet with mysql support on windows? i cant correctly link the directories and its driving me insane
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> did you checkout the ddnet-libs submodule
20:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the error
20:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206324266388430948/image.png?ex=65db9805&is=65c92305&hm=137ee5d76ad683c7a3d986764475a8a74d439ef26767a8bf1bdd69235ae396d8&

20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like they are trying to use wildcard without actually globbing
20:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> i also tried not using the mariadb server, but the connector, same thing
20:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> i feel stupid af rn, but i cant figure it out
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder why it is doing that ...
20:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> it for sure is an issue on my end, but i cant figure it out
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like an error in FindMySQL.cmake
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> the project's cmakelists asks cmake to find the pkg and in doing so it runs that file which populates certain arguments like MySQL_LIBRARIES and stuff
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet's cmakelists can only do so much if it's given erroneous data
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> did you use the mariadb windows installer or smth
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> idk how windows works :/
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you have cmake debugger right?
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> wasnt i supposed to?
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's usually better to just download builds of something like that lol
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> development libraries
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> i am confused, i usually debug cmake with --trace
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> is there a native cmake debugger?
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> in clion, yeah
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> it's the most robust one out there
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> on windows, development libraries are entirely decoupled from the user's programs and such
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> could be you installed the database but not the libraries
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> but i would personally just add mariadb builds to ddnet-libs
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why it isn't in there already tbh
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> i installed it the way i expected it to work since on linux you need libmariadbclient-dev to build
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> and mariadb-server to actually start a server with mysql support (otherwise the mysqld.service is not running - DUH)
20:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i installed mariadb-server community or smth, and then linked the .lib, the executable "mysql.exe", and the mysql.h include - but nope, doesnt work
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> can u send me the link to ur download
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> also i lied
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldn't add the builds to ddnet-libs
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i would just use msys
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's not exactly reasonable to uplift ur entire setup rn just to fix some silly linkage issue
20:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-11-3-1-release-notes/
20:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> the actual download link is a mirror
20:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> and yes i also tried the newest release and also downgraded up to 11.3.0
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ok ill take a look in a sec
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta minecraft
20:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> prioritys, i get it!
20:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'll hop into terraria until then
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> lol i just had to pick up some items
20:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> XD
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> try download the zip version and plop it in ddnet-libs
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and then you can bypass find_package altogether by giving it `-I.../ddnet-libs/mariadb/include -l.../lib/libmariadb.lib`
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not actually like that
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> do it via. target_include_directories and target_link_libraries respectively
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> there should already be a mechanism for this tbh
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> how do i build rome
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> make it snappy plz i have to go block some kids on multeasy in 25 mins
21:18 < bridge> <pouriiia> I know, but to start building and compiling the version, apart from Visual Studio code, what else is needed in the Windows environment?
21:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:18 < bridge> <pouriiia> I have the source
21:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> readme is pretty straight forward
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> read the build instructions
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> there's a forum post and instructions in the repo
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> that will tell you what you need to install
21:19 < bridge> <mazty> how can i get the cfarm, and from tiles?
21:19 < bridge> <mazty> not exist in the list like, TILE_CFARM or TILE_FROM likee TILE_FREEZE
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> btw don't help @mazty i am almost positive he's a botter
21:20 < bridge> <mazty> xddd
21:20 < bridge> <mazty> why u say that
21:20 < bridge> <mazty> hahah
21:20 < bridge> <pouriiia> Can you send a link to the forum post for construction?

21:23 < bridge> <mazty> rust-lang.org``` if u wanna build a client u need download this list
21:23 < bridge> <mazty> ahh
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> why downloading mingw-w64 by itself
21:24 < bridge> <mazty> i use mingw
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> in what ide

21:28 < bridge> <mazty> lmao
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> did it work melon
21:28 < bridge> <mazty> create a launcher its good
21:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> will it be open source?
21:29 < bridge> <pouriiia> Likely
21:29 < bridge> <mazty> u know c++ no?
21:29 < bridge> <mazty> do u know c++ no?
21:30 < bridge> <pouriiia> Yes, but I am new
21:30 < bridge> <pouriiia> Yes, but I am new in C++
21:30 < bridge> <mazty> like me
21:30 < bridge> <mazty> adknas
21:31 < bridge> <pouriiia> Can you send me some launchers developed by developers so I can have a look?
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
21:31 < bridge> <mazty> wait
21:31 < bridge> <mazty> a min
21:31 < bridge> <pouriiia> ok
21:32 < bridge> <mazty> send me dm
21:32 < bridge> <zhn> you just need to compile your own client with your own hard-coded master-server urls
21:32 < bridge> <zhn> and host a master-server that will register only your servers
21:32 < bridge> <zhn> why do you need it though
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> he wants to sell it and get rich
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> pay to win teeworlds
21:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> imagine to make a client where after each death will be playing add
21:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> imagine to make a client where after each death will be playing ad
21:34 < bridge> <pouriiia> Do I need to make changes in the menus_browser.cpp file?
21:34 < bridge> <pouriiia> ؟
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no, you need your own master server (server which provides server info for the client in JSON format)
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> and then u just punch in that IP
21:35 < bridge> <zhn> idk, check the code that fetches master server list
21:35 < bridge> <zhn> and also what ewan said
21:36 < bridge> <pouriiia> how to provides  server info to client?
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> return valid JSON on the client's GET request
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> u can open master server in browser to see how it works
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but the master servers are likely also open source
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i just don't know where they are
21:37 < bridge> <mazty> he wanna kill him after read that you say HAHAHHAAH
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
21:38 < bridge> <mazty> nothing
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
21:41 < bridge> <pouriiia> How do I create a master server that has maps in ports one?
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it's somewhat involved
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd be better off starting with a smaller project 😃
21:42 < bridge> <pouriiia> What do you suggest to start working?
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont even have ideas for my own projects
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make account system for ddnet
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :poggers2:
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> not qualified
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> my name isn't green
21:43 < bridge> <pouriiia> built
21:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nobody said that it will be merged
21:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but you can still make it
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't hate myself that much
21:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and make your own network
21:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ewan network'
21:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ddnet servers with accounts
21:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :poggers2:
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> actually that's a good idea
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> account is $1 one time purchase
21:44 < bridge> <mazty> but
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> time to profit off of the good work of others :troll:
21:44 < bridge> <mazty> he can create accounts with sql
21:45 < bridge> <mazty> no?
21:45 < bridge> <mazty> save the dates in a table
21:45 < bridge> <mazty> create a mod on ddnet that use other table in sql
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> no comment
21:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just save account data in table, duh
21:47 < bridge> <mazty> ye
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> it was that simple the whole time
22:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> im using wsl2, im not doing any client-dev atm anyway, and i'll fix it at some point
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> wait wot
22:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> gerdoe sent me useful stuff that i can work with, so i'll get it running sometime later
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> you've been using wsl to compile?
22:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> obviously not
22:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> but i am now using wsl2 to do so, because windows hates me
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting choice
22:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> i wonder if its possible to run a X-Server on wsl2
22:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It hates everyone
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
22:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i can even do some client-dev
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it's called wslg
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> but why would you do that
22:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> :o
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> may as well run a VM
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> this is not windows dev
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's not a windows build
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it will perform very badly because of no driver support
22:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> may as well dump windows and go back to NixOS >:(
22:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> but ye
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> should probably just use msys
22:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> cross compiling scares me
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> cross compiling?
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> why would you have to cross compile
