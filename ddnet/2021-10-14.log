11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pls fix
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also a space before the closing quote in toggle is weird
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> post Oct 19, 2015
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @deen https://ddnet.tw/news/speedrun-com/ seems to be overwritten with the secured.gg news, and both links in the news list share the same url
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> is it a known problem that server/player/maps are displayed incorrectly? (first screen is the server where I want to go, the second screen is the server where I come)
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/898173099223179264/2021-10-14_13_35_52-DDNet_Client.png
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/898173118353383464/2021-10-14_13_36_38-DDNet_Client.png
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> newest client
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> since the new client it also does not update the servers properly, as if something is going wrong
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> before all servers were loaded one by one, now the list does not change when i click on refresh
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> very annoying, i change again to my old client üòÑ
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> yes, everything works in the old client (15.3-rc3)
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does take a second or two for the list to catch up, but it shouldn't be too stale
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> servers no longer load one by one, but cached inside the ddnet-cache file, no?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thats why you see almost nothing change visually except for the player count if you press refresh
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> it takes alot longer then that, atleast for me ^^
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> before you were contacting directly servers to retreive infos
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> now it's the master server that sends you the server list with all the infos (cached obv for a short delay, until it refreshes)ig
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no clue after how it's precisely done behind https master
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I usually have to wait like 10-20 seconds before I get an update to the serverlist
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> nothing changed when i press refresh
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> and why? b4 was fine
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> like learath said, you wont get an update immediately
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> ok maybe in the next client
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> i use my old client then
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> ok maybe in the next client its better
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> as for why: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> so I highly recommend sticking to the newer versions with said update
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should be about 5s iirc, weird that it's higher for some
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it does make it harder to flw too :/
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a fair price to pay for better ddos resistance I guess
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be cool if it cleaned your connected state from the list when you disconnect tho. I have myself added as a friend to check for fakes and I always check the server again like "wtf there was a friend there?" and it's just me, lagged behind
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so obviously not part of the sync but a special case for your own connection
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Learath2 is there a hotkey for refresh?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> f5
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> nerd
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> :justatest:
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can't test cus I'm on my phone
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> its the normal refresh button
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but makes sense
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> u can use it also in ur browser
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> u can also use it in ur browser
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> what about 0.7? ^^
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it still allows ddosers to collect player ips
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> welp :D
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> üêë
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/pr_fetch_two_masters
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> almost always instant server list
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is your problem only the server info?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it 5 seconds already? wasnt it 2 seconds before?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the reason is too much trafic, couldnt the tool ping servers with players on more often and just do the 5s for the servers that dont have a player on yet
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess the servers just need a way to ping the master server, then its easier to deal with info changes
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what is the interval where we replace the serverlist?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Jupstar ‚ú™ :transheart:
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Jupstar ‚ú™: there is a small discussion about frozen skins in #showroom on discord but I was wondering if you had any interest in the idea. more info in GitHub Discussions too
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm not an artist, i doubt the programming for it is very hard, its just a skin or overlay i guess
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes I was wondering about the programming part :D
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I'll let you know if anyone comes up with something
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Ravie did text wrap like that before?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it doesn't in anything xD
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> @lynn Tell me rn WeirdChamp
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @LCSG47 it's an overlay
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've discussed this before but idk if it's getting fixed
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not the entire ski no
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> drives me mad tho
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> skin*
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it in GitHub?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> won't get fixed prob if it's not
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Yea but how does it make sence to remove the tees eyes because he is frozen :ww:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok u don't understand xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so there's the normal skin right
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> on TOP of the skin there is a freeze layer
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ‚óêœâ‚óë (ru)> @lynn stop triggering people :justatest:  jk tho
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Yea i get it
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> impossible
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> Whats wrong with the normal freeze tee
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> When your unfrozen its removed
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Still doesnt make sence to cut someones legs off and remove his eyes because he is frozen?!
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't differentiate tees, doesn't allow u to see skin anymore, x_ninja just seems like a temp fix to me.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Are you jumping into cold water and lose your eyes and legs?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> I dont think so
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> uh I don't remember tbh, it might not be
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is ravie mad again about the chat or what text wrapping?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> YES!
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes good context clue reading
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we just moved from showroom again
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just accept that your eyes can read it better
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> LMAO
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> my eyes don't seem to agree
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and "old chat" is not old chat
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet you know its true, but cant accept it
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ‚óêœâ‚óë (ru)> don't offend Ravie, pls, he is my favourite art guy :brownbear:
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've said it before that I read chat before skipping reading who wrote the message, so the next line is just stupid to read
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've said it before that I read chat without skipping reading who wrote the message, so the next line is just stupid to read
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> something tells me it would take a tiny amount of time to make a setting for it lol
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> considering that way already existed
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he is free to use older clients
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at this point let's just make it discord style
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why can't old chat be what it's called?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :happy:
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @lynn\: do you know the old version?

16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> Btw is /swap coming back?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oof
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why isn't it even in line with the name xD
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> making room for the id
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and it's still a way smaller gap than                     this
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why does it not react to that setting
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> grrrr
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is literally an old screenshot btw
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how old
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> screenshot\_2020-08-26\_13-07-23
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/898214262470746162/unknown.png
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nobody uses such names tho xD
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already use an insanely long name
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> some people do use long names
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in the old one the gap is at least always consistent and very small
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and there's not even a gap if you have id's enabled like I do
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> image.png
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/898214607699722300/image.png
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you're not just reading the white part tho
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> at least I'm not, I like knowing who's talking :monkalaugh:
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes enable skins
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tees
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> new chat with skins is ü§¢
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and still has the gap issue
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> your peripheric view can easily see who is writting
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> without looking at the exact name
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the skin is even farther to the left
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why would I start reading 3 words in and just glance who is writing
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ‚óêœâ‚óë (ru)> ok, i'm off to the showroom, too stressful here :justatest:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also even if readability is arguable, that empty rectangle looks disgusting
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats something i'd say is indeed worth a discussion
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and also makes the chat take up more space on the screen
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but even for that i just got used to it, and my background color is grey, so i dont really notice it most of the time xD
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in my ridiculous WWWWWW name example it could turn a 1 line message into like 3 lines xD
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 16\:9 we could also increase the width, but that would trigger ppl even more xDD
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just tell me if it's ridiculously hard to fix in code, that I could understand
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but no gap is objectively better
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would defs increase code complexity
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but "hard" is hard to say
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i find it easy, but i also have to test it, which is annoying
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh its fixed code wise, but i dunno if admins want to reactivate it
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (@<B¬µmM>)

17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no problem lol I just randomly spotted that
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Index> Thanks for the notification, quite impressed by how you noticed that :o
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Index> I fixed the space before the quotes, unfortunately the space(s) after the .cfg are not visible in the editor, feels like that's a technical limitation of phbb? :<

19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ur alive!
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> chillerdragon: yo thx for the issue, the problem is that the mod is based on a very old version (maybe 8years ago) so i am lazy to update it i also dont have much time and as u know im still bad at ¬´¬†coding¬†¬ª. but if you want to help a bit for fun.. üòÜ
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i dont know how to ping for matricks users
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> it should work
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> and btw the client is not supposed to be used but would be cool to make some interesting things only for blockers, for exemple mapping
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lmfao
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do that and then press tab
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @louis tab hides chat
