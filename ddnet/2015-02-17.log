12:23 <@deen> I don't know why GER is down
12:23 <@deen> but this is more than 4 hours already, so not a ddos?
12:32 < xRoThx> deen: 
12:33 < xRoThx> I have contacted them. There has been a very large attack. I asked for more information about it. And it will remain down for 8 houres after the attack. 
12:33 <@deen> oh great =/
12:34 < xRoThx> I asked them more information and how to prevent this

14:11 < o_be_one> hellow
14:19 <@deen> hi
14:39 < Muttley> xRoThx, what hosting company in groningen where you talking about a while ago ?
14:41 < xRoThx> Muttley:  No idea. Its a friend of me that has colocation there
14:41 < Muttley> you know who
14:42 < Muttley> xRoThx, we are one of the 2 hosting providers there ;-)
14:43 < xRoThx> He has colocation untill may 2016. 
14:44 < xRoThx> He is willing to set up his machine & configure it. Then I could use it as hosting server for Teeworlds etc :)
14:47 < Muttley> xRoThx, do you know if his ip is within AS39704
14:50 < xRoThx> I have no idea about that

17:04 < o_be_one> hey guys
17:05 < laxadedi> hey
17:05 < o_be_one> do u have some things weird like some able to get rcon without pw ?
17:14 <@deen> ?
17:58 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
18:02 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: no? (?)
18:03 <@deen> oh, he means whether ddnet has backdoors?
18:03 <@deen> of course not...
18:05 <@deen> the only thing to note here is that ddnet client phones home occasionally, asking whether there's a new version
18:05 <@deen> so i could check which ip comes online when
18:05 <@deen> and ddnet client tries to download maps by http, so i could see who downloads which maps
18:06 <@deen> both can be disabled, but i don't consider that valuable information
19:55 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:55 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 606
19:55 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
19:55 <@deen> I believe we get more players just by running more servers (GER2)
19:55 <@deen> it's really weird, because I always make sure GER has 1-2 free servers
19:56 <@deen> i guess many just randomly join some server, so if we have more servers, more people come..
20:17 < Nimda> Desert Pain by JeanneDark just released on Moderate at 2015-02-17 20:13
20:26 < eeeee> ...so you're saying ddos attacks have caused ddnet to have more players?
20:26 < eeeee> ;D
20:27 <@deen> eeeee: yes, that too
20:28 <@deen> when people can't play all morning, they come on later instead :P
20:30 < eeeee> ger2 seems to be holding up, at least from the dashboards
20:30 < eeeee> not sure if lags or not
21:23 <@deen> haven't heard any complaints
21:39 < o_be_one> deen, im not talking about backdoor rumor
21:40 < o_be_one> some tees knows how to spoof ip
21:40 < o_be_one> "maybe", so i just wanted to check if it could be true or no
21:40 < o_be_one> not*
21:40 <@deen> yeah, there is a problem with spoofing and you can steal rcon from a logged in admin
21:40 < o_be_one> yeah
21:41 < o_be_one> someone told me about that
21:41 <@deen> ddnet client has a countermeasure against it, but with other clients and on non-ddnet servers you're vulnerable
21:41 < o_be_one> and some tw servers here to get your ip
21:41 < o_be_one> after, something like a ping let them know who to spoof
21:41 <@deen> ddnet client also has a countermeasure against them getting your ip/port combination
21:41 < o_be_one> that explains what i didnt seen this shit
21:41 <@deen> because then the attackers can just disconnect you
21:41 < o_be_one> oh thats explain why some player got that
21:42 <@deen> tell them to use ddnet client
21:42 < o_be_one> and they get ip of players whos refreshing server list ?
21:42 <@deen> yes
21:42 < o_be_one> woaw ..
21:42 < o_be_one> so the rumor about a TW 0.7 is true ?
21:42 <@deen> if they have ddnet client and use ddnet tab, they only send their ip to trusted servers (mine) :P
21:42 < o_be_one> oh really master server for ddnet tab is you lol ! x)
21:43 <@deen> so yeah, lots of attack vectors =/
21:44 < o_be_one> and is the TW 0.7 update is a rumor or a true thing ?
21:44 <@deen> no idea
21:46  * ngenechen slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
21:52 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: it looks like Oy might be pushing 0.7 out some day, without prior notice ^^
21:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: a better  fix would be to use different sockets for server browser and connection
21:53 < o_be_one> thank you heinrich5991 for this information
21:54 <@heinrich5991> (instead of "trusted servers")
21:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: we do that
21:56 <@heinrich5991> ah good!
21:57 <@deen> heinrich5991: but they can still try all ports and kick you
21:57 <@heinrich5991> deen: they need to try 1000*16000 ports
21:57 <@heinrich5991> I have no idea about scalability in that regard
21:57 <@deen> I even made it so that the ports are really random, because on windows they were just +1
21:58 <@deen> heinrich5991: nah, they probably know the name of the player they're targetting and where he's playing
21:58 <@deen> they can correlate names and servers by looking at the refresh and server join time
21:58 <@heinrich5991> ok
21:58 <@heinrich5991> that's quite nice
