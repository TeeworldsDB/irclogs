00:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> the new hip thing is to take the serial number of the hdd, hash it together with the cpu model and the gpu model
00:03 <+bridge> <Iza> so i guess that's bypassing the gdpr?
00:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> No, big companies just make you sign an EULA letting them handle that data, under gdpr you can store that kind of data if the user lets you
00:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> you just have to follow a couple formalities like guaranteeing that you'll delete them if requested by the user and some other things I don't remember
00:09 <+bridge> <Iza> ohh yeah i see
00:09 <+bridge> <Iza> but i guess ddnet wouldnt like such things
00:09 <+bridge> <Iza> to have an eula
00:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Even then, something like this can only work for us if we disallow all old clients (won't happen the pro players would sooner send a pipebomb to our houses) and we try to only allow the ddnet.org/steam versions of the pre-built cliend (won't happen @Ryozuki will curse us with a prayer to stallman)
00:25 <+bridge> <Iza> alright alright i get it, mac address wont be a thing
00:25 <+bridge> <Iza> or any unique identifier for the ddnet client
00:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> s\/cliend/client/ 😄
00:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> Be not saddened,  it honestly really wouldn't last long except against the naivest of players, authors of popular bot clients seem to follow our work on antibot/ban measures quite closely, it'd take a couple minutes for them to patch it out
00:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think some form of accounts should be our target as any form will help a lot with both moderation and new feature possibilities
00:35 <+bridge> <Iza> yea i guess thats the inevitable truth
00:35 <+bridge> <Iza> yes, an account system is long due
00:35 <+bridge> <Iza> we would just need to discuss the specifics as a community on it
00:36 <+bridge> <Iza> and for it not to be cancelled like last time

09:06 <+bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> This is the main accounts discussion issue, I posted a summary of the discussion at the bottom, that I made a month ago.
09:22 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nice summary ;). From what I can tell most of the ideas correspond to others so the devs are mostly in agreement. The problem is the players (Summary of the summary)
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103600531726946364/image.png
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u know what jumbo-build is?
10:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder why gentoo decided to rebuild firefox
10:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I know what is is
10:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's when u put all or multiple CPP files in one file . And only compile this file then. It's similar to lto.
10:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It also prevents odr
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :O
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and what does the %* mean here
10:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a portage thing
10:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it's a packet, i dunno what it is xd
10:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I only know it in context of compiling
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103601783336611840/image.png
10:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so jumbo build is added
10:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Enable unified build - combines source files to speed up build process, but requires more memory
10:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks when ddnet
10:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can already use it
10:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I fixed compile issues with it
10:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can enable it over cmake
10:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think it's called unified build there
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks lmfao
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35811741
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > y word. I'm sort of gob smacked this article exists.
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > I know there are nuances in the article, but my first impression was it's saying "we went back to basics and stopped using needless expensive AWS stuff that caused us to completely over architect our application and the results were much better". Which is good lesson, and a good story, but there's a kind of irony it's come from an internal Amazon team. As another poster commented, I wouldn't be surprised if it's taken down at some point.
10:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> prime video team at amazon stopped using AWS
10:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103603223010488410/image.png
10:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's always the hard challenge. Question is. Is the new approach harder to maintain? Is it harder to get stuff working? 
10:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But 90% if true is insane xD
10:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nooo way, I've been saying this to people all the time and they keep treating me like I'm crazy
10:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is that even
10:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'm too stupid
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> over architecting a app using 100 microservices
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kurbernetes
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> etc
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
10:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But why y word
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats my bad
10:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh ok xD
10:50 <+bridge> <Learath2> People have this delusion that everything has to be distributed, everything needs to be on the cloud, everything needs to be split into dozens of microservices
10:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it said "my word"
10:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> psst @Avolicious
10:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> "bUt AwS iS wEB SCaLe"
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Monolith approaches always best *cough* kernel.
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> today i had a teeworlds game spin off idea
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But yeah as said, it always depends on your goal
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i know it will end up at that
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a idea
10:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz im lazy
10:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> As with most things, the optimum probably lies somewhere between the two approaches
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂😂😂
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have that once per day
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill try to start it atleast
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with bevy
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Agreed
10:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yes, but using rust ofc
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :brownbear:  gl
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my idea is none other than a hotline miami style teeworlds game
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just can picture it already
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> shouldnt be too hard (said everyone)
10:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how would a tee look top down
10:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the ball and the feet xD
11:09 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Not everything, but it heavily depends on the use-case.
11:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> I have a metric for it. If you are having a chat with me, your project doesn't need the kind of scalability AWS offers
11:10 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Esp. build the infrastructure behind KoG with scalability in mind. Because of Geo restrictions, governments, laws and so on
11:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> good metric ngl
11:11 <+bridge> <Avolicious> AWS, GCP, Azure and all the other hyperscalers are building generic solutions for different use-cases
11:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> avolicious is not doing web scale
11:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he is doing
11:12 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Being decentralized implies other difficulties to solve, but thats another topic
11:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> game scale
11:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> badum tss
11:12 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Actually it would be fun to research this strategy
11:13 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Scaling a single gameserver with a shared current game "knowledge" doesnt sound easy for me
11:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Avolicious ever delved into erlang? or any BEAM lang like elixir or gleam
11:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they offer true scalability
11:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> AWS, GCP, Azure are very expensive hosters that are extremely reliable and offer an api to spin up servers quick. Atleast that's how I think of it
11:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> honestly erlang + aws can be rly powerful
11:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> more than erlang, OTP
11:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't see much value in them unless your demand is extremely unpredictable to the point that the ability to spin up servers quick becomes a good value proposition
11:15 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Btw we are currently testing this in my current company 😄
11:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> erlang can emulate a single computer with milliona of cores
11:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or nodes
11:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> since u can share the vm across computers
11:16 <+bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, who cares what I think, am only a rando on the internet that doesn't even use mongodb
11:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice, rust best
11:16 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Woooow, not using mongodb is a bummer
11:16 <+bridge> <Avolicious> you miss soo many good stuff
11:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Avolicious r u the ceo?
11:17 <+bridge> <Avolicious> nah, techlead
11:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont use mongo
11:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> psql master race
11:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if u cant model ur data in a solid structure its bad model
11:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> change my mind
11:17 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I loved this article 10 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25990400
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> mongo is not ACID compliant
11:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u might as well write to dev null
11:18 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Different sources? How to store them?
11:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nosql is a bizarre phenomenon. I have this conspiracy theory that it's created solely so people who have a hard time putting their data in a model can also code
11:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103611777046020218/image0.jpg
11:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like the no code or low code shenanigans
11:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just reading those words i chuckle
11:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont get the german meme
11:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :justatest:
11:20 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Storing data from different sources, who are totally different at all, but you still want them to be searchable
11:20 <+bridge> <Avolicious> "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"
11:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> diferent sources?
11:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> explain more
11:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I also don't like that last sentence you sent. Maybe that's why I don't enjoy nosql either
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u can model data always, what changes is the level of detail
11:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've always been a fan of rigid protocols
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> same
11:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> predictable too
11:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> Be liberal in what you accept is why chromium is like 20 million lines of code with a cve every other week
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is good, through this chat i can make ur company invest in rust
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Indoctrination
11:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :shut:
11:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> Rustelevangelist
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need a ferris plushie
11:23 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I never said that rust is not the promising future 😄
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> good good
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:24 <+bridge> <Avolicious> We already switched some of our core legacy apps to a newer ( learath will hate me ) rust based cloud native solution
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :poggers2:
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cloud native web scale rust!
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what does cloud native even mean
11:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Rust based 👍
11:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Cloud native :ohno:
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a new human race from the clouds emerged
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the natives will invade
11:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and bring rust into our homes
11:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm guessing cloud native means whatever the person who made the software defines it as
11:25 <+bridge> <Avolicious> https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-native?hl=en
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet server is cloud native
11:26 <+bridge> <Avolicious> xDDDDD
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it speaks to the cloud through the udp api
11:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> The "Contact Sales" button at the very top should be a red flag 😄
11:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> ... Learath... its google, what do you expect...
11:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Nah, but for real. We switched from a monolithic java ee app to a very new modular rust based solution. splitting the application in smaller parts and rethink our use-cases
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well u left java so it cant be bad
11:28 <+bridge> <Avolicious> We still have Java 😄
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Now the next step is to go to a monolithic rust application <a:CoolPika:877946626721857536>
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Avolicious do u use the native vm thing, or the new gc z smth
11:28 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But the cool kidz like me are preferring kotlin
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Avolicious r u doing cool rust projects
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats the pay
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :santatrollet:
11:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, chopping up applications isn't a bad idea. I think the thing that's very slippery is the thinking that all these pieces need to be infinitely scalable
11:30 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Never talk about money
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u mean here
11:30 <+bridge> <Avolicious> y
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ok
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont mind talking money
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:31 <+bridge> <Avolicious> you can still talk with your money
11:31 <+bridge> <Avolicious> but not about :gigachad:
11:31 <+bridge> <Learath2> Americans and people who make between 50k and 200k€ always say that
11:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Above 200k people love to brag. Below 50k people love to complain
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Tbh, because it doesnt matter at all
11:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i make less than 50k but i can kinda brag in spain :justatest:
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> money matters to pay stuff, but not in front of others
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> eh
11:33 <+bridge> <Avolicious> As rust developer?
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> money rules the workd
11:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
11:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Oh okay
11:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a salary over 50k in spain is rly hard
11:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> for real?
11:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont know anyone with it
11:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I know a lot of programmers they work in madrid, they are a way > 50k
11:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
11:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i plan to
11:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> r they senior
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have 2y xp
11:35 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Ah, yeah might be
11:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> around here avg is much higher than 50
11:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> for junior
11:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> senior make 90+
11:35 <+bridge> <Avolicious> They are mostly >40
11:35 <+bridge> <Avolicious> They are mostly >40 yrs
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i actually got some tentative offers for 60k tho
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but the project wasnt as cool
11:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like making a compiler
11:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
11:36 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Urgh, a compiler for another  programming lang based on rust? xD
11:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not based on rust
11:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nah he just likes that
11:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> In italy I only know one guy with a 50k€ salary
11:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> And he is unhappy with it because he'd be paid more in the USA, absolutely delusional behaviour
11:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im 22
11:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Literally lives like a king here
11:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have the highest salary among my friends
11:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 23 soon
11:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 🥳
11:37 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Yeah US is crazy, I also had offers from over there
11:37 <+bridge> <Pipou> Being a teacher is barely 24k in France :justatest:
11:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> im 17 and in post-college level internship :justatest:
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is college uni?
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> messed up
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im always confused
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 17 and uni?
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> r u a genius
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> no uni
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> too expensive
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk man
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> they like me
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah u meant the level of internship
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> ya
11:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean i work with mlir
11:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> peers
11:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its considered post doctorate
11:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> it’s fascinating shit
11:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> The places in the US where you make insane money are also insanely expensive to live in. I have a friend with a salary of around 150k$. They still share a house with 2 other people
11:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
11:40 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Well in my case the company would pay my rent, but I dont like the US medical system, tax system nor the other systems
11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with my salary i can live alone but im living with parents saving money :justatest:
11:40 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I am a proud european pepo
11:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> owning a house w/ $150k salary is not outlandish around here. but around super dense areas like the coasts your house is either in the suburbs or tiny and shitty
11:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> this just seems like a smarter arrangement
11:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> not like they couldn’t have their own place if they wanted to
11:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Eh, they could rent a tiny studio alone but that's about it
11:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> are they in NYC or something
11:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> The housing market in the bay area is fucked beyond your imagination
11:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> rent that crazy is reserved for like 3 areas
11:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> ah
11:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> yep
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> i work in boulder but im like 30 mins away by interstate xd
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> not unreasonable
11:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/america-hurricane-happy4th-of-july-america-flag-independence-day-gif-21259025
11:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> It seems your best bet in the US is to just live in one of those exurbs of the city and just take a car into the city
11:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and take care to not be shot
11:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> Which I could never do. I just despise traffic
11:45 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Be Elon Musk and build an underground travel system
11:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> traffic is just a part of life
11:45 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Or go into the opposite direction and build vehicles you can fly with
11:46 <+bridge> <Avolicious> but dont sell them, because all the richis will get one too, and then the air will get crowded too 😦
11:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> Everywhere I've lived so far has had a way to avoid it, a revolutionary technology called trains 😛
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> round these parts i mean
11:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> train is a joke
11:47 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Trains urgh.... have you ever used the Deutsche Bahn @Learath2 ?
11:47 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I doubt it
11:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> I have taken 2 trains in germany, but I know I got lucky and they were on time 😄
11:47 <+bridge> <Avolicious> This is not even lucky, this is a god sent proof
11:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> trains in tokyo
11:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> You guys need to take a look at how italy does things. I take italian trains all the time, I never saw a delay longer than 10 minutes
11:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> god sent
11:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
11:48 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Last time I used the train for a meeting in Berlin, they just cancelled the train 10 minutes before departure
11:49 <+bridge> <Avolicious> After that I never ever used the train in germany
11:49 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Only going by car or airplanes
11:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> If you really absolutely have to have capitalism on the railroads your best bet is to steal the japanese or italian model. Otherwise just renationalize the entire thing
11:50 <+bridge> <Avolicious> whats the latest train in japan? 13 seconds or so? and they even apologized for it
11:51 <+bridge> <Avolicious> imagine you have to wait 13 seconds....
11:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> Sometimes trains are late due to uncontrollable externalities. Like "Human related incident"
11:51 <+bridge> <Avolicious> 20 seconds, sorry https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42009839
11:52 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Okay, gonna go back into the meeting. @Ryozuki keep me posted with the good stuff of the rust ecosystem 😄
11:52 <+bridge> <Devinci> Meanwhile in France....
11:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf, what kind of teacher. And how much with taxes paid and how many hours? 24k sounds insanely low
11:54 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've had decent luck with french trains too. As long as there isn't a strike they seem to operate on time but when is there not a strike in France 😄
11:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> Tbh sounds about correct to me if it's after taxes
11:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> Teachers are hilariously underpaid everywhere outside the nordics
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If after taxes it's okish
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But also still depends on what kind of teacher ofc xd
11:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> LOL, just noticed this isn't #off-topic
11:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it's development of society
11:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Completely correct channel
12:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
12:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> career development
12:01 <+bridge> <Pipou> Middle school to high school (6th to 12th grade). About 1600€/month after taxes for 18h/week but usually people tend to forget you still have to work when you get home
12:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Pipou are u a teacher?
12:03 <+bridge> <Pipou> You still have to mark papers, prepare lesson plans + extra hours at school meetings etc
12:03 <+bridge> <Pipou> Yeah
12:04 <+bridge> <Pipou> (hours that aren't paid)
12:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah I live in a teachers family 😂😂
12:04 <+bridge> <Pipou> 😄
12:04 <+bridge> <Pipou> You clearly don't do it for the money in France
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah for highschool the payment on Germany is much higher
12:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u must keep the tradition, become a rust teacher
12:05 <+bridge> <Pipou> I think France has the lowest wage for teachers
12:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My brother is CS teacher
12:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll force him to reach it
12:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Teach
12:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
12:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> After c
12:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> That is messed up
12:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> And they wonder why people are getting dumber
12:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ai will carry
12:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For individual learning. Teachers will still be needed to monitor generally
12:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But in Germany we have like 1 teacher for 30 kids.. this was never supposed to work
12:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also look at old gen, they have much worse education xD
12:17 <+bridge> <Devinci> 30 kids per class is what I always had... seems still okayish
12:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It only works BCS kids aren't honest if they fall behind
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in spain is the norm
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but u dont know a class with 14
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u get way more professor time
12:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for ur problems
12:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If all kids would start asking questions it would break apart
12:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> same
12:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> not that it’s okay
12:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> i really think teachers should only have a handful
12:18 <+bridge> <Pipou> 14 is great, it's more dynamic and you can help case by case more than you would with 30 pupils
12:19 <+bridge> <Pipou> I already has a class with 40 pupils, it just sucked
12:19 <+bridge> <Pipou> It's hard to keep them all focused
12:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
12:45 <+bridge> <Learath2> About 20 is where it seems to break down. Atleast from what I could observe as a student
12:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> I can't imagine 40 😄

15:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this interests u specifically
15:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks nice too
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Our goal is to stabilize the MVP for Rust 1.74, which will be released on 2023-11-16. The branch window for this feature opens on July 14 and closes on August 24. To actually stabilize in 1.74, we want to leave room for bug fixes that may arise before the release branch is cut. The key milestones for this goal are as follows:
15:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Finally. Just recently came across this xd
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u using async?
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only for networking
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u could use mio directly
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio
15:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is quite low level

15:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ravie btw u always mention rust is like the metalic rust, but its actually named after a fungus
15:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Where rust front end
15:54 <+bridge> <Ravie> that somehow makes it an even worse name
15:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean the fungus looks like rust. I think it's cool xd
15:55 <+bridge> <Ravie> yeah but still what does it have to do with programming
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what does the letter C has to do with programming
15:56 <+bridge> <Ravie> I'd say you don't really want either kind of rust inside your pc if anything
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> c++
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> python
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a snake
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Defs
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> slow snake
15:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The snake under the programming languages
15:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rust is ravenclaw
15:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CPP is Gryffindor
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Python Slytherin
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Java Hufflepuff

16:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks this is the scala language dev i think
16:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok not dev of the language, but like a heavy promoter
16:25 <+bridge> <Voxel> smokes a fat blunt
16:25 <+bridge> <Voxel> do i even need to say it

16:27 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> isn't it because it was after A and B or smt?
16:30 <+bridge> <Voxel> :(
19:04 <+bridge> <Devinci> Probably, cause even D exists.

19:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its such a unique thing
19:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and rusty
19:24 <+bridge> <Voxel> it better be fun to play at least

20:21 <+bridge> <Teero> like externally
20:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
20:22 <+bridge> <Chairn> because it's easier to design like that
20:22 <+bridge> <Chairn> but then compiler cant globally optimize
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nuclear must be 0% tho
20:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> im a uni teacher, im paid 24k before taxes
20:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
20:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i get 33k
20:28 <+bridge> <Chairn> because it came after B language that also came after A
20:29 <+bridge> <Chairn> as a teacher? i thought you were in private company
20:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> private
20:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no teacher xd
20:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i woulf say in spain most earn 22-26
20:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in general, not it
20:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 22k bro, wtf
20:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how much do u pay for rents? 1k per month?
20:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u end up with nothing xd
20:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u work, just to pay rent and food
20:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> awesome life
20:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in a city, probs that
20:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats why living alone is hard
20:47 <+bridge> <Chairn> i pay 500€ for rent on a 1.8k€ net wage
20:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats impossible in barcelona xd
20:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh wow 1.8k is weird
20:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u almost pay no taxes?
20:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye 1.8k with 24k is a lot
20:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i get 2.1k with 33k
20:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even that is still okish
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think 33k would be around 1.9k in ger
20:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> before i had 25k salary in another company, i got 1.6k iirc
20:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> i pay 60€ taxes per month that is already deducted on my paycheck
20:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> i got 2100€ before taxes
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and health care?
20:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u work in public sector?
20:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in germany u pay like at least 300€ just for health care already
20:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> here u pay for IRPF
20:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> mainly
20:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/en_gb/irpf.html
20:53 <+bridge> <Chairn> oh, actually im paid 1650 net...
20:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that makes more sense
20:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip xD
20:53 <+bridge> <Chairn> i don't pay healthcare cuz im public servant

20:54 <+bridge> <Chairn> i don't understand the line on my paycheck 😄
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i dont pay healthcare directly, but indirectly through IRPF
20:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we also have such a system, but its not trivial to get in
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its like 18% of my net monthly salary
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not net
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dirty
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> before taxes
20:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk the name

20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dude
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its not argentina
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its global company
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually they will move the base here
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and also open one in france
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its international
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i also had that thought first xd
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> which is exactly why they move out of there
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz the bad view
20:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki did u know there is barcelona in venezuela?
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye xd
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fake city
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> valencia too xD
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they steal spain cities
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> spain went there...
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :blobwhistle:
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> poor majas
21:01 <+bridge> <Chairn> what's tributacion?
21:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur contribution, or what u gotta pay
21:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> irpf is the main tax
21:02 <+bridge> <Chairn> first seems to be general tax, then professionnal formation, then unemployment benefits
21:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> translation of irpf purpose
21:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Why is personal income tax paid? The main purpose is to respond to the principle established in the Spanish Constitution that all Spaniards must contribute to the support of public expenses. On the other hand, it tries to favor those people who are in a more precarious situation.
21:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u pay less irpf if u get  less
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and its taxed at parts
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for example
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the first 14k is taxed at X%, the 14k to 24k at Y%

21:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but mold generally so fast
21:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and release perf doesnt matter to me 😄
21:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd

23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lol that again
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd love to understand it. It must be something really stupid xd
23:36 <+bridge> <Voxel> ive been wondering
23:36 <+bridge> <Voxel> what do you think is the latest "its not a bug its a feature" thing in ddnet
23:46 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Vulkan
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think this looks suspicious:
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ```cpp
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> STextContainer &GetTextContainer(int Index)
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> {
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>     dbg_assert(Index >= 0, "Text container index was invalid.");
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>     if(Index >= (int)m_vpTextContainers.size())
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>     {
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>         int Size = (int)m_vpTextContainers.size();
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>         for(int i = 0; i < (Index + 1) - Size; ++i)
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>             m_vpTextContainers.push_back(new STextContainer());
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>     }
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> 
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3>     return *m_vpTextContainers[Index];
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> }
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ```
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> This could create text contained unexpectedly I think
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think this looks suspicious:
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ```cpp
23:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> STextContainer &GetTextContainer(int Index)

23:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> }
