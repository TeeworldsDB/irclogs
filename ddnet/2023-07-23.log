02:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> at-will afk emote would be nice
02:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> for hammer hit maps when u get separated from ur dummy
02:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> and ppl try to grab it thinking you're there
02:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> as well as for when u are going places and dont want to wait for the timeout to put u in sleep
02:17 < bridge_> <murpi> bind a +left; afk-emote
02:17 < bridge_> <murpi> bind d +right; afk-emote
02:17 < bridge_> <murpi> bind w +jump; afk-emote
02:17 < bridge_> <murpi> bind mouse1 +fire; afk-emote
02:17 < bridge_> <murpi> bind mouse2 +hook; afk-emote
02:23 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> Is it even getting approved when im Adding this real Quick tomorrow? Its a one line Code üòÑ
02:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes, like this
02:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> that would be nice
02:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> :D
03:44 < bridge_> <bencie.> yaa
03:44 < bridge_> <bencie.> f3f3
03:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> i brought it up before but nobody even seemed to understand why i would want that
03:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> "just change name :3Head:"
03:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> my dummy is not called [d] ewan so ppl think he's sentient
03:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> and grab him when im right there

09:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> chillerdragon
09:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> !
09:06 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
09:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
09:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Woah this bot
10:06 < ChillerDragon> just had a "unbindall" moment in csgo xd
10:06 < ChillerDragon> followed some redditer on how to unlock inhuman hax using console
10:06 < ChillerDragon> and wasnt able to defuse the bomb anymore
10:07 < ChillerDragon> anyways i noticed that in csgo when you bind multiple actions to one key it still shows up in the ui
10:07 < ChillerDragon> never considered it a bug in ddnet more like a feature to not see that xd
10:07 < ChillerDragon> but maybe it would be cool
11:17 < bridge_> <teero777> Hey would dynamic serverside map changes be possible?
11:17 < bridge_> <teero777> That would open a whole nother dimension of serverside gui and gamemodes
11:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Not without extensive client modifications, it‚Äôd feel awful with maploads
11:19 < bridge_> <teero777> The server tells the client what part of the map changed and then the client modifies itself accordingly
11:20 < bridge_> <teero777> I don't mean whole map loads I just mean small changes like a few block or adding a quad for gui etc
11:20 < bridge_> <teero777> I don't mean whole map loads I just mean small changes like a few blocks or adding a quad for gui etc
11:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> this would be awesome
11:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> but totally not in the cards atm if i had to guess
11:23 < bridge_> <teero777> true. you could do basically do serversidd graphics
11:23 < bridge_> <teero777> true. you could do basically do serverside graphics
11:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> Would work relatively easily if you only have some specific tile layers that can change, for example to support minetee mods where you can remove and create individual tiles
11:25 < bridge_> <teero777> ye was just thinking about that gamemode
11:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> Would probably cause lags if too much of the map changes at the same time
11:26 < bridge_> <teero777> Hmmm
11:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> And of course it would not be compatible with old clients
11:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> So if you want most players to use the feature you need to wait maybe another year after releasing it before you use it so most users updated
11:31 < bridge_> <S·¥è·¥ú ü> is DDNet Client support 128 player in scoreboard ?
11:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Nope
11:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Well actually maybe? I forgot if we merged that patch
12:06 < ChillerDragon> server side map patches would be so epic indeed
12:06 < ChillerDragon> i would code it my self but im too nob

12:19 < bridge_> <totar> demos would get complicated with dynamic map changes
12:21 < bridge_> <learath2> Twas' I
12:21 < bridge_> <learath2> It is not a bot that does anything for the public, maybe I should restrain it to internal channels
12:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> try @DDNet
12:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> mm he‚Äôs still sleeping
12:27 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 nah pls keep it in #dev i want to access internal ressources! But also please make it respond less with "Command not found!" for example not for those "!" "!help" "!p" "!sh" "!py" "!js" "!info" "!mods" "!ping"
12:27 < ChillerDragon> the standalone ! is a false positive imp
12:27 < ChillerDragon> the others a conflicts with chilerbot which was here first!
12:28 < bridge_> <learath2> All the commands it supports require moderator or admin role though, not much to explore in it
12:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> also do like ‚Äúcommand not found, do !help for help‚Äù

12:31 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/lerato/ddnet-discordbot-ng
12:31 < ChillerDragon> a found it
12:31 < bridge_> <learath2> The source is at https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot iirc
12:31 < ChillerDragon> yeye
12:32 < ChillerDragon> different name
12:32 < ChillerDragon> missleading
12:32 < bridge_> <learath2> The ng one is my testbed, not the same bot
12:32 < ChillerDragon> obfuscated open soruce
12:33 < bridge_> <learath2> It is a bit of a mess since it was never supposed to be a permanent bot. It was supposed to be a debugging tool to find an issue with bans not going through with the old bot
12:33 < ChillerDragon> !die
12:33 < bridge_> <YADDB> Access denied
12:33 < ChillerDragon> oof!
12:34 < bridge_> <learath2> Also was where I was practicing rust error handling by hand, so it's a little disgusting for that reason too
12:34 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690108499.png
12:34 < ChillerDragon> rust?
12:34 < ChillerDragon> seems like im looking at wrong repo still
12:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> huh
12:34 < bridge_> <learath2> Lol so many repos with the same name
12:35 < ChillerDragon> "it open source"
12:35 < ChillerDragon> just find the code
12:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Try https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet-discordbot
12:35 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/lerato/discordbot
12:35 < ChillerDragon> got it
12:35 < bridge_> <learath2> It's open source if you can find it yeah
12:35 < bridge_> <learath2> No wait the first link I sent was fine
12:35 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Why did you bait me with the screenshot
12:36 < ChillerDragon> because i didnt click your virus link
12:36 < ChillerDragon> and just removed the -ng xd
12:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> Professional troll
12:36 < bridge_> <learath2> I swear everything you ask or do is tiring to me

16:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> ChillerDragon: I remeber saying something like that to you aswell a few years ago
16:09 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> My stomach is not feeling well, it had too much alcohol yesterday
16:30 < bridge_> <raviesenpai> Robby bubble hitting hard :justatest:
16:31 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> I dont know if you can't read, but I said alcohol :)
16:31 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Not the drinks you take
16:31 < bridge_> <raviesenpai> I don't drink at all
16:31 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Hopefully also no water from now on
16:33 < bridge_> <raviesenpai> Tough times atm so no water for me
16:33 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> :feelsbadman:
16:33 < bridge_> <raviesenpai> :(
19:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> bad idea
19:25 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm what is the spawn radius?
19:25 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1132725216867524618/image.png
19:27 < bridge_> <teero777> maybe some check to not spawn the player with a diff if ther is a solo tile at where you spawn
19:27 < bridge_> <teero777> maybe there should be some check to not spawn the player with a diff if ther is a solo tile at where you spawn
19:27 < bridge_> <teero777> maybe there should be some check to not spawn the player with a diff if there is a solo tile at where you spawn
19:27 < bridge_> <teero777> maybe there should be some check to not spawn the player with a diff if there is a solo tile at where you spawn at
20:11 < bridge_> <coke1465> yes its know bug
20:11 < bridge_> <coke1465> u can avoid it like this
20:11 < bridge_> <coke1465> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1132736874121797793/2023-07-23_20_11_35-DDNet_Client.png
20:12 < bridge_> <teero777> ye
22:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i suck at coding
22:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> even with Ryozuki's website i couldnt figure so much stuff out its horrible
22:01 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i hate this üò¶
22:02 < bridge_> <Voxel> what are you trying to do
22:02 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i wanted to add a simple /afk command, to set a player in afk state and if in one out of it.. i cant seem to either find the afk emote, nor how to correctly implement it if i were to find it
22:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> dont we have /spec and /pause
22:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> yeah its just a gimmick
22:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> but i was curious and now i am stuck
22:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> emoticons would be in datasrc/network.py
22:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> in the Emoticons array
22:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure a /afk command would be accepted if proposed
22:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @blaiszephyr if you still want to find it, search for `AFK` (all uppercase) in the code base
22:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I only see four very relevant results for that
23:19 < bridge_> <borsmatyas02> hi i need a program for making skins or a template png with max size of elements and origo
23:41 < bridge_> <totar> no more bors bot on the github anymore?
23:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes. bors will eventually shut down
23:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the suggested replacement (by the bors hoster) is github merge queue
23:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> if anything i was thinking of a way to immediately get weak hook without specing and unspecing
23:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> idk if ppl want that since ppl want weak hook gone
