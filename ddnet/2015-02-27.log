00:39 < XXLTomate> pong
05:06 < eeeee> sup guys
05:06 < eeeee> ddnet much?
05:07 <@deen> huh?
05:08 < eeeee> nvm, just wondering about low activity here
05:09 <@deen> i was busy optimizing http servers :P
05:09 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/nim-http-speedup
05:09 <@deen> 1.5 million requests per second are fun
05:30 < eeeee> nice
05:31 < eeeee> should also write a simple db engine
05:32 < eeeee> i once played with python-sqlparse and llvmpy, made a db thingy which does select aggregates with where and group by
05:33 < eeeee> processed around 1B rows/second (capped by cpu<->mem bandwidth)
16:18 < o_be_one> hi :)
16:19 < laxadedi> hi
16:48 < Muttley_> hey guys
16:49 < Muttley_> quick question how can i make multiple from to portals which are linked
16:49 < Muttley_> they all seem to be random if i place them
16:50 < Muttley_> ah nvm
16:50 < Muttley_> found the number thing
17:35 < Muttley_> gdamn someone is using my nick on quakenet ;-)
17:35 <@heinrich5991> #Elite-Dangerous
17:36 <@heinrich5991> "that bastard is in there"
17:36 < Muttley_> yea
17:36 < Muttley_> lets hunt him ;-)
17:39 < Muttley_> heinrich5991, do you know something about mapping ddnet ?
17:39 <@heinrich5991> not much, but maybe I can help. what's your question?
17:39 < Muttley_> i'm trying to figure out those checkpoints
17:39 < laxadedi> which checkpoints ?
17:40 < laxadedi> CP for teleporters ?
17:40 < Muttley_> uhm i have them under teleport
17:40 < laxadedi> or standart checkpoints ?
17:40 < Muttley_> uhm ;-)
17:40 < Muttley_> thats why my question here it comes
17:40 < Muttley_> :-)
17:40 <@heinrich5991> is that your question?
17:40 < Muttley_> no typing
17:41 < Muttley_> i want to do the following -> freeze if before checkpoint then go back to start if cp1 is reached and you fall go to cp1 if cp2 and you fall after go to cp2
17:41 < Muttley_> is that possible
17:42 < Muttley_> or do i need to expain more... hard to type out
17:42 <@heinrich5991> you want to have checkpoints that know on which checkpoint you have been last
17:42 <@heinrich5991> and teleport you back there if you fall into some kind of reset/death/whatever tile?
17:42 < Muttley_> yes i want it on a freeze part
17:42 < Muttley_> quite long one
17:42 < Muttley_> so that if you fail half way you dont have to start over all again
17:43 < Muttley_> i could do it with normal from to tele
17:43 < Muttley_> but thats not nice
17:43 < Learath2> there should be a checkpoint teleporter
17:44 < Learath2> that takes you to the last cp if not one should be added imo
17:44 <@heinrich5991> need two different kinds of checkpoint marking then though
17:44 <@heinrich5991> one: checkpoint X
17:44 <@heinrich5991> the other: checkpoint X, teleport here
17:47 < Muttley_> yea but what if you skip the checkpoint then it should go back to start
17:49 <@heinrich5991> you take checkpoint 1, don't take 2, and fall into the "checkpoint teleporter"
17:49 <@heinrich5991> should it go to start or to checkpoint 1?
17:50 < Muttley_> yes
17:50 < Muttley_> checkpoint 1
17:50 < Muttley_> because you went to 1
17:50 <@heinrich5991> yea
17:50 <@heinrich5991> so it should teleport to the last checkpoint you went to
17:52 < Muttley_> yes, but idk how to link those correct
18:32 < guenstig_werben> Tobii: ping
18:35 <@deen> pong
18:36 <@deen> oh right, there was a name^^
18:37 < guenstig_werben> @deen ping
20:14 <@deen> guenstig_werben: yes?
20:14 <@deen> guenstig_werben: you should just say what you want instad of pinging people
20:19 < guenstig_werben> @deen this ping was fun...  That ping to tobii is if he is active
20:22 < XXLTomate> guenstig_werben: what do you advertise?
20:22 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate hi
20:23 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate kennst mich noch?
20:23 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate hast mir damals geholfen mit meinem Server @xxl-clan.com
20:23 < XXLTomate> oh ja ganz dunkel d√§mmerts
20:24 < XXLTomate> btw this is an english channel 
20:30 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate hast du Lust auf ein neues Projekt mit mir?
20:30 < guenstig_werben> Ddblock
20:34 < mentaltrb> hi, can somebody help me with my problem?
20:36 < XXLTomate> guenstig_werben: isn't there already a block version based on xxlddrace?
20:36 < XXLTomate> at least somone wanted to make one.
20:37 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate tobii did, gave to me a non final version but it seems that he died...
20:37 < guenstig_werben> And the only one other does have sources won't give me
20:38 < XXLTomate> mentaltrb: just explain your problem here, sometimes it takes a while till someone sees/can answer it
20:38 < mentaltrb> So, uh, I got a new internet provider today, better speed&stuff, but!
20:39 < mentaltrb> I can't find any servers in teeworlds.
20:39 < mentaltrb> And in, like, any game.
20:40 < mentaltrb> and yeah, this is my problem, does somebody know how to fix it?
20:42 < guenstig_werben> Restart router
20:43 < mentaltrb> Hm, I'll try it now.
20:43 < guenstig_werben> Maybe configure firewall to let master1.teeworlds.com, master2.teeworlds.com..
20:43 < guenstig_werben> through
20:55 < mentaltrb> nope, doesn't hel
20:55 < mentaltrb> p
20:55 < mentaltrb> i have this in masters.cfg
20:55 < mentaltrb> master1.teeworlds.com  master2.teeworlds.com 198.251.81.153:8300 master3.teeworlds.com 188.165.209.72:8300 master4.teeworlds.com 
20:55 < mentaltrb> everything fine?
21:03 <@heinrich5991> yup
21:04 < mentaltrb> damn.
21:08 <@deen> can you just connect to servers directly?
21:08 < mentaltrb> nope
21:08 <@deen> then udp is blocked i guess
21:09 < mentaltrb> how can I unlock it?
21:09 <@deen> that's a weird provider if they just block udp
21:09 <@deen> no idea
21:09 < mentaltrb> fuck/
21:10 <@deen> I've never heard of anything like that
21:11 <@deen> probably best to ask your provider if this happened after switching providers
21:11 <@deen> maybe in the router udp is blocked somehow, you could try enabling it
21:12 < mentaltrb> hm. I'll check it.
21:25 < mentaltrb> i think i cant enable it
21:51 <@deen> mentaltrb: Then all you can do is play here: http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html
21:54 < Learath2> deen: just noticed cant write anything outside TYPE_SAVE using storage.cpp functions
21:55 < Learath2> you know of any particular reason why that might be ? :P
21:56 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: because the other directories aren't neccesarily writable
21:56 <@heinrich5991> and in proper installations certainly aren't
21:56 <@heinrich5991> -c+s
21:56 < Learath2> well in proper installations the self replacing executable wont quite work
21:57 <@heinrich5991> maybe put the executable in the ~/. folder and start that one if it's present?
21:57 <@heinrich5991> I think that's what MC does
22:10 < mentaltrb> @deen, i can't play even there
22:11 < Learath2> mentaltrb: you dont see servers on the js client either ?
22:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 closed pull request #124: [WIP]Autoupdate revamped (DDRace64...dd_autoupdate) http://git.io/zNzUgQ
22:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #154: [Testing]Autoupdate (DDRace64...pr_autoupdate) http://git.io/xmnS
22:15 < mentaltrb> i see them
22:15 < mentaltrb> but i cant connect
22:15 < Learath2> if you are on firefox you need to wait a bit
22:16 < eeeee> wait until Learath2 implements some server list http fetching, that is
22:16 < mentaltrb> wow
22:16 < eeeee> ;D
22:16 < mentaltrb> it works
22:16 < Learath2> :D
22:17 < Learath2> eeeee: done with the autoupdate doing the server list now
22:17 < eeeee> awesome
22:17 < Learath2> obv until someone tests autoupdate and is horribly broken then i need to go back fix that :D
22:18 < mentaltrb> so
22:18 < mentaltrb> my server list should work now?
22:18 < Learath2> no the webclient works your own client seems to be your isp 
22:19 < eeeee> that made no sense
22:19 < Learath2> the problem on the native client that you downloaded seems to be caused by your isp
22:19 < mentaltrb> fuq
22:19 < Learath2> the webclient working doesnt magically fix that
22:20 < Learath2> eeeee: better?
22:20 < eeeee> better than "your own client seems to be your isp" at least :P
22:21 < Learath2> anyone here with windows feel free to give autoupdate a try and someone with linux pls confirm it compiles
22:21 < eeeee> ddnet client is pretty advanced but doesn't yet bundle an internet service provider function
22:22 < eeeee> i can try with windows at home
22:22 < eeeee> it doesn't work for mac yet, rite?
22:22 < Learath2> and eeeee would you mind checking if it still compiles on mac osx might have forgot to put some ifdefs 
22:22 < eeeee> kk
22:22 < Learath2> i ifdefd mac out couldnt figure out hao2 without a working mac :P
22:23 < eeeee> i'm gonna nitpick your formatting also
22:25  * Learath2 prays that eeeee doesn't see all the bad brackets
22:28 < Learath2> hi Ama
22:30 < Ama> Hi learath just saw you making a account in the forum :D
22:32 < Learath2> yep wanted to write something but forgot about it :D
22:37 < Ama> Btw i have a question is someone going to fix the prediction when speeders have a max speed becouse it just shakes my screen XD
22:38 <@deen> Ama: only with f1, cl_predict_ddrace 1, not with 0, right?
22:38 <@deen> i think i tried disabling speeder prediction, but it was even worse for me
22:38 <@deen> no idea how to fix it properly
22:39 < Ama> wait i will try now 
22:39 < Ama> yh that works perfectly fine 
22:41 < Ama> so is it better to keep it 0 or will that break something ?
22:41 <@deen> it will disable all ddrace related predictions i guess
22:41 <@deen> i guess you will notice :P
22:41 < Ama> so hookthru will be messed up 
22:42 <@deen> not sure what that includes exactly
22:42 < Learath2> deen: what is IServerBrowser::SET_DDNET_ADD 
22:42 < Learath2> seems to be not used
22:42 <@deen> Learath2: i see it used, serverbrowser.cpp:577
22:43 < Learath2> thats the part which evaluates the arguments but as an arguments its never passed
22:43 <@deen> no, it's passed there
22:44 < Learath2> oh wow my text editor just decided not to show that match :D
23:17 < eeeee> Learath2: yep still worx on fag os
23:19 < eeeee> (the pr_autoupdate branch)
23:38 < Learath2> eeeee: when is the nitpick ? :D
23:42 < Learath2> well ill sleep will read tomorrow
23:47 < eeeee> yeah i'll do that later
23:47 < eeeee> have to nitpick some stuff at work first
23:50 < Learath2> eh forgot aout the time difference 
23:50 < Learath2> what time is it there eeeee ?
23:50 < eeeee> 14:50
23:50 < eeeee> well not that we're really getting much work done, it's friday after all :D
23:50 < Learath2> :D 
23:51 < Learath2> well nite
23:51 < eeeee> nite
