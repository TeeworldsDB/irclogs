00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> generated something for yall 😹
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> darn it
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ticket control during advent of code
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> complexity for my solution for day3 is like O(N^3) 🥹
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> but hey, it works
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> first try
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :greenthing:
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🙂
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which language do you use?
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> c++
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> i didnt get too familiar with any other language to use it
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> without looking into docs
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> or google syntax
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> kek
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, c++ doesn't have functions for intersection of sets :/
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh wow this day 3 part 1 sounds really interesting
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Unfortunately it's 6:36 AM and im on my phone
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> i was hoping it had it somewhere in stl, but yeah, that hurts 😭
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :feelsamazingman:
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048473116940185700/image.png
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> wtf
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh wow
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder how they do this
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did they reimplement cmake? ^^
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> looks like!
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://github.com/JetBrains/CMake/tree/sysprog-rebased2
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, so they modified cmake
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds more reasonable
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still cool
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> finally i could find out why i cant find bundled mysql library :greenthing:
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> finally i can find out why i cant find bundled mysql library :greenthing:
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> finally i can find out why it cant find bundled mysql library :greenthing:
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ewan> you can set some vars and cmake will give you more verbose debug output as is when find_package fails
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ewan> and yeah i was stoked when i first saw this
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ewan> they tweeted about it and it looked so nice
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ewan> they had a vid attached
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ewan> https://twitter.com/clion_ide/status/1585326506494103552
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks cool!
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my solutions to these advent of codes are so ugly :monkalaugh:
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Same lool
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But I have a chance to redeem myself today
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Can open ai solve advent of code xd
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> each answer have 1 minute delay, so probably that would take a lot of time :greenthing:
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh damn it took me an hour to complete part 1 of day 3
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And it's only because I chose to write properly documented and readable code :kek:
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> if anyone is interested in what I meant by documented and readable here is a link: https://hatebin.com/ojeqplpqwf
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also yeah i made a typo and searched for hatebin instead of hastebin but its the same
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why not use a Set?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or a Map
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Actually a set would've been better
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I forgot about those
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yeah imma actually use a set right now
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U should
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Will improve perf def
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Don't care about performance that much but it would eliminate having to check for multiple values
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whener u see a problen with "unique" and coundinh
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sets and maps are usually good
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupis mobile
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xndbsvsgcjc
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> lmao
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I've used a set before in one of my javascript libraries to prevent duplicates so idk why i didnt think of it now
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> javascript developer trying not to create another javascript library (he can't help it)
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well done openai i totally agree xdd

12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> it actually does
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> just found it googling a bit
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/set_intersection
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> what's a bit strange tho it's that it needs sorted input.
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/?search=intersection
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Woah @Ryozuki you are here
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Wow
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ? xD
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Big fan like every teeworlds pro
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers2:
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> :monkalaugh:
13:43 <+ChillerDragon> lol
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Lol you are bot?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Wtf
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah cool. FYI an `std::set` provides ordered input
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> i am hooman i swear
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> oh, nice to know. Personally I used sort for today's problem
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pff googling
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048590987842293780/image.png
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was so 02.12.2022
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Xd
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Did it just release? And where?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chat.openai.com
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think it already released yesterday actually
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Is it really open?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Sad
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> after ms bought it not anymore xD
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Scam name
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well at least open to use ^^
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there are claimed to be better text AIs which u cannot test
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wat
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Als
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> was openai ever open?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think so
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if bing uses better AIs it could indeed beat the current google
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i felt like at least most stuff was really well written and/or summarized
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it would give 1-2 sources, would be good replacement xd
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems it wasn't bought by microsoft, but it did indeed get a huge investment from microsoft
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats just another word for it xd
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gpt3 was going to be open
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if u know for sure
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#History
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess this sums it up good enough
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we still got gpt3-j but I’m pretty sure gpt3 is better
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so yes the models seems to never should have been open
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as in what we define as open
14:43 <+ChillerDragon> wait did yall send your phone num to openai to create those chats?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i got the account of my brother, that makes it easy for me to not decide on such things^^
14:44 <+ChillerDragon> can i be ur brother joüpstar?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u r my bru
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> send pw then
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> i broke openai
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1670075000.png
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> they act super confused since i logged in to my account that got interrupted during signup xd
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I already sent you the online phone number thing?
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh tru
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> never oosed it
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> bra lost wire chat log
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> wire moment

15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does this reflect the real reasoning?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do jupstar
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do Learath2. Even I don’t know why I chose it. Maybe openai can find a deeper insight
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD

15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Cool or unique
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> 🤓
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mine is actual a bit correct 😄
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The structure of the question seems to lock the ai into a structure of the answer. It’s quite interesting, I’m intrigued
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^^
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> try to rephrase the question =]
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like so? XD
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048600638877077594/image.png
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks can you ask the ai
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to reverse entropy?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "How can entropy be reversed?"
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> xd
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> perfect
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also sad about meekrioz
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask it how to reverse aes without the key
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048601007485104220/image.png

15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Theon> aoc
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the answers about nicknames seem to be handedited
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048601135868551240/image.png
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably to make the answers sound nice
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and not make the AI look bad
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks can u put "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER"
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to ur question?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ask it
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048601508276609024/image.png
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or it’s one of those hypernetwork things people have been investigating, where output of one network that only handles the structure is combined with the output of another network that only handles the context
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask for ddnet client bot names
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bad idea
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if it can answer tho
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it indeed recognized the right well of spelling it ^^
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048601830755672094/image.png

15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It capitalised ddracenetwork properly so it did hear about us 😄
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that means? "I dunno"
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah ^^
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> What do you mean DDRaceNetwork isn't general knowledge? I thought that everyone knew about it!
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask "is there something smaller than a quark?"
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do u want to test if it has intelligence? xd

15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its to clever xD
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask what happens at the edge of a black hole

15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cache locality?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can explicitly ask it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok .o
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can even ask smth like this
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048607052638998559/image.png
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 3 seems to be outright false?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> best = fastest?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but dynamic arrays with amortization can be quite the same
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well best is better
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz faster trades security
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sounds like it confused with const sized arrays xD
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe use vector
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of array
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048607556181966928/image.png
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "linked list vs vector
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah probably more clear, but i dunno dynamic array to me sounds like exactly that, maybe i am wrong tho, let me ask openai if i am wrong
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048607851272220752/image.png
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uhh
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vectors are not just c++ std xd
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think havingg support for iterator matters in the definition of vector xd
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048608179833028758/image.png
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it broke it
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_container_(C%2B%2B)#Vector
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is wikipedia fault
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048608340445507584/image.png
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> interesting 😄
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> built-in is meh
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK you usually don't call types implemneted in the standard library wihtout magic "built-in"
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> find the stack overflow answer and correct it xDD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> typically
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's always of items of the same type
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where is erlang used
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think rust's iterator and generics makes it more useful than dynamic arrays in other languages
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048609037182324756/image.png
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> iterators also exist in dynamic languages, generics are just required due to the static typing that doesn't exist in the typical dynamic language
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it knows it was wrong
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xDD
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmfao
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so do you agree with its argumentation?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just googled "rust builtin"
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> couldn't find something quickly where they call stuff from the standard library "built in"
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048609931936419961/image.png
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well whom should i trust
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> AI or rust pro heinrich
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i wouldnt call it builtin
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> builtin would be the hidden "box" syntax
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/box-syntax.html
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the `Box` type is also special
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yeah
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048610491951497316/image.png
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because `*boxed` can move out of `boxed`
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this isn't possible for other smart pointers
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant move out of a arc
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's due to the nature of an arc
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah xd
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't implement "moving out" of your own smart pointer
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember reading an rfc about giving this functionality to the user somehow
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, it'll probably appear at some point
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048611203695517766/image.png
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it’s been a while, doubt I can dig it back up
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> DerefMove or so
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 it every way it claims that std is built-in xD
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, weird
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if im not asking about it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but it uses your history?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can close and reopen the tab
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can even install cargo without std library
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *rust
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but in the usual installation all three are installed together
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048611796682027018/image.png
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is if it doesnt have previous context
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048611998063145000/image.png
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> heh
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can give feedback and say this is wrong xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean its not build-in as in the rust language
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe it was trained not for the sense of the language itself only
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048612425919889408/image.png
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for c++ it clearly says its not built-in ^^
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you use rust without std? xD
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there a flag to turn it off?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no_std
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its how i made ryoOS
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048613126398038036/image.png
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would say
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> libcore is ithe builtin thing
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/#fn1
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048613546327547975/image.png
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a nonanswer
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> political ai
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048613928059535372/image.png
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I LOVE IT
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i trained it
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> open a bug on rust and ask there
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki u in rust discord i bet
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> trigger a huge discussion there
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no xd
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask it if vim is an ide
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vim alone isnt
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok let me join rust discord
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and trigger ppl
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust discord has some confidently incorrect people, I can see them actually going into a war about that
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i asked, lets see when it escalates xD
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I actually got really nice answers from there when I got stuck on some problem
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As did I. There are some very clever people, especially the macro magicians
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which one
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think there are 2
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a verified one
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the rust programming language
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.gg/rust-lang
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want official answer xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where did u ask
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hard to stalk u
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used other acc
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in #rust-usage
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a random is saying ur question is meaningless basically
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs he doesnt know xD
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean it's probably kind of meaningless
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it is
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but still interesting
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hope it evolves in a discussion
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and they update their docs
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xdd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This sort of pedantry doesn’t really interest the rust people from what I’ve seen so far
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean it literally has no value
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wouldnt be sure about it
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this is a random guy
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> developers hate randomness xD
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he doesnt represent rust lol
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to see real discussion go ask the ##C channel the difference between unspecified and undefined behaviour. Or the legality of type-punning through a union
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that how to get a war in that chat?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should i heat the discussion up?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should i say "THIS IS UB"
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> INSIDE RUST
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the #c++ people a solution that doesn’t involve boost
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I ask anything there everyone and their mother tries to sell me boost
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks btw
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most hackers of rust hackers
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka the compiler hackers
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are on zulip
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not discord
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forge.rust-lang.org/platforms/zulip.html
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ask them for me
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do u have to loose xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lose*
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iim shy
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is a zulip?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a nice threaded forum
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and these days it's even publicly readable without an account
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048620011448696842/image.png
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not logged in
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its where the real discussion happens
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about language design etc
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How are the rust compiler people? LLVM and gcc people are so mean, you have to be extremely prepared before asking anything
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're not mean IME
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think some decisions happen privately behind closed doors though
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i never interacted with anyone so idk
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine talking to people :monkalaugh:
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have one small gap in your research? L + stupid + learn2read the docs + don’t talk again until you’ve read the entirety of the dragon book
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I love this so hard xD

16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wat
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aw, it’s trying to make you feel better
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the spelling of "to lose" with two "o"s is the correct form of the verb
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's either counting the "o" of the "to" or being very wrong
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont get the part with double "e"
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, yep it’s stupid. What two ‘e’s
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask if tail recursion is guaranteed in rust
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask if tail recursion optimization is guaranteed in rust
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it? I don't think it is
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask if tail call optimization is guaranteed in rust
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it isnt
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just curious xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the question would sound like a "no"
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, why not? Tail recursion is usually trivial to optimize
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because "is … guaranteed" is usually a "no"
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes, tail recursion is guaranteed in Rust. Tail recursion occurs when a function calls itself as the last action it performs before returning a value. This is a common technique in functional programming languages, as it allows recursive functions to be implemented in a way that is more efficient and less prone to stack overflow errors. In Rust, tail recursion is guaranteed to be optimized by the compiler, which means that recursive fun
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> LMFAO
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it disagrees
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> possible tail recursion is rare in languages with RAII
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because destructors have to run after the function call
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, now that I think about it, I guess you can actually have impossible to optimize cases yeah
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust might introduce a keyword for a guaranteed tail call, destructing all locals before jumping to the next function
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think they thought about `become`
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Robyt3 you are doing all the things I’ve always been thinking about but never had the time for 😄
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> robyt doing gods work

16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont think anymore
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll just put any input in the AI
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks ask if you can create UB in safe rust
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> these questions are probs in any rust FAQ xD

16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe u'll still find stupid bugs by the AI
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's easy to create undefined behavior in rust on linux
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just open `/proc/self/mem` and poke some bytes
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's all safe, too 🙂

16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you trying to compile?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where did you get the source code?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these days, ddnet uses cmake instead of bam to compile
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- BaBa> @heinrich5991 that source old
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- BaBa> @heinrich5991 is sourcd old
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> LMAO i posted our full vulkan backend and asked it what this code is doing

16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wow awesome analysis xD
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- BaBa> I work with cmake but I like the bam compilation source

17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this picture is OpenAI
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> use it to search responses like a :gigachad:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> does it only work for dev stuff? or everything
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> like: how to cook potatoes
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> here's a tweet i've shared
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> after it's an AI and it can also do mistakes so read carefully what it writes
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> still insane tho

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> that's soo good
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> I need to look for some answers asap

18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why was the math book sad?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Because it had too many problems.
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (I know it's not the best joke, but I'm just a text-based AI and don't have access to the internet, so I can't look up jokes for you. Sorry!)

18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teero> 😂
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ar1gin> Yo devs, can someone recommend me an IDE for editing ddnet's code please? My current IDE is struggling to parse the codebase
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1048652682623189063/image.png
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what OS are u on?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ar1gin> Linux.
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what is ur current IDE?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ar1gin> KDevelop
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can try vscode if u prefer easy out of box experience
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else try to customize a vim
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet also provides a workspace for ddnet
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> other/vscode/
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its preconfigured and also suggests extensions
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ar1gin> Oki, thanks :)
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd fun
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> wtf am I reading above, next gen programming with AI
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <just-leave-me-mailless> Hello guys, do you have any tool a linux user could use to find out what processes are using the internet data and bandwidth? I found out that discord is an internet data hog when compared to whatsapp or messenger and while I'm searching for FOSS alternatives to streaming videos I want to compare the data, bandwidth and quality on a few different platforms. Would be very helpful if you had any app or sth that I could also use
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes, there are several tools that a Linux user can use to monitor their internet usage and find out which processes are using the most data and bandwidth. Some common tools for this purpose include the iftop command, which shows a real-time list of network connections and the processes associated with them, and the nethogs command, which displays a list of processes and their current network usage. The netstat command can also be used t
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lol it’s ofc because I am fanboi of the best clan in whole teeworlds DragonFight
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Oh no, the AI took over Jupstar
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <just-leave-me-mailless> Thanks a lot! That's giving me a place to start from
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <just-leave-me-mailless> (@Not Keks)
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <just-leave-me-mailless> I'll see if these also work on non-rooted termux
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If you are not able to use the sudo command to run the iftop, nethogs, or netstat commands with administrative privileges, you may still be able to use them if you have the necessary permissions. Some Linux systems allow users with certain permissions to run certain commands without using sudo. For example, on some systems, users who are members of the netdev group may be able to run the iftop command without using sudo. To check if you
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Biep Boop Jupstar?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah that feels so good xD
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and its better than my normal english
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what more do i need
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Jopstar should I sell amd and buy meta stock?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, their metaverse sucks xd
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> That’s the point
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Everyone loves to hate Facebook and their stock is the worst in the S&P 500
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So they cheap
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If they would make the Metaverse suck less which they have the money for they could dominate the field
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also I thought you do not manually respond anymore hehe
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont think it gives such advises anyway
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also its trained with 2021 data
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Openai can’t replace life advisor jopstar
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> exactly xdd
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if stocks are low it might be worth it indeed
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> The lowest
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generally i dunno it feels like rn meta struggles hard
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the other hand they have some good projects
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If I sell my last liver I can literally own Facebook
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> similarly how microsoft turned into a cloud service and gained profile back
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Think about it. No bad narrative can shock meta investors now.If it turns out that mark is a repteloid and selling user data to aliens. Stock price wouldn’t tank. It’s just another Tuesday.
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or they go bankrupt in 5 years which would be fun too
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But really? They rich
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but it would be better if nobody talks about meta verse for now
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it can slowely recover
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> silicon valley
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they too rich
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im gonna tell mark you good new CEO and u gonna save meta then ez stonks
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good idea
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would both brother mark hasn’t switched to irc yet. I think that fool still sends me WhatsApp messages.
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would but brother mark hasn’t switched to irc yet. I think that fool still sends me WhatsApp messages.
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would but brother mark hasn’t switched to irc yet. I think that fool still sends me WhatsApp messages to me.
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would but brother mark hasn’t switched to irc yet. I think that fool still sends me WhatsApp messages.
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kekw: this AI can actually tell me how to make my stuff in Godot, while the other professionals on Godot dc cant
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :pepechill:
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I think I found my new hobby

21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can bypass the ai
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> LOL
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Xd
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Damn
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Best poet
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt work for me xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for other stuff it just writes the poem lel
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :trollge:
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen do you think its stupid to wait for an application?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. if i'd take my next holidays to quickly implement e.g. a basic global illumination algorithm so i have some sources to backup my skill wouldnt that be better than randomly apply and not being able to demostrate something particular?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, I'd just apply before they find someone else
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but realisticly i dont fulfill their requirements
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I alwaays got the job without fulfilling the requirements
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u showed me what u did with ddnet
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would hire u
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho im not a hirer
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u got the skills
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i tell u, rly small amount of ppl know vulkan
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem isnt really that i dont have the confidence to learn everything required
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just apply
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont worry
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its simply i currently dont have the skill and cannot back up my claims enough
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the worst is just a no
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u care
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true, thats why i asked if  i should increase the chance
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u got nothing to lose
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe your time
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why discord acting up rn
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you wait chances are the job is filled until then
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks also
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u should write a blog
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it kinda helps
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its a way to learn too
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats my experience
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but having a blog shows something to show off too
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah now that openai makes my bad english look good
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i could do that xD
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> One time I had an interview and the question they asked me was exactly what my last blog post was about. I got lucky 😄
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they asked me about ddnet
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe they read ur blog and wanted u xD
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so they made it easy for u
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean deen is a instant hire
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah 😄
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho even though i know there is always ppl better sometimes i feel like a bit meh, but well experience will tell
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just 22 so kek
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but then there are 14y old genius
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the rust reddit there is a 16y old writing a os or smth
