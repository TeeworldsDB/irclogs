00:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> tried into steam gfx_opengl_major 1 parameters
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> In quotes? Also downloaded the driver I sent?
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Else upgrade to win10
00:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> upgrade to win10 is problematic xd
00:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then use linux, or use an old driver
01:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> it kinda seems to be "hard coded" to not work... is it some kind of anti cheat or just a bug?
02:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> command evaluation is weird
02:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not always the order you expect
04:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i think they just all execute at the exact same time, and sometimes 1 command might just take longer than the others
04:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> not sure ab that tho
06:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> right yea
06:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sometimes that behavior is good
06:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cus like kill takes more time apparently so i have to do toggle/kill backwards but it works
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Modern browsers are so nice
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/855746339198992384/20210619_114947.jpg
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wouldn't blame the browser. Websites are just huge. At least my Firefox is usually around 1-2 GB which is ok-ish
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what were u doing
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never ran out of memory
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well 72g is just insane. The browser should never let this much leak no matter what
11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, I assumed you just had some thousands of tabs open ðŸ˜„
11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing interesting, it was just a firefox instance running for a long time. Just like 2 dozen tabs
11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> about:memory helps I guess
11:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the computer was pretty dead at that point so I didnt get to check which website caused it
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 16tabs 3 youtube the rest just text
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wut? how much memory do you have?
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 12 tabs, 1 is twitch which is kinda heave, 500mb only
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say memory leak
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 16g, anything more than that it starts swapping
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> So you got like 60G of swap :D?
12:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had like 2 userscripts running, I'm guessing one was leaking
12:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for sure
12:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no wonder the thing is slow
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have 13 tabs open but task manager says opera has 32 sub tasks
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc macOS doesn't limit swap in the traditional way
14:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> why do we have chuvash and greek as language files but not in index.txt
14:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> hmm, looks like teeworlds does that too
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try adding it to index.txt, see if it works, make a PR
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know a reason not to include them
14:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the font might miss some chars?
14:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well teeworlds has chinese included in index for ages before they had a CJK font
14:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i'll ask teeworlds people too, just to be sure.
14:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> nvm, teeworlds do have them, github search was lying to me
14:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i'll add them to index.txt
16:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> heinrich rich
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> richheinrich
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hein rich
16:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @heinrich5991 still can't get them to troubleshoot SSL cert. but i did gave them a `ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg` with an http mirror. it worked.
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> should we change this to macOS too
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/855821744576659486/SPOILER_unknown.png
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ..oops accidentally clicked spolier
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, will do
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @Learath2 any idea why? tried both steam version and from ddnet.tw/downloads
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/855826416734306344/unknown.png
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> seems like 15.5 on mac is broken? i don't have my mac right now. can't test it myself. 15.4 worked for him
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That would be bad. I don't think we changed anything
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> segfault sounds like someone with a mac should build their own version and try with a debugger
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, my mac isn't 15.5 either, I'm not really certain how we debug that
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> huh?
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> you can't debug ddnet 15.5?
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I'm silly our versioning looks so similar to macOS versioning I thought 15.5 was the newly released macOS version ðŸ˜›
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm up to 15.7 on catalina ðŸ˜›
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> Which servers are the ones hosted on Davides vps?
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> GER3
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks, I just saw the server names :D
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Dakaa> @everyone OMG guys I just sent to this dude trade offer and he gave me his knife for free!! Try your luck maybe he will give you skins too https://steancomunnity.ru/tradeoffer/new/?partner=361920527&token=zK4OU8Ir
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> :banhammer:
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> looks like 90% of generated server stuff is useless
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does client use server_data.* ?
21:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie I knew I forgot something. I forgot to disallow HTTP ðŸ˜¦
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggesting:ddnet: 
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> back  the  average time
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> the reason: "median time"   always give us time shorter than what we will do really.  if he give us 30 mins median time we  quickly understand finish this map need more than 30 mins and this useless
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> either 
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> " average time" was almost give us time longer but  this better than shorter if we know we will finish in under a hour it's so helpful
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :banhammer:
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> >  always give us time shorter than what we will do really
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is that just your own impression or have you actively asked other players? for me that time seemed like a better estimate
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i see it with my eyes
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> last one i remeber was solo map was median time 4 mins
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and was 10 mins not even enough
22:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> better estimate in first finish? or
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i saw somewhere median time was more accurate for the average player
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think a good way to do it could also be to only count the first finishes of all players, then take away the extremes but that might be expensive to calculate
23:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Kayrabot/00> Its not possible that you can satisy everyone with any algorithm
