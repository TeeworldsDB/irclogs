12:25 < sdsdfsdf> >><@deen> i told the hoster what qemu commands to use to make the CPU faster^^
12:25 < sdsdfsdf> just curious, which options was changed/added?
14:13 <@deen> sdsdfsdf: nothing special, just -host cpu did the trick :P
14:13 <@deen> that tells qemu to emulate the exact cpu that you have in the host system
14:14 <@deen> and great, since last evening Deutsche Telekom ping on GER2 has been up +15 ms
14:14 <@deen> without any change in routing
14:17 <@deen> might be voxility analysing our traffic since it happens right at the ddos protection
14:46 <@EastByte> deen: or maybe it's the telekom delaying udp traffic for the lulz
