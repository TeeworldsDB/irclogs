20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I noticed one time that https://info.ddnet.tw/info was slow to load, I guess the database connection was hanging, not sure why though
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I suggest a /spec command for maps where spec is disabled. It should only work before touch startline.
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Because its always damn annoying when ure speedrunning a map and planned Which player has strong, u finish the noobfilter but your Partner die so you have to restart and always look if ur Partner got it now its so annoying...

22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> For those who think im planning a cheat with that, thats nonsense, to use SG bug i can also use join team/team 0 because we are talking about before touching start.
