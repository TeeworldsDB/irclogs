10:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
17:12 < bridge> <teero777> im on wayland and after joining this map and waiting for a few sec ddnet crashes. cant debug rn
17:12 < bridge> <teero777> can anyone confirm this?

18:12 < bridge> <teero777> im a little bit confused with map loading.
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> when you load a 20,000x20,000 map with a completely filled game layer and nothing else. how much ram would it take up?
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> i mean a block is basically an integer right? so 32bits * 20,000 * 20,000 (1.6GB) should be the space it would take in ram right? im a little bit confused because when you actually load the map on the client it takes more than 30GB of ram (at which my computer overflows).
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> what other data is getting loaded here?
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> in the map editor loading the map works fine
18:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe you can try with OpenGL 1 so it doesn't cache tile layers etc.
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> i was running GLES btw
18:22 < bridge> <robyt3> not sure how much tile buffering that does
18:26 < bridge> <teero777> nop
18:26 < bridge> <teero777> ram is overflowing still when joining
19:10 < bridge> <teero777> okay i successfully loaded a 10x10k map but half of the map isnt showing in enties for some reason. its just cut off
19:14 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks jupsti vulkan chad may you help me?
19:38 < bridge> <teero777> okay i feel like everything is the fault of wayland. piece of shit
19:39 < bridge> <melon> agreed, fuck wayland!
19:39 < bridge> <melon> agreed, frick wayland!
19:41 < bridge> <k2d222> wayland+nvidia drivers sucks, but other than that it works fine in my experience
19:42 < bridge> <chairn> well, imagine you write a switch with no default case, and some other parts of the code test for some specific bits, and voila, you got unofficial opcodes that are completely implementation dependent
19:51 < bridge> <k2d222> hx
20:15 < bridge> <teero777> I'm using amd but some things are still very buggy for example obs, screenshotting and weird graphic bugs
20:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> now i have a rectangle with anime in it :justatest: '

20:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dude you just set yourself up to be laughed at
20:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and?
20:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> laught at me, me ðŸ¤¡
20:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> tf does that mean
20:51 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> did you not net "im a clown" part?
20:51 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> did you not get "im a clown" part?
20:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh i understood it now
20:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah    dude out of all the images idk why you chose to showcase that one
20:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> it was the best :justatest:
20:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> coomer
20:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> u aint fun, me no talking to you :feelsbadman:
20:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> u aint funny, me no talking to you :feelsbadman:
21:29 < bridge> <teero777> k switched to xorg now
21:29 < bridge> <teero777> will try the big map again and check if it was really waylands fault
21:44 < bridge> <teero777> okay.
21:44 < bridge> <teero777> the bug is still there but my client isnt crashing anymore
21:45 < bridge> <teero777> where are entities drawn?
21:45 < bridge> <teero777> it seems like on huge maps half of the entities arent drawn for some reason
21:45 < bridge> <teero777> havent tested with design

21:45 < bridge> <teero777> wont embed?
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> You could try using a profiler to see what the memory is allocated for. For example https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack

21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Why you building 0.7.5? :monkaS: There's a good chance those are already fixed on teeworlds master
22:00 < bridge> <yekrm> :owo:
23:21 < bridge> <gumbatw> Some new suggested qol changes: 
23:21 < bridge> <gumbatw> Delete saves from ddnet-saves.txt after loading them.
23:21 < bridge> <gumbatw> If your tee hits a timed button, display a corresponding countdown in red below the current maptime
23:23 < bridge> <gumbatw> Some new suggested qol changes: 
23:23 < bridge> <gumbatw> Delete saves from ddnet-saves.txt after loading them.
23:24 < bridge> <gumbatw> Some new suggested qol changes: 
23:24 < bridge> <gumbatw> Delete saves from ddnet-saves.txt after loading them.
23:24 < bridge> <gumbatw> And maybe a section in the client where the saves are printed, or only the recent ones
