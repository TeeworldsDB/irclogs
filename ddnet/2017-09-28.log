00:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> My two cents, out of nowhere:
00:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> 1. About leaving rank when you go off - first of all, it's not always planned, sometimes you may just quite disapear like I did, or earlier onionly' me. But about leaving the rank, there's one thing i'm really curious about - how is that when my rank was removed i was left as plain member, same as lots of other staff members before, yet gdin managed to get "Retired Administrator" rank that was cre <message clipped>
00:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> 2. About discussion for adding or rejecting mods - I do remember lovely times when I had gdin's old role of managing community and taking care for mod applications, those were times when together with @Ryozuki i was talking with those people, people who play with them on specific country-server, and later checking for few days how they behave when they have no idea that anyone from the staff is wa <message clipped>
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nice wall xD
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Soreu from what i know, it's to get his opinion, and yes you can get his opinion without having that rank, which made no sense to me. They told me that is to be in the private admin discussion, and there the discussion i created to have open admin discussions
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Which u dont need the rank in forum either, in private admin discussions
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so basically gdidn just wanted to keep his status whilst afk, and used his friend snail i think.
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> obviusly this is all unfair for lot of people
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> another reason why i want mod discussion open
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> ?_?
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 2. and me and snail we just appoint people mods and let them roam around, it's much better this way /s
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 1. should give a thought about this one
01:01 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> hows gdin being retired admin related to open mod discussions
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no that's their other point
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> "another reason"
01:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh yeah you mean that, i don't really get that one either
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @Learath2 I have no idea how the process runs right now, last time I followed it, mods were added based on forum posts feedback, just shared how it was done when "I had to" care for it.
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @Soreu did someone state that or are you just asuming it?
01:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @jao both observed by me, and informed by hi_leute_gll. - and even if he is/was hated, so his opinions were often skipped, it has to be admitted that he was always informed very good.
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> so you are asuming it ðŸ˜ƒ
01:33 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> hi_leute is always mixing his opinion with informations, so I wouldn't believe everything
01:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Mod decisions are currently made by the council which includes @jao o @RayB.  @snail  and me
01:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> people get evaluated, we decide to give them a chance or not, if we give them a chance and they blow it we go ahead and remove them
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> Glad to hear

16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> https://github.com/hpjohn/ddnet/tree/JekyllClip
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> What do i do now
16:49 < Learath2> as in?
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> How does testing stability and overall worth proceed
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Should i make a forum post explaining the features i added
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> oh wait, i have to make a pull request?
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Oh yep
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hey
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I fixxed a few smaller bugs and disabled teams:
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> https://github.com/lschierbach/ddnet
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I didn't expect Deen to instantly host the server so it isn't as polished as I'd like it to be
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (generally, it's a good idea to ask about how one should do things before coding large PRs)
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> apparently I'm horrible with sed and regex :/
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> could you maybe put it down and give me a fe wmore days so improve some bugs?
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you sure you want us to put it down?
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> just for a few days so i can polish it a little more
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sure
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> the map is like 5 years old as well lol
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> just wanted to test wether everything works haha
17:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> one bug is if you join spec you still get the broadcast waiting for new round all the time
17:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ok thank you my friend
17:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] hpjohn opened pull request #880: Jekyll clip (master...JekyllClip) https://git.io/vdOBv
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon took it down
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Thanks
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @deen  In the forum thread you wrote
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> "also all teams should be equal size"
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Can you explain what you mean by that? Should everyone be forced to join a team or what do you mean?
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Best I could think of is improving the Matchmaking so in the first few waves the matches are more fair... (Like 1v1, 2v2, 3v3)
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I think he ws thinking along the lines of forcing everyone to join a team by splitting them up
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Hmmm
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Back then there were 3 server (1v1, 2v2 and 3v3)
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I think that would be a better solution if ddnet is able to put that many ressources into the mod. 
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> If not I could imagine making a vote changing the teamsize and then limiting them. (Vote: 2 Player teams for example)
17:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> And @Learath2  could you please remove the news post at the start of ddnet as well?
17:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is there a reason why you only commented out instead of deleting?
17:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> because that's how it was done and I just followed it
17:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh
17:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> didnt see
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well we will end up with big comments
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yep should probably ditch them at some point
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> the others were commented out because they were marked as "inactive mod" in forum irc
17:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon hmm not sure if we remove news posts
17:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Well...
17:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> xD
17:19 < Learath2> well I don't see why not
17:20 < Learath2> oh that one was supposed to be "...we can remove..."
17:20 < Learath2> not sure what triggers the client to show news
17:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i guess new news  xD
17:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hahaha
17:22 < Learath2> duh
17:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> At the moment it's confusing imo if a player starts the client and sees the announcment of the server but can't find it you know xD
17:22 < Learath2> how does the client know which news is new tho
17:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> btw what is this bot
17:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> is @Learath2  controlling it?
17:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> or is it speaking to Learath2
17:23 < Learath2> the bot links the irc channel to this channel
17:24 < Learath2> s/this/discord/
17:24 < Learath2> it's so we don't have to check both places all the time
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oh ok
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> that's cool I guess
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> xD
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> If you can't delete news you could might as well post another one
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> or idk
17:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> it's not that important to me
17:25 < Learath2> yeah i'll figure sth out :P
17:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thank you my friend hahahaha
17:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i g2g have a nice day and thank you again!
17:26 < Learath2> found it, if I delete it it'll trigger a news page show on everyone with no new news
17:28 < Learath2> well w/e, removed it
17:46 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: C can't nest comments either
17:46 < Learath2> I thought it wouldn't work but github editor syntax hillighting misled me :P
18:43 < fstd> nested comments are supported as of C99, but only for // :)
21:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you make backups of ddnet db regularly?
23:02 <@deen> heinrich5991: there's a mysqldump in crontab and I have nightly backups of the entire machine, but for space reasons I prune the old ones pretty quickly right now
