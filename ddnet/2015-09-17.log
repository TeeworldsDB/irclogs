02:03 < fstd> is map download from vanilla clients broken?
02:04 <@deen> i hope not
02:05 <@deen> but that would explain why we get 0 new players since the steam release
02:06 <@deen> works for me
02:07 < fstd> i'm using a 0.6.3-ish client and every map download stalls right at the beginning
02:07 < fstd> let me tcpdump that
02:08 <@deen> there's a new anti-spoofing feature
02:08 <@deen> vanilla 0.6.3 works
02:08 <@deen> i've heard that some bot client doesn't work
02:08 < fstd> hm maybe it's older than i though then
02:08 < fstd> 9
02:08 < fstd> (i always build the client right from upstream's repo)
02:08 < fstd> -9
02:13 <@deen> east is probably the right one to investigate this if he has the source of the client
02:16 < eeeee> someone with rcon access can also try disabling fast map download
02:17 < fstd> it appears like the server does send the map data, but the client is not receiving it, or ignoring it
02:17 <@deen> there are 2 maps sent because of the spoofing
02:17 <@deen> spoofing-protection
02:18 < fstd> yes, i do receive the dummy map
02:23 < fstd> here's the tcpdump, if someone cares: http://penenen.de/tw.tcpdump.gz  (tried to connect, waited 30 seconds at "Downloading map (0 / <number> KiB), 1 second left", then ctrl+shift+q'ed it).  client built from upstream/0.6 (at 1b2a91f0cff53054cb75182843bfb9de939f8b2a)
02:23 < fstd> the server sends quite a lot, possibly retransmissions
02:23 < fstd> (server in question was '95.172.92.151:8335')
02:25 <@deen> fstd: i set spoof protection off, works now?
02:27 < fstd> one sec
02:28 < fstd> deen: nope.  do you see me connecting in rcon?
02:29 < eeeee> deen: can also try "sv_fast_download 0" ?
02:29 < fstd> (my ip being 87.78.80.218)
02:33 <@deen> fast download 0 now fstd 
02:34 < fstd> nope, still no download.  but there's also the chance that it's a problem on my end
02:34 < fstd> i can't currently try it on a different machine, but if upstream/0.6 works for you, then it's probably that
02:38 <@deen> yeah, works with 0.6 with fast_download and antispoof on
02:40 < fstd> (that said, i can download maps from 0.6.3 and 0.6.4 vanilla servers)
02:50 <@deen> hm
04:02 < eeeee> fstd: and in case you wanted to play instead of debugging ddnet you can try ddnet client, it likely works
09:34 < EastByte> cool, can reproduce
09:47 < EastByte> heinrich5991: what's the version/commit of steam teeworlds?
10:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #338: Added vital flag for mapdata (includes fast download) (master...mapvital) http://git.io/vnehw
10:16 < EastByte> okay the steam version still is 0.6.3

16:50 < DMTee> huhu :)
16:50 < DMTee> wer issn eigentlich jetzt der ansprechpartner für ddnet sachen?
16:55 < DMTee> ich hab grad gesehen, dass ihr die foot server garnicht mehr habt. Ich würde die Utd.Legends Foot Server in DDnet Footserver umbenennen und wenn ihr wollt könnt ihr die dann wieder unter die Kategorie DDnet nehmen. Ich würde die dann quasi sponsorn und immer mal ein Turnier veranstalten. Dürfte ich dann dem DDNet-Clan beitreten? :D und das Adminpasswort würde ich gerne behalten und ihr kriegts natürlich auch 
17:11 < EastByte> english pls :p. I guess it wouldn't be wrong to put them on our list
17:11 < EastByte> DDNet is not a clan, rather a community
17:14 < DMTee> oh sry i forget thet everytime :D
17:16 < DMTee> ok i contact my server hoster and rename them should i do something else?
17:17 <@EastByte> wait for deen's opinion first
17:18 < DMTee> so deen is still the man to contact?
17:19 <@EastByte> yes, I think so
17:29 <@heinrich5991> [15:43:48] <dimi> hey. i'm trying to build bam right now. according to the instructions i need visual studio express. make_win32_msvc.bat only supports versions 8 to 10, which i cant find anymore, only newer.
17:29 <@heinrich5991> [15:44:14] <dimi> do you have any idea, what i could do? i would prefer to not use visual studio at all, if its possible to build tw without
17:30 <@EastByte> mingw does the job
17:31 <@heinrich5991> dimi: I don't know if it's advisable to try building without MSVC
17:31 <@heinrich5991> but here's a download link for an older version of MSVC: http://www.chip.de/downloads/Visual-Studio-2010-Express_36594560.html
17:31 <@EastByte> the official ddnet client is build using mingw
17:32 <@heinrich5991> that says nothing about the setup time needed to do that, though
17:32 <@EastByte> k, right
17:40 <@deen> DMTee: i don't see any use for what you propose
17:54 < dimi> thanks guys
17:55 <@heinrich5991> dimi: and please ask in the channel instead of PMing someone!
17:55 < dimi> will do, sorry
17:58 <@heinrich5991> no problem :)
19:27 < Nimda> Monster by Fňokurka oo7 just released on Moderate at 2015-09-17 19:20
20:53 < dimi> yeah, i managed to build bam. when i try to build tw now, bam doesnt accept the targets mentioned in the build instructions. if i try to build without targets, i get a debug executable, which is i guess the default target
20:53 < dimi> any idea, what i'm doing wrong?
20:53 < dimi> mingw btw, no visual studio
20:54 < Henningstone> which version of tw?
20:54 < Henningstone> the targets changed from 0.6 to 0.7
20:54 < Henningstone> so if you are on the master branch, you have 0.7
20:54 < Henningstone> if so, use just "bam debug" (if I remember right ^^)
21:00 < dimi> yeah, i am on master. however debug also doesnt work and what i wanted was actually a release executable. ^^
21:00 < Henningstone> then "bam release" ;)
21:01 < dimi> "target 'release' not found" unfortunately :(
21:01 < Henningstone> ok wait a moment
21:04 < Henningstone> hmm I thought it were like that o_o
21:05 < Henningstone> ah damn it was on 0.6 to build both client and server *facepalm*
21:12 < dimi> 0.7 was my fail anyway, i needed 0.6. i guess, i'm good now. thank you very much
21:13 < Henningstone> ok, for 0.7 maybe try "bam client" or "bam server" (not sure though)
21:15 < Sorrow> hi
21:15 < Sorrow> anyone here,
21:15 < Sorrow> ?
21:15 < Henningstone> lol
22:47 <@deen> oh cool, brazil is back
22:47 <@deen> that's always a problem with sponsored servers, can't even reach anyone, no idea what's going on with the server
22:48 <@deen> and how to fix the database now
22:48 <@EastByte> uptime 20:05
22:49 <@deen> yeah, someone just now told me it's back...
22:49 <@deen> i don't sit around randomly pinging servers all day
22:49 <@EastByte> well but we know the server was completely down, not just a null route or something
22:50 <@EastByte> so synchronising the database now is hard?
22:50 <@deen> yep, but still same OS running with all my files there, even auto-started the servers
22:51 <@deen> and they made 100 ranks in these 20 hours
22:51 <@EastByte> nice ...
22:51 <@deen> so how do i get those to the other servers now?
22:51 <@deen> because it was out of the DB sync loop
22:52 <@deen> maybe we should just buy 1 really realiable database server and use that as the DB for all locations (and live with 500 ms to get a response for /rank)
22:52 <@EastByte> manually :p
22:53 <@deen> i know i can do it manually, i have a few scripts to translate table entries to new inserts etc
22:53 <@deen> but still have to think of a better way
22:53 <@deen> because the DB setup is the main problem with how ddnet runs
22:53 <@EastByte> I still think a central server is a better idea
22:53 <@deen> a central server?
22:54 <@EastByte> like you said
22:54 <@deen> ah
22:54 <@deen> well, it would lead to a lot of rank losses
22:54 <@deen> for example iran and china have often not been reachable from outside the country
22:54 <@deen> so they could not store ranks
22:54 <@deen> same with chile sometimes
22:54 <@deen> so the solution would be to buy more expensive servers with better connections
22:55 <@deen> my solutions usually tried to keep costs down and still have high quality and instead have more manual work to keep it up
22:55 <@EastByte> why not just queueing the inserts for the ranks, in case the db is not reachable
22:55 <@EastByte>  /rank commands won't work then, right
22:55 <@deen> and what if the server gets shutdown?
22:55 <@deen> or even saves, loads
22:56 <@deen> what I could think of is a mysql proxy running locally
22:56 <@deen> that would store these things
22:56 <@deen> but meh, didn't want to write that and existing solutions were so ugly
23:00 <@deen> I'll probably take the mysqlbinlog, convert it to mysql commands and filter them, then run them
