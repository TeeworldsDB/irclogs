00:07 < bridge> <murpi> Tested abit, seems fine to me.
00:08 < bridge> <baby frog> yes, for some reason if you have a "+toggle cl_dummy_fire" bind, it doesnt work so great, but that is also present in the main branch anyway
00:08 < bridge> <baby frog> turning on cl_dummy_copy moves fixes it pretty much but, its such a minor thing anyway
00:09 < bridge> <baby frog> yes, for some reason if you have a "+toggle cl_dummy_fire" bind, it doesnt work so great if you spam it, but that is also present in the main branch anyway
00:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There are so many insane dummy players these days. I think it would be nice to ask around if anyone is using cl\_dummy\_fire and if it breaks their gameplay. But I assume barley anyone uses it anyways.
00:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ask that one russian Dude with His custom Dummy Client If He is fine with it :kek:
00:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> But Yeah - get some good Dummy Players to review If possible maybe (Zfrogger, plantknight)
00:30 < bridge> <baby frog> custom dummy client?!
00:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> He has Dummy Copy moves to only Copy certain Inputs and Not everything iirc(i dont know Details sadly)
00:36 < bridge> <baby frog> oh yeah that would make flying a lot easier
00:36 < bridge> <baby frog> i didnt know thats allowed ü§î
00:37 < bridge> <baby frog> yes, dummy control isn't used that much, especially not for long periods of time. it's only really useful when doing a specific part and you make binds in advance just for the part
00:37 < bridge> <murpi> Can't break something which is already broken
00:40 < bridge> <baby frog> lmao true
01:22 < bridge> <gumbatw> Sounds like cheating... if I could disable that cl_dummy_hammer 1 overwrites/cances hook copy, then I would be a dummy pseudo 3fly god also. Plus if the dummy doesnt even copy a and d...
02:31 < bridge> <baby frog> not copying a and d would be insane for flying
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
08:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> does anyone knows how to get your hands on a free vps, i wanna host my own server now and i can't effort it :feelsamazingman:
08:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> just wanna test the code and find bugs for sometimes
08:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> just wanna test the code with other players and find bugs
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> then you don't need a vps
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> you can do it on your computer
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but AWS gives you free trials on fairly well featured VPSes
09:24 < bridge> <reitw> I saw avo here, just asked him
09:24 < bridge> <reitw> there was no context before that, avo is the only one using k8s afaik here
09:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah he recommended it somewhere else? Ok nice
09:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use k8s BTW
09:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not privately because it‚Äôs bloat but at work
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> u se gentoo
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use gentoo
09:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not free but I sell managed tw servers for 1 euro a month.
09:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you wanna provide credit card details you can get free vps at oracle but I didn‚Äôt test it not sure if it‚Äôs good
09:36 < bridge> <reitw> oh, well I'm learning all of that through kodekloud which is amazing. well you pay obv but they give you access to labs etc... They explain pretty well
09:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> we don't have worldwide usable credit cart here in iran, but thank you
10:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> happy wednesday
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> happy wednesday
10:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> feels good to not work
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> feels bad to not work
10:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
10:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> duality of life
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bro, how can i debug the server segmentation fault ?
10:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> welcome to cpp
10:06 < bridge> <Ewan> with much difficulty
10:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> but since u new i think its probs  obvious
10:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u the one making a bot
10:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i made a hook tracker to see who kills who, and some times when you keep hooking the player and kill him, the server shots down
10:08 < bridge> <Ewan> are u clearing the hook when the tee dies
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur probs holding a ptr to a freed character
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz kills frees the character
10:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> characters are allocated on spawn and freed on death
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> players are kept
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> track the player instead
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> cplayuer
10:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> CPlayer
10:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> when a character dies it became a player right ?
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> no9
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> it becomes nothing
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u hold  a invalid pointer
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to do CCharacter::GetPlayer
10:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no longer you can acces the character
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> player = tee-independent representation of a particular client
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> character = the tee
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> CCharacter is the physical representation
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> u could say
10:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so when it dies you can't access the character nor the player ?
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> you can access the player
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> you can access the player
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> not character
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> use character instead
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> for the credit i guess
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> agh i was gonna shower 15 min ago
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean player
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> XD
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> to be clear
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ‚ùå character
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> ‚úÖ player
10:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can i get the player with ,  m_pCharacter->getplayer()  when the character dies ?
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> well
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> before the character dies
10:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> just get it when u track the hooks
10:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> CPlayer holds a ptr to CCharacter too
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> they p much interchangeable except for in this instance
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> both exist
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> CPlayer::GetCharacter
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> CCharacter::GetPlayer
10:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> always check if ur ptrs are null
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> deen merge my rescue pr when :justatest:
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo where did i put my airpods ‚ùì
10:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i cant find a method to get the player by ClientID, there is a```cpp
10:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> GameServer()->GetPlayerChar(ClientID)
10:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
10:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i want something like ```cpp
10:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> GameServer()->GetPlayer(ClientID)
10:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
10:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> #questions
10:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ?
11:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Access m\_apPlayers array
11:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs public
11:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> love you bro
11:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Methods bloat
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> or just `GameServer()->GetPlayerChar(ClientID)->GetPlayer()`
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> check that pointer tho
11:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That breaks if no char
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> > check that pointer tho
11:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Still
11:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Player might exist without char
11:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i currently using this but gave me segment fails sometimes
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> because you're not checking the returned character pointer or player pointers
11:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe player def
11:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Des
11:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fuck phones
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> u just called deen a player
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> he's a committed man don't you know
11:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is it in game/server/player.h ? i can't find it
11:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In Gameserver
11:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay that‚Äôs it
11:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I turn off autocorrect
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GameServer()->m\_apPlayers
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude its op
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I could write fakin code on my ohone now
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay but now i can not type puone anymore
11:24 < bridge> <cyberfighter> fat fingers

11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> insider info
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> call me zorbuk
11:33 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Can someone Ping that Insider in the Channel please Ty :owo:
11:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot
11:52 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone diagnose while zooming out is rly laggy btw
11:52 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Wasnt that Always the Case afair?
11:53 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what you remember
11:55 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> If you Zoom Out past map border on huge Maps, i remember it beeing normal for your Frames to drop as Low as 10 per Second - cant try it Out atm tho
11:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Latest client should allow zooming without lags #7408
11:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7408
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 #7724
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's only interesting for ogl 1.x & editor.
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you are interested in making the editor text faster you could use the text overlay textures like the map rendering does
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the `Text` call is simply too inefficient
12:31 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7724
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (so what i mean is check if tilebuffering is supported => 2d textures arrays are supported)
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the overlay textures would probably be moved out of mapimages.cpp tho, doesn't really fit there if it is used for editor too ^^
13:27 < ChillerDragon> after so many years i finally understood the power of interactive rebase :D
