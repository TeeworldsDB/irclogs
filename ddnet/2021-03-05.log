01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> any idea?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/817188779793711144/9d6d8cc00cf7008e01790c14be03be08.png
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet.exe is not supposed to be a dynamic link library so I guess something went very wrong while linking
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but dlls have DllMain, not WinMain
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe bcs of the console stuff, i only tested it with MinGW
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not with VS
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe u need to tell VS that the entry is still main and not WinMain
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs have to add /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Does anyone know why my shields and weapons sometimes move and sometimes stand still?
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Only idea I have would be if you havent restarted the client in many days
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 for your information, if you remember: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/db9a4609c959cfbab218f93c8a8289f47ebed84b
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that okay? or should i apply the ddnet version: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/base/system.c#L2365
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen ^ :monkaS:
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen @deen there are 2 deens
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i think u need to tell cloudflare to reset the cache
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or the image wont be updated
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Hey, 2 questions:
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> 1. Is there a way to do this: `bind mouse1 "+weapon1; wait 1ms; +fire; +weapon2"`. The idea is to change weapon to hammer, hit and then change it to weapon2. Without "wait 1ms" it's not working, and I didn't heard of such function. Is there any alternative?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> 2. In theory, is there a way to connect tee without GUI, without client. Directly from script connect to a game server, walk, join teams, complete the map? Am I right or am I missing something?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki you could also add a ?version=1 at the end of images, but will do
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @paulmost no, there is no wait.
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, also no tee possible without gui
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut both seem okay
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> @deen can I add wait function? Do you think it will have a use in future?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> I can see a bunch of functionality around it
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's unlikely to get added
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could script parts with it
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> No
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> If you are talking about bind then max bind commands is 3 or smth
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Or maybe you are talking about smth else
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm talking about things like rocket jump, hammer fly, etc.
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could time it perfectly with this wait command
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Hm
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Makes sense actually
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> what about "next_tick" command?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Same as wait 1ms but executed on next tick sent to server
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It also requires a bit of work to turn the very sync console into an async console ;P
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Oh that's what I was afraid of
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Wait why console? Or you mean functionality which executes binds. I didn't seen DDNet client on this part, I can be talking non-sense
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiki Kusuo> i have this problem. if i enter ddrace after 5 min i got this pls  help i want to play ddrace https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/739791189641003010/817085701350096926/20210303_194036.jpg?width=628&height=471 @deen @murpi
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Saiki Kusuo other games work fine for you? This looks like a GPU issue. Try updating driver, try gfx_opengl_major 1 (F1) and restarting client, try a new GPU
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiki Kusuo> thx i try it
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> also try limiting your framerate to something sane using `gfx_refresh_rate [amount]`
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying to scroll to the bottom of a QTreeView, whenever an item is inserted
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `self.log2.rowsInserted.connect(lambda: self.logView.scrollToBottom())`
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is my current code
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but this only works if I insert two rows at once, otherwise we only scroll to the second to last entry
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who is a qtreeview?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtreeview.html
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is C++, what you have looks like python. Is there some documentation for the binding?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really, it's "do whatever you do in C++"
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe this https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/PySide2/QtWidgets/QTreeView.html
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, this is one of the reasons I despise rmgui. I bet that’s some internal state shenanigans
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Scrolltobottom referring to an outdated internal state sounds like the issue
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree @ the latter
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there maybe some later event you can react to?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Give the state time to get corrected maybe
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html#signals
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12657294/keep-qtableview-scrolling-to-the-last-row-when-the-model-is-growing
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here you go ;P
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks, my google-fu was failing me
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've been stuck there for at least half an hour
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mind sharing the google query?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wanna see my google query? ;D
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rowsinserted scroll to bottom
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I haven't mentioned the signal name, only the class names
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was actually looking for the “behaviour” was ready to add qt at the end of that
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But spotted this post
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully it works
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AMAZING
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it owrks
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that chinese clone requires mobile phone straight up
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats china for u
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> for the record not many chinese people uses email regularly. many kids don't even know what email is nowadays.
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’ve stated many times my position on this. If you want people to behave like humans online, you need proper id verification
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let’s have a philosophical analysis of this. Do you think it’s the default human condition to be a dick?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People behaving well are only doing so to appear good. Trying to preserve their reputation. The second we give them the ability to reset their reputation whenever, they always act like assholes. The more anonymous the medium the more egregious the behaviour
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then u live in a bubble
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in real life u meet a lot nice people
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But would they still be nice if it wouldn’t serve them?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if u see them in person u can notice if they are nice or only act like it
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like someone I meet at a classroom can call me a retarded sewer rat with other people around without losing their reputation
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc but if u spend enough time with them u notice how they are
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean you develop a sense for it, sure. But my point is these people still act nice. Because you are forced to act nice to be a part of the society
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc these dicks exist but there are a lot people who are nice
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m just taking it a step further and asking whether all niceness is a result of this
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so i wouldnt they its the default human condition
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so i wouldnt say its the default human condition
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can tell some people are more genuine, but maybe they are better actors. Would they still act nice given complete anonymity is something I wonder a lot
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why would they act bad
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what do they get from it
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because there is no reason not to do it. You only need to believe it’ll get you to your goal
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but there is also no reason to randomly be bad
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. in america some people think treating waitresses awfully is a way to get good service
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u can just not care
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if you see a small insect and nobody is around. do you kill it or do you save it?  if you save it, then why are you doing it
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SP | Someone thinks insulting us is a good way to achieve his goal of getting unbanned
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sp someone is braindamaged
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is real selfish benefits to being extremely mean
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think the human nature is to be super selfish
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it’s in my home it’s dying
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> humans need friends
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats mean
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this is where our disagreement stems from. I think most people are extremely selfish, or at the very least only care about a small minority of people around them
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are you like that
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> must suck to be learath
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I try not to be, but it sometimes takes conscious effort
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on the exact situation
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I were truly selfless I’d donate all my money to some charity and off myself
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it doesnt just make you happy to be freindly IRL without benefit?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but why do you spend time for ddnet then for example
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess most people lie on a spectrum of selfishness?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you get no return
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s almost the only thing I’m actually good at. It makes me feel fulfilled instead of empty and useless
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At a certain level my interest in ddnet is selfish even though the action is good for other people too
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok then ur selfish
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I’m sure at a certain level I can make any action any person takes apparently selfish
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no selfless act imo. Even the most selfless looking acts usually are done to fulfill yourself at some level
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 real life ID isn't stuff that makes people behave. check facebook or twitter
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to implement consequences. Facebooks consequences are just not large enough
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hard to change ID might make bans more effective
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Learath2 that selfishness is basic self respect. if youre not at least a bit selfish you have to be dpressed
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (They are large enough to filter the viler behaviour you’d see in completely anonymous mediums like teeworlds or 4chan)
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lets require personal id for ddnet accounts
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there was no privacy concern, I’d be totally for it
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok then mobile number
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's only helpful for making bans more effective
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I read a paper comparing Korea (where you register with your id) and Eu cheating rates in league of legends
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are virtually 0 reoffenders in Korea, since you can’t get a new id number
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link please
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They also coerce people into not acting like complete buffoons
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’ll look for it
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Does anyone know why my shields and weapons sometimes move and sometimes stand still?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it was a riot employees blog showing some statistics
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Learath2  you prefer fake nice people to real assholes?   thats bluepilled
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if they faked their stats
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw it’s quite simple to see how effective this is with s real life example. If I threatened to cut off your tongue if you say a bad word, you’d very quickly stop using bad words
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people still stole in the medieval ages
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now how ethical that is in terms of proportional punishment, I don’t know. But high consequences are quite simply the best way to get compliance
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> despite such practices
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same for murder and capital punishment
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because they think they wont be caught
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Difference is with the perfect surveillance today, you only get one chance to steal before losing your hands and thus the ability to steal
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, we don't have perfect surveillance
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> crime solving is far from 100%
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure what the correct word is
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why not
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> people who want to do harm can still use disposable numbers
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because no way we're going to require phone numbers
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it just harms people who play peacefully but anonymously
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do u get a disposable number
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well in teeworlds itd be 100%
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We control the entire medium afterall
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u dont
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> plenty of ways, there are sites that let u receive sms ( ie  <https://smsreceivefree.com> ), u can use google voice or a similar service, u can buy a cheap sim card/burner phone, u can use a friend's phone, etc
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but it costs money
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is all hypothetical btw, there is ofc no way we implement my insane world view into ddnet 😄
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> almost all of those things are free lol
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ddos also costs money right
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes often
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Im 'corneum not if u have made ur own botnet
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by distributing programs with virus
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye sure
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> google voice is free
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the part of the medium we care about. I don’t care if someone hosts their own anarchy server
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u still dont control it totally
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would need to control the entire internet
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For this hypothetical, lets say I want to enforce the rule that you cant say some word on ddnet
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only care what happens on ddnet servers, thus I only need to control that
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> humans know how to bypass that
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing that mattersi s the meaning of the word
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My point being this argument is moot because there is no getting away with it in this case
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, but you are taking incredible risk now. If a human mod catches you you arent going to play the game for a month
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell that to ppl in dictatorships
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that still are alive
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean people that dont agree with the dictator?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cant never have total control
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1984 is a nice book
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But its taking place in a rather large world where there are opportunities to sneak around
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the internet seems pretty big to me
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here its literally bytes going through to our server
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you dont even have full control over yourself tho
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can always mentally manipulate a higher up
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can AI have full complete control over something really simple?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lets mentally manipulate ryo
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone can also go the physical location of the server
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and destroy it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hes already on reddit
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure but I think we are getting beside the point. If I want to punish cheating harshly, the more anonymous the medium the less options I have for pubishment
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Has it anything to do to the channel?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lets go to the physical location of ddnet
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ddnetcon 2021
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> lets go
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a bit off topic, but it's where the people who'd want to talk about something like this reside
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go to hetzner servers location
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant just enter hetzner servers location
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn i lost my dota game cuz i was reading this
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have something on topic to ask, feel free, we can stop :P
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if u dont work there
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> I subscribed this channel to receive some info on dev and reading through messages about... I don't even get the point
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 anyway, if there were total control i doubt it would last
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i just need to pay someone at hetzner to put fake ranks for me in the database?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there is no place where total control lasted for long
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> total control being a hard dictatorship here
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe north korea is near that
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what they doing over there
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum yes, but unlikely to happen 😉 there are bigger targets than ddnet on hetzner
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the only one who has more control over ddnet than learath is hetzner ceo
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well that makes it easier for him then right?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bill gates can buy anyone here
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and anyone would accept
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> even u
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would accept ofc
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having ur life resolved
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> over a game
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who wouldnt
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vlc
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do have very abstract talks like this sometimes. It's off-topic but we've kinda accepted it
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym subscribed
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> So what are you talking about?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u want to see the real dev progress and talk github is the best place for you
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Like servers and stuff
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> GitHub is too dead
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> $info
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> $github
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> $about
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are chatting about the effects of annonimity and whether 0 anonimity would prevent people from acting like assholes
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i figured out why the $profile and $points stopped updating
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the cache is too big to load in memory
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are you one of those that accept more "security" by saying yes to a state police?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> too many ranks
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and users
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Just prune cache 😄
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No but not because I don't think it'll bring more security. It's because my desire for privacy is more than the amount of security I thibk we'd get
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> Or maybe having something like RabbitMQ might solve the problem
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we are at a sweet spot in real life in western countries
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but privacy is the first thing the state trades for "security"
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On ddnet we have a lot more privacy, but no security at all. That's far from the sweet spot imo
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is ddnet especially toxic?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> look up steam reviews
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u justn eed to play dota 2
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a valve game
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to learn
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the truth
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about humanity
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can technically get infinitely toxic in ddnet since we have no way to stop it
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> DDNet is not toxic until Russian players log in
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then we have a miracly right here right?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <paulmost> No racism, I'm Russian
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u look at % of toxic
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then we have a miracle right here right?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure its less than 1
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but sp someone always shines
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well depends on what u consider toxic
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point is that there is no way for us to get rid of that 1% nor is there anything ever stopping them
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> % of toxic
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i updated <https://ddnet.tw/explain/?layer=game>
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In real life societal pressure takes care of this. You can't act like an absolute degenerate
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 thats just false
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at any karen
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in a supermarket
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats a level of degeneracy that americans seem to accept. Try the same in europe and I bet you'd stop real fucking quick
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nah you cant just explain it like this
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I shout at a supermarket worker people will look at me like I'm insane
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> there are areas where karens are possible and there are areas where its not possible.  no matter what country
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-zenimax-deal-approved-us-securities-exchange-commission/
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its done
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they did it
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean sure, but have you met sny karens here? Or have you seen more than like 1 or 2 instances even on video?

20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yay I guess. Hopefully they keep the spirit of the studio alive
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how to attach gdb to a running process
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Learath2 u sure you dont live inside a black mirror episode? 😄
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got my ddnet client frozen
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its unfrozen now
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so something must be doing this
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and idk what is it
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it doesnt crash its hard to know
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Load binary. Attach with `attach <pid>` c when it breaks to keep going
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im sure its related to discord
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 have you ever used nom? (rust lib)
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. it's a parser combinator
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki btw Zwelf and i created our own version of about:tiles which is quite extendable :)
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fairly, I think I'm just a little too glass half empty than most people
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/teestatus/blob/master/src/server_v2.rs> i implemented the server info with it
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes you cross me as a overthinker
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 180 lines only :poggers:
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the svg thing?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pessimistic overthinker sounds about right
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hard to put it in the wiki due to svg script security issues
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats cringe @Learath2
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Better overthink than not think at all, no?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hard to explain...  its like emo
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you can overthink and just accept it and be happy anyway
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you don’t reach a conclusion, what are you supposed to accept?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that very fact
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you cant reacha conclusion so just dont worry about it
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u know germany removed all their nuclear reactors due to ignorant ppl fear? and the very fact of removing this and going for coal kills more ppl statistically
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda hilarious
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzfpyo-q-RM
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> @Ryozuki I think should work with an iframe, object or embed the same way you embed the other svgs
20:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> but it doesn't load any external javascript code and even embeds the png
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl  who die by each energy production mean

20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way*
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/817480960500170772/unknown.png
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting data eh
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but nuclear bad
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nuclear death isnt the same as coal death tho.
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So when can you reach a conclusion? If you can never reach a conclusion there is no need to think about anything. But certainly there are ideas that can be taken to a logical conclusion
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking at one statistic and calling it a day is lazy
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the whole video then
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm sure I can find a favorable one for coal, out of all things
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So which things am I allowed to think about and not be cringe?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go for it
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is true in a lot of places. Happened a couple times even in china
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> square meter of uninhabitable land created? as in "you can't go there"
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the c oal itself will make the entire planet inhabitable
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki now you're changing goal posts, the above thing was about past events
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you can think about anything but when i realize that going urther into it is going to be bad for me in any way then i just stop.
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ????
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nuclear is by far the safest and cleanest source of consistent energy as far as I’ve read. I’m obviously no expert but the decision from countries to phase out nuclear does look silly to me
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there is lot of FUD
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know it's one of reddit's favorites positions to hold, at the very least
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what about that waste tho. they dont know where to put it yet
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> serioiusly, watch the vid
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its backed by references to scientific papers
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just because reddit agrees with it doesn’t mean it’s false
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://sites.google.com/view/sources-nuclear-death-toll/
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> pff science
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the sources
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 obviously not
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s much safer to store nuclear waste underground than storing co2 in the air 😄
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/817481993767747602/1614371255799.jpg
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> science
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why r u always like this
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about science
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> LOL
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda cringy
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk its just funny
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its joke ryozuki
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it reminds me of dumb americans and flat earthers
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> triggers me
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does the video say about nuclear waste @Ryozuki?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki big snowflake
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 it mentions it
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> near the end
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not going to watch a video
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you can't tell me what it says, we might as well stop here ^^
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well then the dicussion can end
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s about 10 minutes, so it’s likely not a time concern
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's bad form to say that people are stupid but still not willing to explain your position
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not a good communicator, the video communicates stuff rly well
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont want to watch it the discussion ends here
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I don't like videos, waste of time, mostly
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> X2 speed ftw
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kurzgesagt is rly good channel btw
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I know
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Ryozuki  how are you now different than to any other eligious person?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Ryozuki  how are you now different than to any other religious person?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I find well presented and well sourced videos much more accessible than actual research on most matters
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the whole science reddit thing is the biggest cult rn
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like well presented texts better
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it allows me to go in my own speed, verifying stuff as-is
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well people learn in different ways
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3blue1brown has excellent visualizations for mathematical concepts. I think there is extra value in the visual part of a video
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can go at ur speed
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pause the video
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep @Learath2
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://sites.google.com/view/sources-nuclear-death-toll/
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sent u this before btw
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its text
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the good old way
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i prefer to read stuff related to statistics or studies etc
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> stuff like lemmino is good for youtube tho
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just documentaries on interesting concepts
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With something like kurzgesagt the extra value comes from the accessibility. It’s rather difficult to actually read the papers on such complex matters. Even if you are scientifically literate enough you are lacking in domain knowledge that would let you spot biases
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s much easier to compensate for the selection bias of the author of a video/collection than to compensate for very complex statistical mistakes in actual papers
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> kurzgesagt is great, especially how they admitted when they did mistakes on some videos. good stuff
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 > – However, all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power. Opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk, while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind, it is arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than 
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Around 90% of the total waste volume is composed of tools and work clothing that is only lightly contaminated and contains only 1% of the total radioactivity. It loses most or all of its radioactivity within 300 years and is mostly stored on the power plants, where it doesn’t require special shielding such as concrete walls or protective clothing for the nuclear workers.
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > oughly 7% is intermediate-level waste, such as used filters and steel components from the reactors. This kind of waste has been exposed to alpha radiation or contains long-lived radionuclides in concentrations that require isolation beyond several hundred years. This kind of waste needs to be solidified in concrete or bitumen and is mostly buried in shallow repositories on the site.
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > So we can handle 97% of the nuclear waste quite well, but the real trouble starts with the remaining 3%. These 3% consists of the highly radioactive materials produced as a byproduct of the nuclear reactions that occur inside the reactors.
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly, i would simply put it in a elon musk rocket and make it go as far as possible
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > – In a ploy to appease the public, the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022.
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the biggest problem is that uranium is not endless, if all countries would have nuclear power it would be gone in less than 20 years
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think thats a problem
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it is
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think there is quite lot
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its the biggest problem indeed
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Ryozuki youre telling me germany shut down nuclear energy just because people wanted them to?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think u underestimate how much energy is consumed in future, e.g. by india and china
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hell no
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: didn't you have teeworlds log parser?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why would the gov suddenly listen. especially when th epeople are wrong
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i think merkel got some big corps behind telling them to use coal
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> Thorium, the better Uranium
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the big boys get more money
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that sounds a bit more like it
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, I actually am not sure about the numbers but uranium is EXTREMELY energy dense and we devised ways to squeeze every bit of it. I think we have enough to power earth for quite some time
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not to mention other radioactive elements we have access to like thorium
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > On Earth Uranium is surprisingly plentiful for a heavy metal. In fact estimate place the Earth’s supply of Uranium at 30 times that of Silver.
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so what its not a new realisation that the old energy sources are going to get emptied before we actually switch
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not all is suitable
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without a chain reaction its useless
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.forbes.com/sites/llewellynking/2020/06/08/uranium-supply-isnt-the-crisis-in-the-nuclear-industry/
20:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Ryozuki: Can you try to set an iframe to https://wiki.ddnet.tw/images/3/3a/Entities.svg in the wiki?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all FUD from coal companies
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they rly dont want  govs to go nuclear
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it’s not an argument I can take at face value. So I’ll need sources for it
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> once the sources are empty we have the technology to switch quickly. i dont see the problem except global warming
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i heard something about mining uranium from asteroids
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nearby
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> science fiction
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw green energy is already cheaper today
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its only that we dont have a storage yet
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all oil and coal companies
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling we never will. Lion batteries are about as dense as we can get them and they have very unfavourable characteristics
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wtf they use lions for batteries? cruel
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Zwelf: check this https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/TilesSvg
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well there is lion batteries that are solid
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont burn for example
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and have higher capacity
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of the energy storage is in form of gravitational potential where we pump a lot of water up a hill. And that is not energy dense enough (but you can store massive quantities)
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> Zwelf they key u have to use on iframes is "local"
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> i just added it
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> and then the absolute path without the domain
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> as u can see in the link i sent
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> ah nice, I couldn't get it to work
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> there was no way u could get it to work
21:07 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> due to my bad
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> i didnt add the local key
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> $wgIframe['server']['ddnet'] = [ 'scheme' => 'https', 'domain' => 'ddnet.tw' ];
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> $wgIframe['server']['local'] = [ 'scheme' => 'https', 'domain' => 'wiki.ddnet.tw' ];
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> u need to allow a domain first
21:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Ryozuki-> to enable iframes for it

21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> I have a suggestion for DDNet. Sometimes you're playing a map, a cool map. And then you forgot what was the name of the map, it would be cool to have an option in the webpage to see the last map you've played. This idea it's not the same as the maps that the webpage shows when you finish a map, this works without the necessity of finish a map.

21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess you want to replace gas, coal and oil:

21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while nuclear is around 10%
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you u basically want additional 600% of nuclear power

21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so even in a very optimistic calculation that is only 43 years of supply

21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If we now consider that we also have primary energy(cars, planes, trains and so on) that should use oil anymore

22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't forget a lot of countries use gas coal and oil for all their power needs not just the baseline. You only need to replace the baseline with nuclear and we can then maybe feasibly meet the spikes in demand using renewables and existing power storage solutions
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we make everything nuclear we don't really get much time to come up with something more sustainable
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well probs germany should have started with replacing coal true
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the coal industry is a huge pain
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what kind of improvement will come first, will it be a breakthrough in battery technology or a breakthrough in power generation like maybe fusion
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if 2025 iter is a success, how fast fusion will develop from there
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but in the end our time limit is around 2040, maximum 2050
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its pretty risky to only rely on new technology
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only time will show
