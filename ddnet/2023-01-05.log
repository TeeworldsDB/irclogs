11:03 <+bridge> <murpi> > Just a curiosity: I compared resources consuming of Teeworlds and DDnet.
11:03 <+bridge> <murpi> > I noticed surprisly that DDnet use 3x more ram memory (around 750 mb, while Teeworlds only 250 mb) and 10 times more CPU usage in percentage on an intel i3-1125g4 chip (approximately 20%, while teeworlds only 2%)
11:04 <+bridge> <murpi> > 
11:04 <+bridge> <murpi> > I guess in the evolution of its development DDnet became heavier along adding new features and/or adopting different libraries 
11:04 <+bridge> <murpi> > 
11:04 <+bridge> <murpi> > What do you know about?
11:04 <+bridge> <murpi> posted on the teeworlds discord server
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Doubt the ram increase is only caused by me. We have much more stuff laying around. Also more cpu i highly doubt
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Teeworlds runs worse
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> He should post fps and throttle settings
