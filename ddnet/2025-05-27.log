00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> Non argument
00:00 < bridge> <syrinok> Whole game's meaningless with an admin team that halfass cares about it :greenthing:
00:00 < bridge> <kebscs> real
00:00 < bridge> <kebscs> only roby keeping it alive
00:00 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i.. dont even really agree
00:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> people are burnt out or busy with other stuff, im almost certain. i don't think i would equate that to not caring
00:01 < bridge> <syrinok> Sure, in the end it's the same thing
00:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> end result yeah
00:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but framing the issue correctly is important
00:02 < bridge> <louis> its not like tas ranks exist permanently, they're reversible as in you can remove them from the db
00:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm gonna read the entire QUIC spec today
00:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wish me luck
00:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> goddamnitsfuckinlong
00:03 < bridge> <Ewan> they have nobody to please but kids who came to ddnet because it was free and bcs their potato PCs can run it
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no novelty in the OSS nature anymore
00:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'll be honest the audience is a huge deal of it
00:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> from my end as well
00:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if I know I'm banning some grade schoolers friend who's honestly just going to block other people after I disconnect, it's not exactly something I get much gratification from
00:06 < bridge> <gorp_tw> The older community has stalled out or diffused into duos or otherwise private spaces it seems
00:06 < bridge> <gorp_tw> the "groups" now are mostly children
00:06 < bridge> <learath2> Tons of devs is a vast overstatement. Only like 3 are working on any level of activity that's beyond fixing things that are emergencies
00:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> just on changelog alone ive seen at least a handful of ppl I didnt even know in 2022
00:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i get that they're not all active or whatever
00:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but they're here, they exist, and if maybe we all organized and talked about it, they would be more active :P
00:08 < bridge> <learath2> They are all new and interested in shiny new things that are shiny and new
00:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> maybe! but we should ask :3
00:10 < bridge> <learath2> No one new is interested in (or capable of) working on finishing up a PoC by a senior dev changing vast pieces of networking code to unblock another PoC that is about to bring a version of accounts that are not very intuitive and don't really do anything
00:11 < bridge> <learath2> All the pieces of my statement above can be argued about, but just the fact that it needs discussing is enough to put off most the new people. They want to change text colors. add new ui, add new packets
00:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i will make sure the conversation happens and prove learath-kun wrong
00:12 < bridge> <kebscs> even with fixing and 1 line prs its like 10 devs max
00:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hai @alw5 @sollybunny ya wanna talk about accounts together
00:13 < bridge> <learath2> I know an almost surefire way to get QUIC completed ASAP
00:13 < bridge> <learath2> Implement in a very dirty way DTLS over UDP instead. Open the PR and heinrich is sure to show back up to stop the madness
00:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> xD
00:14 < bridge> <gorp_tw> drop back compat
00:14 < bridge> <gorp_tw> DROP 0.7
00:15 < bridge> <louis> u gotta find rce in old vers to get admins to drop backwards compatibility
00:16 < bridge> <aegisub> who wants to add new feature:
00:16 < bridge> <aegisub> who wants to maintain features:
00:16 < bridge> <learath2> You can technically create a secure channel over an insecure one (with some drawbacks). My veery first attempt at accounts used something akin to STARTTLS
00:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> YES
00:16 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you're not-
00:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> revert back to monke
00:16 < bridge> <gorp_tw> supposed to agree
00:16 < bridge> <learath2> The ddnet.tw domain being lost almost got all the old versions killed
00:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> we need zombietoad now
00:17 < bridge> <louis> yes i was almost happy
00:18 < bridge> <kebscs> domain lost, discord links lost
00:18 < bridge> <kebscs> 😂
00:18 < bridge> <kebscs> discord.gg/ddnet
00:19 < bridge> <kebscs> discord.gg/ddracenetwork
00:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yooooooooooooooooooooo
00:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> time to join up
00:19 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf I don't even see all that much of an issue leaving all non-critical communication unencrypted. But this was litigated in the past and past heinrich somehow convinced past me it wasn't a great idea. So it probably isn't a great idea
00:19 < bridge> <kebscs> wrong link still in #welcome
00:19 < bridge> <kebscs> not even first time this is brought up
00:20 < bridge> <learath2> @murpi can you remove that link?
00:20 < bridge> <learath2> Discord for some reason refuses to let us be a partner. So everytime our nitro boost runs out someone yoinks our invite link
00:22 < bridge> <always> hi i like accounts
00:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> cool one second
00:26 < bridge> <learath2> Chat should I quickly rush through and make a very centralized very traditional account system?
00:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be measurably better than nothing
00:26 < bridge> <Ewan> which is the track we’re on
00:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> like, literally i will fork over cash
00:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> 100 USD
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> we are seeing yet another example of the software developer's desire for output vs the software engineer's desire for perfection
00:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> kog has a fuckin chat command man
00:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> literally anything would work
00:28 < bridge> <syrinok> do it, I believe in you
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> that's not even to say the desire for perfection is better all the time, that's how we end up here
00:29 < bridge> <learath2> Trying to solve zooko's trilemma was our first mistake. Far smarter people have tried, far smarter people have failed
00:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Surely my sweet Learath would never let me down
00:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Quick guys, grab his booze
00:29 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you need booze money buddy
00:29 < bridge> <gorp_tw> im bribing you now, deadass
00:30 < bridge> <Ewan> what does the AT protocol miss out of these demands
00:30 < bridge> <Ewan> seemed kinda cool to me the way they did it
00:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> AT mentioned
00:30 < bridge> <Ewan> is @whatever considered high entropy
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated question: has anyone seen this (using MinGW)?
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan>  libcurl error (77): error setting certificate
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> file: C:/msys64/home/ewan/TaterClient-DDNet/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> browser won't load at all, and it's quite annoying
00:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think this is directly caused by anything in ddnet/tclient code, it's probably some stupid (and false) preprocessor assumptions
00:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's new
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> honestly though i have zero idea why it would treat the build folder as the sysroot
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> honestly though i have zero idea why it would treat the source folder as the sysroot
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> Well it only pretends to be decentralized. It's freeloading off of DNS which is centralized
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it's centralized in that it has authoritative servers, but i'm not sure how you can get better than that
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> we can't store every hostname on every instance and hope the naive resolution by each is correct
00:37 < bridge> <learath2> You can check out the wikipedia page for zookos "trilemma" and see some clever actual solutions to it. I also consider those cheating
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> actual solutions or cheating? xd
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i looked at the page for a sec
00:40 < bridge> <Ewan> can someone explain to me like i'm stupid how blockchain even got so prominent for decentralized networking
00:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i understand proof of work as consensus but is that the only way
00:40 < bridge> <learath2> Well wikipedia considers them actual solutions it seems. I don't really since each has a flaw.
00:40 < bridge> <learath2> 
00:41 < bridge> <learath2> The blockchain solution is only truly secure if noone controls more than half the network.
00:41 < bridge> <learath2> 
00:41 < bridge> <learath2> The decentralized ip thing is only "human meaningful" in the sense that you can make out the sounds of the names.
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> the ultimate hack
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> just bind all ipv4 sections to english words
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> human readable!!!
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate "memorable" passwords from password managers too
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> the reason you exist is so i don't have to remember the passwords. stop putting words in there
00:42 < bridge> <learath2> LoserPotatoCatGravity
00:45 < bridge> <learath2> Our upcoming account system has human meaningful names, is secure and is a tiny bit decentralized in the sense that it technically allows third parties to piggyback off of our centralized accounts
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> > LoserPotatoCatGravity
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> if u think this is meaningful idk what to say
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> numbers have meaning too. this is no different from a string of those
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> they also tend to forget that people mainly remember words in grammatically correct scenarios? where if there's any uncertainty on the order of the words, it can be decided thru grammatical rules
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> putting random shit together isn't that at al
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> putting random shit together isn't that at all
00:48 < bridge> <louis> its still more memorable than $$287be&^bOucuq1
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> However, the human meaningful names are not assigned by the central server so can't really be used for anything. They are also not really shown anywhere. They just kinda exist
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> 
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> It's pretty secure unless we all missed something major. So we did pretty well on that part
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> 
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> And is pretty much not decentralized, if the ddnet account server were to be dead for a while other server wouldn't really be able to issue certificates instead of us
00:49 < bridge> <learath2> So given 3 options, allowed to pick 2, we picked 1.6 options
00:50 < bridge> <learath2> You are supposed to weave a story through it to remember it
00:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you're telling me CorrectHorseBatteryStaple has a story?
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe to the average joe but i have a hard time seeing a scenario where i remember either of these
00:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> im definitely gonna remember any 4 words honestly, if i type it more than maybe 3 times
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> make unmemorable ID, memorable name
00:51 < bridge> <louis> its also easy to type them manually in cases where u have to
00:51 < bridge> <learath2> Imagine a Loser losing a Potato, finding that the Cat ate it, while at the ceiling because the Gravity is upside down. Or something like that
00:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> at work i constantly have to have my password reset by the manager because i frequently forget to clock out, and after entering it once i just remember it and use that password they came up with l o l
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> is imagining that more or less work than taking the effort to memorize a shorter password? in this case the words aren't much more meaningful than individual characters, since it's not a password and ppl aren't really trying to brute force guess them & as such length matters less
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> or, lookup by name, if there are duplicates you don't have to remember yours *exactly*, just well enough to know which is which
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> is imagining that more or less work than taking the effort to memorize a shorter UID? in this case the words aren't much more meaningful than individual characters, since it's not a password and ppl aren't really trying to brute force guess them & as such length matters less
00:55 < bridge> <learath2> Depends on the way your memory works I reckon. A lot of blind rubix cube solvers similarly use stories to memorize a set of moves. Ditto for people memorizing pi and decks of cards
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> that has merit
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> for an account identifier tho im just not sure
00:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ID should be human-readable though for /players/id no?
00:57 < bridge> <learath2> Weren't we talking about passwords? The idea with using words is that you can remember them easier but they result in far longer effective passwords, making the possibility space massive
00:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or at least not super long
00:58 < bridge> <learath2> The current accounts implementation has human-readable (even meaningful) usernames, albeit they are per server network
00:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> name would be fine, as it is you already have 404s on the staff page from name changes
00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> oh, for passwords i think 4 words together is better than 4 characters together purely for security's sake
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> not really for memorability, but in my opinion, memorability isn't a factor when we're talking about a password manager generating & storing & pulling it up for you when it's time to use it
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i wasn't following that closely but i think the conversation drifted a bit
01:00 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, we are having 3 interleaved convos it seems 😄
01:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> why not
01:01 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I need to sleep. Tldr, accounts when, accounts soon, accounts I am not really sure about
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i've never heard that before
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> sleep well
01:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i started a patchwork team of people that are being dragged against their will
01:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and we dont know what we're doing
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> in game or in real
01:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but
01:02 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf perhaps it's just that I'm just particularly dumb. Others seemed fairly confident in the accounts
01:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah if you are actually serious thats cool
01:02 < bridge> <vahemaaa> good night leretha2
01:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or if you want to sit with us Mr. learath you can
01:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> good nice prince
01:04 < bridge> <learath2> AH I remember why I stopped my very first attempt at accounts. It's because people told me not to roll my own crypto
01:04 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but do it
01:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i did it, once
01:05 < bridge> <learath2> Then I dug around for hourst trying to find some other audited project that implemented some standard secure channel over plaintext channel. Then I just decided the entire thing was too much of a headache
01:05 < bridge> <learath2> Then I dug around for hours trying to find some other audited project that implemented some standard secure channel over plaintext channel. Then I just decided the entire thing was too much of a headache
01:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you can have a headache with us for fun, imagine being social and enjoying doing anything with the game though
01:06 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i imagine instead murpi sitting at his desk alone with an inbox of paperwork that touches the ceiling

11:32 < bridge> <Assa> Did we ever find out what's causing the fps drop between ddnet 17 and 18?
12:27 < bridge> <zhn> https://ctf0.de/posts/realworldctf5-teewars/
12:28 < bridge> <zhn> im sure ryo posted it 2 years ago but anyway
13:30 < bridge> <kaffeine0> That would be amazing. Any plans to actually do it? Maybe there is an issue I can track? I see huge need in this (netobjs flag telling the client not to interpolate positions between ticks)
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What do you need this for? It's not about prediction
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least not anti-ping
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly a very very niche thing, I can't see it applying to much other than the case of teleporting stuff. What might be cool is a sort of flag to indicate that an netobj shouldn't be predicted at all, sort of an indicator that the object is being used in a non-standard manner
14:11 < bridge> <learath2> About fixing the teleport interpolation, I wonder if a limit to how far we interpolate for inter-ticks might be enough of a band-aid without requiring network changes
14:12 < bridge> <learath2> We can get a rough estimate of how far you can move at max speed between 2 ticks, if it's much further than that we just wouldn't interpolate
14:12 < bridge> <patiga> we also have the velocity inside of the character object
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> That's even better, if pos + vel isn't enough, don't interpolate
14:13 < bridge> <patiga> I think a sensible estimate wouldn't be too difficult to get
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds brittle, we should focus on correctness
14:13 < bridge> <patiga> there are small edge cases for why we need a threshold (e.g. ninja literally teleports you)
14:14 < bridge> <learath2> I'm just wondering if a flag to prevent interpolation from the server-side is the "correct" answer to the question
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say a counter is
14:16 < bridge> <learath2> (The entire inter-tick thing is a completely client-side concept, should the server really know about the specifics of that? I'd think it's the clients responsibility to display the movement the server sent "properly")
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> ((atleast that's what I'm thinking right now, very open to be convinced otherwise))
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The server does not really know about it. it just counts non_linear_events
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This can also be applied to ctf flags resetting, or respawing (the teleport one)
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or stuff like that
14:20 < bridge> <riaʂ> glorp
14:20 < bridge> <riaʂ> gnarp
14:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the client to know what death or teleport tiles are
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> If I were to reframe my thinking in terms of this:
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> Why are `non_linear_events` special? Wouldn't the velocity of the entity is not being enough to change the position that much be an indicator that the movement was non_linear?
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Flags resetting also suffer from the exact same issue, they have 0 velocity, they move an insane amount, obviously shouldn't be interpolated
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's usually correct and I've used it and it has worked fine almost all of the time
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> in other games of course
14:23 < bridge> <learath2> It'd also make more sense in the ninja case. It's special that the ninja has this dash looking movement, but no where do we have code for this special behaviour
14:23 < bridge> <learath2> Now what I am not sure about is whether this looks worse in the edge cases where the connection might lose some snaps and stuff

15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> Rip @.cammo.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 even if i get your point, let's stay realistic, the servers know about quite a few things that are more client side.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. the attack tick time (so animations can play even after the _actual_ attack was instant.
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the laser is not despawned before the next eval tick. so the client can render it the whole time (it will have no logic anymore, since there is an early return to destroy it in the tick)
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in other games where animations are blocking the server often has to simulate the same animation too
15:28 < bridge> <Cammodude> man
15:29 < bridge> <Cammodude> completely ruins my plans
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> str compare nocase
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or a score based comparision even better
15:30 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> add exceptions to it
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> There is one more plus to keeping this fix to the client side, old servers would immediately benefit from it too. Is there an issue for this where we can list these out and other people can chime in too?
16:26 < bridge> <robyt3> No, would be good to open an issue
16:27 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I have an issue of interpolated `POWERUP_HEALTH` positions, thought it should not be the case, as each powerup has its own `Server()->SnapNewId()`.

19:07 < bridge> <learath2> I guess this would benefit from a "do_not_predict_at_all" flag of sorts, but then the movement of the other hearts would be less smooth too, I guess this a whole different issue from both the things we discussed
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it can be "hacked around" using the "do_not_interpolate" flag thing and teleporting the heart furthest away
19:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> wait a minute, who is this coffee bean guy :poggers:
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd give the same argument as yesterday actually. If a heart is spawned in ctf then you have a massive packet loss and another heart takes the other heart's id during the gameplay then these two hearts should be different no matter the packet loss. so IMO an id must be unique forever. a `u64` would hold enough possibilities that you could never exhaust it even if you spawn one entity ever nanosecond
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd give the same argument as yesterday actually. If a heart is spawned in ctf then you have a massive packet loss and another heart takes the other heart's id during the gameplay then these two hearts should be different no matter the packet loss. so IMO an id must be unique forever. a `u64` would hold enough possibilities that you could _almost_ never exhaust it even if you spawn one entity ever nanosecond
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> Why do they have to be different? (Think in terms of teeworlds/vanilla) The hearts don't move, a heart at a given location before and after it's respawn is no different functionally at all
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> So I can see why matricks didn't ever bother going any further than what we currently have
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno do they hearts stay in memory all the time or do they get call snapnewid after respawn?
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then even two different hearts in vanilla could have the same id
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> But why do the ids matter at all?
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is what causes the interpolation i assume
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> But think vanilla, the heart isn't moving anywhere, it won't get interpolated anywhere
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks like he somehow ends up reusing the id of another heart
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then the client thinks the heart simply moved
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but they respawn, thus my question
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> but they respawn at the exact same location, no?
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes but the snapnewid would potentially give a different id
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if its called again on respawn
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> If you manage to somehow drop all snaps between the heart getting picked up and it getting respawned, whether it now has a different or the same id doesn't really matter at all
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and honestly i'd not say that was matricks reasiniong since it also applies to characters
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it has the id of another heart it will move for the client
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and honestly i'd not say that was matricks reasoning since it also applies to characters
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yeah I guess it just was never tested with snaps getting lost for that long, tbf I don't even know necessarily what is causing the interpolation in that video, I'm guessing the entity gets destroyed, calls snapfreeid, following snapnewid gets the now free old id
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps vanilla hearts don't get destroyed that far?
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probs
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, they don't they hold their id
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not?
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's funny
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder if you can cause the interpolation bug if you collect a heart exactly in the tick that a new would spawn (or one tick before)
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, you are right that a single forever unique id would be better, but I can see why matricks just didn't bother so much. A single forever unique id will keep getting larger, so you'd need larger snaps, perhaps that's what he optimized around
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe, but snap diffs should normally diff these ids away
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I assume he simply didnt think about these edge cases
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> Can it diff the ids away? You need those to know who to apply the diff to
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> Can it diff the ids away? You need those to know what to apply the diff to
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean you dont get new ids _that_ often. so between two snapshots these ids are almost always the same
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think it's much worse than reusing old ids
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which also create a snap diff for a short moment
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> Well he does seem to have thought about it enough to make sure pickups keep their ids
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then dunno xd
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> Though maybe he did that to optimize the diff size too
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pickups and hearts are the same for me tbh
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> Who knows what matricks was thinking 😄
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet 1 cent he won't know even if he'd answer here xD
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I generally wonder how much he just typed in without proper thinking. I mean it's kinda normal you just prototype some stuff and then forget to improve the bad parts
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And then it's production code
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> I bet 20 that even if he thought about it back then he probably doesn't even remember
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> I forgot a lot of the accounts discourse we had 5 years ago, let alone subtle snap behaviour decisions from 20 years ago 😄
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XD
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Teeworlds is 20 years in 2 years
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Older than 90% of player base
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> When he was around that one night he mentioned working on many iterations of this "engine" before getting to teeworlds, many more generic/flexible, more engine like projects
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> He said he wasn't getting anywhere with an actual game trying to abstract stuff away, so he stopped trying to make it so generic
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The classic
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's like those guys that say, why dont u make teeworlds in unreal engine 5
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with RAYTRACING
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> :noway:
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> Jupstar get on that rn, you are the gfx guy, we need the ray tracing asap
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't wanna lie. would be a cool side project. too bad i am not as rich as chiller and can just do whatever i want without at least partially considering my consequences
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> Raytraced lasers when?
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rs version already killed me xd
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be sick
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> blooom
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> I gtg find some food that is healthy
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i heard vegetables do that
19:57 < bridge> <faffa81> am I allowed to add line from player to ghost?

21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #questions
21:21 < bridge> <noodle.on.stuff> nobody  answers....
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then try #general , but here there will more likely be no answer either.
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also your description is really vague
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Sec

21:27 < bridge> <noodle.on.stuff> yeah u dont have it. thx tho
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yea sorry not sure, you'd be better off asking for help in that server linked
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> gl tho
21:27 < bridge> <noodle.on.stuff> i got the game skin. better than nothing
21:35 < bridge> <teero777> Just wasted 6 hours because I accidentally zoomed out using opengl 1.4
21:39 < bridge> <faffa81> Hi!
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We have a limit zoom config
21:40 < bridge> <teero777> Good to know... I've been waiting 20min for the next frame
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You must have disabled it manually xd
21:43 < bridge> <teero777> Well on vulkan the issue doesn't exist.
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Add a check if its ogl1 and force the limit
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you wont have this again
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd also accept this upstream if it helps
21:45 < bridge> <teero777> It's fine
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🫠
21:46 < bridge> <teero777> A hard coded zoom limit isn't good. Maybe a zoom reset if the frame takes too long to render
21:46 < bridge> <teero777> And cancel rendering that frame
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well hard limit for ogl1 is ok imo. cpu single thread performance wont be noticable faster in the next 10 years
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and tbh ogl1 only targets shit pcs anyway
21:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm witnessing a Deenial of Service attack.
21:47 < bridge> <teero777> No. Depending if you have entities enabled or not you get different fps.  Also it depends on how full the map is with blocks
21:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> deen getting 1€ donations
21:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is true yeah xd but i bet only u know about this setting and use ogl1 at the same time
21:50 < bridge> <patiga> well its not hard coded and you can configure it if you want to get rid of it. if it works for 99% of cases, then it makes sense imo
21:52 < bridge> <teero777> I didn't mean in general please read the messages above
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway we'll defs not cancel the frame
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is maximum complexity you want to add xD
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> real time profiling for ogl1
21:53 < bridge> <teero777> I'm still waiting for my frame
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro buy a new pc, why cant u use vulkan again
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u loading the 10k map again?
21:54 < bridge> <teero777> yes
21:54 < bridge> <teero777> please fix ur implementation xfd
21:54 < bridge> <totar> Does zooming out further make any difference once you can already see the whole map?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can use rs version
21:54 < bridge> <teero777> then I can use it
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not a "fix"
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's a rewrite
21:54 < bridge> <teero777> Yea ogl1.4 renders each block individually including the edges I think
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't downplay pls
21:55 < bridge> <totar> oh ok
21:55 < bridge> <teero777> ik ik I'm joking
21:55 < bridge> <totar> So 3x map size should be a fair zoom limit
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i think in some versions rendering has been O(1) in regards to zooming, and others O(n)?
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea why
21:55 < bridge> <teero777> So it basically takes infinite time to render my next frame
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but i’d see the same fps at any zoom level sometimes
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> others, i lag like crazy at low zooms
21:55 < bridge> <totar> Vulkan one uses a shader for the edges I think
21:56 < bridge> <teero777> In the vulkan version the entities rendering is o(n) I think. N is the map height
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Correct
21:57 < bridge> <teero777> In the vulkan version the entities rendering is o(n) I think. N is the height of the blocks visible on the screen
21:58 < bridge> <teero777> Is the rendering in ddpg way different? @jupeyy_keks
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mhh, kinda yes, kinda no.
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It still uses the O(n) approach (except for the editor which uses smth more similar to twgpu)
21:59 < bridge> <totar> If the ogl backend renders each tile individually then we can just set a limit on the number of tiles it should render before giving up?
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But since I use features like shader storage buffer I also had to change some minor things to the pipeline and the buffer creation
21:59 < bridge> <teero777> I would suggest a time limit
21:59 < bridge> <totar> same thing almost
21:59 < bridge> <totar> Time limit is much harder
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can defs do that in your fork, but pls dont upstream it xD
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Invalid rendering sounds buggy
22:00 < bridge> <totar> I was suggesting for teero
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah all fine
22:00 < bridge> <teero777> Each tile is issued individually on the cpu so a time limit is like 3 loc no?
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, taters approach is defs more sane
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CPUs have so many weird factors that could speed or slow things down
22:01 < bridge> <noodle.on.stuff> I can finally play properly. Thx Ewan, I always feel like I can’t play without that skin
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> ik measuring time is slow
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> Actually at some point measuring the time was 20% of my benchmark @jupeyy_keks xdd
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> iks de
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> The physics benchmark measured 1 second of time. Now I just do like 100mil ticks and then figure out tps with math
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> Okay I'm killing my 6hrs of work now. Haven't gotten a new frame
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> Idk if I can attach gdb to save it maybe
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes you could
22:04 < bridge> <teero777> I try
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gl
22:09 < bridge> <teero777> yea gg im a retard

22:09 < bridge> <teero777> why must that crash the game....
22:10 < bridge> <teero777> zero purpose
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, why does changing random value in gdb crash the game
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> damn
22:10 < bridge> <teero777> no
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you could have changed the height & width to return early and then change the zoom value
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then you'd have dodged this bullet
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> i just returned but ofc when i return manually it didn't call QuadsEnd(). it makes sense.
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> but instead of crashing the program it should just give a warning man
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
22:12 < bridge> <teero777> why?
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. this whole quad start, quad end shit shouldnt exist in first place
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. a bug must be visible to the programmer else you might end up with more serious bugs
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's a cascade
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> downfall
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a never ending downhill
22:13 < bridge> <teero777> a terminal warning would be enough
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i disagree
22:13 < bridge> <riaʂ> blah
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i disagree with blah
22:14 < bridge> <teero777> why do you need a crash that can possibly make the user to lose progress or cause inconvenience instead of just a simple warning?
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because unreproducable bugs are the worst
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Asserting a state is valid is important
22:15 < bridge> <teero777> okay but no need to crash the thing xd
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Especially you as a c deverloper should know
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Everytime you refused asan, asan told the truth
22:15 < bridge> <teero777> yy ik im just mad about losing 6hrs
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You'd never read the warning in the terminal of a random player
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The bug would be ignored silently
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I know, understandable
22:16 < bridge> <teero777> no it wouldn't? XD
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can you not add auto save to your tool or smth xd
22:16 < bridge> <teero777> saving costs much time
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Show me the terminal output of all ddnet players right now and I agree with you
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Once per 2h or smth
22:17 < bridge> <teero777> on run_antibuguse i had auto-save on and the saving took longer than the save-interval causing an infinite loop
