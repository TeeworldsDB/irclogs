00:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> weeb*
00:10 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> Any thoughts on what might have caused this strange CPU behaviour in the last week or so on ZAF server? It's been causing lots of irregular lag spikes, while the player count has being quite normal as per previous weeks.
00:10 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> Could it be the RAM getting full and going into swap memory? I don't fully understand the memory graph lower down, at the link: <https://ddnet.org/stats/server/#zaf3.ddnet.org>

00:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> Robyt3 is too professional to be a weeb
00:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> I never see him talk about his interests LOL
00:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is th most weeb probs
00:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> WHAT THE
00:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> WHY IS HEINRICH RED
00:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm red?
00:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I look green to me
00:12 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> he's red?
00:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1116852430789951538/Screenshot_20230609_181245_Discord.jpg
00:13 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> he's green to me
00:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> still green after reloading my disord client
00:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you need to reload?
00:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> im mobile, one sec
00:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> still red
00:14 <+bridge> <deen> Yes, it looks to be swapping extremely. That's weird, haven't seen it before
00:14 <+bridge> <deen> I'll try to reduce memory usage on it
00:14 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> Thanks!
00:15 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Could it be related to the emoji spam?
00:17 <+bridge> <deen> Something is totally broken on that server, I think bad disk
00:22 <+bridge> <deen> I rebooted the server and thinks look normal-ish again. Tell me if the problem returns
00:22 <+bridge> <unlucksmcgee> Will do, thanks
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> void fn() {
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   static int wtf;
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   auto fn2= []{
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>     // do stuff with wtf
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   };
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> }
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> 
02:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> same as

02:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> this marks hour 30
02:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> :bluekitty:
02:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes heinrich red on iOS very conflicting and horrifying
02:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> may be a sign of Armageddon
06:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For me too. Confusing af xd
07:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He needs to use his github pfp now xd
07:41 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> He still is green for me. Well, I use irc (compact) mode but when I click to see his icon it's green 😉
07:42 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's maybe because he got a username without a tag?
07:44 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe it's*

11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah its only on phone
11:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> weird
11:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so maybe it'll be fixed in an update
11:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u choose green as color? i cant remember how its handled in discord xd
11:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I didn't choose green
11:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I like the green
12:24 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> Red to me as well

17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have no bugs
17:39 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> so instead of helping him to fix bugs you made. you just say there're no bugs
17:39 <+bridge> <Asacura> I don't understand how to make such textures

17:40 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> PAGE UP
17:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> see no bugs
17:41 <+bridge> <Asacura> press the page up key and that's it?
17:41 <+bridge> <Asacura> I don't understand how to put such textures
17:42 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> have a nice time explainign something to him
17:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don't understand how to put such textures
17:44 <+bridge> <Asacura> ALL GOOD thanks
17:44 <+bridge> <Asacura> thanks
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, now u can select the other textures

17:55 <+ChillerDragon> english certified moment
17:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> i wonder how much will change when we go to cpp20
17:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> code will be ugly non C ish
17:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gaminger endusers wont notice anything
18:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> nothing will change
18:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> so it wont even run a tiny bit faster?
18:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> better wait for c++23 :santatrollet:
18:09 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet code currently is mix of c c++11 c++17 xd
18:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and theres nothing about performance boost from new standards
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> c++98 but 2098
18:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 98% cpu load :troll:
18:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet is a mix of c, c++98, and a bit newer cpp 😂
18:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its just "better abstractions" mostly
18:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> are concepts usable?
18:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah a new standard doesnt magically give perf
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in fact if u want more perf u go to old c
18:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> also still can't make constexpr kv map without macros
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or rust
18:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> unique ptr is not zero cost
18:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> ddnet rust when ryoz
18:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> box in rust is
18:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> option too
18:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> ddnet rust when ryoz
18:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> unique ptr is not zero cost?
18:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> lulz
18:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
18:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> look this chat history
18:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich told it
18:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> idk whar that means but it sounds like propaganda
18:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> heinrich said so it's the absolute truth
18:14 <+bridge> <gerdoe> it sounds like std lib is kinda bruh fr fr
18:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> learath too
18:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i say it too
18:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but the truth comes from godboly
18:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> godbolt
18:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> i love my cpu
18:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> so fast
18:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the outputted assembly
18:15 <+bridge> <gerdoe> do you have link to first message about unique ptrs?
18:15 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i don't argue about it just wanna read conversation
18:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ok gonna lurk so+habr to learn more xd
18:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> oh so moving unique ptr costs some empty state object if its not return valur
18:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> value
18:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It depends on compiler anyway
18:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Like always
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> newer coding tech usually just uses abstractions into tricking you to write nice looking code that is slow af
18:30 <+bridge> <gerdoe> still don't get what "i know cpp" means xd
18:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yes it’s a trick purely to deceive devs
18:30 <+bridge> <gerdoe> theres so many unknown cases in it for me at least
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean is not using zero abstraction an "unknown" case for you?
18:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in an absolute hot path it might have an effect on perf, else it might not matter anyway
19:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/5230992782/jobs/9444868823?pr=6727>
19:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> i assume it thinks the line is too long and clang-format will make it thinner
19:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> but `clang-format --style=file -i ./src/game/client/file_loader.h` doesn't fix
19:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/5230992782/jobs/9444868823?pr=6727>
19:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i assume it thinks the line is too long and it wants it to abide by the MaxColumns or whatever, but there's none set in the .clang-format
19:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> but `clang-format --style=file ./src/game/client/file_loader.h` doesn't have anything different
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> why run clang manually
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> ``./scripts/fix_style.py`` ftw
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> which version is your clang-format in?
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> @Ewan
20:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> i dont have the ci scripts lol
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> if u have ddnet repo
20:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> o they are just there
20:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didnt notice
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> u have fix_style.py
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> this u best frint
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> it also version checks you
20:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> clang-format version 16.0.4
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> buy clang format 10
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> which distro u on?
20:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> its in aur
20:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> why i want different version of clang-format
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> you want the one the ci uses
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> then you can run ``./scripts/fix_style.py`` and ci wont fail
20:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> ci should use new clang format
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> pr
20:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> bleh
20:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> i've satisfied the beast for now anyways
20:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> brute force

20:25 <+ChillerDragon> oh no
20:25 <+ChillerDragon> just run fix style locally
20:25 <+ChillerDragon> i really recommend getting that to work locally
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> msys user repository when
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> uff windows 
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> rly
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i like the windows
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> ok bye
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> updates don't break my audio
20:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> it just works
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> which aur pkg
21:40 <+bridge> <WarNer> How do you do that?
21:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> is just a python script
21:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didnt actually look at the workflow i thought it was doing other stuff lol
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mine either
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and u dont have pipewire in windows
21:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> why would i want pipewire
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117177287633272963/qpwgraph_screenshot-1.png
21:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> advanced audio setup
21:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> looks like jack to me
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> pipewire can indeed replace jack too

21:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> o
21:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> that one's better
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats the thing with linux
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can decide
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> TOPKEK OMG OWNED
21:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'd wait for a kxstudio app
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye i woke up ccringe today
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh nvm that's the qjackctl guy
21:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> neat
21:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> anyway windows audio has always been low-latency for me and i've never once had an issue with it breaking or high cpu/memory usage
22:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> me neither on linux
22:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linux has real time kernels
22:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> hmm
22:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just dont waste any more of your precious time and install linux
22:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> come to the master race
22:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> when has my time been wasted by windows
22:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> it’s not a thing
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> come to the bright side:
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109446078509621318/1109773006835810354/Jupeyy_Keks_darth_vader_playing_violine_in_the_background_there_fdfb9eef-54e8-4d88-b471-1f3597a1fdc5.png
22:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> ❓
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does this guy look evil to u
22:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yea
22:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linux is faster
22:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so windows wastes ur time
22:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even slowbuntu is faster than windows
22:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt that convincing enough
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u think i never used linux
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently yes
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u never used it
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> i used a lot of linux
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just like the windows for desktop
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz i can run all things and things work
22:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but they work worse
22:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> howzat
22:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they slower, stupid design choices
22:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what does not suck about windows
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> api
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> winxp compatible 😂
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the win32 api does not suck?
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> it does not
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in what world do you live 😂
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> this one idk
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> windows is hybrid kernel
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> so it doesn't work with your conventions
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> so what
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can call all windows api under linux too
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so chill
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> ❓
22:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ❗
22:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/928853077593849900/1098329994545082508/F12A3953-F102-4088-BEB1-F68E57F88ECD.gif
22:26 <+bridge> <reitw> wsl
22:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its a slow linux
22:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sucks
22:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
22:26 <+bridge> <reitw> It is not meant to be fast
22:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well its better than windows, but that's also a paradox in itself
22:27 <+bridge> <reitw> Also i'm waiting for that git integration in windows
22:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> what
22:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> os level git integration?
22:28 <+bridge> <reitw> https://youtu.be/bC-60KNgLuE
22:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah
22:30 <+bridge> <reitw> Sure windows is proprietary etc.. but they have good ideas
22:30 <+bridge> <reitw> They just need to make it work properly lmaoo
22:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> no cuz windows isn't the fastest that means it's objectively worse for every purpose and shouldn't be used
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like making your screen go black when u switch to a fullscreen app?
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> great idea
22:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> u cannot even take conversation seriously
22:31 <+bridge> <reitw> Also u didn't mention which version of windows but for eg as a sysadmin I can say active directory is a major feature
22:32 <+bridge> <reitw> So much easier
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> always locking files, also absolutely great idea 😂
22:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fact that u have to close your debugger before building again
22:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> it is a good idea
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt that a reason enough
22:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
22:33 <+bridge> <gerdoe> have anyone worked with rust abi as rust app?
22:34 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like a plugin system where shared libraries are plugins
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not with binaries directly but i did test around with wasm, which apparently is "only" 1.3x slower than native
22:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh i can use rhai or something
22:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> just wanna know is it possible to do stable app with dylib plugins
22:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> got this to read
22:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://zicklag.github.io/rust-tutorials/rust-plugins.html
22:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> dlopen
22:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wot

22:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the world would be a better place  if linux api was the only
22:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> what linux api
22:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmao
22:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but seems there's problem with stablenedd of rust abi
22:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also windows naming is ridiculous
22:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> stableness*
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX
22:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
22:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> u called it linux api
22:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i mean if linux implements posix
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u probably have to use c as an API then
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its kinda the linux api
22:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh fair
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust abi is not stable
22:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fair and simple
22:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use repr c
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if linux implements POSIX as a way to interface it
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it is the linux api by definition
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont see how the logic is flawed
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt exclude posix being the interface api for other  systems
22:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> u cannot call posix the linux api just because linux implements it
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why not?
22:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> because it's not just the linux api
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the linux api is POSIX
22:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> where is the statement false
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> the linux api implements posix
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> they are different entities
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> posix is the standard
22:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> me calling posix the linux api doesnt make it not be other os api
22:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and this convo is stupid
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but would u say posix is a interface?
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> are we speaking in oop
22:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> because that's a whole different wheel house
22:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we dont speak oop
22:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> object oriented is evil
22:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sucks
22:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the rust way is better
22:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> composition over inheritance
22:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😴
22:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its the hard truth
22:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> no
22:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it indeed is
22:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> not that hard
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pure functional programming
22:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> haskell supremacy 🙏
22:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i need a tshirt
22:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> with composition over inheritance
22:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> written in it
22:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lambda calculus
22:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the most simple programming language possible
22:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> why can't windows and linux enjoyers exist in harmony
22:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ur propietary
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u want enjoy windows
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/stallman-meme-extreme-gif-15311412
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> join the cult
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> i enjoy both
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and thats not even possible
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linux isnt perfect
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but always better than win
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Ewan Green u will never  find harmony in this chat
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that simple
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar  loves non licenses
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i love agpl
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u love windows
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i love linux
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> chiller likes gnome
22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we dont like gnome
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> obligatory rms free software song
22:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJUDx7iEJw
22:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is a singer
22:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> indeed
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like java
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryo likes rust
22:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> GNUsic
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
22:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I25UeVXrEHQ
22:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd typical reaction of anti stallmaners
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ewan Green can we agree that java sucks?
22:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> i like stallman
22:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> he's just weird
22:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> go for the personality instead of the arguments
22:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes java sux
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good start
22:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> join us now and share the software
