09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> might be cool info
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: You should have asked about btc donations 30 minutes earlier
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just bought some more btc to pay for Persian server ðŸ˜„
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¥²
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> oh lol deen
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> oh should now im ur btc dude
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> just activate btc donations again and let the idle in the wallet
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That would be potentially throwing away donations, so definitely not
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You don't speculate/gamble with donations
10:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <anon_seren1ty> o/
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> time to uninstall arch this os ships with gui irc clien o.O https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1611048287.png
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hi anon_seren1ty
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> its me :)
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> ChillerDragon your server was on high bandwidth only for a few days, maybe weeks... imo it improves the prediction for other players with antiping. The description with LAN-only was maybe valid when teeworlds was first released, but today most connections can handle 50 snaps per second. There are games with more than 100 snaps per second :D
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> did u recommend it?
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> and why do you know my server better than me? o.O
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Not sure. Could also have been AMN
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Well it felt worse again at some point and the stats said 25 packets per second ðŸ˜…
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> It's not really an issue without antiping thought
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to have an exam right about now, but someone hacked into most of the uni network and took it down :P
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> lol
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> exciting
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He keeps taking it down when the prof gets about a quarter of a way down the roll call lol
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> XD
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> meh i had my editor crash 2 times on a map and since so i decided to debug it today and now i cant reproduce 
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> aaaaaaa

14:32 <+ChillerDragon> ur tool told me to fix it and then my client crashed
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its my custom client idk so hard to catch it w debugger
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> u mean debug_load ?
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> 0 errors
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm now the 1 sound error
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its rls mode only bug idk i give up and just fix the map
