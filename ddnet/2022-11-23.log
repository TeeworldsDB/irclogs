00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hello. Can someone please help me with pos calculations?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I can't calc even the simple Y distance.
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I use this input:
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> V = 13.2 (default GroundJumpImpulse, assigned once (`m_Vel.y = -pTuningParams->m_GroundJumpImpulse;`))
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> A = 0.5 * 50 (default Gravity multiplied by ticks per second). `CCharacterCore::Tick() { m_Vel.y += pTuningParams->m_Gravity; }`
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> T = V / A = 0.528 sec until the highest point. This is similar to what is observed.
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> S = V * T + A * T * T /2 = 13.2 * 0.528 + 25 * 0.528 * 0.528 / 2 = 3.4848.
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Visually the ground jump is about 5.5 tiles / 180 units in height.
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> `S = 3.4848`; something like S * 50 = 174.24 would be approximately equal to the observed jump height. Is this correct? If yet then why we need the final `*50`?

00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I've measured a ground jump. Seems to be `5.69 tiles = 182.08 units`.
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I could tell by all the snow üòâ
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 50 ticks per second?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> your unit for time seems to be seconds, the game uses ticks?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds about right
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> You think it changes something?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> V = 13.2 (the default GroundJumpImpulse, assigned once (m_Vel.y = -pTuningParams->m_GroundJumpImpulse;))
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> A = 0.5  (the default Gravity )
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> T = V / A = 26.4 ticks
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> S = V * T + A * T * T /2 = 13.2 * 26.4 + (-0.5 * 26.4 * 26.4) = 174.24 units

01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Oh. Hm. You mean that this is the right result. ü§î
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that your calculation assumes continuous time
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but ddnet uses discrete ticks
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It is slightly different from what is registered in game but hmm.
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you'll be slightly off
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Thanks, it seems to be the case.
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> ‚ô•Ô∏è
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds really cool üôÇ
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should do that üòÑ
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im trying to LOL

01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you heard about branches? üòõ
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://xkcd.com/1597/
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> each folder has its updates linked to each branch in my fork
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> at least i think thats how you do it
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> each folder has its updates linked to each branch in my fork (minus mat_slime_
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> each folder has its updates linked to each branch in my fork (minus mat_slime)
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably fine üôÇ
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only have one ddnet repository on my computer
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Wait, so how do you manage multiple PRs at once?
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :justatest:
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Multiple branches?
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ui-sounds is mostly just an experimental one
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1044776468816859186/image.png
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can switch between branches in your local repository
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git switch <branch>`
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ohhh... Wouldn't you need to push your updates before switching?
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to push them, yes
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git push origin branch
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> visual studio has it all in gui form which is nice imo
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> iirc you have to push your changes and then you can checkout to another branch
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't have to push your changes
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only if you want them pushed ^^
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also push them after switching branches
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> it tells me that i will lose my changes if i dont push and checkout
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm so glad I have people who actually know how to use Git LOL
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm so glad I have people in contact who actually know how to use Git LOL
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm? are you talking about git commits?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> You can use stashes
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Changes will be stored locally and could be restored later
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah i think
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Also i find github desktop quite good git client, it gives all basic functional with gui
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> git is also very confusing to work with
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> for example if i want to work on two projects
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> one on github and one gitlab
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i have to change my user settings
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I think you can store creds for each repo
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Or use git clients who does it ü•∏
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think you have to do that. can you give an example?
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i really cant because half the time i dont know what im doing
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> thanks
04:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Quick question: How do you test other's pull requests?
04:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Do I Click this checkout button

04:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Maybe, in theory you just clone their branch
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye checkout
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And u dont need multiple folders
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Branches are ur friend
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It will also dramatically reduce ur disk space
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I suggest u learn proper git xd
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but thats hard :(
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet-9999 is now on gentoo guru https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/tree/games-action/ddnet
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im a maintainer <a:nekospin:1039804721378111548>
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yay, thanks!
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Also, about using Rust for website. I also had the plan to switch the website from python to a compiled language a long time ago, but mostly to save RAM back then. My quick poc showed that ram usage was about the same, so I stopped
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you have to git add remote the remote, git fetch it and then check out their branch.
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can also add a special remote to get access to all PRs directly
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> however, i don't remember the remote from GitHub
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's `pull/<id>/head`
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you add sth like `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*`
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh thats pog
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just use the gh cli tool
09:58 <+Ryozuki> h pr checkout 123
09:58 <+Ryozuki> gh pr checkout 123
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah there is one nowadays isn't there
09:58 <+Ryozuki> yeah
09:58 <+Ryozuki> you can also comment on and see issues irc
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> yea you can i used that to spam ddnet repo with my bot axaxax
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait no i was creating issues but commenty prolly too
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1669194845.png
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> seems pretty complete to me!
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> is there some docs on ddnet snapshot extensions?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, you spammed my git with a fucking huge PR that was a missclick from you üòÑ
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> hehe
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `git fetch upstream pull/6060/head:demo-skipping` then `git switch demo-skipping`. You only need to add the remote `upstream` then. You can choose whatever (unused) name you want for the local branch.
10:36 <+ChillerDragon> do the ddnet ext snap items send their size or is it pre-agreed?
10:38 <+Ryozuki> real    0m19.561s
10:38 <+Ryozuki> user    4m5.067s
10:38 <+Ryozuki> sys     0m14.590s
10:39 <+Ryozuki> i can compile ddnet in under 20s
10:39 <+Ryozuki> with rust included
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It uses gcc,clang should be even faster
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (release)
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> ok the way i understood ddnet snap items is: it sends type 0 with a high id and a 4 byte payload (maybe its uuid?) then the client is supposed to register those ids as types. Then the server sends those types followed by the id and then the length and then the payload. 
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> does this make sense?
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> 4 int payload* so 16 byte
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> @wiki_maintainer add this quote ^ to dev wiki and give me nobel price thanks
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> spec?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> even on a 20 cores machine, took me around a minute i think
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1 minute sounds like lto or the initial cargo update
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> omg poggers i managed to parse ddnet snap without any errors?!

15:13 <+Ryozuki> if you needed some kind of content delivery network, e.g your users upload files and allow them to be downloaded by others, do you know a good service thats not too costly?
15:14 <+Ryozuki> tldr a storage hosting or smth
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord, it‚Äôs against TOS, but all the cool scammers do it
15:15 <+Ryozuki> oh true
15:15 <+Ryozuki> and something more legal?
15:15 <+Ryozuki> imagine i want to make some profit, i cant use discord

15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Do you want to host it yourself? -> ownCloud
15:15 <+Ryozuki> not rly
15:15 <+Ryozuki> i want a file storage service that e.g a web app can use to deliver files to users
15:16 <+Ryozuki> hetzner storage is quite costly
15:16 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used bunny cdn for a small thing once, they have pay as you go

15:23 <+Ryozuki> according to calculator
15:24 <+Ryozuki> doesnt sound too bad
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is traffic free? Also technically a cdn will multihome your data so it can be accessed at similar speeds everywhere. Why bother hosting the data separately otherwise?
15:27 <+Ryozuki> yeah
15:27 <+Ryozuki> idk im rly ootl hee
15:27 <+Ryozuki> here
15:27 <+Ryozuki> thats why im asking
15:27 <+Ryozuki> bunny cdn or bunny storage?
15:28 <+Ryozuki> note that the things i want to store range on the 20mb to 100mb side maybe
15:31 <+Ryozuki> the bunny web looks nice
15:32 <+Ryozuki> https://bunny.net/solutions/software-distribution/
15:32 <+Ryozuki> this looks the closest to my needs
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally found what is causing my desktop to freeze up while building stuff. It's disk encryption. I for some reason seem to have used aes-cbc instead of aes-xts for my /home
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My cpu can do 2 gig/s of aes-xts but only 700 mb/s of cbc
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hm, I've also did something like that for Infclass mod. It would be amazing to have something for improved killfeed in DDNet (I thought you're not interested in violence game types).
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The new mod-specific icons barely could interest you, but maybe you'll consider killer assistant? That one is easy to do, and it would greatly improve the players UX.
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Killer assistant is the player who somehow helped to kill the target. E.g. on FNG the killer can be the one who lasered the target, and the assistant is the one who throwed it to the spikes. Or vice versa.

17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hm, I've also did something like that for Infclass mod. It would be amazing to have something for improved killfeed in DDNet (I thought you're not interested in violence game types).
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The new mod-specific icons barely could interest you, but maybe you'll consider killer assistant? That one is easy to do, and it would greatly improve the players UX.
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Killer assistant is the player who somehow helped to kill the target. E.g. on FNG the killer can be the one who lasered the target, and the assistant is the one who throwed it to the spikes. Or vice versa.

17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> This is some good stuff
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Here is the code for that (killer assistant): https://github.com/infclass/infclass-client/commit/a844c27b13c34625b88720b0f9a30166557f6b9f
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It is added after the mod-specific damage icons so it won't apply clearly to the current DDNet but I would be glad to add the assistant support to DDNet and then rebase my code.
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I think I can add some `NetMessageEx("kill@netmsg.ddnet.tw")` in this weekend but it won't make much sense without a discussion on what is wanted by mods and what is acceptable for DDNet.

19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi, im modding vanilla teeworlds 0.6 and am wondering the best way to modify / access the team score from character.cpp
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m_aTeamscore is defined in gamecontroller
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what problem do you need to solve that the character needs to know the score
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the chars have access to GameServer(), so u probably can ask the gamecontroller too
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> add a virtual getter in IGameController and override it where u need it
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea i think the way i was doing it was kinda messy
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think i need to loop over all the players and call a function from their character to do what i want
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> GameController is the place for the mod-specific stuff.
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> You still need to do what was said but I'd suggest to see it from a different point of view: add an *event* handler to the game controller and then in the character *inform* the controller about the event.
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> E.g. if you want to increase the team score on a character hit another character with a hammer while in the air, I'd suggest to add `IGameController::onCharacterHitCharacter(CCharacter *pCharacter, CCharacter *pTarget, WEAPON Weapon)` and call it from `CCharacter::TakeDamage()`.
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Then in the game controller you can do something like `if((Weapon == WEAPON_HAMMER) && !pCharacter->IsGrounded()) { m_aTeamscore[pCharacter->GetPlayer()->GetTeam()] += 5; }`
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> This way your gameplay logic 'll be incapsulated in the Mod Controller and you won't have to break into the Controller (which should define the mod rules) from a character (which should just follow the world physics).
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Also, you'd better base on DDNet than on anything else. I'd say that even a DM server should just base on DDNet nowadays (although you'll have to re-add some code for that).
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah alright, thank you üëç

20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly ddnet ripped quite a lot of vanilla out over the years, I'm not sure if it's an easy exercise to add things back in

21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> bam
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> yo guys
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> imagine, ddnet exists from 2013, AND
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> we have 999 languages in client
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> but we recieve server messages(yellow) only in english
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> isnt that funny?
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> just random kid downloads game, goes ddrace, and doesnt understand shit lmao
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> may be we should make autotranslate server msg?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Oh, that is awesome. This is what I would do if I had the time.
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> In a better world we could have DDNet being a mod based on such skeleton. Of course I see how this idea is a "waste of time" for ddnet devs, so I won't even try to reason you.
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Thanks for the link, maybe we'll have such a 'base for all mods' in 2035 or 2045.
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet made me learn better english
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which helped a lot ngl
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hm, closer to the topic: various mods have server-side translations. Would DDNet accept a NetMessageEx with various client preferences for the sake of better UX?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It won't immediately benefit to DDNet though.
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> As a mod dev I'd love to get the client preferred language and the enabled skin options (whether 'vanilla only skins' checked, etc). Probably this would be useful for other mods too, and the preferred language 'll be needed for DDNet servers as well, eventually.
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> > maybe we'll have such a 'base for all mods' in 2035 or 2045.

22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :monkalaugh:
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bro predicts the future
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> wtf
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> In 2035 or 2045 will be smth like DDProRaceMaxUltimateAdvancedReloadedFinal 5
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Still no accounts and all maps moved to legacy, old legacy, very old legacy categories :greenthing:
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> All new maps will be genrated with RyoAI written in rust
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> And someone would still play ddmax
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like sending preferred language to the server, I think we should have better localization options instead. vanilla skins only. hmm, what would you like to do with that?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like that. I think we should add kill assists, and maybe we can also add some infclass weapons üôÇ
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> >  E.g. on FNG the killer can be the one who lasered the target, and the assistant is the one who throwed it to the spikes. Or vice versa.
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wonder which way would make more sense
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nobybot
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> second guy the killer
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> like csgo
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah thats what i thought
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> first giy killer
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz he shot him
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ajd shooting is harder
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no it isnt
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> killing takes longer and requires u to be closer
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> like
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> shooter + killer (gun) target
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea but killing is rly easy
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought it was more like
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which behavior do u less want to reward
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ppl who steal kills on purpose, or ppl who shoot and dont kill on purpose
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the guy who shot should get the assist
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sicne they already got an entry in the kill board for the shot
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also wonder how this would affect the client side statboard since afaik it calculates its stats from the killfeed
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> shooting is point n click
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> killing is more risky
