23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yo, I want to have the vanilla shotgun in my mod, without not having the ddrace bullet tiles. how can i do that? i tried so hard, but couldnt get anywhere. also tried to use a Stable projectile (which is not moving at all) and modify that so it moves, but also that didnt work out very well. (im trying to add the ddrace gun, as the curve stuff from vanilla is harder to make than a <message clipped>
