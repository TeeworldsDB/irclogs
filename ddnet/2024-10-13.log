11:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to make such structs in rust?
11:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to be precise how to do this part `Macro macros[];`

13:44 < bridge> <learath2> You don't need to be holding the lock to notify. But you do need to modify the condition itself under lock
13:44 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. the state needs to change under lock

14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `android:supportsRtl="true"` biggest lie in ddnet code üòÇ
14:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Technically true since we don't have any Android-native layout code
14:48 < bridge> <robyt3> > Declares whether your application is willing to support right-to-left (RTL) layouts.
14:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Also this doesn't say anything about the actual effort that we take, just that we are willing üòÑ
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't understand why landscape is working properly in cpp version for the vk backend, but not in my app.
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What black magic do we use.
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I always get a surface suboptimal, bcs the orientation is 90¬∞ rotated (probably bcs teh default mode is not landscape)
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> We pay google extra
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe I should just debug cpp version if that claim is even true
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When latest NDK support @robyt3 xd
14:51 < bridge> <robyt3> How outdated are we? I think I had build problems with some newer versions :pepeW:
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah, can i force the NDK toolkit to use?
14:52 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean if you have multiple installed?
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `mold: fatal: ddnet_engine_shared-cd5af9afb6c5385a.1x1mslembt45wzvj8781d2swp.rcgu.o: incompatible file type: arm64 is expected but got x86_64`
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is the err in newer NDK versions, so weird
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have yes
14:55 < bridge> <robyt3> And it works when you use mold with older NDK? Or does it maybe use a different linker with newer NDKs?
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as far as i remembered it worked in ndk 26
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's compiling
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> *elevator music*
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok no
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it does not üòÆ
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah wait
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was about rust stable
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vs nightly, right
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `mold: error: undefined symbol: __sendto_chk`
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> man ndk 26 used to work

14:58 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
14:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like the build script currently uses the folder based on the sorting the filenames, so you can't easily use an older NDK
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah i remember that code
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway, can't compile anyway, bcs this
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if i need to recompile the libs again
15:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you make sure to clean the build directory after changing NDK?
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it doesn't change it otherwise üòÑ
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok recompiling android libs fixed it:

15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just way too hard to compile for android
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> openjdk-21-jdk ist schon die neueste Version (21.0.5~8ea-1).
15:05 < bridge> <robyt3> You should only have JDK 21 I guess. But the warnings can be ignored: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77799747
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah it's  only a warning i see
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> confused me that they put it under the error

15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, I also get them though I only have JDK 21
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok nice
15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you pass a package name by argument?
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> works now i think
15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> You passed `DDNet` when you should have passed `org.ddnet.client` I guess
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```

15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it trolls now
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok delete & recompile it is
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you delete the java files from the build folder?
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> If you used a different package name before you'd still have the old files there
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah interesting
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc worked
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok the vk backend actually gets the same orientation here too.
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Really weird that it works here
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are touch controls a release mode thing?
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me there were not on by default
15:12 < bridge> <robyt3> They should be enabled by default if you compiling for Android
15:12 < bridge> <robyt3> They should be enabled by default if you are compiling for Android
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh weird
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it deleted the old app, so this isnt some old config
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also got the welcome screen
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i reinstall
15:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Weird. Do you have other Android specific functions? E.g. when you minimize the app it should save the config
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> still not there lol
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i had a clean config
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it must be on or not?
15:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you check in the console?
15:14 < bridge> <robyt3> If the config failed to load you'd also see no touch controls, but you should see the extra line of buttons in the ingame menu (and a warning)
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but there are not there either
15:16 < bridge> <robyt3> To confirm, did you actually check our the PR? It's not merged yet
15:16 < bridge> <robyt3> To confirm, did you actually check out the PR? It's not merged yet
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh lol true xD
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i probably switched the branches in the meantime
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok ok I found all variables in my puzzle
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We actually ignore `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR` in `vkQueuePresentKHR` and only handle it in `vkAcquireNextImageKHR`
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Funny that android reports that in one function but not the other
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well only wasted 6 hours of my life to obtain this information

16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use scrcpy

17:43 < bridge> <learath2> Oh nvm, it's actually a broken query
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how that happened

17:46 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, that is it, you made the `LIMIT` a `?` but didn't add an argument to bind to it
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> and it was broken in every iteration, of force push you made, I don't get how this even worked in your local testing
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> actually nvm, it does look bound, hm maybe something chiller did

18:06 < bridge> <learath2>             FROM       record_teamrace AS tr
18:06 < bridge> <learath2>             INNER JOIN record_race     AS rr

18:07 < bridge> <learath2>             AND        tr.time = rr.time
18:07 < bridge> <learath2>             AND        tr.timestamp = rr.timestamp )

18:07 < bridge> <learath2>     ORDER BY ranking ASC
18:07 < bridge> <learath2>     LIMIT    0, 5) AS l2
18:07 < bridge> <kebscs> It 100% worked when i tested it
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> This is what the query looks like, I extracted it with gdb and filled in the ? by hand, it doesn't run
18:07 < bridge> <kebscs> Dont think it broke when resolving merge condlict
18:07 < bridge> <kebscs> And it passed unit test
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mb the db server is simply outdated and doesnt understand some syntax
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> ```sql
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> SELECT Rank() over w AS ranking, count(*) AS teamsize, id, server
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> FROM (
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   SELECT     *
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   FROM       record_teamrace AS tr
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   INNER JOIN record_race     AS rr
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   ON         tr.map = rr.map
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   AND        tr.name = rr.name
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   AND        tr.time = rr.time
18:10 < bridge> <learath2>   AND        tr.timestamp = rr.timestamp
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> )
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> WHERE map = 'Multeasymap'
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> GROUP BY id window w AS (ORDER BY min(time))
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> This subquery is already wrong somehow
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well map already sound ambiguous
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh i dont how it should work at all
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> I already tried `tr.map` just in case
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but select *
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that allowed for inner joins?
18:13 < bridge> <learath2> it must be fine because @kebscs says it runs fine locally
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well I can only say that the FROM () IMO needs a name
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like `as b`
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then  b.map = '...'
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is what i'd intuitively do
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But tbh the SQL syntax always allows 30000 variants to work as well
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So I can't say what the real err is xD
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> yes, giving everything names fixed it
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> ```sql
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> SELECT Rank() over w AS ranking, count(*) AS teamsize, id, server
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> FROM (
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> SELECT tr.map as map, tr.time as time, tr.id as id, rr.server as server
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> FROM record_teamrace AS tr
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> INNER JOIN record_race     AS rr
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> ON tr.map = rr.map
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> AND tr.name = rr.name
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> AND tr.time = rr.time
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> AND tr.timestamp = rr.timestamp
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> ) AS kek
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> WHERE kek.map = 'Multeasymap'
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> GROUP BY id window w AS (ORDER BY min(time))
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> This query looks insanely expensive btw
18:19 < bridge> <kebscs> no other way to do it when teamrace doesnt hold server
18:19 < bridge> <kebscs> i took this query from website source
18:20 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, probably no other way to do it except adding server to teamrace, anyway, the db is a mess. The thing is this doesn't work and needs to be fixed
18:21 < bridge> <learath2> With names it works, including the more limited select on line 3. So I guess you can just commit that
18:21 < bridge> <kebscs> im guessing differnece between mysql and sqlite
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> AS kek
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is also easier to follow, even if more verbose üòÑ
18:22 < bridge> <kebscs> i tested sqlite only locally
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> MariaDB [teeworlds]> SELECT VERSION();
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> +-------------------------------+
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> | VERSION()                     |
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> +-------------------------------+
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> | 10.11.6-MariaDB-0+deb12u1-log |
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> +-------------------------------+
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> 1 row in set (0.000 sec)
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> or if you want to mess around with debugging it
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> Probably, sqlite is extremely loose
18:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> generally don't use select * in production code ._.
18:25 < bridge> <kebscs> didnt know theres a diff when there isnt many columns
18:25 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont work with dbs that much
18:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> is fine, happens, not the end of the world.
18:26 < bridge> <kebscs> good to know tho
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> insert or update is scarier üò¨
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> it's not an extremely important command either, so doesn't even need an emergency restart
18:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> no backups
18:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> no mercy
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> delete and update are the scariest, insert is still not the end of the world üòÑ
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true xd
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> during a lifetime everyone had that one delete from without where
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that still a thing
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> yep
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is that not allowed anymore
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually insane xD
20:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what's the endpoint to get player's info?
20:47 < bridge> <syrinok> Can we allow nameplates to go smaller? The lowest size looks like it should be the default :justatest:
20:47 < bridge> <syrinok> Really weird how massive they are
20:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> why not
20:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> if u want it so bad u can just fork it
20:48 < bridge> <syrinok> I mean for the ddnet client, not just editing my own client
20:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> alr
20:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> ig this is all the code that is used for the nameplate size
20:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1295096591866400778/image.png?ex=670d6831&is=670c16b1&hm=e94f291dd71c4558883e3c64dbd8c6d7ac976bdec93beabd2de91d26413ee509&
20:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> so if its 0 font size is 18
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 I kinda did little steps towards macros and here's so far what I've done. It's a macro written in C for my language called by Rust xD
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fn printf(format: *i8, _: *i8) -> void;
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fn main() -> u8 {
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let lol: *i8 = gimme_points!();
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     printf("Player's points: %s", lol);
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     return 0;
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Shared object file
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```c
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Data Points(Data data, size_t _) {
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     char buf[256];
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     FILE *file = fopen("~/personal/c_playground/file", "r");
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     fread(buf, sizeof(buf), 1, file);
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     int n = strlen((const char *)buf);
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     char *str = (char *)malloc(n);
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     memcpy(str, buf, n);
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     // Overwrite '\n'
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     str[n - 1] = '\0';
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     return str;
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Macros macros = {
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted to fetch player's points but cloudflare redirects to https :pepeW:
21:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted to fetch player's points from api but cloudflare redirects to https :pepeW:
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> Macros in different language is interesting üòÑ
21:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think i can compile it in my language actually xd
21:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i started prototyping in C so here we go
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> ```c
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> int n = fread(buf, sizeof buf, 1, file);
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> buf[n - 1] = '\0';
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> 
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> char *str = malloc(n * sizeof *str);
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> memcpy(str, buf, n);
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> 
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> return str;
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> ```
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> Don't cast malloc, don't strlen for no reason
21:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm sorry :feelsbadman:
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> memcpy(str, buf, n);
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û>     // Overwrite '\n'
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û>     str[n - 1] = '\0';
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> that's one way to handle null termination
21:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> memcpy(str, buf, n);
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û>     // Overwrite '\n'
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û>     str[n - 1] = '\0';
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> that's one way to handle null termination
23:00 < bridge> <louis> big agree
23:16 < bridge> <chairn> who made the catch mod (not zcatch) ?
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> $wiki catch
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh no wiki :c
23:19 < bridge> <chairn> malwarebytes flagged 3 files in a zip i had of the mod
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is it this?
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4810
23:20 < bridge> <chairn> one of them is making a connection to 77.224.14.* which is located in spain
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> looks like yes
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> you "catch" tees and the goal is to catch all tees
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> it's like zcatch but solo
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> i think there was a team mode as well
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "I dont copy anything from other mods exspecialy not catching16, only help from Redix."
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I still have a catch16 src code somewhere
23:25 < bridge> <chairn> more like this one actually
23:25 < bridge> <chairn> https://github.com/AssassinTee/catch64
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah neat üòÑ
