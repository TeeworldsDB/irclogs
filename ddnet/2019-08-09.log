14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the windows build itself is slow ^^
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we can try ðŸ˜‰
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 perhaps this could be done on the fly, when rendering?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, I'm not really sure if thats efficient
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Opengl prerenders the overlays on map load iirc
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª feel free to correct me on that tho
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 also i'm not sure if setting the index 0 only affects rendering
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm. so the flags in the snapshots are probably the wrong location
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I wonder if this affects all other entities flags aswell
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it prerenders the text for the overlays, and it builds the whole map on OnMapLoad as a buffer
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 it doesnt.
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The entities flags can even be changed ingame, so we can swap between different entitie files ingame
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yea, if that flag were to move, the other entities stuff should probably too
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 the other stuff works fine.
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they logically group with the "dont mask entities", I think

15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In this video you can see that I have changed the entities in real time, I checked if the weapon is not gun and then set the entities to FNG
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We just need to update the indices when we receive the dont mask entities flag or not
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> updating the indices on the fly sounds stateful, not easy to undo
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only way I can imagine doing that would be in the rendering itself, where it wouldn't change state
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, cant we just save the invalid front and game layer tiles in a vector ||(https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/609092005250859215)|| and render tile 0 for them if the flag doesnt get sent? otherwise render them normally?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Let me try something
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nvm
