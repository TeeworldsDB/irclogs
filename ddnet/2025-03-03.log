00:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: ur chiller client on 19.0 seems to not work with 128 tees
00:12 < bridge> <Assa> please be gentle with the stones thrown at me!
00:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> same for cactus 19000 i think
00:13 < bridge> <Assa> is there any reason I should trust the cactus client?
00:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and tater i think
00:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they all mess up versioning :(
00:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut how do i reproduce?
00:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa cactus is closed source there are open source clients with similar features so no need to trust it
00:43 < bridge> <Assa> there are some great children books about it
00:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> closed source ddnet clients are not valid clients in my eyes
00:51 < bridge> <Assa> clang-tidy is on drugs reproduced: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/13620242565/job/38068614829?pr=9795
00:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u need the magic comment i sent u
01:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tater no panic merging into ddnet should fix all issues, at least it did for me

09:37 < bridge> <matodor> dark theme got boring a few years ago
10:24 < bridge> <d1nnnn> Does the API have limits?
10:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> what do I even answer to this
10:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Does any API have limits? Probably the answer would be "yes"
10:31 < bridge> <d1nnnn> You're right, I meant what are limits of the API?
11:07 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks I hope you didn't confuse the `TileIndex` Parameter of the `RenderTileLayerSpeedup` function and took an actual look at it. I am not rendering each tile individually, I am putting individual tiles of type `TileIndex` into the buffer
11:08 < bridge> <Assa> Maybe the name `TileIndex` is to unprecise
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am not confusing anything
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You create one draw call for every tile that matches
11:15 < bridge> <Assa> Thats why I am asking. What does every tile individually mean, I took that literally: tile by tile, of the map
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tile by tile of all currently visible tiles.. so if u have a speedup layer of 1000x1000 and zoom out
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's rip
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> Yes, this are currently 3 render calls instead of 1
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is currently 1 million render calls instead of 1000
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> ? no
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> what, explain how you get a 1000
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> `Graphics()->RenderTileLayer(Visuals.m_BufferContainerIndex, Color, s_vpIndexOffsets.data(), s_vDrawCounts.data(), DrawCount);`
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> In the normal implementation this gets called once, in the new one this gets called 3 times
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Create a new separate tile buffer for your new tile, similar to how overlays work
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the s_vDrawCounts
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the size of it is how many draw calls you have
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and you go over y and x
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> while the other impl only goes over y
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @essigautomat I strongly recommend to load ddnet into renderdoc
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And just see yourself, then you understand
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> easier than text
11:24 < bridge> <Assa> I guess I may have missunerstood the graphics render function
11:34 < bridge> <Assa> I see now, I add a draw call for ever x individually to the buffer. I could optimize it by counting conecutive tiles, but I'll look into a new seperate tile buffer
11:36 < bridge> <Assa> Thank you @jupeyy_keks ‚úÖ
12:31 < bridge> <kebscs> I guess this could send the already overriden zone
12:31 < bridge> <kebscs> I'll test it
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> I didn't touch the shaders, why does this happen üò¶

12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Look F1 console, maybe that tells more
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But kinda sounds like missing shader files tbh
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You gotta use the data dir from the build dir
12:47 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently having a windows moment, brb

14:05 < bridge> <Assa> is the fps counter broken? When I look at the graph with cntrl + shift + g, it shows ~ 2000 fps, the top right counter shows ~1000 fps, when the graph is opened in the ingame counter shows 500 fps, and when I tab out of the game, the ingame counter shows 120 and the graph shows 144 fps
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the graph uses a maximum and minimum to display a graph

18:26 < bridge> <Assa> @ryozuki do you have an idea what to do about [this](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/13633665853/job/38107024618?pr=9795) ? I know chillerdragon suggested a clang-tidy turn-off line, but I don't know if this is a joke or why this is only triggering there
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its because u edited that file or smth

19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> under certain conditions that clang-tidy evaluated and described
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> delete when u heap alloc
19:05 < bridge> <robyt3> It's a false positive, probably because we use our own memory pool, so'll need to add an exclusion: `for(int i = -ShotSpread; i <= ShotSpread; ++i) // NOLINT(clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc)`

21:06 < bridge> <kebscs> pr says "Some server code has to be updated accordingly." but the "fail safe" is in shared code and i think its compeletyl useless in server
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog
21:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa it was not a joke and it is common that this gets unlocked seemingly randomly when you change other code.
21:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @d1nnnn which api
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> yes thank you, I am just wondering that nobody else was running over this in other PRs
21:14 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently working on colored speedtiles and run into the issue, that I am skillchecked in setting up vulkan rendering buffers xD writing a shader was not an issue
22:30 < bridge> <kebscs> how can i scan all maps' server settings?
22:30 < bridge> <robyt3> `config_retrieve`
22:31 < bridge> <robyt3> (and a script to run it on all maps)
22:34 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i make a script that checks the server settings?
22:34 < bridge> <kebscs> or is there an existing one
22:37 < bridge> <Assa> use twmap or twmap-py, it has all the bindings you need
22:37 < bridge> <Assa> Can you program in python? I have a small bad notebook
22:37 < bridge> <kebscs> yea
22:38 < bridge> <kebscs> i just need to check if any map contains `tune_zone 0` setting because it doesnt work
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> I tried to use it in my map, but it doesn't work so I needed to patch it out
22:39 < bridge> <kebscs> yes, but it started working with <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9798> so idk if i should prevent it or is it fine
22:40 < bridge> <robyt3> It's just a small python/shell wrapper to list all maps files in the ddnet-maps folder and execute `config_retrieve` for each
22:40 < bridge> <robyt3> That would write the settings to `.cfg` files next to the maps
22:41 < bridge> <Assa> twmap can do this directly, but yes this would also work
22:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you could simply search the cfg files in folder recursively with a text editor
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i can do that
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> ty
22:44 < furo> @kebscs I checked, and no maps contain `tune_zone 0`
22:45 < bridge> <Assa> please also check for tune_zone_enter and tune_zone_leave
22:45 < bridge> <Assa> but I guess you won't have any results
22:46 < furo> Hm, actually. Behemoth contains `tune_zone_enter 0 "Map for 4+ tees, max 8 tees if in a team!"` and Simple World 3 has `tune_zone_leave 0 "Leaving beloved standards behind"`
22:47 < bridge> <Assa> maybe the other two commands actually work as expected
22:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Thanks,  so I guess I can fix it with that pr
22:48 < bridge> <kebscs> Just need to update prediction if it breaks it
