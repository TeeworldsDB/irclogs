00:05 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, hm are they really comparable? I guess a `Stream` is kinda close but it still lacks the ability to yield to a specific destination
00:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give a more concrete example? I can .await a future to yield to a specific destination? I guess I don't really know what coroutines are
00:18 < bridge> <learath2> Symmetric coroutines allow the callee to dictate where to yield to
00:26 < bridge> <learath2> I only know them in theory aswell, as I said not many languages have them and thus I never really think in terms of them so idk how useful a symmetric coroutine is
00:29 < bridge> <learath2> Instead of just `yield 5` you get something like `yield coro_b 5`

00:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you guys suck
00:59 < bridge> <learath2> he is still here, you just have a skill issue in hiliting people
01:19 < bridge> <Ewan> he is gone
01:19 < bridge> <Ewan> he rejoined
01:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i wouldnt say made him leave rather that he just chose a reason to which happened to be our typical rust trashtalk :BRUHH:

06:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> its currently possible to have teamranks on solo and run maps

12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki thanks for your contributions üòè
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just merged xd
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried looking at smth to do but im always without ideas
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how robyt finds alll these small things to do
12:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Add team lock indicator
12:29 < bridge> <bumm.> Change /tp back
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> (ideas that dont require me working over  a week)
12:30 < bridge> <bumm.> Or can you merge /tp with /tc
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> never heard of those commands ngl
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xDD
12:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Or possiblity to set password in custom browser protocol :santatrollet:
12:31 < bridge> <bumm.> Test ingame and you will find out
12:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> accounts? :poggers2:
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thanks for taking your time to merge some cpp code
12:35 < bridge> <furo321> People kept complaining, and I don't feel like arguing against them. Also a merge of the two is just `/tc`, so make your bind that instead?
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's your use case for it?
12:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ohohoh u cannot even imagine
12:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can even show u, wait
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And if he hasn't died yet, he still lives in these days
12:54 < bridge> <Ewan> these are ez
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt mean these, but they look like there is drama around it
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt mean these, meant in general, but they look like there is drama around it
12:59 < bridge> <Ewan> oic
12:59 < bridge> <Ewan> team lock indicator seems harmless
12:59 < bridge> <Ewan> afk indicator in browser info tab would be awesome btw
12:59 < bridge> <Ewan> and ez
12:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do it
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> arent u pro cpper xD
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> im joking maybe ill look into it
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i could do it
13:00 < bridge> <furo321> That's already a thing?
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but im not looking for quick ddnet features rn
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> where
13:01 < bridge> <furo321> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7406>
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> oh that‚Äôs what that means
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> really unintuitive imo
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> could just place an emoji somewhere
13:02 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> @mpft impletment kill tile being the same as /r in practice
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ask ryo
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> he wabts ddnet feature
13:02 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> thats really the biggest improvment that could be made imo
13:03 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> 2nd would be like a way to place checkpoints that u can tp to
13:03 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> at least wrt to practice mode
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> cant code rn too lit
13:03 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> hell yea
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> also 5 am
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i will forget
13:03 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> 6 for me
13:03 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> mountain time mfs
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> if robyt hasnt done it it means there are some drawbacks or things to take into consideration i think
13:03 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:04 < bridge> <Ewan> why is he doing it anyway
13:04 < bridge> <bumm.> Its already like that
13:04 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> yeah im not familiar w the documentation and codebase so
13:04 < bridge> <Ewan> he only engages in the community to respond to/talk about technical parts of the game
13:04 < bridge> <Ewan> is it for resume i guess
13:04 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> @bumm. i was playing in solo and it tp'd me to start
13:04 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> not to like my last position
13:04 < bridge> <Ewan> learn it it‚Äôs fun to mess around with
13:04 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> like /r
13:04 < bridge> <bumm.> Use /lasttp
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think he is based, he enjoys programming probs
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and he already got a job
13:04 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> ah
13:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> no drama
13:05 < bridge> <mbvxoxo> ill check that out when i wake up thx
13:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i want to enjoy programming
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm still waiting
13:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was googling regex
13:05 < bridge> <Ewan> but so many strings attached and rn it‚Äôs hard to just find something silly to knock ouf
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's the wrong way to implement it. instead, you should be put into some "dead" state until you either manually respawn or send /r
13:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:

13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i kinda got % to work but _ is always beginning of line for me
13:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> for example if u have few tabs before text, it goes to the very first char?
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use spaces
13:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> shoudnt matter
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah oh
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it goes to end of tabs
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isee
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would use shift+i for that tbh
13:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> URL syntax doesn't have a way of specifying a password without a username, unfortunately :/
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont think ill ever use % or _ xd
13:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a gg
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki ye integration tests are pain to debug and they also never work on my machine xd. Did you manage to fix your issues?
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat thanks for sharing vim trix anyways
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i didnt even tell you about `va{`

13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller add integration test to check solo settings work as intended
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u wanted little things to do
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just add a solo tile to coverage.map
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but that magic script is urs
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no need to script
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just edit the map
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> not solo tile
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a setting
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> for solo server
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> and race
13:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think @zwelf2's work might help with it
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> integration tests are so bloated already
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pipeline is so slow
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wonder if there is a way to unbloat it
13:19 < bridge> <stepfunn> So whats the issues with the team finishes on solo?
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe make it an external project ddnet-tests
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> client and server are not modular enough
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not thought with easy testing in mind
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I meant as a get parameter not the @ thing xd
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But that would be interesting too
13:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fixed here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7685
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> its already fixed, someone missed a return; on some iff statement
13:20 < bridge> <stepfunn> Ah damn
13:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sooo. try to fix it ^^
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats like asking to rework all
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> no? xd
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes
13:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it'd be worthwhile to brainstorm how the code could be properly tested
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> definitly
13:21 < bridge> <stepfunn> Just do it 4head
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> proper testing would avoid 99% of the regresions we have
13:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so go ahead and lead the effort :p
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> also it would allow us to refactor code without fear
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> fearless refactor
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> reminds me of smth
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's very hard if all components need pointers to all possible other objects.
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Only thing u could do is make it more functional
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and anything that takes user input would be put into a fuzzer
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> weewa
13:58 < bridge> <robyt3> I work on a large thing or look through the code randomly. Then I notice a small thing and write it down in a TODO list or fix it immediately.
14:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what are these doing ? i put some number in them to see what happens, but nothing happened
14:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>

14:33 < bridge> <bumm.> works, thank you
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is there some trick to write tests for private methods in a class?
14:42 < bridge> <kekomonter> Make method public and run test, or create public function for call private function xdd
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess i found my answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47354280/what-is-the-best-way-of-testing-private-methods-with-googletest
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> write better code to make tests work
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> write tests to allow refactoring code to better code safely
14:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> FRIEND_TEST works without, I think
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea its also mentioned there
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does not look too nice
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> would me spamming FRIEND_TEST be merged?
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is your objective?
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> test CConsole
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> arg parser for starters
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I actually already have a couple of tests for CConsole
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a cconsole test iirc
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in rust IIRC
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt find any
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> weird
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> serverbreowser.cpp tests
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> auto pConsole = CreateConsole(CFGFLAG_CLIENT);
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats not really testing the console is it
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk xd
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the rust tests do actually test the console
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which file?
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> src/engine/consolee.rs
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> src/engine/console.rs
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye fakin rust inline tests
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually the parsing ^^
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i expected stuff in a test/ folder
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust so powerful it has tests in docs
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the doc tests are not nice though
14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> super unperformant :/
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are the comments the tests?! xd
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> code in docs is tested
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u put no_run
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> to make sure ur examples rly work
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fancy
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shot
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> changing the comments breaks the test indeed
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> most obvious console test ever
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if irony
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not in a test file not in a test folder not annotated as test not in code but in a comment
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is discovering fire
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> irony yes
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie https://andrewkchan.dev/posts/fire.html
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> Simulating Fluids, Fire, and Smoke in Real-Time
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly good article
14:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am having a hard time reading these non syntax highlighted comment tests
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why aren't they syntax highlighted?
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which editor do you use?
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1187030916879622266/image.png?ex=659567b0&is=6582f2b0&hm=73ef3331db058b0e482383b7a56afcf43539ac45aad92f715341b229fc531419&
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> they arent for me either
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they're highlighted for me in all of vim, idea and rustrover
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1187031124875169812/image.png?ex=659567e2&is=6582f2e2&hm=95b2b6e9cef627390eabd673c3e2569277cfb0dda1bdfd5a6069031af37843e6&
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> vim?
14:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you use vim as well?
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> my neovim is fancy
14:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, I use vim, not neovim, currently
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> neovim should be like vim but better
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> except here, apparently?
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok let me try vim
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf. For me they are
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ahh
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U have to use  rust behind the `|
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1187031707501727876/image.png?ex=6595686d&is=6582f36d&hm=404ec787ffb8f35aaaf5efd1c19740a9460e5620eca3cbe1e194e630c20cea31&
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Else it doesn't assume any language
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vscode
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then it works
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is plain old vim
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Try chiller
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doesnt work for me
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ???? No way
15:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, I have `vim-rust-git` installed
15:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess it comes from there
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt for me xd
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Strange
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I use vscode too
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah in vim it works
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also without vim-rust-git xd
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ??
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I use nightly rust analyser tho
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried with vim 9
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and neovim
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what theme
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Default
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dark
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> same xd
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> dark modern
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well rip. Can u try nightly analyser extension
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> already do xd
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1187032573130580079/image.png?ex=6595693b&is=6582f43b&hm=9ce6962b2c611bcc8ab37ab30f9bac742962d0258a03d9bad1e3975cd4ec7828&
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well i tried it on different project. Let me look on ddnet
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its cuz ddnet does weird
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> on my project it highlights
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> it must be cuz its a weird setup on ddnet
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No. For me it tries it on loading for a second then dies
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Seems the cxx macro
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When I remove it, it works
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> indeed breaks, no matter which proc macro xd
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki do bug report üòè
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> contribute to rust, it's your duty
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> no u do it
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> im lazy today
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have no github account
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its the cold
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> troll
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it now requires 2fa, so i can't access it without my pc
15:09 < bridge> <stars_111> hey
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hello Stars, wazzup
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon:
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vscode settings
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```json
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "rust-analyzer.procMacro.ignored": {

15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     }
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it should work xdd
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i find many reports similar to this on the gh repo
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> add to workspace
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt test this btw, i read it from an issue xdd
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao it blinked once
15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> got a 1s preview of how it could look like xd
15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watever im not rust dev anyways ill go back to starring at C++ code
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> staring*
15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can take a look at it though, since it tests the stuff you wanted to test I think, jsut without requiring private members
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea you test the whole thing which is also recommended according to one of the SO answers
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no need to write any test if you already did
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and how do you call it if you star a github repo? üò¨
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> starred
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> staring means to stare
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you actively doing it XD
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:47 < bridge> <volvicc> Did we ever tried to contact DDNet Solutions for ddos protection?

15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, can you call them please and ask?
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder what they think if they google their company and see a 2d game xdd
16:00 < bridge> <volvicc> maybe they even offer account systems :D
16:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> instant sue, idk, companies do that nowadays
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know its not the same but im sponsoring the wiki theorically :d
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Devs, mappers etc sponsor the game anyway.

17:13 < bridge> <robyt3> We should update to SDL 2.28.5 in DDNet 17.5, prebuild libraries are still 2.26.5
17:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> 10000 euros for 2013-2022
17:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> thas expensive
17:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> 2013-2019 probably costed like 3 cents lol
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> static constexpr int gs_BackendVulkanMajor = 1;
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> static constexpr int gs_BackendVulkanMinor = 1;
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks does anything happen if i put minor = 3
17:30 < bridge> <deen> Every time I upgrade SDL they break something
17:33 < bridge> <deen> Anything we want from 2.28.5?
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks mostly like smaller bug fixes since it's "the last scheduled release of SDL 2.0", so hopefully it doesn't introduce any more regressions
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> > Fixed occasionally failing to open the clipboard on Windows
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> I think we had an issue with copying not working which could not be reproduced, so that could be useful. Various other fixes mostly for gamecontrollers including some crashes with them.
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> > Fixed large mouse jump when changing relative mouse mode on macOS
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure if that was an issue for us
17:34 < bridge> <deen> I'll try to do it on one of the next weekends. Somehow the lib updates are never easy
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you want to go through the community applications for next release as well?
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> We have a few issues about hosters wanting a community, but they haven't responded with properly formated icons yet
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then only GPUs with vk 1.3 are respected
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to change the instance version, change:
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> VKAppInfo.apiVersion = VK_API_VERSION_1_1;
17:47 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Did you see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5676#issuecomment-1859212798 ? Seems like something that we could prevent if that is the problem
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i reported that bug to amd and they already fixed it
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this guy must have a driver from last year
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if he has a driver from last year, he could also use Vulkan
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then he wouldn't have this problem
17:50 < bridge> <misteringanamorte> where server config in teeworlds
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vanilla or what
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be nice if you could give a full sentence

19:02 < bridge> <broso56> thats what i tried to do a few months ago but never got it to a releaseable point lmao
19:03 < bridge> <broso56> mostly just did it to learn ddnet code a lil not to be released since i dont know much about that process
19:03 < bridge> <broso56> i think i also tried this but not for multiple cps and that was just straight up unfinished i think
19:04 < bridge> <broso56> i think i also tried this but not for multiple cps and that was just straight up unfinished

20:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah lol that is F-DDrace
20:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @misteringanamorte: I do not think the author of that mod would like you to run this o.0
20:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @misteringanamorte: I recommend this alternative it is free to use https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP
20:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
20:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Has similar but not the same features as F-DDrace but there you can get the latest code and no angry mod dev will hunt you down
20:10 < bridge> <nouaa> lol I'm waiting for @fokkonaut to blame me again
20:10 < bridge> <nouaa> :kek:
20:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd why wat happend last time
20:11 < bridge> <nouaa> I have no idea, some people got the source (idk how) and since I had it before fokko made it private, he blamed me
20:11 < bridge> <nouaa> the guy was faking fokko's server
20:11 < bridge> <nouaa> and was malicious somehow
