07:57 < laxa> deen: can you make a /mute feature that would simple mute what a player /say and /w to you ?
07:57 < laxa> deen: if you do so, then you can remove the anti-flood protection on /w !
07:59 < EastBite> laxa: does the player muting feature of tw on work for that?
08:00 < laxa> Don't know, but a /mute command would be more handy.
08:01 < EastBite> hm it could work together
09:38 < EastBite> deen: does this look like the correct way of defining the freq table of teeworlds?
09:38 < EastBite> https://github.com/east/nimrodbox/blob/master/huffman.nim#L30
09:47 < EastBite> okay I made it const now
18:41 <@deen> hi
18:41 <@deen> laxa: meh, i don't know. just write in full sentences and you will never be flood-muted
18:42 <@deen> EastBite: Looks good, but you could do
18:42 <@deen> const twFreqTable: array[maxSymbols, uint32] = ...
18:42 <@deen> or even: const twFreqTable = [1u32 shl ..., ...]
18:43 <@deen> and for 0..maxSymbols-1 you could also write 0 .. <maxSymbols
18:56 < EastBite> ehh
18:57 < EastBite> array[maxSymbols is possible?
18:57 <@deen> yes
18:57 < EastBite> damn
18:57 <@deen> =)
18:59 <@deen> EastBite: Do we need moderators?!
18:59 <@deen> (on ddnet servers, not irc)
19:00 < EastBite> hmm
19:00 < EastBite> depends

19:01 <@deen> Discussion here
19:10 < EastBite> I think I'm against it

19:15 <@deen> ^^
19:15 <@deen> i would only want people as moderators who don't want to be mods
19:17 < EastBite> I hate being a moderator
19:17 < EastBite> it sucks
19:17 < EastBite> don't even try to chose me
19:18 <@deen> ^^
19:18 < EastBite> hm as you already said, you can't get rid of ragers/flamers
