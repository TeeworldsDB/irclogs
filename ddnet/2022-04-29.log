09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not having std::optional rly makes me feel sad
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just such a good pattern
09:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to do `bool CreateMyType(MyType *pMyType);` `std::optional<MyType> CreateMyType();` is just superior
09:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid debian smh
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill use std::pair for now but i feel bad still
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> error: 'class sorted_array<CAStar::Node>' has no member named 'empty'
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>    66 |                 return !m_Path.empty();
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> ðŸ˜¦
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> i did it     sorted_array<Node> m_Path;
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> why it don't recognize being an array?
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @everestkio no, it says that the class sorted_array doesn't have a member named empty, this means there's no method declared with name "empty"
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if you look at src/base/tl/sorted_array.h
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what you could use is size() and checks if it's empty
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> i just add     /*
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>         Function: empty
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>     */
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>     bool empty() const
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>     {
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>         return num_elements == 0;
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>     }
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>  on array.h and now it work
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> do you know what this is for? or could you explain to me what the hell is mutex LOCK_SECTION_MUTEX
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what r u even trying to do
09:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> implements some function of another client
09:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> and often the client use LOCK_SECTION_MUTEX(m_Mutex)

14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> Hello, is allright if i will text in developer chat room? i don't want to mess with anything
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> Im playing DDraceNetwork for a 5 months now, im playing only kog, i had the name on steam same as in game and it was not taken name, now someone stole my name and 4 points added in my name and when some friend of mine changed it on my name, it showed new clan and new state flag in tab what i didn't recognised, i cant register the name i don't know why, i tried to register as mail, it couldn't and i tried to register as discord, it didn't w
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> thank you
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> thank you for letting me now
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need to register your name
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just use it. the name belongs to no one in ddnet
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone can call themselves heinrich5991
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> so in ddnet is okay if anyone uses a different user name ?
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> so like if i will use for example Mixi name, it's all allright?
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, if you're talking about KoG, try this discord: https://discord.gg/3G5SJY49nY
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, on DDNet anyone can call themselves Mixi
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> oooh
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> yeah i mean kog
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> im sorry i texted in wrong discord server
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> so sorry
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <MaikCZE> thank you heinrich5991
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone got an opinion on the log format? before and after:
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [2022-04-29 15:25:37][engine]: running on unix-linux-amd64
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [2022-04-29 15:25:37]I[engine]: running on unix-linux-amd64
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, The `I` might look better after the module name and it'd be easier to spot, however this way might make more sense logically
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though now that I think more about it not all modules have the same name length, so the set position after the timestamp is better
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> How about no [] but spaces instead?
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ```
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 2022-04-29 15:25:37 I engine: running on unix-linux-amd64
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ```
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would be fine with that. doesn't have the characteristic teeworlds log format anymore, but I'm not attached to it
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be more readable due less noise even
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets see how android does it xd
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, if we don't mind breaking peoples parsers I'd move the E/I/W all the way to the start
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the argument against that is that it's no longer naively sortable
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (see also the PR, but now the two arguments in there were already said ^^)
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe the E/I/W is not that great, might be clearer with ERROR/INFO/WARNING/
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `04-29 15:46:22.220  4064 13009 W PhenotypeConfigurationU:`
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so i guess similar to deens proposal
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ERROR WARN INFO DEBUG TRACE is clearer, EWIDT wastes less space
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that is a nice quality indeed. I think I like what deen proposed with full names
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe WARN instead of WARNING so it's not too long
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust's tracing-subscriber:
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2022-02-15T18:40:14.289898Z  INFO fmt: preparing to shave yaks number_of_yaks=3
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe make the date and time ISO8601 with a T between?
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I don't like the T and Z personally, looks strange
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does look worse but makes it trivial to parse
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I also prefer spaces and no Z or T, human readability > robot readability
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> We also print local time right now, so Z would be wrong
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently, I think I'd prefer EWIDT over ERROR WARN INFO DEBUG due to the 4 less characters required
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently, I think I'd prefer EWIDT over ERROR WARN INFO DEBUG due to the 4 fewer characters required
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the logs are read by users and developers. first time readers might be confused by EWIDT
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> others benefit from it because more stuff fits into a line
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I guess colors could compensate for the regular user not knowing exactly what EWIDT are
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> default color red for errors? ^^
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> White is normal, Yellow is something might be awry, Red is bad
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could do that ðŸ™‚
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea what colors debug and trace should be, but shouldn't matter much
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think tracing-subscriber had blue for debug, pink for trace
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (anyone wanna take a look at merging https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5013 so I can more easily work on the follow-up pull requests for changing the format and the macros? ðŸ™‚ )
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki my bot, new drama round #5041
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5041
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a nice logging interface we could offer a json loggers too
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the common way is to output 1 json object per line
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> per log
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a nice logging interface we could offer a json logger too
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```json
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {t: "datehere", "system": "engine", message :"rusti is better than C"}
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {t: "date2here", "system": "engine", message: "rusti is better than C"}
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> {t: "date3here", "system": "engine", message: "rusti is better than C"}
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like this
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen it a lot
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now my total awesome logging feature wont work anymore:
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/969605020825813012/unknown.png
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, with well formated json
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i forgot keys in json also use ""
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your totally awesome logging feature?
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> team colors are shown correctly
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its the colors?
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats smth fokkonaut wanted and i implemented it, but never really finished it xd
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks already put my comment there
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> todo: Remove vanilla support, remove 0.7 stuff, change the protocol to remove the monkey patches we done throughout the history to not completly break vanilla
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> annoying item ex stuff and shit
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my does the laser from vanilla not even send its owner
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its so annoying in fng ðŸ˜„
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> todo: consider getting the only good stuff from 0.7, the dynamic skins, but without making them look weird
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that the client cannot know it
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wanted star wars colors .c
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the skin support would be nice indeed
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would also be cool to be able to fully use c++17
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and not just parts of it
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is unrelated to vanilla
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its vanillas fault that we support ubuntu 18 xdd
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> blame them for everything
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks have u ever imagined, scripting support within maps, with a rly stripped down language
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tesselation shaders
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am all in
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that most of that stuff also has backward compatibility concerns with ddnet itself ^^
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did, I thought about something like a command block which can execute console commands
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> redstone computers incomming
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh true
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe instead of a language as is
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> provide building blocks
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like minecraft redstone
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka switches 2.0
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just give a nand gate and do a computer
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant wait to see doom in ddnet
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd love to have animation triggers for mappers
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe thats not that hard to do
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just make a special tune zone
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah think so too
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I still have the prototype somewhere, the id of the tee that touched the tile would be %v, so you could do things like `tele_xyz %v 0 0 0`
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just built in, we can always break compability xdd
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Animation triggers would be very cool, maybe even animations that chain so you wouldn't have to offset everything by hand
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i miss lady saavik animations
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OEgiJFKtQw
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if playername == ryozuki
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar>  fireworks()
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar>  nothingxd()
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> She made some insane stuff
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We need more loading screens for tournaments ðŸ˜›
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well tournaments always remind me of the only thing we cant do nothing about
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the word must not be spoken
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/ddos-bowzer-roboo-homies-lunisity-gif-20625247
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but proxies will help a lot
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just make proxies for proxies
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then e.g. i can host for ppl i trust
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can u rebase ur other prs?
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i saw that but havent really looked into it deeper
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hard to see a good diff
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah well
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should click on the commit
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of changes
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which other PRs? @Ryozuki
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is there a I (i)
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the log format?
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5036>
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `[2022-04-29 15:25:37]I[console]: executing 'autoexec_server.cfg'`
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> EDIWT = ERROR  DEBUG INFO WARNING TRACE
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dislike it
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer it to tell the full word
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We better discuss it in the PR
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> best would be to post your opinion in the PR
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the first thing i thought about the I is that it was some fancy separator
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> done
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Looks similar. Nice to see that nearly everyone is on most recent version, great advantage of Steam.
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true
16:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i think thanks to steam we can try to do breaking changes
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what would you think about vanilla support if it was encapsulated in a way that doesn't interact with the main source code, and developed independently?
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably no problem with that?
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do you want it?
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see nothing good
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't lie. I assume you have read the PR ^^
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the issue*
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you think of a positive thing that was said about vanilla support?
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A sort of proxy? In my experience while adding sixup this is really hard to achieve. If you envision a proxy I'd say it's very close to impossible with how much information is lost when you get to the packet level. Otherwise I guess you'd need hooks littered everywhere
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thought about that too, removing network code from the client code as first step ðŸ˜„
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did it for 0.5-0.6, but I guess 0.6-0.7 is harder
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cause of the state that needs to be kept
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we can truly have it be clean I'd be for having a 0.7 layer
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not even sure if an outside observer can derive all the needed state
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you come up with an example that would be hard?
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking about whispers, but I guess you could keep track of that
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just break compability once per year
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What would be a little sad is that you'd have to re-calculate state that the server already knew, but I guess it could be affordable for 1% of clients
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all problems solved
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ah I remembered one, `protocol7::CNetMsg_Sv_ServerSettings` how would you go about this one?
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It requires information that wouldn't be sent to a 0.6 client to begin with
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's not sent, I'd first check if it's optional, and if not I'd add an extended message sending the same or similar information
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if that'd still be called non-invasive by you then ^^
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the ddnet client could then also use the info ^^
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the worst case, if not wanted, I'd fill it with stub data that the client accepts
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> player_slots can be derived from server info, team_balance set to true, team_lock set to false, spec_vote set to true, kick_min set to 5
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, the set of things sent to 0.7 clients is almost in all cases a superset, so this could be desirable
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah u were talking about the pr
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought u said in general
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, the issue, see next line
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'd honestly even be okay with it if you can wrap it up into a separate set of files loosely hooked into the server code, but an external proxy would be great too
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could even be generalized by #4791
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4791
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> u know how use twmap on py
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> in a test script it gimme immediately this error   File "c:\Users\sradi\Desktop\Test\test2.py", line 14, in <module>
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio>     assert g1.name == g1_name
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> AssertionError
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best u tag patiga directly
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> @heinrich5991 can you look what just happened to ger2 server?
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> everyone disconnected at the same time
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> or anyone that has insight to the servers
21:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Server crashed, probably because of the recent changes
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Bug in /swap, disabled on official servers for now
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the test file I sent you for example code it does that assertion. it even tells you the line there ^^. the file should only have success with the map Lotus, and probably also only on the dev-branch of twmap-py, due to an unrelated bug
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> oh sus
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> lotus is a kog o ddnet map?
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> could someone give me a hand, a tutorial or something on how to use HSplitBottom, vertical etc others well?
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also have the feeling its black magic xD
