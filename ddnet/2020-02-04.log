00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Lol that Spoiler shouldnâ€™t the GitHub bot message be a markdown free area?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably forgot to escape the text there
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobos
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> find me a markdown escaper for php and i'll add it ðŸ˜›
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But I mean the whole thing looks like it is made for this
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> U?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fixed the comment
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wait? Who made the bot?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 filters the events, but the actual bot is by one of discord or github I think
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yea I thought so that it is something official
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my filter pretends to be the github webhook
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Thatâ€™s why I wonder it does not have proper markdown escape
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get the events from github, then i pretend I'm the actual github bot to discord
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah so you send the actual messagesb
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah i see
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And you wrote it in php I guess
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, that's the one language I'm quite efficient with when writing web stuff
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you try bash ðŸ˜„ ?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh yea and sorry I just wanted to rant on Microsoft I didnâ€™t expect the bot to be built by u
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh yea, please give me a user account on your machine by writing a internet-facing service in bash
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *an
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, discord only supports a subset of markdown, so i'll need to code an escaper on my own
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bash is bullet proof :p
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> every ctf has atleast one bash challenge, very easy to get bash wrong
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I wish I wasnâ€™t too nobo
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> One day ima join a ctf

13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 how do i remove client side commands from server now with your new update?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like i need to add my own function for it?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where i just pass the client commands name
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh did I forget to add oneM
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, check CGameContext
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can only find a function to remove a command that is in the server's commands list
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure I added a SendRemoveChatCommand or sth
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clients have their own commands
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, you did
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but there i cant just remove the command "all" for example
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a client command, which switches to chat allÃ¶
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a client command, which switches to chat all
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, those are supposed to be removable?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just add an override for SendRemove... that takes a const char * instead of an SCommand *
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't think that was a usecase
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can pull request it feel free to, if not I'll just do it after I'm done with food
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> did you test the command stuff
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, so did chiller
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cannot send any command from the client using the chat, it seems like the autocompletion just makes the chat command send as a normal chat message
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh wait
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah no ok
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it works, yes
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have the formatstring right?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> was my error sorry
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does the client sort the command alphabetically?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, I thought you were against that

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> @noby  u consider deleting github content as mature?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> or scamming ppl?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wasnt a scam
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is lickout the idiot who paid you?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, @yee
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But lickout is an idiot for sure
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how is it not a scam tho
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check all messages by me in the last discussion
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if u offer something for free then u clearly don t think its worth $150
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i did
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye it was really dumb to buy that. the guy scammed himself
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> exactly corneum
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> both are dumb
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you and lickout, yea
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no i meant fokko and whoevers in charge of letting fokko stay here
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just funny that you care so much
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> ppl calling u idiot bcs ur against scam
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> kinda hurts my feeling
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> kinda hurts my feelings
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont care i just feel like calling out scamers
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lazy afternoon
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think fokkonaut approached the guy or made any wrong promises. he just sold a early access and the guy was ready to pay 150 for it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and thats rly funny tbh
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this mans speaking true words
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i appreciate it
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not unknown that you guys just hate on me, lickout nobdy
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> maybe i didnt hear the full story because what i heard makes it sound like a scam
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Enjoy your money, it doesnt mean ur morally right tho, totally a dick move and it just shows i would never do business with you, and probably any othee
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Other*
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye okay
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u rite, its not a scam, its not illegal, its just a dick move
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you can call it a dick move, or a smart move. especially in the business world there no difference
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> He losy trust
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No one will buy any new mod he does
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if something makes u seem sketchy to others then its not smart
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think fokko even told the guy that he is eventually going to release it at a later point
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> did he
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I doubt
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we even had multiple calls
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why would he pay so much for a mod that he could just wait for
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i told him i didnt want to sell it in the first place
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> onby, i dont know
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But yet you did
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he offered it multiple times
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ur totally a dicl
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U were just liying
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Doesnt make u right
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did not lie
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You did
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if someone offered me such a ridiculous amount of money for something i thought was worth $0 then id have a hard time not accepting it too
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but i feel like
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there is something being left out
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if there were more customers buying that, it would been reasonable to freak out
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what does even one person matter?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Here comes cellegen
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> was about to say the same ryo
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im out
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Cellegen the fuck, last time you were also against me xd
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> kid
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i even dont know who bought it
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that doesnt make it better
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so? one person brought that shit, did you warn him about any changes in the future?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gth
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not nice of you
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and then
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> telling the guy how to run his own servers after doing that
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> alpha
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:31 PM]  Cellegen: not nice
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ^
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who even started this convo anyway? what has to do with that?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> was that customer or just a random complainer?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/671961226066001920
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cellegen, if you want to participate in these talks you should know whats really up.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a random, yee cried at
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> exposed
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Im 'corneum i just forgot who started it, i was here at the start
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> were you a good freind at the start too?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there are open source mods for free that are very similr to urs afaik (? mabye wrong) so thats why i wonder whats being left out
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i wasnt sure if it was an issue for other people besides him
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my mod is not that usual
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i only got my eye on this because of that 150 Euro paycheck
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye thats an insane amount of money
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> for a tw mod
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> shut up @Im 'corneum
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @onby his own offer
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> my points deserved to be transferred
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> were planning that source alone, but you were selling it to people too, wouldn't be logical to start these types of projects with people?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> at least one got it ^^
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then he is also dumb for offering so much
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i thought back then that you made up that prize, well sorry bout that
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you didnt mention as protection
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ur taking advantage of a dumb person tho xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that my problem?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what doent make sense for me rn is that he got so angry afterwards. he was pretty wasteful with his money, which makes me think he has a lot to spend. even if it was an excusive mod it would be alot of money
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes its not nice
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or maybe he was giving real value to your work and u totslly destroyed that
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It just makes it worde
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Worse
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well i have no issues about who brought it, it was the customer's decision in the first place
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> could've cut off the prize a bit just to be fair but whatever
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then he would never learn the value of money
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> again said: that's not how you play economy
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> now at least he wont do dumb shit like this again. at some point in life you have to learn money
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Working at 10â‚¬/h which is cheap and making the mod in 20 hourd it would be 200â‚¬. U just undervalue ur work
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why not sell an offline DLC pack for 2-5 Euroes to TW 0.7 on Steam?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, i am working on this mod now for over a year
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes theres a value in learning stuff like this the hard way, that doesnt mean that whoever is facilitating this type of learning isnt an asshole tho
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just going from money/hour perspective, i could have get thousands of euros
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that doesnt make sense
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lool
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cellegen i wonder when you will be of good value to a convo
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sorry ryo, did you say anything useful lately?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> christ
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :gg:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U got me
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i didnt care about that, because i made this mod for me, and only me in the first place. Thats why i didnt want to sell it, but if that guy just offers me 150â‚¬, i thought about mhh why not,. Just creating a mod for myself, and selling a copy and even getting money? sounds like a good deal for me
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes ur mod is worth tHoUsAnDs Of DoLlArS
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :|
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @onby i said looking from money per hour perspective
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but u had already made it for free
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> before taking advantage of an opportunity to make money off it
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> tbh you could've measure the prize by the original game's value times the amount of days you have put it
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> @onby  your anticheat is woth MiLlIoNs Of UsD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :Pog:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh sorry, this game's free :troll:
