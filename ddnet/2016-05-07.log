07:10 < Carrotteeworlds> yo!)
10:57 < Gabee_> deen & heinrich5991 & EastByte : sorry to interrupt, I'm running a ddnet server for test and the up/down command doesn't work, as admin and as helper, do I need to enable or disable some stuff in order to make it work? thanks guys
10:58 <@heinrich5991> Gabee_: you have to enable test commands AFAIK
10:58 <@heinrich5991> sv_test_cmds 1

12:10 < mhsabbagh> Hello people
12:10 < mhsabbagh> the ddnet 10.0.1 client for Linux is missing the file libSDL2
12:11 < mhsabbagh> I hope someone can fix it?
14:10 <@deen> well, sdl2 is intentionally missing and you're supposed to install it with your package manager
14:10 <@deen> same as with sdl1.2 in older versions

21:16 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 642e7f7 def: Still hide window at start (fixes fullscreen in Gnome)
23:04 < kamillentee> if gfx_screen is not 0 (might me because there was a screen plugged in before) DDNet fails to startup with "unable to retrieve screen information: displayIndex must be in the range 0 - 0"
23:05 <@deen> kamillentee: ah, thanks
23:05 <@deen> I guess we should handle that more graciously
23:06 < kamillentee> btw what happened to multi window playing (Im sure that was possible in earlier sdl2 test versions)
23:06 <@deen> huh?
23:06 <@deen> what's that?
23:07 < kamillentee> playing on 2 or more screens :=
23:07 <@deen> with 1 client?
23:07 < kamillentee> ye
23:07 <@deen> ah, so that the window spreads over both of them
23:07 < kamillentee> yes
23:07 <@deen> that doesn't sound very useful
23:07 <@deen> the old sdl1.2 client used to do that for me all the time
23:08 <@deen> and I had to painfully switch to another resolution on first start
23:08 < kamillentee> not sure just asking
23:08 <@deen> ok, i don't think it's useful
23:08 <@deen> if you have a good use for it, feel free to add it
