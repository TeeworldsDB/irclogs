00:01 < savander> btw
00:01 < savander> i change nothing in this
00:01 < savander> Gamecontext.h: http://pastebin.com/6HX8P1XG  Ranking.cpp: http://pastebin.com/u9xrLnnd Ranking.h http://pastebin.com/iNhFi5eA
00:02 < savander> so maybe you see smth wrong with this Server() :(
00:02 <@deen> what error do you get?
00:02 <@deen> segfault?
00:02 <@deen> what value does m_pServer have on the segfault
00:04 < savander> http://pastebin.com/wCqT6xgD
00:04 <@deen> i don't know what you're doing there, but it seems weird
00:04 < savander> xD?
00:05 <@deen> why does CRanking inherit from CGameContext?
00:05 < savander> n o no
00:05 < savander> i deleted it soryr
00:05 < savander> i should
00:05 < savander> send new code, ye
00:05 < savander> i forgot
00:06 < savander> http://pastebin.com/QSk2QQkA
00:07 < savander> http://pastebin.com/8Excy84w
00:18 < savander> meh
00:25 < laxa> deen: don't you think ddnet should standart ?
00:25 < laxa> for example : half freeze should ALWAYS be freeze or not freeze
00:25 < laxa> this should not change from one map to another
00:27 <@deen> no, mapper decides
00:27 < laxa> <_<
00:31 <@deen> savander: hm, now that i look at the segfault
00:31 <@deen> it looks more like your pointer to CRanking is broken
00:31 <@deen> maybe you forgot to initialize m_Ranking properly
00:31 < savander> hmm
00:32 < savander> i init it in gamecontext.cpp
00:32 < savander> like that:
00:32 < savander> 		m_Ranking = new CRanking(this);
00:32 < savander> gameconetxt.h
00:32 < savander>     class CRanking *m_Ranking;
00:33 <@deen> it's difficult to debug code when you only have snippets
00:33 < savander> i can send code on github
00:33 < savander> if better
00:34 <@deen> maybe try running it in gdb and get a backtrace
00:35 < savander> https://github.com/savander/zcatch/commit/2a54f759145f86fce4ad2a333de6d9cd911d8861
00:35 < savander> i run it in gdb
00:35 < savander> but maybe i can't use it
00:35 < savander> i only have 
00:35 < savander> http://pastebin.com/wCqT6xgD
00:35 < savander> when crash
00:35 <@deen> type bt
00:36 < savander> ah
00:37 < savander> ;o
00:43 < savander> http://pastebin.com/RLUEwKJ7 i think, i did smth wrong i zCatch.cpp but... meh nvm, it's too hard for me at this time, dont understand why :p.
00:43 < savander> but, ye thanks for all :)

11:26 < Savander> hi.
11:27 < Tobii> Hi
11:27 <@deen> hi
11:41 <@deen> Chinese server is fun
11:41 <@deen> I'm watching chinese, russians and japanese playing Kobra 2 Solo
12:51 < KinG_> hi all hi deen 
12:52 < KinG_> deen:  we got plenty of ram available but there is still 120MB swap that's too much can u do somthing about that?
12:53 < KinG_> i'm gonna sleep bye for now :)
14:04 < laxa> deen: this Qshar guy thinks that his ddrace is safer than ddnet server...
14:38 < EastByte> laxa: safer?
14:39 < laxa> Dunno, he thinks ddrace is less vulnerable to anything than ddnet
14:39 < laxa> I didn't told him he is retard, but maybe I should have xD
14:49 < Maple> hi
14:50 < laxa> hi
15:30 < CookieMichal> [14-09-27 15:29:32][client]: error, couldn't find the delta snapshot
15:30 < CookieMichal> what does it mean
15:33 < CookieMichal> Help me with this! http://is.gd/JtDonM
15:43 < laxa> debug 0 in F1
15:43 < laxa> will fix it
16:14 < EastByte> CookieMichal: seems to be an error while handling snapshots
16:27 < CookieMichal> why does it happen?
16:45 <@deen> laxa: I'm not sure if he's right or not. I fixed some vulnerabilities, maybe I also opened some^^
16:45 < laxa> well, if an exploit is discovered on ddrace, he is fucked
16:46 < laxa> if an exploit is discovered on ddnet, you'll fix it directly
16:46 <@deen> CookieMichal: that's weird, i only get that when i have huge lags on Chile
16:46 <@deen> laxa: yeah, there are a few open exploits on ddrace and they're abused
16:47 <@deen> they also were abused 2 years ago on ddmax and are still open
16:47 < laxa> which exploit oO ?
16:48 <@deen> for example doors not resetting when the entire team restarts
16:48 <@deen> ah, or maybe that was recently fixed
16:48 <@deen> but all cheated records are still there :P
16:48 <@deen> and they're unbeatable now^^
16:49 <@deen> or that you can kick every client
16:49 < laxa> last commit on ddrace was march 2013
16:49 <@deen> and kicking admins even more easily
16:49 < laxa> I am admin of the repo :)
16:54 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went down!

17:15 < EastByte> CookieMichal: it happens due to packet loss I guess
18:06 < SNAK3> hi !
18:07 < SNAK3> I'm having another problem with my DDnet servers 
18:07 <@deen> hi SNAK3 
18:07 <@deen> what problem?
18:07 < SNAK3> The DDnet servers always end with a segmentation fault error 
18:07 < SNAK3> the owner of the server reports that it hapens around 50 players 
18:07 <@deen> there are that full DDNet servers?
18:08 < SNAK3> Apparently 
18:08 < SNAK3> I can't confirm it though 
18:08 <@deen> Oh, ChillerDragons DDNet server has 56 players now
18:08 <@deen> hm, that's weird
18:08 <@deen> we regularly have 64 players at the tournaments
18:08 <@deen> and no segfaults
18:09 <@deen> is that a new bug or anything special set?
18:09 < SNAK3> I have tried 2 different VPS's now 
18:09 <@deen> how are your servers called?
18:09 < SNAK3> !DDrace [Blocker] Frost Clan server w/64p !!! [1] [0/64]
18:10 < SNAK3> and another one but it's uDDRace 
18:10 <@deen> ok, most recent version
18:10 < SNAK3> not officially DDnet 
18:10 < SNAK3> yes 
18:10 < SNAK3> the update from about a week ago if i remember correctly 
18:10 <@deen> i guess you can't compile it in debug mode and run it in gdb?
18:10 <@deen> is that on Windows or Linux?
18:10 < SNAK3> ubuntu 14.04 64bit LTSA
18:11 < SNAK3> ubuntu 14.04 64bit LTS
18:11 <@deen> ok, very weird
18:11 <@deen> i hope we won't see crashes at the tournament tomorrow =/
18:11 < SNAK3> me 2 
18:11 < EastByte> deen: tournaments never segfaulted before right?
18:12 < SNAK3> I have also posted this on the forums (teeworlds.com) but no one replied 
18:12 < SNAK3> under support 
18:12 <@deen> EastByte: i think at the very start we had problems, but loooong ago
18:12 <@deen> well, teeworlds.com doesn't want posts about DDNet I guess
18:13 < SNAK3> I figured they had lots of active mod topics so this wasn't a problem... but idk
18:13 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/ might have been a better choice
18:13 <@deen> EastByte: can you connect your 64 dummies on that server?
18:14 < SNAK3> idk how do i connect dummies ? (It's not my server I never play DDRace 
18:14 < EastByte> ip limit needs to be disabled first
18:14 <@deen> ok, can you do that, SNAK3 ?
18:14 <@deen> hm, you said "my DDnet servers"?
18:15 < SNAK3> Well yeah I host and manage them 
18:15 < SNAK3> but i do it for other people 
18:15 <@deen> if you have rcon on it, set sv_max_clients_per_ip 64
18:15 < SNAK3> My DDRace servers is indeed a bit of a bad choice 
18:15 < SNAK3> I have 
18:15 <@deen> i want to see if it crashes
18:16 <@deen> and if it crashes, I'd like the config, then i can try it on my own
18:22 <@deen> afk
18:22 < SNAK3> What's [14-09-27 18:16:34][server]: '(29)test' -> '(29)test'
18:22 <@deen> i don't know, but it's normal^^
18:23 < SNAK3> It's about 9-% of my logs :P 
18:23 < SNAK3> *90
18:23 < EastByte> some playerinfo change or so
18:24 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went down!
18:24 < SNAK3> Surely it's the same segfault :
18:24 < SNAK3> :P
18:24 < EastByte> the same?
18:24 < SNAK3> I'm having segfaults to 
18:25 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went back online!
18:29 < EastByte> SNAK3: the status of the persian server is not reliable
18:30 < EastByte> too far away and packet loss
18:31 < SNAK3> ah ok 
18:31 < SNAK3> Can it somehow be a DDos atack ?
18:32 < EastByte> it can, sure
18:32 < SNAK3> I'm at ovh.ie and they claim to have pretty good DDos mitigation 
18:32 < SNAK3> So how can they still atack the server ?
18:32 < SNAK3> (I'm a total noob when talking about DDos ) 
18:33 < EastByte> you can't completly block a ddos attack
18:33 < SNAK3> So what do they do then ?
18:34 < EastByte> what can't be blocked gets trough :P
18:35 < EastByte> through*
18:36 < SNAK3> So a DDos protection is pretty useless ?
18:36 < EastByte> it's not
18:37 < EastByte> attacks which can be analysed and detected, can be dropped
18:37 < EastByte> it works pretty well
18:37 < SNAK3> How can i check if it was a DDos atack ?
18:37 < EastByte> ovh will notify you
18:37 < SNAK3> Except my vps control panel bandwidth monitor (cuz there's none .. :/)
18:38 < EastByte> the problem is gameservers suffer the most under those attacks
18:38 < EastByte> because every lost packet will lagg the game
18:38 < SNAK3> I know that's the reason i got a DDos protected vps host 
18:41 < SNAK3> So how can i see if it was a DDos atack ?
18:42 < EastByte> you can set up your own bandwidth monitor
18:42 < EastByte> but you also might not be able to access your serveer while ddos
18:42 < SNAK3> would a tool like nethogs also sufice ?
18:43 < EastByte> sure
18:44 < EastByte> but remember that attacks which are dropped by the ddos protection won't reach your server
18:44 < SNAK3> But the atacks dropped by the protection also shouldn't interfere with the server right ?
18:44 < EastByte> yep
18:45 < SNAK3> So those are not a problem 
18:45 < SNAK3> Oh well i gtg eating 
18:45 < SNAK3> Thanks for your help so far !
18:45 < EastByte> np
18:45 < SNAK3> :)

21:21 <@deen> ok
21:21 < CookieMichal> lel
22:16 < laxa> deen: you found why the server crashed for SNAK3 ?
22:16 <@deen> no
22:17 <@deen> and I'm a bit worried about it
22:17 <@deen> because of tournament
22:17 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/v67ezkTC
22:17 <@deen> Maybe it's an attack
22:17 < laxa> it's the settings he used originally
22:17 < laxa> but he must have changed the sv_register to 1
22:18 <@deen> so many xxlddrace options^^
22:19 < laxa> I feel like he doesn't know much about teeworlds.

22:44 <@deen> you mean over http?
22:44 < CookieMichal> Yeah
22:44 <@deen> use a library or write your own http code!
22:45 < CookieMichal> But what library :I
22:45 <@deen> some simple http download library
22:45 <@deen> there should be many, don't know any
22:45 <@deen> http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/competitors.html
22:46 < CookieMichal> Thanks :D
22:46 <@deen> most are probably way too complicated^^
22:47 <@deen> or check the autoupdate.cpp in DDNet client
22:47 <@deen> it's HTTP 1.0 only though
22:51 < CookieMichal> Found this for curl :3 http://stackoverflow.com/a/1636415
