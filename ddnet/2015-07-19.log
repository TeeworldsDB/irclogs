16:00 < laxadedi> css problem at the bottom of the page
16:00 < laxadedi> is your interview available and in english deen ?
16:10 <@EastByte> someone could add english subtitles on youtube
16:30 <@EastByte> eeeee: btw. how would you pronounce your nickname?
16:30 <@EastByte> 5 times e? =)
16:31 <@heinrich5991> quintuple-e!
16:31 <@heinrich5991> (pronounced 'quintuply')
16:32 <@EastByte> oh that's nice
16:34 < BeaR_> entity which enables fixed physics - pls no :D
16:35 < BeaR_> and call it a feature ^^
16:35 <@EastByte> where did you get that?
16:36 < BeaR_> someone requested fixed hook strength on the forum
16:36 < BeaR_> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=14&p=19239
16:37 <@EastByte> adding features which nobody will understand isn't the best idea anyway
16:38 < BeaR_> well we are already at that point (:
16:38 <@EastByte> yea...
16:38 < BeaR_> but i agree
16:43 < BeaR_> are there any statistics concerning the amount of people using ddnet client?
17:10 < Learath2> BeaR_: deen did grep the logs for all clients but its very crude statistically
17:11 < BeaR_> huh?
17:12 < Chairn> i found an image with 44% user of ddnet
17:12 < Chairn> http://i.imgur.com/JanCse3.png
17:13 < Chairn> but so few vote ^^
17:13 < BeaR_> oh (:
17:14 < Chairn> DDNet Client users today (unique IP): 3261 Players online per server today (DDRace and Block only, unique IP):  Code: Select all GER:         4240 GER2:        1246 Chile:       1362 RUS:          845 South Africa: 406 Brazil:       387 USA:          349 CAN:          102 CHN:           76
17:14 < Chairn> 3261 ddnet clien over total
17:14 < Chairn> seems around 30%(i let you do the maths :P)
17:17 <@EastByte> hi Chairn 
17:20 < BeaR_> Chairn: thanks, where did you get the data?
17:21 <@EastByte> it was once posted on tw.com
17:24 < BeaR_> ok found it, was actually in the history post :D
17:41 < WolfAlex> eh ddnet logs my ip? :(
18:01 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: I think all tw servers log your IP address
18:01 <@heinrich5991> by default, and the master does not
18:02 < WolfAlex> they only print the ip to stdout
18:09 <@heinrich5991> ok, fair point. but I believe that most people simply capture that stdout and save it as log file
18:27 < Chairn> 36.18% ddnet client user ^^
18:27 < Chairn> hey EastByte
20:14 < Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/nimircbot
20:15 < Learath2> doesnt quite work nor compile yet
20:15 < Learath2> but wanted to put what I had on github
20:26 <@EastByte> deen: seems bad today
20:29 < Chairn> ger2 under attack...
20:29 < Chairn> cant move
20:57 < Nimda> Optimum by Knight :3 just released on Moderate at 2015-07-19 20:01
20:58 <@deen> laxadedi: not sure how to fix that css problem best
20:59 <@deen> WolfAlex: yes, ddnet logs ips for 48 hours
20:59 <@deen> and chat content and server events
20:59 <@deen> also all for 48 hours
21:00 <@deen> mostly to check when something went wrong
21:00 <@deen> Damn DDoS attacks at tournament today
21:01 <@deen> First GER got 3 separate attacks, then Deutsche Telekom decided to increase ping to 120 from 20
21:01 <@deen> Then GER2 and South Africa DDoS
21:02 < WolfAlex> deen: ah ok, thanks
21:05 < Learath2> deen: maybe we could ask some ddos prevention company to give us some protection cheap as we have a non profit project ?
21:05 <@deen> Learath2: i tried that already at maybe 5 companies
21:05 <@deen> they were not interested
21:05 <@deen> i also wrote to about 30 youtubers to make ddnet videos, they also weren't interested^^
21:06 < Learath2> weird :P
21:06 <@deen> Learath2: they usually cite prizes starting at 400 € / month for 1 location
21:06 <@deen> and that wouldn't even cover the huge attacks we sometimes get
21:07 < Learath2> holy what
21:07 <@deen> so i'm extremely happy with the current 30 € / month thing for GER
21:07 <@deen> they just shut down the server a single time
21:07 <@deen> and that was when the attack went over 100 gbit/s
21:08 < Learath2> any idea who is doing it ?
21:11 <@deen> yes
21:13 < Learath2> ask him nicely to stop ? :D
21:13 < eeeee> no :D
21:13 <@deen> when i do that the attacks come more often and stronger
21:13 <@deen> tried already
21:14 <@deen> my current course is just ignoring them
21:14 < Chairn> why is he ddosing ddnet?
21:14 < Learath2> maybe he just needs a hug
21:14 < eeeee> Learath2: those attention whores were trying to use ddos to get privileges like being allowed to cheat/block on servers
21:15 <@deen> Chairn: for fun, attention, bragging
21:15 < Chairn> isnt it punishable by law?
21:15 <@deen> and yes, they claim they will ddos people if they're not nice to them
21:15 < Learath2> sure it is what will you write on the police report ?
21:16 < Chairn> harassment
21:16 < Chairn> bullying
21:16 < Learath2> and who exactly should get punished ?
21:16 < Chairn> the one who does the attacks
21:16 < Chairn> and eventually, the one who ordered it
21:16 < Learath2> how will you connect them tho
21:17 < Chairn> ip
21:17 < eeeee> i imagine there could actually be a case with proof at this time, however the associated legal fees would be pretty high. we'd need another fundrasing :/
21:17 < Chairn> let the police do its job
21:17 < Learath2> the ip is hundreds of ips in a botnet
21:17 < Chairn> but police has the mean to track them down
21:17 <@deen> Chairn: i don't think you know the German police :P
21:17 < Chairn> or maybe they should have the mean...
21:18 < Chairn> deen: cant be worse than french one :D
21:18 <@deen> I'd be happy if they've heard of the "internet" and "servers"
21:18 < Learath2> take down the ddosser fundraiser :P
21:19 < Learath2> i really should stop writing stuff without trying to compile
21:19 < Chairn> deen: any new from our QuintessenZ map?
21:19 <@deen> Chairn: i only know what's written on the forum
21:20 < Chairn> ok
21:22 <@deen> But yeah, maybe I should go to the police about the attacks at some time
21:22 <@deen> but everything gets ddosed, very rarely is someone caught
21:22 < Learath2> do try
21:59 <@EastByte> eeeee: some guy wants to control me in tw spoofing my address
22:00 <@EastByte> we can clearly see that the tokenized protocol works
22:01 <@deen> EastByte: until he gets bored and ddoses you instead
22:06 <@EastByte> deen: he is a friendly guy and is testing it with us
22:08 <@EastByte> but sure, normally they would pay 5eur to kill my home link
22:12 < Learath2> EastByte: im finally done designing it now i just need to get it to compile :D
22:13 <@EastByte> :D
22:13 < Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/nimircbot
22:13 < Learath2> if you didnt see it
22:15 <@deen> cool
22:16 < Learath2> so it needs to compile and i need some kind of interplugin interface
22:18 <@deen> interplugin?
22:18 <@deen> and yes, code should compile :P
22:19 < Learath2> like x plugin can request an interface for y plugin its just to make stuff more flexible
22:19 < Learath2> like a mysql plugin which could provide and interface to mysql for other plugins
22:27 < Learath2> deen: any comments on what it looks like ? :D
22:31 <@deen> Learath2: looks clean, but lots of methods
22:35 < Learath2> methods are bad practice in nim ?
22:37 <@deen> dunno, i just don't use them
22:37 <@deen> because they have overhead
22:37 <@deen> you have to look up which method to call
22:37 <@deen> but if you don't need incredible performance, it's fine i guess
22:40 < Learath2> huh would it even work with normal procs ?
22:40 <@deen> not as you do it
22:40 <@deen> not sure, i just don't need methods usually
22:40 < Learath2> do give me any tips to improve anything really
22:41 <@EastByte> deen: it's a plugin system with interface
22:41 <@EastByte> using nim methods there is the best way I think
22:42 <@EastByte> otherwise you would need to use callbacks, same overhead
22:42 < Learath2> EastByte: while you are here any idea how i
22:42 < Learath2> can get an arbitrary call interface ?
22:42 <@EastByte> what's that?
22:43 < Learath2> hmm something like one plugin can request an interface to another and use its functions
22:43 < Learath2> but obv that cant be standartized
22:43 <@EastByte> why not?
22:43 < Learath2> well how would i know what functions any given plugin would expose?
22:44 <@EastByte> plugins can import each other I guess
22:45 < Learath2> oh that would work get a handle to it cast it then call any function you want
22:45 <@EastByte> yea...
22:49 <@EastByte> Learath2: we be nice to let the bot automatically update itself from github
22:49 <@EastByte> so we can just push a plugin to the repo
22:50 <@EastByte> and it will be automatically recompiled
22:50 < Learath2> could get a ci for it i guess
22:50 <@EastByte> ci?
22:50 <@EastByte> comand interface?
22:51 < Learath2> like some kind of buildbot to recompile it on github changes
22:51 < Learath2> continuous integration
22:51 < Learath2> bot cant quite compile itself if i dont also include the nim compiler with it
22:51 <@EastByte> we need to fully recomopile it thuogh
22:52 <@EastByte> nah a second program should da that
22:52 <@EastByte> do*
22:52 < Learath2> well the only way to avoid fully recompiling it is dynlibs i guess
22:52 <@EastByte> well we wanted to avoid that
22:52 <@EastByte> also maybe nim gets his own dyn module loading some day
22:53 <@EastByte> or something similiar
22:53 <@EastByte> I think it's possible natively
22:53 < Learath2> well with what it looks like right noe getting in some dynlib loading shouldnt be that hard
22:54 <@EastByte> could you repeat pls? :)
22:54 < Learath2> with how it looks like right now getting dynlib stuff in there should be easy
22:55 <@EastByte> well if nim does fine with that
22:55 <@EastByte> virtual calls
22:55 < Learath2> yeah not sure if nim would like it :D
22:56 <@EastByte> but you could try that :P
22:56 < Learath2> i sure will after i get my debian laptop/nim compiling slave back
22:56 <@EastByte> :)
22:57 <@EastByte> Learath2: we have openssl ssl/crypto statically linked in ddnet right?
22:58 <@EastByte> (depdendency of curl)
22:58 < Learath2> yep
22:58 <@EastByte> so we basically can use it
22:58 < Learath2> should be
22:59 <@EastByte> hm do you know which revision of openssl it is?
22:59 <@EastByte> headers are missing
22:59 < Learath2> should ask deen which version he statically links
22:59 <@EastByte> deen: which openssl version is in ddnet?
22:59 <@deen> on which system?
23:00 <@deen> but generally 0.9.8
23:00 <@deen> i don't know where the windows ones come from
23:00 <@deen> and I'm waiting for Learath2 to fix the dll updating anyway for that :P
23:00 < Learath2> me fix what ?
23:01 < Learath2> oh i have no idea how to fix that
23:01 < Learath2> should have just gotten a seperate updater
23:02 <@deen> well, you told me to wait with updating dlls until you fixed the updater to work with them
23:02 <@deen> and also with differentiating between win64 and win32 dlls
23:02 < Learath2> thought there was a way apparently the thing i saw had nothing to do with it
23:03 < Learath2> oh i know how we just need to replace them like the executables
23:10 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you had time to look at my patch already?
23:14 < Learath2> uhm does plugiface.nim(6, 43) Error: undeclared identifier: 'BotInterface' make any sense to you ?
23:15 <@EastByte> it's not global/extern
23:15 <@EastByte> type BotInterface = ref object of RootObj
23:15 <@EastByte> type BotInterface*
23:15 < Learath2> oh yep keep forgetting the star
23:15 <@EastByte> me too
23:21 < Learath2> aaaand a seq cannot hold inherited types
23:23 <@EastByte> can you show me?
23:23 < Learath2> EastByte: http://codepad.org/sM9wvpmC
23:24 <@EastByte> you need to convert SamplePlugin to PluginInterface
23:25 <@EastByte> but `ref SamplePlugin`, the ref shouldnt be there
23:25 <@EastByte> not sure where it comes from
23:26 <@deen> heinrich5991: not really, sorry.
23:26 < Learath2> i guess new returns a ref somewhy
23:27 <@EastByte> so what happens if you do PluginInterface(obj...)
23:27 < Learath2> replaced it with this bot.plugins.add(PluginInterface(new(SamplePlugin)[]))
23:28 <@EastByte> the [] shouldn't be there
23:28 <@EastByte> or is SamplePlugin a ref ref ? xd
23:29 < Learath2> well the [] makes the compiler happy
23:29 < Learath2> new(SamplePlugin) seems to return a ref SamplePlugin
23:30 <@EastByte> maybe because we have "ref object of RootObj", "ref object of PluginInterface"
23:30 < Learath2> nope sampleplugin is ref object of PluginInterface
23:30 <@EastByte> yes and PluginInterface also is ref
23:31 <@EastByte> you could try to remove ref from SamplePlugin in the type
23:31 <@EastByte> oh wait
23:31 <@EastByte> that's a bad idea
23:32 < Learath2> how bad ?
23:32 <@EastByte> nvm got something wrong, try it xd
23:32 <@EastByte> in my projects I had the interface without ref
23:33 < Learath2> doesnt quite work
23:34 < Learath2> sampleplugin.nim(7, 9) Error: 'this.botif' cannot be assigned to
23:37 <@EastByte> Learath2: no way to compile your repo :p
23:37 <@EastByte> so many typos
23:38 < Learath2> i compiled it 
23:38 < Learath2> EastByte: pushed it
23:38 <@EastByte> ...
23:38 < Learath2> compiles but not sure how it'll perform :D
23:39 < Learath2> i love meself some PAsycnIrc
23:39 <@EastByte> ...
23:41 < Learath2> im scared of running it
23:42 <@EastByte> I won't do that
23:42 <@EastByte> hm new(SamplePlugin)
23:42 < Learath2> HA SIGSEGV just as i expected
23:42 <@EastByte> var obj = SamplePlugin()
23:42 <@EastByte> ^ works
23:43 < Learath2> still SIGSEGVs tho
23:44 <@EastByte> nvm the sigsegvs xd
23:44 <@EastByte> the first problem is solved
23:44 < Learath2> well i dont have gdb on my windows so will have to wait until i can claim my laptop
23:44 <@EastByte> looks like new cannot be used like "new(typedesc)"
23:44 < Learath2> why not ?
23:44 <@EastByte> normally you do something like
23:44 <@EastByte> var obj: type
23:45 <@EastByte> new(obj)
23:45 <@EastByte> or var obj = type()
23:45 <@EastByte> but you are passing the type decriptor directly
23:45 <@EastByte> which seems to behave differently
23:45 < Learath2> well i read it would work fine in the manual i think
23:46 < Learath2> oh i also found something broken in nim
23:47 <@EastByte> looks at this:
23:47 <@EastByte> proc new(T: typedesc): ref T =
23:47 <@EastByte>   echo "allocating ", T.name
23:47 <@EastByte>   new(result)
23:47 <@EastByte> you are passing T, it returns ref T
23:47 <@EastByte> but T already is a reference
23:48 < Learath2> how is T already a referance in case of SamplePlugin ?
23:48 <@EastByte> type SamplePlugin* = ref object of PluginInterface
23:48 <@EastByte> see the prototype
23:49 <@EastByte> ref object
23:49 < Learath2> never quite understood that syntax either
23:49 <@EastByte> why not?
23:50 < Learath2> wasnt explained anywhere
23:50 < Learath2> i'd honestly expect it to be type Bla = object of RootObj
23:51 < Learath2> but everywhere on the tutorial its ref object of so i just took that
23:51 <@EastByte> pure object can be seen like a structure in C
23:51 <@EastByte> while ref is a reference to an object like a pointer in C
23:52 <@EastByte> the object needs to be created using new() first
23:52 <@EastByte> (ref object)
23:53 < Learath2> what does new return ?
23:54 < Learath2> oh i see
23:54 <@EastByte> var numRef: ref int
23:54 <@EastByte> numRef.new()
23:55 <@EastByte> no return value there :P
23:55 < Learath2> so is var num: int num.new() even valid ?
23:55 <@EastByte> yes, num is reference to a new object then
23:56 <@EastByte> why do I miss so many words in my phrases :(
23:56 <@EastByte> I guess I'm tired
23:56 < Learath2> num magically turns into a ref int ?
23:56 <@EastByte> oh wait, your example is different
23:56 <@EastByte> right it's not valid
23:57 < Learath2> makes sense now 
23:57 <@EastByte> :)
23:58 <@EastByte> when using `ref object` you can always use the type name a constructor
23:59 <@EastByte> so instead of `new`:   var obj = TypeName()
23:59 < Learath2> oh it didnt crash
23:59 < Learath2> crashed right after it joined my channel :D
23:59 <@EastByte> :>
23:59 < Learath2> but it managed to join my channel so thats nice :D
