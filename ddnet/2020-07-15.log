01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bubbacio> developer apply is open?
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cyw> hey
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cyw> is there a way to move my points from an account to an other?
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> Used to require 3k+ points and for you to contact an admin, but I don't know if it changed or not.
02:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cyw> could 8 years+ of playtime exchange 3k+ points? :lol:
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yes if you average around 1.027 points per day
02:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @Learath2 These msgs on the top right when you kill is not seeable for 0.7
06:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Marius should they be visible? They are hidden by a gameinfo flag
10:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @bubbacio no need to apply as developer, you can just develop and if it makes sense we'll accept your PRs
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Never looked into the code, but would it be possible/easy enough to change the numbers of the teleporters in the entities to colored circles, so it doesn't annoy you while playing, but still gives you the information, if there are different teleporters
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @Learath2 https://i.imgur.com/P2z8TA8.png
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Its just visible when you use the ddnet client, if you use any 0.7 you can't see it
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> Why would you want to see the deaths in a race gametype?
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Why would you not?
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its trivial to enable
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> This place is meant for showing the finish messages in 0.7 race support. You can still also show the deaths there. I just don't see the reason why you would care about other players deaths in ddrace
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> Just useless info
13:51 <+ChillerDragon> @maggi323 so each number is a different color? Guess the difficutly depends on how you do it. You can use distinc numbers only for the currently visible teleporters or a fixed color based on number which could be ahrd to differentiate
13:51 <+ChillerDragon> like how many different colors can you find for 60+ teleporters
13:52 <+ChillerDragon> @redix whent its a gamemode where tee collision/interaction is on like ddrace this information is valuable
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Yes, i thought about repeating the pattern after like 10 colors, because most times there are just 2 teleporters, one to get you to the beginning of the part, and one to the next, if they are different for player and dragged person, it would be 4 which still if they are continuous, would work too
13:53 <+ChillerDragon> most common use case is to check if your teammate killed and you do not have to go back @redix or if someone used /spec or kill
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> I have another opinion on that but okay... I think you are the reason why I added this flag at all @ChillerDragon :D
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> yea repeting pattern is a good idea @maggi323
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> appreciate it @redix
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, not going back for teammates that killed sounds like a good reason
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> its a gores thing
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm glad you left it a flag @redix, usually vanilla likes to decide these for us
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> or like most useful at gores spawn but can also be useful in ddr i guess
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 because ppl stay in 0.6 and do not complain about 0.7 changes because they stay unnoticed
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> did i mention already that updating to 0.7 could be a good idea?
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> I tried to make it at flexible as possible so everybody can use it :D
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> Oy also wanted to remove the precision thing
13:56 <+ChillerDragon> when fix democutting @redix? :D
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> Not sure... within the next month hopefully :D
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> o.O thats exicitng news
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> ill come back to that in 2 months :p
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> no pressure
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> üëç
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> dfq
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> emojy in my terminal
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> wtf?!
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594814277.png
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> since when
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: it is a good idea, hire us some developers
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> devs so expensive
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> what is a good idea updating?
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> ah no need for devs just use fclient and ddnet7 all done already
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> or fix skins on ddnet6 and thats also working
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> how much money do you need to fix skins @Learath2?
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not half assedly upgrading just because you are a 0.7 cultist
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> "0.7 cultist" sounds cool
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> might become my new github bio
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> i guess here is where the tele text is getting rendered
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/732934924910329966/tele_render.PNG
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> ye just add CircleRender()->(aColors[Index % 10]); and ur done ;D
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> ```Graphics()->SetColor(); RenderTools()->DrawRoundRect();``` actually could do tje job
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> you can hack ur rect round as a circle idk if there is a actual circle renderer
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> there would be a draw circle function
14:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> idk if i even wanna have a circle, but something inside the tele instead of the numbers
15:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> okay, in DrawRoundRect, you put in x,y,w,h,r...if w and h are width and height, what is r?
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> @maggi323 the rounding crank that up and u get ur circle :D
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the radius
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Hmm i tried to change the text to a circle in render_map.cpp, so i could test it in the editor, but with DrawRoundRect it crashes...
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> last two lines are mine, the 3 before were the text render before
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/732980816204005416/unknown.png
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Ok nvm, i needed Graphics()->QuadsBegin() and End
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Ok nvm, i think i needed Graphics()->QuadsBegin() and End
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bubbacio> @deen ohh thanks !
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Well, got it working with a star text instead of a circle, but i still think if done right, this could be an option instead of the tele numbers (with maybe an command to change between them)
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/733023552240091166/Teeworlds_COlored_Tele.jpeg
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Well, got it working with a star text instead of a circle, but i still think if done right, this could be an option instead of the tele numbers (with maybe a command to change between them)
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/733023552240091166/Teeworlds_COlored_Tele.jpeg
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Well okay, for ddrace with cp tele there is no need, but maps like solo mietzcore where every tele has the number on it üòÑ
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure if this is better. Maybe because i am partly colour blind.
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> The idea was, that it's just one big circle of color instead of numbers that are thin lines, which when playing is annoying, but i guess it's a rare case where you would need this anyways
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Problem is that I didn't get it working the way i wanted yet
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> too many teles next to eachother will get very confusing
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think it would be really cool to have teles grouped into pairs so a number isnt on every block but rather every few blocks
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> also the tele entities look really ugly
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> ye, group of tiles with some color will be better than just stars
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <maggi323> Would be hard to implement, and idk if that would look so good, also stars weren't the idea anyway üòÑ
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> hm idk how does it work but maybe when the player joins and gets map, client will make his "own" map with using algorythm like mapres rules
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @louis that sounds actually pretty nice:poggers:
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> twitter broken
