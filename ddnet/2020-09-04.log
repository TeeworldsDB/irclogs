00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i'll port this to ddn rn
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Github costing monies now :justatest:
10:56 <+pastaaa> ist Kevin da?
10:59 <+Learath2> I'm sure there is atleast one Kevin around
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> > Github costing monies now :justatest:
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti  whut?
12:00 <+ChillerDragon> yea wdym @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti what costs?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> chillerdragon someone on fng keeps faking u
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 could you please check https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2675?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen it takes the 2k we use for binds and quadruples it
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually 16k -> 64k
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are okay with that for a seldom used feature, it just needs testing
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, seems like a bit much
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but at least we should tell the guy how he can proceed
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is I'm not sure, I'd do some research at that point
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are better at this theoretical stuff than me. I would probably consider a flat vector of all binds we can linearly search through, a way to sort it so we can do binary search
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or since the last key always triggers the bind, maybe an array that we can index into which contains a list/vector of binds that end with this key?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds complicated. Does it have such a big performance impact?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How about having all binds in a vector and just checking them one by one? ðŸ˜„
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah that's the first one I proposed
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds more complicated and less performant than the 64KB
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly don't know it's impact without testing but it's something that's definitely on the hot path, not sure if an O(n) worst case lookup is acceptable for us there
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also average case
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (but our n is fairly low, maybe we don't even notice it)
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, maybe the O(1) lookup is worth the extra 48k and the feature would be nice to have
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, then let's stay with the 64 KB
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we load all skins into memory, that has a way larger impact I guess
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or the map data, uncompressed
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll give it a test
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 any opinion on getting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2720 in? I'd really like to release today because of some fixes
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the last screenshot looks fine
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, I'd already looked at that and liked it, forgot to merge it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck ^^ that should do it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> oh hey
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heyo
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i woke up late
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Help, how to specify different syntax for sqlite than for mysql?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's "INSERT OR IGNORE" in sqlite, but "INSERT IGNORE" in mysql
16:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Currently I handled all cases by writing a function like `const char *GetInsertIgnore() const` and MySQL would return "INSERT OR IGNORE" and SQLite would return "INSERT IGNORE".
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how does your skin patch handle people joining?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 loads the skin, try it out ðŸ˜„
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see how it adds a task to start the download, but Find only gets called once per tee joining/already ingame
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> first they are shown with default
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it gets called more often
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It actually does, huh how inefficient
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `m_aSkins` is a sorted array and we are doing a linear search on it, every tick, for every tee ðŸ˜„
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please optimize ðŸ˜„
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see why, matricks' tl is actually really quite weak
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> there is no unpause button
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Join Game should work on current DDNet version
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not on old servers
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> ah ok i am on kog right now
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tell them to update
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :poggers:
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> KoG is missing a lot of the extended functionality from newer ddnet
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont even have the ddnet network character
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :cammostripes:
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's the problem here
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do we have a version check in the client? (and do we want to use this?)
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or should we just not show the pause button when server sent no ddnet character
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not show it i guess
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> KoG is based on DDNet 9
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lmfao
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> because DDNet built a lot of trash like the new hammer
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Would be the worst thing in gores
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol no
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lol yes
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be good for them
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its deterministic
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u remove randomness
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also its not just additions u see like hammer
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has lot of background improvements
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> First if all its not random
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ddnet character helps with prediction
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Second u dont want freezed people hammer u when u hammer them
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Definitely not
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> In gores
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the player can choose that
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by pressing or not pressing hammer
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> players are dumb
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that is a retarded take
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> new hammer is retarded, gores people would flame qdash to the hell
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to argue with someone who thinks old ht is better than new ht
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like antimaskers
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can we not? You don't like anything new Konsti, we already got that
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> im just Saying new hammer would be a mess for KoG
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And if u deny that rly
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> im a antimasker :justatest:
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª "MY GAME IS BROKEN. EVERYWHERE IS RAINBOW." sounds like someone has graphics problems again
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but rainbow = broken assets
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> normally
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or missing data file
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah thats what i mean xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, he left again, not sure what the problem way
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> was*
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe we can add a mini chat responder
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if someone says game is broken
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> send discord link
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> nice update :D
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751456006973816872/Untitled.png
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 what changed?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> you can just go trashmap and make a random map name
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> then it shows on steam
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the map name
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who added that there?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought we only got the steam name thing
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751456479311036486/unknown.png

17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, rich presence is there too, nice
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> whats new at entities?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Slayer some small fixes because they are rendered differently
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Slayer> thanks
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 it should say Playing -mapname- tbh
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill check it
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751457167571419197/Untitled.png
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> why was this changed D:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u mean
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> tries to connect dummy
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> accidental disconnect
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think they're big enough not to misclick
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean if you misclick that are you sure DDNet is the right game for you? ðŸ˜„
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> good aim for noobs, use binds if you are pro
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And since it was on the left newcomers always clicked Connect Dummy because they could find no other way to restart game
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ps: spectate button width seems broken
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ps: spectate button width SEEMS broken
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> at the right 3 large buttons, at the left 2 small buttons and 1 large
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you are killing perfectionist in me
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: No way to get the failed INSERTS from logs now, right?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need the space
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay Hm, could make it large size if space permits and only small for 5:4? But I thought same size is better because then translators instantly notice that their text won't fit
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen inserts shouldn't(tm) fail, no?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should go to the sqlite db if they "failed"
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 the sqlite insert syntax was wrong and no one noticed for a week
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in sqlite it's INSERT OR IGNORE, not INSERT IGNORE
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> hope DDNet will you use adaptive UI one day, but its another story
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> DDNet7 is testable?  I was thinking about packaging it to Arch, but I notice that the standard DDNet Client can't see DDNet7's servers, and DDNet7 is "Server only" according to the message the repository's description.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> `You have to be on the 'GER' server to load this savegame` :justatest:
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Is DDNet7 testable?  I was thinking about packaging it to Arch, but I notice that the standard DDNet Client can't see DDNet7's servers, and DDNet7 is "Server only" according to the message the repository's description.
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF DDNet7 is not really maintained anymore I think. Regular DDNet now supports 0.7 clients
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we don't run it anymore, had no changes in DDNet7 either
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 fast map download in 0.7 works well, thanks
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that actually annoyed me today when testing somethintg
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> can you port savegames outside of the game somehow
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> saves are saved serverside obviously
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise u could edit them and put urself at finish
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NeXus to run them on your own server or why?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> there is no ger server anymore
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> GER6 replaced GER
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so the saves work there
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah good to know
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me actually rename it from GER6 to GER1 so that this isn't so confusing
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> noo
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could reach GER10
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> or rename it in the load message
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @deen Download page still points to DDNet7. Should it be removed?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NeXus also, empty servers don't require server name to match anymore, so you can load anywhere
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Ryozuki it could make sense if they are big and replication is expensive. CRC(or other idk) check should be enough if so
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nononononono bad bad idea to rely on crc for that ðŸ˜„
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A cryptographic hash could be acceptable, but what's the point anyway
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rather than that i would first change how saves are serialized, relying on %d\\t x100 is rly ugly
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it could be helpful while testing
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> what the size of such saves ?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/save.cpp#L226
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think size matters much also text can be compressed easily
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't compress them though
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why the saves aren't json yet tho
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why json
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be so much easier to manipulate
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It parses rather quick aswell
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Better than `%d\t` ðŸ˜„
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why you want a save be easily manipulated
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would rather use a format that uses less space
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> binary tho
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and is more machine friendly
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> zipped binary
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> to me its weird to store them as string
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_binary_encoding
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki Not like we are tight on space though, might aswell have it easily readable
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only admins see the save
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u never modify them
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We occasionally need to manipulate them, it'd atleast make that easier
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u saying
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cheated
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :justatest:
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/servo/bincode
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make a rust program
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A couple occasions of stolen saves, a couple occasions of servers crashing as soon as the save is loaded
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to manipulate them
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> what if you want to tell someone what their save is
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is not it better to make a tool to convert saved save into json instead of wasting disk space for readability?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A binary format would also make searching for someones saves painful as shit
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get what is your obsession with disk space, it's like 10-20 extra bytes per save
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok just use csv
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why should we care
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about anything
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well the metadata could stay in database for search and so, but I can not see much usecases for whole data being "readable" all the time
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> csv would work too
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay metadata being extracted from the saves is even more unnecessary work
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and it's duplication of data, another thing to go out of sync with the actual save
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it's a matter of implementation
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it's a matter of implementation (you can store only data not stored in db fields as binary. I am not familiar with current implementation)
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen  is the abuse of changing map names on a test server gonna be fixed?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what abuse?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Everyone can run their own server, Steam will show the map name you choose for your server
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Can steam ban for this? Should not we show map name for players being on oficial DDNet servers?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> like ban for setting status "BannZay playing on asshole" or so
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª uhm, you seem to have broken something with gl3.3 :/
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dejavu xD
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on macOS atleast
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> non 3.3 works or what?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> non 3.3 works just fine
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 3.3 doesnt load or looks buggy or what?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> abc 3.3
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3.3 uses the same implementation for tile rendering as the other version now

17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 62 fps
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> "it says diusable on macos xD" - can we detect os and just disable it and not show ?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it probs even is
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> disabled default xd
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean hide it in settings and dont let to set
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> users are dumb you know
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there are also new MacOS
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not all will be broken
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sooooooooo, how are we debugging this?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> renderdoc
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh no macos
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, you know
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> macos.. xd
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hate working for gpus xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, man. The same on windows
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What were you going to look at in renderdoc?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even windows?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then maybe bcs of multi textures?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> off
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i gonna look into the code
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751470806940385460/unknown.png
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah let me see, never disabled it tbh xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and changed alot of code to be downward compatible to gl 2.1
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar âœª  it fixable as before by enabling Multiple texture unit (for windows)
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ty will look into it, cant be that hard to fix
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok found it
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen also when you leave a map on steam it still shows you are on that map
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> multiple texture units makes it work on macOS too btw
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just as long as you are okay with 10fps
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what are ur fps without
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @TearlessAbyss46 found a bug with map info on steam ^
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually the multiple texture units was a try to remove API calls, but appearently some drivers implement them as software rendering to allow more units
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pretty stupid xd
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I get 62, but I cap it at 62 or it stutters AND turns my computer into a toaster
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 nice, cold winters can come
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª that fixes it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice ty for testing
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think the hotfix doesnt hurry bcs its gl 3.3 only
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe wait for skin fethcer or stuff like that
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nah, skin fetcher should be a big release
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isnt 14.6.1 big release? xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its 1 more than 14.6
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :star15disappointed:
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok valgrinded didnt show anything, hope its fine now
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> tbh i think changing `str_copy` straight up might just works for everything. but i'm a coward.
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> well not actually DoEditBox doesn't use str_copy at all lol
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why dont we save `cl_overlay_entities` btw?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs nobody who uses entities would turn it on probably xd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why dont we save `cl_overlay_entities` btw?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs nobody who uses entities would turn it of probably xd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why dont we save `cl_overlay_entities` btw?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs nobody who uses entities would turn it off probably xd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I find it strange as well but I added it to autoexec instead of fixing in code. no idea why
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we should really remove that C90 requirement xD
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2157
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :EeveeShy:
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > bcs nobody who uses entities would turn it off probably xd
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar âœª but how have you tuned it on, lol ?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen didn't you release 14.6.1?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I got yelled at by C90 just now
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > bcs nobody who uses entities would turn it off probably xd
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar âœª but how have you tuned it on, lol ? Can we do it, please, can we save them?

19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> add `|CFGFLAG_SAVE`
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @BannZay if you convince the ppl that were holding it back yet, it'd be easy fix
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but probs someone said its bad, and now they wont add it xd
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there was another setting that is saved if you are using `cl_overlay_entites 100`
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, I guess that died with ddrace client
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont use ddnet long enough probs to know ðŸ˜„
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClShowEntities, cl_show_entities, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_CLIENT, "Cheat to show game tiles")` 
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> XDD
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs it was a cheat xD
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am about to hate people saying its a cheat to such things
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> in fact ANY improvement is a cheat
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This was alll the way back in ddrace times ðŸ˜„
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was 10 years ago, that commit
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just finished a map
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> . /teamrank
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not showing
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 not yet, I went outside a bit
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hi
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751495854749122630/unknown.png
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @mind that looks like a broken update :/
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That looks verybroken
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we only removed the ca-ddnet.pem file *after* updating to the DDNet.exe that doesn't required
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I guess the DDNet.exe failed to get overwritten. Just download a new version I guess
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Ok, thx for fast response
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the autoupdater is kind of broken recently
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure why
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Next time we should make sure the autoupdater gets the ddnet folder exactly into the state we want
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can we have overload for a str_format with return value char[] ? Many times we use buffer just for calling str_format
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean is it possible in c++ ?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay system.c is written in C, not C++
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2157
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the best closed pr
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> from deen
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think str_format can return a char[] even if it was C++, you can't return arrays in C++ either
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> how does char z[] = "123" work? The link would be enough
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> compiler knows the length of "123"
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> then it'll just do char z[4]
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> probably can't use a variable length string other than manually calloc
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but that way you'll need to free that afterwards.
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What you are looking for would be something akin to `std::string` which sadly comes with a lot of heap allocation
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> stack is fast but I am worried about that amount of work processor does on each update. Like calling str_format N thouthands times per each Render tick
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but thats bcs nothing in the client is not streamed xD
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so much stuff could be buffered
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I noticed something interesting. The way we have the borders actually inside the tiles means we always get the odd effect of tile borders being doubled up on the inside edges
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did mappers design around this for so long? I never really noticed it in almost any map
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is this borderfix tool
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and alot of maps actually use vanilla resources
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does borderfix handle it?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this guy in #general
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> says he joins a server
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then the game crashes
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any idea?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Learath2  it will shrink down your image and than add a 2px border around each tile
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is that even supposed to help with the issue I mentioned ðŸ˜„
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki not really he can test gfx_opengl_major 1
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but has to restart
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> before he joins xD else config not saved
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2011 pc
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he says
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I mean this
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751505601875673108/unknown.png
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does borderfix really help with that? I don't think so
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not for squares.. except its exactly 2 pxs(the border)
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª doesnt work
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imagine it like this:
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u have bad resolution and the old renderer calculates the texel offset for a higher mipmap(and even wrongly)(but bad resolution = small mipmap)
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> => mipmap has to be fixed, by fixing the original image, else inconsistent in the border
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki then he has a really broken GPU or its not realted to anything GPU side, maybe update GPU driver
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if opengl 1.x fails its probs not tw
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I guess we need to see logs then
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can get him to create logs. I find that rather difficult
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª he says it worked fine yesterday
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this update broke it for him
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe he can try an older version again
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats strange, but the GL 1.x really doesnt use anything new
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it even removes stuff that could break
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 appearently he already tried 1.x
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe it's not the gfx change but another change we have in 14.6?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah maybe
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its weird
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it crashes when he joins a server
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not in menus
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might have to do with the new tile rendering tbh
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe the skin finder?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh maybe
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it included?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no new tile renderer in GL 1.x
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 100% the old one
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, the skin fetcher didn't make it yet
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just the linear search is gone
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh did that make it in? :d
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think in 16.5.1 it is for sure, isnt it?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It works just fine for me though and I don't see it crashing anything either
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 14*
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i dunno, but that'd be something that is new and ingame ðŸ˜„
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª btw, what happens now that we have correct rendering for the entire tile on all renderers?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now ravie and other mappers are happy xxd
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs u can now do pixel perfect mapping
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ravie complained
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (almost pixel perfect)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its blurry i htink
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly cant fix the blurryness?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its just blurry compared to old gl 3.3
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not compared old renderer is it?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and all the maps with borderfixed tilesets will have a little thicker borders?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as said, you can fix the texture LOD in the shader if u want xd
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u expect to much
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from users
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 yes, but all that use vanilla tile sets can be fixed
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, what causes the blurriness anyway?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> by fixing the resource in the data
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 in OpenGL spec the LOD(mipmap level) is well defined, but drivers are free to choose the mipmap(most probs use some 3D algortihm, that makes in blurrier for 2D)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and the old GL 3.3 used the one from opengl 3.3 spec
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the advantage of not choosing it manually is saving API calls and modifying state changes
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How can LOD be well defined but not well defined at the same time? wtf ðŸ˜„
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and since 2D arrays dont require the LOD, it didnt do it
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 bcs in 3d u wont notice ðŸ˜„
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its better to use an efficient algorithm
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs sampling is ofc expensive
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How much of an overhead is choosing it manually?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not alot for teeworlds
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in a 3d game it'd be more for sure
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the previous version
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but not this one
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> amazing
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the crash is when joining a server
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what broke it
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki are u sure he restarted after using 1.x?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made sure 2 times
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he didnt lie 2 times then ye
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the context isnt created on fly xD
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then its not the renderer i guess(except some buffer overflow valgrind didnt find)
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what is crashing? how to repro?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki which OS is he on?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think it's just, join game, crash
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows 10 64bit
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pc from 2011
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im asking what cpu and gpu
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I'm not really very familiar with how we do the rendering nowadays, do we even need/generate mipmaps? Isn't there usually a max LOD which we should be at when we are all the way up close?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec33.core.pdf

20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it'd be nice if we can get the log

20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is not a bug
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its bcs without mipmaps zooming out far enough samples the texture so precice that it looks likek a bigger texture
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki version from steam?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol wtf? ðŸ˜„
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen latest probs, i told him to download  14.5.1 and it worked
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant execute the game without updating in steam so
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay but I don't get why we aren't at max LOD when we are fairly close like this, there should be no scaling at all thus no blurriness?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the nice things about mipmaps is that it creates less aritfacts
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> linear interpolation is much worse than cubic
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and mipmaps are probs cubic
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah mipmaps are fine, I just don't get why we get any blurriness at all up close
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> The resolution of the screen is probably closer to the first mipmap level
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> One could also use interpolation between the two mipmap levels. Might look sharper
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds extra unsharp
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Câ™­
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Nope, usually looks better
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does opengl decide which mipmap level we are at?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean us being in level 0 when 10 tiles fill the screen isn't quite useful
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª

20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he sees this
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on 14.5.1
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the weapon
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xDDD
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being a graphics programmer sure it tough
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> missing game.png? xD
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> If someone wants to test it: the tiles might look sharper if one replaces all occurrences of `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` with `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` in `backend_sdl.cpp`
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> or wrong resolution of game.png
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is interpolation supposed to look sharper than anything is beyond me... I hate what computer graphics has become
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An API disconnected from hardware, drivers that implement the API so loosely it's impossible to get consistent results
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Most screens have a lower resolution than the tiles, so OpenGL needs to scale it anyway.
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Mipmaps just use the lower res images that were created with a better scaling algorithm
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Gpus from different vendors implement certain thing in very different ways, so it's hard to design an API that works for all of them. With Vulkan there are even some issues because the API does not map very well to some mobile graphics chips
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually at default zoom and for quite a bit atleast at 1080p we seem to be in LOD0 as I'd expect
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its more about image quality ðŸ˜„
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the zoom level `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` even would start to make a difference tiles are already too small for my eyes to detect the difference
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah its hard to notice, tried it too, but depends really alot on resolution etc
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt resolution matters much the way you calculate the LOD
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it does alot actually, bcs the screen of teeworlds is always same size
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so less pixels are rendered
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even at the smallest resolution when tiles are waaay too small to begin with, it's firmly in LOD0 for like 6 zoom levels
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i see the diff on 2k screen when zooming like 4 steps or smth already
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it clearly chooses a different mipmap then
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could be the stupid retina screen messing with it
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but didnt test with current version, let me give it a try
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the fact that the window is actually small and not stretched in macOS
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't have stretched fullscreen apps in macOS
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> already at 2nd zoom step
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses different mipmap now
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751518029245972530/screenshot_2020-09-04_21-03-40.png

21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the kill tiles suddenly look shit af
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but didnt profile to check for correctness, just feeling rn
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki so what did i miss
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that the old or new version
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if even that is buggy
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new crashes
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he really needs to update his driver
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'm not going to add software renderer xDDDDD
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant expect to play games with a potato
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from last century
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean GL 1.x is litterally from last century xD
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1.2.1    14. Oct. 1998
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> how hard it is to port this game on android ?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> to be able to spectate
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, you need to add OpenGL es support, that isnt too hard probs
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and some libs
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but generally its not hardest, just annoying
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you have a modern phone, the opengl 3.3 support should even work with android
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> opengl es 3.0
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> The draw call count might cause issues. Mobile chips often can't really handle more than 100 per frame. Today the game easily exceeds 200
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> modern phone are better than that above guys PC XD
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, I guess I'm not qualified to comment on this with my current gl knowledge. Tilesets looking blurry at the default zoom is just confusing to me
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and IMHO shouldn't happen
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Still they have some limits that dedicated gpus don't have. Modern engines just handle things differently
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice @mind
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hoped for that one ðŸ˜„
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, but really modern phones aren't really bad anymore
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> True
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are we planning to port SDL2 DDNet to android again? ðŸ˜„
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would be nice to have a watch + chat mode
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if we wouldnt need to fix so much gui stuff, we could do it
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the code base gets really ugly xD
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet my 5 years old mobile phone can handle with gl 3.3 with atleast 30fps xD
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (or better GL 3.0 es, basically the same)
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess I'll have to learn gl myself
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> GL is just about vertices xd
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u have to feel it
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> look around your room and see vertices
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª just get rid of the gui? Only need server browser and then ingame
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen sure would be nice too
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does somebody have the SVG for the original tilesets btw?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be cool to test 4k versions
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Not public
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask in tw discord, I think zatline has them
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, that's sad to hear for an open source game
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's commission replacements?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean why would they care
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> recreating them in inkscape isnt really hard
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just annoying work xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Android version could evolve into something bigger then just spectator. Some  simple maps might be finished using android inputs. There is only 4 buttons and aim thing to finish map. Check out something like brawl stars.
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but is it fun? xd
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> if it is not so laggy I believe so
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Attach it to a screen and play with Bluetooth keyboard or a controller ðŸ˜…
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I cannot do it being at work :(
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Or outside... you got the idea
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> bug, after apply "cl_text_entities_size 40"
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751528087107272764/unknown.png
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Matodor should be fixed in 14.6.1. are you on that. Otherwise @Jupstar âœª ^
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think instead of Kill and Pause the new buttons should say something more descriptive like Restart and Watch
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes should be fixed
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> thx ðŸ˜Ž
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki btw i just read the msg again, 14.5.1, so that means he has a opengl 1.x card, bcs 2.x card normally support mipmapping, and since his fails its probs just that it should fallback in the current version.
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> So gfx_opengl_major 1 => restart should actually fix it WTF,
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and learaths binary search isnt in yet, so he was 2 times lieing probably xD
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can he speak english?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a wasted effort
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> idc, i want it fixed for everyone
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else they cant play teeworlds
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> :tear:
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just found out the proof circle in editor is off by quite a bit
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751555506614829176/proof.png
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, that looks like it should be totally centered in the editor.cpp
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And DrawCircle looks correct too
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we don't put the tee in the middle?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean we could just manually move the circle up a bit until it about fits, but that's still weird
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> it looks centered on the red squares
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen the "circle" part of your tee is not exactly centered, it's a bit higher
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie could you send me the map?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm horrible at mapping ðŸ˜„
23:48 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> > Zwelf: No way to get the failed INSERTS from logs now, right?
23:48 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> no not really, you can grep for "save score failed for all servers" and "save team score failed for all servers" to count all lost ranks, and the finish time should be printed some lines above those.
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, counted > 200 since yesterday, so no chance
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/751559300056612874/proof_circle.map
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's also weird that sql connection fails for all servers, no matter where they're located
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> our network connection can't be that bad, can it?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe the tcp connection is missing a keepalive?
23:49 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Are some logs lost as well?
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, we rotate logs every day
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so no logs before then
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So did we lose 200 ranks? :/
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, > 1000 probably
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we've been running this version for a while
23:51 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> If the database connection fails due to no activity for some time, it tries to connect again.
23:52 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> I guess, Only a teehistorian parser could bring those ranks back.
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well is it fixed now?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teehistorian sadly doesn't save finishes, so not just a parser but a way to actually play them back would be needed
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on restarted servers it should be fixed
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The connection failing is interesting too now that ddnet.tw pretty much is never overloaded/ddosd
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like it's common that major data centers have no routes left between them either
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> uh, the new update has overwritten old entities which I spent 2 hours on customizing it
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and I didnt back it up
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> am I fucked?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I think you are
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> rip murpi
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> hi sheep
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :wowcry:
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a NTFS file recovery thing can try to salvage it, but it's very very likely that it used the exact same physical disk space while updating
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi sorry :/
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your custom files go inside the config directory :/
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really should make that more clear ðŸ˜¦
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or we could ask people before overwriting their customized files?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we have the hashes of each file, we can check while updating
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't know that the files are customized, atleast not as it is right now
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So let's store hashes of everything in data
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This happened every time we updated entities
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so we move from update6 to update7 and include an old_hash key for each file?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If old hash doesn't match we ask for a warning
