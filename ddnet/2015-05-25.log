14:54 <@deen> Spyker: i don't know why but your videos always look laggy
14:54 <@deen> it's like each frame is a mixture of the last 2 frames
14:54 <@deen> of 2 frames*
14:54 <@deen> pause the video to see i
14:55 <@deen> it clearly
14:55 < Spyker> i record with 200 fps and edit with 30 cuz youtube max is 30
14:55 < Spyker> you can upload 60 fps video too but too long for upload
14:55 <@deen> hm, that's probably the problem. why you record at 30 fps?
14:55 <@deen> at 200*
14:55 <@deen> and why not at 30 directly?
14:55 <@EastByte> Spyker: you shouldn't care about upload time ;)
14:55 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/
14:56 < Spyker> because if i record with 30 i cant do slowmotion
14:56 <@deen> look at the screenshot here
14:56 <@deen> it looks terrible
14:56 < Spyker> ahah wait i ll change it
14:56 <@deen> yeah, but the whole video looks like that =/
14:56 <@deen> i guess most people don't notice, but i find it annoying
14:57 < Spyker> deen on my pc when i see video before upload it is perfect, after upload it is laggy, i know this too... i think i should upload in mp4 and not in wmw
14:57 <@deen> yes, definitely not in wmv
14:58 <@deen> maybe you can experiment a bit with a short video of a few seconds
14:58 <@deen> and find out what looks best on YT
14:58 < Spyker> but the video was edited like 1 month ago, new videos will be mp4
14:58 <@EastByte> Spyker: check whether you can choose the h264 codec
14:58 < Spyker> i usually wait near 700 views to upload new video
14:59 <@deen> i always upload lossless h264 videos if i upload to yt
14:59 <@deen> takes forever, but oh well
15:01 < Spyker> i will upload next video when this video is around 500 views, in .mp4
15:01 < Spyker> maybe we ll have better quality!
15:02 <@deen> maybe try to make a 5 second video and try a few things with uploading, like wmv, mp4, h264, 60fps
15:03 < Spyker> ye, but not now, im not with my home internet 
15:03 < Spyker> in this days ofc
15:03 < Spyker> i changed the image of video
15:04 < Spyker> it look ugly as well ahah, just wait, next videos will be with better quality i think!!
15:25 <@heinrich5991> deen: shouldn't it be possible to avoid mixing two frames, even with 200fps?
15:25 <@heinrich5991> just tell the software to not interpolate frames
15:27 <@EastByte> the youtube encoder might do the interpolation aswell
15:27 <@heinrich5991> then figure out youtube's framerate mb
15:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: no idea
15:40 < Spyker> guys i have to go home! when i go back home i return! see ya!

20:14 < Spyker> deen, from 0 to 100 is bugged as a shit at end... i lost 30 min of race for last switch
20:58 <@EastByte> speaking of mods, why do players often think I'm a ddnet mod?
20:58 <@EastByte> was the fourth time now
21:01 <@deen> no idea
21:01 <@deen> they also think o_be_one is the founder of ddnet
21:06 < o_be_one> lol really ? x)
21:07 < o_be_one> its just cause of V3R, cause i was the previous main host since 2 years :/
