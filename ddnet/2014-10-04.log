00:02 <@deen> no
00:03 < o_be_one> ok if you have players on your ddnet blmapV3ROYAL its just cause of his stupid script whos crashing my players
00:03 < o_be_one> i'll be not surprised if he ddos directly you dedi ...
00:04 < o_be_one> vali and nazar, care !
00:04 <@deen> yeah, i noticed our FRA blocker servers getting fuller right before ddos attacks
00:04 < o_be_one> yes its a game for vali
00:04 < o_be_one> he was away for a moment but now his back.
00:05 <@deen> i think we have protection for this
00:05 <@deen> in ddnet servers
00:05 <@deen> i had these attacks quite often before
00:05 < o_be_one> your ddnet bin has no more this issue yes
00:05 < o_be_one> but about ddos im not sure ...
00:05 <@deen> ^^
00:05 <@deen> yeah, we go down with every ddos attack
00:07 <@deen> talking to vali, he says nazar is ddosing us
00:08 < o_be_one> lol he will always say its nazar (and its true, nazar pays booter for that), but vali is a real bitch, take care
00:08 <@deen> no problem, thanks
00:08 < o_be_one> trust me, he will try to be friendly with you to begin and will do best efforts to break all your work in your back.
00:09 < o_be_one> since 1 year or more with XXLTomate with work to fight these stupid exploit but now XXLTomate is too busy to fix issues :/
00:10 < o_be_one> i like ddnet but it really needs more "fun" features for blocker players ...
00:12 < laxa> block is shit map, deal with it
00:12 < laxa> simple gameplay
00:12 < laxa> boring as fuck
00:12 < laxa> you don't need anything for it
00:12 < laxa> and nazar came on the teamspeak to speak with me
00:12 < laxa> I don't know why, and what he wanted
00:13 < o_be_one> i love blockers gameplay laxa 
00:13 < o_be_one> you cant like all gameplay, its normal
00:13 < o_be_one> but you cant say "its shit" cause you dont like it
00:13 < o_be_one> i waste all my time on this "shit" ^^ im a fan ... But fairplay player.
00:14 < o_be_one> nazar just wants to be sure he will not get banned or he will be able to ask for deban ... 
00:14 < laxa> no one can get perm banned
00:14 < laxa> I don't understand what you mean
00:15 < o_be_one> ahah you need more experience about some blocker players ^^
00:40 <@deen> vali: what do you want?
00:40 < vali> nothing
00:40 <@deen> you attack just for fun?
00:40 < vali> i search a gay person on alle irc chats of teeworlds
00:40 < vali> im killing him
00:40 < laxa> vali: ddos this for 30 minutes : ddracepro.net

00:41 < vali> no time for that
00:42 < laxa> I got ddosed earlier todayh
00:42 < laxa> but only for 10 minutes
00:42 < laxa> not even 10 minutes
00:42 < laxa> like 2 minutes

00:44 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
00:44 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!

00:45 <@deen> vali: it's more fun to create something than to destroy it
00:46 < vali> deen what create?
00:46 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
00:46 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
00:46 <@deen> whatever you like! a teeworlds server for people to have fun on, for example
00:46 < laxa> deen: you changed the stats.json ?
00:46 <@deen> no
00:47 < laxa> wtf
00:47 < vali> deen ok i will give out a client that crash servers ok?
00:47 < vali> first create than destroy
00:47 < vali> good idea
00:47 < o_be_one> you already did vali :/
00:47 < vali> no
00:47 < vali> my clients send commands to my server
00:48 < o_be_one> you made a stupid kiddy bot whos playing with !crash and other shit like that.
00:48 < vali> to attack the server
00:48 < vali> true
00:48 < vali> ip spoofing on your server is easy too
00:48 < vali> really shitty :P
00:48 < o_be_one> i know :/
00:48 < o_be_one> cause it needs to get fixed.
00:48 < vali> its easy to fix
00:49 <@deen> vali: fix it and make a pull request
00:49 < laxa> deen: is it somehow possible that the JSON got FRA server x 2 ?
00:49 < o_be_one> yes to xxlddrace :)
00:49 < vali> deen no, i wouldnt support tw
00:49 < laxa> cause I don't see any other explanation for nimda to say twice on same function FRA down + FRA up
00:49 <@deen> vali: what about ddnet? we have a lot of work to do
00:49 < o_be_one> we are ddrace, not tw :/
00:50 < vali> deen you have xxxxxx people that help you
00:50 <@deen> vali: always good to have more talented people
00:50 < vali> deen you musnt do anything
00:51 <@deen> what do you mean? do you think they do everything for me?
00:51 < vali> sure
00:51 < vali> they are your slaves
00:51 <@deen> i wouldn't say so
00:52 < laxa> xD
00:52 <@deen> most of the coders are here and they just do something when they feel like it. not like i'm forcing anyone
00:52 <@deen> and the testers, maybe i should force them to work more :P
00:53 < vali> deen do you want close your project?
00:53 <@deen> why?
00:53 < vali> deen i just ask
00:54 <@deen> I'd like to keep it running, even though it's a lot of work and I'm often not sure if it's worth it
00:54 < vali> ok
00:54 < vali> just so
00:56 < vali> deen why you dont try to start a other project?
00:56 < vali> maybe a privat metin2 server like me
00:56 <@deen> vali: i did, http://hookrace.net
00:56 <@deen> but it's a lot of work and i have lots of other stuff to do
00:57 < vali> ok
