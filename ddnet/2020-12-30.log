03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> omg i want to try that
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if i already faked everybody's clientid to be 0, is it safe to just increase MAX_CLIENTS to allow more clients to join?
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice 😄
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793706948482039848/2020-12-30_13-07-15.mp4
06:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> is this ridiculous
16:52 < ***> Buffer Playback...
16:52 <+bridge> [16:49:51] [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> haha nice idea @Patiga , reminds me of mario kart
16:52 <+bridge> [16:50:35] [ddnet] <Patiga> thank you :D
16:52 < ***> Playback Complete.
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the map names should have been inverted too xD
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ultimate confusion
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sadly stoppers break from mirroring
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oof
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wdym?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. stoppers on fly to legends 2
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ehm, I think stoppers can't be mirrored, but have to be rotated
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah 😄
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Patiga fix!!!
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😆
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i dont get it yet, why do stoppers have to be rotated?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddrace code
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that bug exists since ever i guess
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i already had it like 4 years ago
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, it's been this way since forever, and we're afraid to change physics
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> long before ddnet
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I'm switching back to normal maps, no quick way to fix this I guess
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do rank get saved or what?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you quickly explain how it would need to be fixed?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do ranks get saved or what?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Rotate stoppers by 180° instead of mirroring them
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> stoppers are so dont flip them horizontally, but vertically and horizontally at the same time?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> forget the first two words
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i mean they have 3 flags
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> flip_v, flip_h, rotate
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what i do is flip either flip_h, or flip_v if rotate is enabled
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, and the condition for that in server is broken
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map testers can hopefully confirm this
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> exclude maps with stoppers from the event 😄
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so all? xd
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😆
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so could you tell me how should i rotate stoppers?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> stronghold would still work @Jupstar ✪
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga my guess is that stoppers that are turned left or right need to be rotated 180°. In editor it's clicking CW twice
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga if they look right, vflip then rotate
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no vflip I think
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah im messing around in the editor rn
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that is a bit fucked up o.o
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> top broken, bottom working
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793872709577867264/unknown.png
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could also finally fix the server code, but that will take longer to deploy
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeye, im going for a quick dirty fix
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we'd have to check existing maps
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so for 270° all flags have to be present
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh could you quickly get me mapping of the wrong ones to the correct ones?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793873372827615282/test2.map
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at spawn
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> left are the normal ones
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> top thing is broken
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the others under it work
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i dont see the tileflags like you do
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turn on info
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> where do i turn on info?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in editor top bar
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, got it
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also mapped u the reason
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it hlips H first, then its flips V, so it looks same but is flipped then all
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the reason why it breaks
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so for each type, the upper one works and the lower ones dont
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think always if the 3rd dimensional vector is rotated basically xD
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so V and H always have to be on together?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think so yes
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or better
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if H is enabled v has to be too
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> H -> V
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok nvm its vice versa probs
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah rotations are either only 90° or both flags
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its defs confusing xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do mappers always check all stoppers by hand or what XD
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> you know which of each are correct and which are broken?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793875362634661968/unknown.png
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if h or V is present, enable both
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else it doesnt matter
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so top will work
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sure? V looks like it is pointing up, VH points down
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes but thats the problem
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u basically rotate it in the 3rd dimension
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its not the same arrow
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> V -> remove V
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> H -> add V?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oop
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wait
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if all maps are correct
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah if the upper row is correct?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that shouldnt even exists
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for server code
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it could just ignore V and H if not the other is present
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (doesnt fix this issue tho)
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or add one of each
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok server code:
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If only H is present add V, bcs that doesnt change the tile
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if only V is present, remove V
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> are only stoppers affected?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think so
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone got a map that was broken so we can test it first?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> it works on this test map
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793878350446723072/test2.map
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793878375000178718/test2-mirrored.map
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> (the now fixed code that is)
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the 3 main lines of the fix are now:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if tile.id == 60 {
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     tile.flags.set(TileFlags::FLIP_V, tile.flags.contains(TileFlags::FLIP_H))
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> }
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the first operand is the flag to be set to the boolean of the second operand
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks correct
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 👍
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks for the support @Jupstar ✪ @arch1t3cht30 :heartw:
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do u do if the stopper looks left?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are u removing v then and only set 90°?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not that V and 90 is active
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the transformation that happens before is clean mirroring of tiles
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> these two conditions basically
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> this is the clean up function that is called afterwards
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alright
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried my own test2-mirrored on test server and seems to work, thanks @Patiga
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wait
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sure the tiles were mirrored? or did they stay the same (but are working)
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they look the same
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they are mirrored
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u basically rotation around the same achsis
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> who even decided that this is somehow interesting?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also knew that this would evoke this reaction by part of the community, but wanted to have some fun event for a day anyway
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah just ignore them xD
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> > fun
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> few are always anti
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I'm ok with that, but that's just causes some confusion at first
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea okay it seems to be correct @deen ;)
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> then you just ignore mirroring
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not for ever 😄
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> so I'm curious where is the fun here
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ? XD
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> @deen is there a way to detect if there is stoppers in a map? like the webside shows if theres rocket, solo, jetpack etc.. because then just reverse all the maps without stoppers ?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Too many maps with stoppers
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Patiga has a fix already
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> oh nice
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Might take me ~1 hour to sync 2 GB of maps to all servers again
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, Patiga suggested it for April Fools, but I didn't want to wait that long. For me it's some harmless fun where nearly everything should still work. But of course not everyone will like it.
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> for april first it's at least somewhat fun, because you're confused why everything is broken and turns out today is april fools day
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well a new year is a turn in numbers, so fitting to this, ddnet turns around the maps
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt that fun
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he should add an option permanently, [] Mirror cup
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sec are laser doors the same?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tag @deen
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> how to do doors in the editor? ^^
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they look inactive for me
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i placed DDOR (240) and length 3 (210) next to each other
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no idea, never seen them mirrored
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah fair
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they _should_ not be affected since they are placed with 2 blocks
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but the tool doesnt check which block it is rotating, and simply rotates everything
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so the question is
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> are there blocks that must not be blindly rotated
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (only in game/front/switch layers)
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe u should ask, what should be mirrored
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its probs less
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on luminati the doors seem to work
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> speedups, stoppers, bullets, rotating laser things
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno xd
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> lets go through them
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> speedups have an angle between 0 and 360
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i rotate them by doing 180 - angle
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> +360 if it is negative
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> stoppers are hopefully fixed now
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> bullets?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> exploding bullets
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and spinning lasers
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from tile 203
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on front and game layer
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay thankfully this _should_ not be critical on most maps, since they are will probably spawn like normal and go into their loop
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and switch layer has them too
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for bullets they define the direciton
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where they "shoot"
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gonna look on intermediate
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm then mirroring normally should work on them, no?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if they not as buggy as stoppers XD
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> point taken
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are bvroken
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> same fix as stoppers?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/793886048262422589/screenshot_2020-12-30_17-59-34.png
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see the second from left
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it looks down
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but goes left right
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> spinning lasers cant be rotated at all in the editor
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so cant check if they break
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen maybe we should disable mirroring in the editor for game layers completly? or is there a case when its useful other than rotating a hook tile for design xd
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sounds good to me
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sent deen a fix, it includes:
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> rotating laser fixes
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> handle bullets the same as stoppers
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alright
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i could find another thing that could break on the quick
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there are more tiles that arent rotateable
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i have no idea if they break
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @Jupstar ✪ you  know why some rooms are reverse? i mean i read someone speack about makign troll maps where its reversed not long ago but damn
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Dry Wall do u mean, that the maps are mirrored?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats a event
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> yes
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> especially for older players that know most maps, its probably pretty funny
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> oh
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its the same map just "harder" in a way u cannot rely on muscle memory so easy 😄
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> How long will it last and when did it start xD
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> Btw I like it
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For the rest of the year
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will last until new year is over
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> Lel
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> Multimap would be crazy
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ Do you know what's up with bidirectional stoppers?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do we also need to special-case them?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i've no idea, but i can test
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be nice, thanks
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they seem to be fine
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> speeders, hookthrough? (64, 65, 67)
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the all side stoppers cannot be changed in editor
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh, they have a function
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt know 😄
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> always thought they just a arrow xD
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I've no idea how they even work
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> better check new ht tile as well
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good point
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is broken too
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the one sided hookthorugh allows you to hook through it
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> luckily that is already included in my pessimistic fix
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 👀 is there any ~~bots~~ dummy client that can fill up a server. preferably 200 of them.
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are u just rotating most stuff now? 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea, my next pessimistic fix is to normalize the rotation on all game/front/switch layer tiles
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie would like to have that too 😛
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> didnt realize on my pessimistic fix that i could just do it for all tiles
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (except for the tiles layers)
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i c
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie to test servers use dbg_dummies
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> or use clients that are low in ressources like this one https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-h7
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU8U858lXa8
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> barley uses cpu 
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> or there is the known hax client k-client that can spawn a zillion dummies
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> or u quickly edit the timout protection code to keep all tees that joined forever and reconnect a few times
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also have a udp-relay.py from somewhere that clones one client to any number you want
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> so many options
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> does cloning directly work tho? with anti spoof codes and stuff?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I have to disable antispoofing and allow more than 4 clients per ip
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rest is fine
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> interesting
