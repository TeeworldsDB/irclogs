00:12 <@deen> WolfAlex: apply to be a mod and help solve the problem
00:22 <+Neruell> is this the dicker dennis net channel?
00:23 <@deen> Neruell: thanks for reminding me to get some food :P
00:23 <+xush_> yea please, make it happen.
04:02 <+Henningstone> deen: wanted to mention that macosx doesn't know what CLOCK_MONOTONIC is
09:49 <+minus> does it even have clock_gettime? at least on iOS i had to use something else
10:39 <@deen> Henningstone: Oh, so do they have a replacement or will we have to use gettimeofday again for OSX?
11:15 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11680461/monotonic-clock-on-osx
11:16 <@deen> ok, would be nice if someone could implement and test that
12:53 <+Ryozuki> deen
12:53 <+Ryozuki> someone made like ddnet servers
12:53 <+Ryozuki> that connect to the database
12:54 <+Ryozuki> i guess it's because this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/commit/aea9ac99068b0ceeff650270bd674911d9d83c1f
12:54 <+Ryozuki> you can fix it by changing the password right?
12:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #511: Use the monotonic clock on OS X (master...pr_ddnet_osx_monotonic) https://git.io/vKfZ8
13:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you have OS X? ^
13:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: nope
13:07 <@deen> Ryozuki: I'm pretty sure I changed the password already
13:07 <@deen> Ryozuki: maybe he's not connected to the official database, but just runs a copy of it, which you can download here: https://ddnet.tw/stats/
13:07 <+Ryozuki> Oh
13:08 <+Ryozuki> trolls get more and more ideas
13:08 <+Ryozuki> i wonder how far they can go
13:08 <+Ryozuki> and it's obviusly that it's someone
13:08 <@EastByte> using ddnet's public ranks is not exactly trolling
13:09 <+Ryozuki> with server name as "Dickerdeen"
13:09 <@deen> ah^^
13:09 <+Ryozuki> xD
13:09 <@EastByte> ah
13:09 <+Ryozuki> wait its dickerdennisnet
13:09 <+Ryozuki> but anyway..
15:42 <+Ryozuki> deen
15:43 <+Ryozuki> a user is trying to donate 60â‚¬ but he says he can't do it, paypal tell him that they will revise it and after 72 hours he gets his money back
15:43 <+Ryozuki> you know why it could happen?
15:44 <+Ryozuki> (Saki)
17:38 <@deen> Ryozuki: Yes, I sent him PayPal's explanation by email. Basically some people or countries have US sanctions and PayPal is not allowed to send their money around

23:47 <@deen> heinrich5991: well, version 10.1 also didn't work on Mac initially and then it was fixed^^
23:47 <@deen> at least it compiled, that's a start
23:48 <@heinrich5991> ok, if it compiled then it has a good chance of working
23:48 <@heinrich5991> but I didn't even know whether it'd compile
23:48 <@deen> and I'm not even sure if the new time caching in client works on any platform
23:48 <@deen> I didn't notice any problems but I don't really play actively anymore
