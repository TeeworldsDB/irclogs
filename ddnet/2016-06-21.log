01:38 <+Maple> so theres this bug
01:38 <+Maple> where the servers load the wrong map metadata
01:38 <+Maple> so you race the wrong map and set scores on another map
01:38 <+Maple> and i have no idea how to reproduce it
02:12 <@deen> Maple: huh
02:12 <@deen> Maple: that's a bad bug
02:12 <+Maple> yeah
02:12 <+Maple> it happened with my rank on Gorou
02:12 <+Maple> dont forget to remove it
02:12 <+Maple> like, the scores from gorou appeared
02:12 <+Maple> but the map loaded was blackbear 3
02:13 <+Maple> and dinner told me it happened to him before
02:13 <@deen> nice of him not to tell anyone :P
02:13 <@deen> the 11 second rank or both?
02:14 <@deen> and is the server still running?
02:16 <@deen> Did this start happening recently?
02:16 <@deen> I believe it's related to a new database related change we did
02:45 <+Maple> yeah it happened a few days back
02:48 <@deen> I think I know about what causes it, told HMH about it and he should look into it tomorow
03:23 <+nameless-tee> deen: why you don't have comments on your blog?
15:31 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/voob2
15:31 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master aeec3c6 def: Add support for mousewheelleft and mousewheelright
20:33 <@EastByte> deen: do you know how accurate ntp can synchronise the time with another server?
20:35 <@EastByte> I'm now reading about ntp precision
20:41 <@EastByte> wow, precision=-24 (2^-24 s)
21:23 <+minus> what'd you expect?
21:24 <+minus> actually i get a "time slew" of ~30ms every time i run ntpd -qg
21:48 <@EastByte> well I was wondering about how far time synchronisation is technically possible if the ping varies by x ms
22:47 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I guess it's impossible unless you make the assumption that the latency in one direction is the same as in the other one
22:48 <@EastByte> yes, that makes sense
22:50 <@heinrich5991> all of ddnet maps are in the ddnet map repository, right?
22:51 <@EastByte> ddnet-maps is kept up to date with the ddnet releases, so yes I guess
