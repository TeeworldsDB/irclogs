00:00 < bear> just reclaiming what nick ive used for over 10 years hehe
00:00 < bear> nothing personal
00:00 < bear> there are bound to be more than two bears :)
00:43 <+eeeee> tl;dr
00:44 <@deen> eeeee: hi
00:44 <+eeeee> so have heard you want accounts
00:44 <+eeeee> ddnet client is easy but what's the plan for vanilla client?
00:46 <@deen> no accounts for vanilla client
00:46 <@deen> but accounts are not necessary for anything
00:46 <@deen> just so that others know that you're really you
00:50 <+eeeee> so you'll just show the account's "login" in scoreboard and that's it?
00:50 <@deen> for the start, yes
00:50 <+eeeee> or rankings will also get tied to accounts
00:50 <@deen> those are the next steps
00:50 <@deen> profile on the website, with all the maps you created, your ranks
00:51 <@deen> demo upload and stuff like that
00:51 <@deen> but preventing fakers would already be great
00:53 <@heinrich5991> big meh from me
00:55 <+eeeee> y
00:55 <@deen> what else would you want?
00:55 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: ?
00:58 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: is that a "why"?
00:58 <+Learath2> ./claimnick command would be nice :D
00:59 <@deen> so far gameservers don't even know about accounts
00:59 <@deen> so only the clients would see whether someone is logged in or not
00:59 <+Learath2> well eeeee already has done account systems before so that should be pretty quick
01:01 <@heinrich5991> claimnick is the worst IMO
01:01 <@heinrich5991> as long as you only show the acc name, that's okay-ish
01:02 <+eeeee> for ddwar we used a separate account server which was hooked up to gameserver through econ
01:02 <+eeeee> kept gameserver changes to a bare minimum that way
01:02 <@deen> hm, but then you need a modified gameserver
01:02 <@deen> so it would only work with the ddnet mod
01:03 <+eeeee> not sure you can do it 100% in ddnet client
01:03 <@deen> we have some plans, but they're not in a nice form
01:03 <@deen> EastByte can decide if he wants to show them to you^^
01:03 <@deen> i think it would work
01:03 <@deen> at least for the features we want for now
01:08 <+eeeee> i guess it could work if e.g. your account server would accept messages like "<login> joined/dropped/playing on <ip>:<port> at <timestamp>" signed by with that login's password (via hashing for simplicity)
01:09 <@deen> yes
01:10 <+eeeee> wanna interface with account server via http?
01:10 <@deen> we wanted at first
01:11 <+eeeee> but then got an arrow in the knee?
01:11 <@deen> but the account server should also be able to notify the client directly
01:11 <@deen> when a new authenticated player just joined the player's current server
01:11 <@deen> so it should be tcp + tls
01:12 <+eeeee> why tls?
01:12 <@deen> when you send the password hashed, then the hashed password becomes the actual password
01:12 <@deen> so someone can just sniff it
01:12 <+eeeee> well but you don't ever have to send the password
01:13 <+eeeee> you just use the password to sign your messages
01:13 <@deen> for the client to login
01:13 <@deen> ah
01:13 <@deen> that would also work
01:13 <+eeeee> tls is cool but hard to port around
01:13 <+eeeee> and hashing can be simply copypasted in C codes
01:15 < Savander> good night
01:15 <@deen> good night, Savander 
01:15 <+eeeee> although iirc fisted managed to get libcurl+openssl working in both linux and windows for ddwar client
01:16 <@deen> yeah, that's why EastByte wanted libcurl initially as well, but then we discovered that tcp would be better
01:23 <+Learath2> he used libcurl for autoupdate to download the files
01:24 <+eeeee> on a side note, we can make a centralized http hosting of tw maps and make ddnet client try fetching map from there whenver it connects to any server
01:24 <@deen> eeeee: yes!
01:25 <@deen> that would be really nice and reduce the requirements for gameservers
01:25 <+Learath2> i can try to make that happen 
01:25 <@deen> i don't know if we need libcurl for that
01:26 <+Learath2> libcurl sure would be nice but could easily be done without that
01:26 <@deen> we have some HTTP 1.0 code in autoupdate.cpp
01:26 <@deen> but i don't know if it's a good idea to keep using that
01:26 <+Learath2> should reimplement that with libcurl
01:27 <+Learath2> libcurl is pretty light
01:27 <@deen> but this would be really simple. client requests filename_hash.map. if it exists, download, otherwise from gameserver
01:27 <+Learath2> fastdl.ddnet.tw :P
01:28 <@deen> hmmmm
01:28 <@deen> having just one server would probably lead to slower download for many
01:28 <@deen> chileans can't download quickly from europe, for example
01:28 <@deen> maybe it's fine as it is right now, after all
01:31 <+eeeee> single server should be fine for everyone
01:32 <+eeeee> will be much faster than udp even when downloading overseas
01:32 <@deen> I'm not sure, i should make a test
01:34 <+Learath2> Cloudflare pls
01:34 <@deen> tested with our biggest map, 2.5 MB
01:35 <@deen> 5 seconds from china, 3.5 s from chile, 7 s from south africa
01:36 <+eeeee> sounds acceptable?
01:36 <@deen> yes
01:36 <@heinrich5991> with cloudflare it might be less
01:36 <@deen> of course
01:37 <+eeeee> and yes, we could also try to cloudflare it or even pay for CDN
01:37 <@deen> but cloudflare costs money, right?
01:37 <@heinrich5991> standard cloudflare doesn't
01:38 <+Learath2> i still dont get cloudflares business model :/
01:38 <+Learath2> how can they hand out free CDN and not bankrupt
01:38 <+eeeee> i wonder if standard cloudflare supports http long polling
01:38 <@deen> get people hooked on standard cloudflare, show them that it's not enough and they have to upgrade?
01:38 <@heinrich5991> stnadard cloudflare is pretty awesome from what I've heard
01:38 <+Learath2> yeah its pretty nice
01:39 <@heinrich5991> works against http ddosing
01:48 <+eeeee> deen: so what, want me to set up the infra for maps?
01:48 <@deen> hmmmm, would probably be nice to have, yes
01:48 <+eeeee> will buy a tiny vps in US for a couple years and cloudflare it
01:48 <@deen> oooh
01:48 <@deen> you mean that infra
01:49 <@deen> i thought you wanted to write the code :P
01:49 <+eeeee> could try wiring up existing http 
01:49 <@deen> for now i would just use our existing infrastructure
01:49 <+eeeee> but i prolly can't properly link to libcurl
01:49 <@deen> i think we have more than enough servers anyway
01:50 <@deen> dedicated server in FRA is sitting around doing nothing right now
01:50 <+eeeee> sounds like it might go away then
01:51 <+eeeee> and you'll have to perform extra effort to move the maps hosting from it
01:51 <@deen> yes, it will. but moving a map server isn't difficult
01:51 <+eeeee> okay ur the boss
01:54 <+eeeee> i just remember how annoying it was to move around when ddwar was haunted by ddoses
01:54 <@deen> yeah, moving the main server is very annoying for ddnet
01:54 <+eeeee> why?
01:55 <+eeeee> because of favorites?
01:55 <@deen> no, because i have too much stuff setup there
01:55 <@deen> all the weird scripts, website, dynamic website parts, email, forum, databases and so on
01:56 <+eeeee> why not separate all of that from gameserver?
01:56 <@deen> right now it is separated
01:56 <@deen> and still gets ddosed
01:56 <@deen> well, it ran fine for a year without protection
01:56 <+eeeee> http should be much easier to protect from ddos
01:56 <@deen> then i moved it to the "ddos protected FRA server"
01:56 <@deen> but it wasn't that ddos protected after all
01:57 <+eeeee> well might be because the hoster cannot filter udp
01:58 <+eeeee> but if you only used http on that server the firewall might be smart enough to just drop all udp
01:58 <@deen> but http also went down, so it's not like they're just blocking all udp
01:58 <@deen> with the ovh pro firewall you can set it up like that, yes
01:58 <+eeeee> yeah i mean if you dont filter the udp then it just saturates the link and http stops working as well
02:07 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/eJVI5Q
02:07 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 1d7d511 def: Set ed_zoom_target to 0 on default
02:30 <+eeeee> i dont get it
02:30 <+eeeee> does autoupdate block the client
02:30 <@deen> what do you mean?
02:30 <+eeeee> or is it because i'm on macos
02:31 <+eeeee> i mean i dont see any threading or async networking
02:31 <@deen> there is no autoupdate for mac. i don't have a mac and i have no idea how it works
02:31 <+eeeee> yeah i removed all ifdefs to get it to work
02:31 <@deen> where don't you see threading or async networking?
02:32 <+eeeee> in CheckUpdates
02:32 <@deen> aah, now i understand
02:32 <@deen> yes, the autoupdater blocks the client
02:44 <+eeeee> seems to kinda work, at least it downloads the file fine
02:44 <+eeeee> the linux version though so cannot restart into it
02:44 <@deen> cool
02:45 <@deen> but for macos we distribute a dmg file, no idea if you can even update that
02:45 <+eeeee> surely not auto update
02:48 <@deen> same for the android one
02:50 <+eeeee> so how about this: a separate component which runs in a thread and uses that blocking getfile function to fetch the http://acc.ddnet.tw/gameserverip:gameserverport/players like every 5 seconds
02:51 <+eeeee> could pass back and forth some kind of last update timestamp to save traffic
02:52 <+eeeee> that file would be just plaintext mapping of player slot to login name
02:52 <@deen> hm, interesting idea, that could work
02:52 <+eeeee> and would be synced to some memory structure which is used for rendering
02:53 <@deen> need to see what EastByte thinks about this
02:53 <+eeeee> so the main thread would only be blocked for the time needed to parse the file into memory
02:58 <@deen> something like global chat messages would be difficult if we want to use http
02:59 <+eeeee> we can use long polling
02:59 <+eeeee> was de-facto industry standard before they invented websockets
03:00 <+eeeee> it works great but i'm not sure how ddos resistant that is
03:00 <@deen> yeah, would probably work
03:00 <@deen> I guess EastByte will be happy to hear, since he wanted http from the start
03:01 <+eeeee> http <3
03:01 <+eeeee> although world is moving on to spdy
03:06 <+eeeee> if our signing code is like really slow, e.g. a couple thousand rounds of salted md5
03:06 <+eeeee> then we could auto-generate a short alpahnumeric password in the client
03:06 <+eeeee> and store it in settings
03:12 <@deen> good night
03:12 <+eeeee> nite
03:14 < DoNe> hi
03:14 < DoNe> look at this :D http://timgame.de/files/balance.demo
03:19 <+eeeee> html5 tw demo player anyone?
03:22 < DoNe> xDD
03:22 <+eeeee> you may laugh
03:22 < DoNe> i do
03:23 <+eeeee> but the time is nigh
03:23 < DoNe> some1 working on a converter?
03:23 <+eeeee> not yet, but should be super easy now that we have https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Asyncify
03:24 < DoNe> whats that
03:24 <+eeeee> c++ to js compiler
03:24 < DoNe> ahhhh
03:24 <+eeeee> now supports "sleep" function which was the last problematic piece
03:24 < DoNe> then its easier to make a html5 player than a converter xD
03:25 <+eeeee> do it
03:25 < DoNe> haha no
03:25 <+eeeee> meh
09:58 <@EastByte> hm
10:52 <@EastByte> eeeee, deen, heinrich5991: I think cloudflare will be a problem, I often heard complains iirc
10:52 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: about what?
10:52 <@EastByte> and I'm not sure whether cloudflare allows long polling
10:52 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: downtime and so on
10:53 <@heinrich5991> GreYFoX was quite happy with it
10:53 <@EastByte> cloudflare might see long polling just as a "server didn't response" and cancel
10:54 <@heinrich5991> ah
10:56 <+eeeee> that alone is not a problem though
10:57 <+eeeee> as long polling connection will timeout eventually one way or another
10:58 <+eeeee> maybe we should just try it
10:59 <@EastByte> well, let's check out whether cloudflare does fine with polling at all
10:59 <+eeeee> long polling isn't even necessary for the basic accounts stuff, only for cross server chat which is hypothetical atm
10:59 <@EastByte> I think it's more directed to desktop clients visiting simple webpages
11:00 <@EastByte> http://i.imgur.com/9uFhVzt.png
11:00 <@EastByte> and this is what cloudflare might return on timeout :D
11:01 <@EastByte> would be bad if they still set the http status to 200
11:04 <+eeeee> in that case maybe we still can leverage an advanced not-so-long polling technology 
11:04 <@EastByte> "+eeeee | you just use the password to sign your messages"
11:04 <@EastByte> how does that work?
11:05 <+eeeee> like 5-seconds-long polling or something
11:05 <+eeeee> you just take the message
11:05 <@EastByte> md5(msg+pw)?
11:05 <+eeeee> yes
11:05 <@EastByte> so the server needs to store the plain password
11:05 <+eeeee> yep
11:06 <@deen> that's bad =/
11:06 <@EastByte> well for me it's find I guess
11:06 <@EastByte> fine*
11:06 <+eeeee> well you can always do md5(msg+md5(pw)) if you want
11:06 <@deen> i don't want all these passwords!
11:06 <@deen> eeeee: then the md5(pw) is the real pw
11:06 <@EastByte> deen: better then the plain password
11:06 <@deen> no
11:06 <+eeeee> but it's never transmitted over the net
11:06 <+eeeee> should be fine
11:08 <@EastByte> the reason why I wanted to use tcp+ssl was because many people could help us hosting a "tcp forward" for the master server
11:08 <@EastByte> so they only forward raw ssl
11:08 <@EastByte> and block everything on ddos
11:09 <@EastByte> only problem would be if the masterserver's ip gets public
11:09 <+eeeee> uh if they block everything then what's the point 
11:10 <@EastByte> well if one node get's attacked it will be down anyways
11:10 <@EastByte> and if we have like a hundred nodes
11:10 <@EastByte> no way to take everything down
11:10 <+eeeee> cloudflare sounds easier somehow
11:11 <@EastByte> yea let's check it out
11:11 <@heinrich5991> cloudflare gives you automatic caching in that point
11:11 <@heinrich5991> so it doesn'
11:11 <@heinrich5991> t evne go down on ddos
11:11 <@heinrich5991> (as long as the internal server is hidden)
11:11 <+eeeee> yeah it's kinda useless for dynamic content like account server's responses tho
11:12 <@heinrich5991> yes
11:13 <+eeeee> well just for accounts could make it useful, but not for chat
11:13 <+eeeee> oh hut cloudflare website says they update the content weekly, so no :D
11:14 <@EastByte> I personally don't like to use a commercial cdn like cloudflare
11:14 <@EastByte> rather want to be independent from nsa backdoored stuff
11:14 <+eeeee> oh please
11:14 <+eeeee> nsa has backdoors everywhere anyway
11:15 <@EastByte> well that's a bad argument, yes
11:16 <@EastByte> but cloudflare always has been used by kids who didn't know how to do distributed safe hosting
11:16  * eeeee doesnt know as well
11:20 <+eeeee> if all maps get loaded from cdn, how much traffic is that gonna be?
11:20 <@deen> hmmm, i can only estimate
11:21 <@heinrich5991> what's wrong in admitting that one doesn't really know how to do safe hosting?
11:21 <@deen> since GER has ~2 TB traffic monthly
11:21 <@heinrich5991> and using a well-known solution for that
11:21 <@EastByte> eeeee: but map downloads can be cached by cloudflare?
11:21 <@deen> eeeee: I'd say at most 1-2 TB
11:22 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: it's not wrong but I don't like
11:22 <@EastByte> it
11:23 <@heinrich5991> aha
11:23 <@heinrich5991> must be really useful to the "NSA" to see teeworlds map caching going on
11:24 <+eeeee> why do you think the "battlefield" tw mod disappeared?
11:25 <+eeeee> nsa took it down as they used it to train terrorists
11:26 <@EastByte> you will stop laughing if cloudflare isn't able to pass through polling requests correctly, takes too long for response and forces cached responses :P
11:27 <@heinrich5991> didn't say that we should use it for polling
11:27 <@heinrich5991> (but rather for map downloads)
11:28 <+eeeee> the cheapest non-cloudflare cdn for 2TB is $80/month
11:28 <+eeeee> that's kinda expensive
11:28 <@EastByte> so does anyone have a free domain name which could be used for testing cdns?
11:28 <+eeeee> we'd better off with a couple "ddos protected" servers i guess
11:29 <@heinrich5991> we can use a subdomain I guess
11:29 <@EastByte> I'm not sure
11:29 <@heinrich5991> test.ddnet.tw
11:29 <@deen> sure
11:29 <@deen> every subdomain directs to ddnet.tw
11:30 <@deen> maps could already be downloaded from ddnet.tw
11:30 <@heinrich5991> unless the CDN doesn't like it specifically, it should work
11:30 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/maps/Kobra.map
11:30 <+eeeee> no crc tho
11:30 <@deen> true
11:30 <@deen> just for cdn testing i meant
11:30 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I'd use a sensible hash function and only download via hash
11:31 <@EastByte> isn't crc32 enough?
11:31 <@EastByte> it already is some kind of id for tw maps
11:31 <@heinrich5991> but specifically only to differ between maps of the same name
11:31 <@EastByte> right
11:31 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: not necessary for ddnet and 3rd party servers only support crc
11:32 <@heinrich5991> okay right
11:32 <@heinrich5991> but centralized stuff might have the problem of "map poisoning"
11:33 <@heinrich5991> (should be fairly trivial to generate a crc collision, and if anyone can upload new maps...)
11:33 <+eeeee> plan is to start with hosting only official ddnet maps
11:33 <@heinrich5991> right
11:33 <+eeeee> about new maps, yeah
11:33 <@EastByte> you can just check whether the crc already is in use and log something like "heinrich said it"
11:34 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/MHX2IQ

11:37 <@EastByte> eeeee: relating to html5 demo player, we already have this: https://eastbit.net/public/tw-webgl/?map=dm1.map and https://eastbit.net/public/tw-webgl-tees/
11:39 <@deen> the second one is exactly what it looks like when OVH falsely detects me as part of a DDoS!
11:39 <@EastByte> ^^
11:41 <@heinrich5991> the second one =)
11:41 <@heinrich5991> looks fun
11:42 <+eeeee> yeah still far from a demo player though
11:42 <@EastByte> well you talked about c++->js convert
11:42 <@EastByte> will be easier since we already have some graphics stuff
11:42 <+eeeee> i once just set up the recording of all opengl commands in tw client and replayed them back in html5 canvas
11:43 <+eeeee> was kinda slow and i couldnt figure out how to use webgl
11:43 <@EastByte> :D
11:43 <+eeeee> coz it's opengl es
11:43 <@EastByte> yea
11:45 <@EastByte> really sad that you can't use 3d textures there
11:45 <+eeeee> if someone does try c++ to js convert then the major challenge would be stripping down the client to only what's necessary to play demos and removing all the low level system stuff like threading, fs, networking, etc.
11:46 <@EastByte> I personally find it easier to rewrite it^^
11:46 <@EastByte> my layer rendering engine runs nearly completly on gpu
11:46 <+eeeee> kinda hard to get exactly all the quirks of original
11:46 <@EastByte> would be too slow otherwise
11:46 <+eeeee> think stronger hook
11:47 <+eeeee> not sure if that's necessary for smooth demo playback though
11:48 <@EastByte> ^
11:48 <@EastByte> we could strip everything down
11:48 <@heinrich5991> stronger hook might be necessary
11:48 <@heinrich5991> it's in the shared codebase
11:48 <@heinrich5991> of client and sever
11:59 <@EastByte> so using a cdn for map downloads is what we want?
12:00 <@deen> I think a single normal server would be good enough
12:01 <@EastByte> why do teeworlds relating discussions never end up to anything?
12:10 <@heinrich5991> the end was IMO: "let's build a centralized map storage for ddnet-maps only, behind a cdn"
12:14 <@EastByte> so I would say using deen's "single normal server" as http file server and put cloudflare free on top
12:14 <@EastByte> if cloudflare doesn't work out well, fall back and rely ddos protection
12:15 <@EastByte> on*
12:15 <@heinrich5991> yep
12:16 <@EastByte> and the ddnet acc system will be devloped behind the scenes
12:22 <@EastByte> deen: you already added a motd message for non ddnet cl users
12:22 <@EastByte> we could do the same for people who are using a really old version of ddnet cl
12:34 <@deen> EastByte: i thought about it, but do we really want to annoy them?
12:35 <@deen> (i actually had it in and removed it before committing)
12:35 <@EastByte> hm
12:36 <@deen> i guess we can do it
12:36 <@deen> and see what happens :P
12:36 <@EastByte> yea :)
12:36 <@deen> but the people with old ddnet client
12:36 <@deen> already get a message whenever they start it
12:36 <@deen> and choose to ignore it
12:37 <@EastByte> right
12:37 <@EastByte> but a motd can be changed afterwards so they are going to think about it again
12:37 <@deen> hm?
12:38 <@EastByte> the first motd might be: please download the newest ddnet client
12:38 <@EastByte> and later you can add reasons why they should do so
12:38 <@EastByte> you can also make the text flashing and everything =)
12:39 <@EastByte> at some point they well really get annoyed
12:39 <@EastByte> or even interested :)
12:47 <@deen> haha
12:49 <@EastByte> is there a simple first in last out buffer class in python?

12:56 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes
12:57 <@heinrich5991> e.g. there's queue
13:43 <+laxa> deen: killstreak 1 dosn't seem to have been released properly :)
13:49 <@deen> weird
13:50 <+Nimda> Killstreak 1 by Tuna just released on solo at 2014-10-12 12:46
14:16 <@EastByte> hello BeaR 
14:16 < BeaR> hey :)
14:16 <@deen> hi BeaR 
14:16 <@deen> BeaR: Your sound stuff is awesome!
14:17 < BeaR> thx :)
14:17 <@EastByte> question: how is it being used in the future?
14:17 <@deen> background music on maps!
14:17 <@EastByte> where do the client get the sounds from
14:17 <@EastByte> autoupdate?
14:18 <@deen> from the map? they should be embedded?
14:18 <@EastByte> ohhhhhhh
14:18 <@EastByte> now I get it
14:18 <@deen> well, people with vanilla client will not be happy
14:18 <@deen> to download these sounds they can't even hear
14:21 < Java__> Hey Guys
14:21 < Java__> Could someone reinvite me to ddnet-priv?
14:22 <@deen> i'm not there either
14:23 < Java__> Thanks
14:23 <@EastByte> invited you both
14:24 <@EastByte> though I don't think that there is something going on in the future
16:11 < DoNe> test
16:12 <@deen> hi DoNe 
16:12 < BeaR> position envelope for sounds now working (:
16:13 <@EastByte> =)
16:13 <@deen> so you can have a moving sound?
16:13 < BeaR> yep
16:13 <@deen> How do you synchronize moving sound and animation?
16:13 <@deen> some ghost moving through the map and sound with it for example
16:13 < DoNe> hi im testing irssi client for irc
16:13 < BeaR> does teeworlds already as far as I see
16:13 <@deen> BeaR: nice
16:13 <@EastByte> DoNe: nice
16:14 < DoNe> lol cant read your name yellow on white
16:14 < DoNe> ah east byte
16:14 <@EastByte> DoNe: background color of console should be black :P
16:14 < DoNe> yeah should be
16:14 < DoNe> u are using irssi too?
16:14 <@EastByte> nah for me it's weechat
16:15 <@EastByte> (similar)
16:15 <@deen> EastByte: i always switch to white console when it's bright outside for better readability :P
16:15 < DoNe> if i tell irssi my hostname is "jffnskfj" i can connect to quakenet
16:15 <@EastByte> interesting
16:15 <@deen> you can have a bind for urxvt
16:15 <@deen> to switch
16:15 < DoNe> but it says cant resolve hostname
16:15 <@deen> also for font size :P
16:16 <@deen> DoNe: because that is probably not your real hostname
16:16 < DoNe> if i enter my real hostname it gives an error when connecting
16:16 <@deen> DoNe: just enter no hostname?
16:16 < DoNe> yeah but its crazy
16:17 <@deen> EastByte: echo "\033]10;#000000\007\033]11;#ffffff\007\033]12;#000000\007\033]706;#0000ff\007\033]707;#ff0000\007"
16:18 <@EastByte> BeaR: deen: I would love to hear some breeze/wind sounds in the background of maps :D
16:18 <@EastByte> would also be cool for an autumn map
16:18 <@EastByte> leafs flying around
16:19 <@EastByte> deen: no I won't change anything :P
16:19 < DoNe> my hostname is empty now
16:19 <@EastByte> fortunatly the sun never gets through my window :)
16:20 < DoNe> is there a reason quakenet wants to know my hostname?
16:20 <@EastByte> ^ always looked up in irc
16:20 < DoNe> but why
16:20 <@EastByte> dunno it's on old protocol
16:21 < DoNe> hm, ah white on black looks so basic :)
16:21 <@EastByte> white on black and you are the uber hacker in school
16:22 < DoNe> wtf
16:22 <@EastByte> well green on black would be more leet
16:22 < DoNe> u mean such a green that burns in eyes?
16:24 < DoNe> hi
16:24 <@deen> hi cris272 
16:24 <@deen> cris272: are you french cris from TW?
16:25 < DoNe> sorry for my stupidness but what does a @ and a + mean?
16:25 <@deen> + is voice
16:25 < DoNe> voice?
16:25 <@deen> @ is operator
16:25 <@deen> (or whatever it's called in ircspeak)
16:26 < DoNe> whats voice
16:26 < DoNe> ?
16:26 <@deen> you can set the channel to some mode and then only people with voice can speak
16:26 < DoNe> ah
16:26 <@deen> we did that when ddosers would come here to talk shit
16:26 < DoNe> wanna voice too
16:26 <+DoNe> yeaa :D
16:26 <@EastByte> happy?
16:26 <@deen> don't need^^
16:26 <+DoNe> but i have bow
16:26 <+DoNe> now*
16:27 <+DoNe> do i keep voice when reconnecting?
16:27 <@EastByte> nope
16:32 <+laxa> Has anyone ever installed & configured tomcat to run a java website behind reverse proxy ? :)
16:33 <@deen> luckily not!
16:33 <+laxa> Why luckily ? xD
16:33 <@deen> I'm not a big java fan
16:34 <@EastByte> lol I have 5 usb->mini usb cable and 4 usb->micro cable
16:34 <+laxa> EastByte: make a necklace with them
16:34 <+laxa> you are going to be a babe magnet
16:34 <@EastByte> laxa: hahaha
16:35 <@EastByte> I already webcam chatted with anqel so be quiet :P
16:35 <+laxa> well, she had no webcam :p
16:35 <@EastByte> when she was on her smartphone, she had
16:35 <+laxa> Wut ? You saw her oO ?
16:35 <@EastByte> yea
16:35 <+laxa> Fuck me !
16:36 <+laxa> Go out with her, then come visit me :p
16:37 <+laxa> DoNe: you have a bouncer at least ?
16:44 < BeaR> deen: Volume changing via envelopes also work now, anything else which I should add :) ?
16:44 <@deen> BeaR: let me look at it and think
16:44 < BeaR> sure :D
16:46 <@deen> what's a global sound?
16:46 <@deen> can't you just use para 0 to get a global sound, BeaR ?
16:46 < BeaR> independet of position, you will hear it always
16:47 < BeaR> hm didn't look into Parallax yet :d
16:47 < BeaR> maybe
16:48 <@deen> and we probably need a setting to disable map sounds
16:50 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Tomew opened pull request #61: Removed InputData Array for Dummyinputs (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/ap-hfg
16:51 <@deen> hm, i think sound doesn't work with para 0 
16:52 <@deen> yeah, para is always 100 for sound
16:52 <@deen> i think it would make more sense to have working para instead of global
16:52 <@deen> then you can also put a sound on the left side, or right side
16:53 < BeaR> gonna fix it tomorrow (probably)
16:54 <@deen> awesome
17:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #61: Removed InputData Array for Dummyinputs (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/ap-hfg
17:03 < BeaR> deen: Add a volume slider for the map sound and I'll try to fix the parallaxing tomorrow, if you find something else, tell me. Bye (:
17:04 < BeaR> Added*
17:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: it would be great if you could specify the maximum volume possible by maps, instead of scaling it
17:05 <@deen> how would that work, heinrich5991?
17:12 <@deen> hi TestTee96_xRoTh 
17:12 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Yo
17:12 < TestTee96_xRoTh> How are you doing? Still incoming attacks? 
17:12 <@deen> no attacks
17:12 <@deen> tournament in 2 hours
17:12 <@deen> 3*
17:13 <@heinrich5991> deen: not sure how that will work
17:13 < TestTee96_xRoTh> How so tournament? 
17:13 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Never did it :) What is the goal? 
17:13 <@heinrich5991> finish the map first
17:13 <@heinrich5991> afaik
17:13 < TestTee96_xRoTh> ok
17:13 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=518
17:15 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Just found it. Nice idea
17:15 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Since o_be_one 's servers are full again & No DDoS incoming I think I will not be needed anymore. :) 
17:18 <@deen> We still don't have a protected server in Germany right now
17:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Tomew opened pull request #62: Removed InputData Array (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/xnr2yg
17:21 <@deen> we will get it at some point from the current hoster, but who knows when
17:23 < TestTee96_xRoTh> I can host those
17:24 < TestTee96_xRoTh> But you need linux right deen ? 
17:25 <@deen> right
17:25 <@deen> and i don't think you can host them
17:25 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Because? 
17:25 <@deen> since we need 4 cores, 2 GB of RAM
17:26 < TestTee96_xRoTh> Okay
17:26 <@heinrich5991> that's quite a lot
17:26 < TestTee96_xRoTh> for just 1 server? 
17:26 < TestTee96_xRoTh> I got 3cores, 3gb ram. Should be enough? 
17:26 <@deen> for all of GER
17:27 < TestTee96_xRoTh> ok, too bad :) 
17:27 <@deen> at tournaments you have to plan for 300-400 players there
17:27 < TestTee96_xRoTh> No problem :)

17:56 <@deen> would be nice if we could get rid of them for easier mergability with other mods, but some nice dummy features stop working =/
18:34 <+laxa> I gave nimda to harmony hosting and made them a plugin to announce server up/down
18:34 <+laxa> if you wanna follow the status, you can enable it deen
18:34 <@deen> nice^^
18:35 < DoNe> how to simulate for example +left key is pressed?
18:35 <@deen> simulate where?
18:35 < DoNe> client
18:36 < DoNe> i want to add it to client fifo
18:36 <@deen> see controls.cpp

18:38 <+laxa> or in long time maybe
18:38 <@deen> what?
18:38 <+laxa> well, you removed the standart blocker servers you had in FRA right ?
18:38 <@deen> during the last tournament there were 0 people on european blocker servers
18:38 <+laxa> oh
18:39 <+laxa> ok
18:39 <@deen> and they're still running
18:39 <@deen> just no players because r0x.fr is up
18:39 <+laxa> I thought you removed them for vali
18:39 <+laxa> but apparently you added them back
18:39 < DoNe> u cant write a bot with this because you have no input

20:19 <+o_be_one> really ?
20:19 <@deen> our server was down 4 times already
20:19 <+o_be_one> well let me ask to move you host to an other node
20:19 <@deen> not now!
20:19 <@deen> and not just because of the node, all nodes have very low uptime
20:20 <+o_be_one> maybe they had a problem ?

20:29 <@EastByte> yay
20:35 <@EastByte> deen: we need to do some deep profiling to find out what can cause laggs/high cpu usage
20:36 <@EastByte> (in the client)
20:36 <@EastByte> if people are complaining about a laggy client, let's prove that it's not the case^^
20:38 <@EastByte> we also should speed up the rendering engine (layer+font)
20:39 <@deen> "feel free to do that" :P
20:40 < shahan> ohi all
20:40 <@EastByte> hi shahan 
20:41 <+o_be_one> ive seen all my players back on my servers <3
20:41 <+o_be_one> what a real community :D
20:41 <+o_be_one> nothing to do for that ^^
20:41 <+o_be_one> hi shahan how r u ?
20:42 < shahan> ohi o_be_one , fine, thx, and u?
20:43 < shahan> deen: as I told, i can setup a stream on RUS server while DDNet Tournament
20:43 <@deen> shahan: that's a bit late now^^
20:44 < shahan> deen: yeah, mb, but next time I'll find a micro for that too. Now it's just a stream without voice www.twitch.tv/shahan78rus
20:44 <@EastByte> deen: if hookrace is not going to be reality in near future, I'm more motivated to refactor/rework the teeworlds engine
20:44 <+o_be_one> fine ty shahan :)
20:44 <@EastByte> also opengl+gpu knowledge is important for my future^^
20:45 <+o_be_one> ive an idea, soon i'll upload my banlist online so deen youll be able to check if a player is a bad player or not
20:45 <+o_be_one> banlist on my firewall ;)
20:45 <@EastByte> ddrace doesn't have bad players ;)
20:46 <@EastByte> deen: I guess we'll have atleast a weak ddos attack before the finish line
20:48 <@EastByte> okay nvm
20:50 <@deen> maybe we had one, who knows
20:50 <@deen> there are no notifications at HarmonyHosting
20:51 <@EastByte> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.368/0.568/4.401/0.391 ms
20:51 <@EastByte> from eastbit.net
20:51 <+o_be_one> EastByte, sure, no vali and no cheaters, ya :D
20:51 <@EastByte> o_be_one: ya maybe they are gone^^
21:20 < laxa> deen: there is a fucking bug in the tournament map :(
21:22 <+o_be_one> EastByte, i only blacklist very bad guys (whos cheating everytime or ddosing) on firewall, for the other its just regular ban :)
21:22 <@EastByte> o_be_one: so how many of them do not have a dynamic ip?
21:23 <@EastByte> well atleast ddosers are behind a proxy so it's useful
21:26 <@deen> o_be_one: i'm very much against bans
21:26 <@deen> I'd rather try to talk to "bad players"
21:26 < Nimda> Fried by Hake just released on moderate at 2014-10-12 19:47
21:31 <@deen> hm
21:31 <@deen> so it turns out only chile was 30 players lower today
21:31 <@deen> otherwise we would have had a new ddnetpeak
21:31 <@deen> well, and Persian was 20 emptier
21:31 <@deen> but europe had 320 players
21:34 <@deen> that's good, that the ddos attacks didn't kill the european community
21:37 <+o_be_one> EastByte, easy to rangeban
21:37 <+o_be_one> deen, me too and youve seen that the real problem is only people like nazar
21:37 <+o_be_one> i'm alway available to engage a talk, every if banned
21:38 <+o_be_one> but when you talk 343 times and nothing changes ...
21:38 <@EastByte> range bans mostly aren't effective
21:38 <@EastByte> my own ip is in a different subnet/range everyday
21:38 <+o_be_one> what do you think ? ive tried to talk with vali and nazar since 1 year ... i know them more than you can know them ...
21:39 <+o_be_one> EastByte, well as you like ;). But about me, ive never had problem with dyn ip, always win the "ban game" and i hate whos bypass.
21:39 <+o_be_one> and, vali was banned and thats why he started these big ddos, just he cant bypass my bans
21:39 <+o_be_one> and you think he cant just change ip ?
21:39 <@EastByte> banning might stop trolls from spaming the chat
21:40 <+o_be_one> about chat, just mute, best way
21:40 <@EastByte> but attacks always come from somewhere else
21:41 <+o_be_one> well just to let you know, 10 years moderating on very heavy communitys and networks ^^ i'm very experienced in that :p
21:42 <+o_be_one> wow 57 players currently on blmapV3ROYAL :o
21:42 < laxa> deen: is the tournament over ?
21:42 <@deen> yes
21:42 < laxa> team size is still 2 players
21:42 < laxa> is that normal ?
21:42 <@deen> yes
21:42 < laxa> pl
21:42 < laxa> ok
21:42 <@deen> mappers want it to stay 2 forever!
22:12 < laxa> Someone wanna watch with me : The good the bad and the ugly ?
22:23 < laxa> deen: welf will fix the bug I found on tournament map
22:44 < laxa> deen: marge down !
22:45 <@deen> huh?
22:45 <@deen> wow...
22:45 <@EastByte> ...
22:45 <@deen> this hoster is weird
22:45 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
22:46 <@deen> o_be_one: you should have said that their servers go down every day :P
22:47 <@EastByte> if this would have happened while tournament...
22:47 <@deen> I really don't know what they're doing
22:47 <+o_be_one> deen, i dont monitor my servers, but when i play never seen down, its very curious that you had these problems ...
22:47 <@deen> all other servers run incredibly stable compared to that
22:48 <@deen> o_be_one: their dedicated servers go down all the time
22:48 <@deen> so all vps on them as well
22:48 <@deen> 3rd time now
22:48 <@deen> and at some point they destroyed the firewall so no connections came through for 5 minutes
22:48 <@deen> and 10 min later again
22:48 < laxa> They just have an undiagnosticed problem I guess
22:49 < laxa> once it's fixed, should be no more downtime
22:50 < laxa> They say the kernel has been updated
22:50 <@deen> and they couldn't at least announce that they would update it?...
22:50 < laxa> it was an unexpected down
22:51 <+o_be_one> deen, the bad thing with harmonyhosting is that they only communicate on irc
22:51 <+o_be_one> ive already told them to announce on twitter and mail
22:51 <+o_be_one> idk why they dont do that -_-
22:51 <@deen> that's great since they don't say anywhere on which server their irc channel even is :P
22:52 <+o_be_one> on theyr website you have the irc support shown :p
22:53 < laxa> yeah, but no server address, you need to use the IRC chat connection to get it
22:54 <+o_be_one> ok
22:54 <+o_be_one> its klat00.org
22:54 <+o_be_one> irc.klat00.org
22:54 <@deen> yeah, i know
23:00 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
