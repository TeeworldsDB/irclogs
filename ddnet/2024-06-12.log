05:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> weird
08:20 <+bridge> <0xdeen> So you're saying the full disk encryption is making your server less secure by not having security updates, interesting! ðŸ˜„
08:20 <+bridge> <0xdeen> If an attacker can infiltrate your running server, the disk encryption is useless anyway.
08:46 <+bridge> <learath2> Exactly, I was young and dumb and excited to try something new. Now I need to find a dozen hours of free time to copy over stuff and have downtime so I can remove it
11:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:45 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> will ddnet implement !addwar?  everybody does it
11:47 <+bridge> <louis> only block players use that command, you'll have to find some block or other custom client if you want that functionality
11:56 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> lol
11:56 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> i thought you want me to use ddnet client
12:13 <+bridge> <zhn> use whatever you want to use
12:14 <+bridge> <zhn> besides cheats and bot clients
12:23 <+bridge> <teero777> Is there a way to keep the prediction working even if you spec?
12:43 <+bridge> <yrrr_> its hardcoded in the source code iirc
13:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> why would you want that tho
13:15 <+bridge> <zhn> ye same question
13:25 <+bridge> <godly13> Guys
13:25 <+bridge> <godly13> Very need servers near turkey, because so hard playing without good ping
13:25 <+bridge> <godly13> Allways lag
13:25 <+bridge> <godly13> My the best ping is 70 (ger2)
13:35 <+bridge> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1250413114202001458/Screenshot_20240612-133459.png?ex=666ad975&is=666987f5&hm=17f3b4d303ead9c0c6fc398d37c0374b5c2b6be182ad2402808fb7d3928b4c7e&
13:36 <+bridge> <jxsl13> There is a server in Turkey
14:20 <+bridge> <godly13> Very need tur servers xd
14:56 <+bridge> <peter0x44> But there are "tur servers"?
14:56 <+bridge> <peter0x44> Oh nvm maybe not
14:57 <+bridge> <peter0x44> Something happened with the host I guess
15:23 <+bridge> <jxsl13> is the turkey server down?
15:24 <+bridge> <jxsl13> might have looked at the wrong location. should have looked at the live stats, I guess
15:32 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Tur server is probably leratos raspberry pi
15:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And the land lord cut electricity again because lerato is never in turkey and stopped paying the bills
15:37 <+bridge> <egyt> nitpick: in one place it says 2013-2023 and in the other it says 2013-2022
15:37 <+bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1250443750065307710/bildo.png?ex=666af5fe&is=6669a47e&hm=65b867d2d7998ec58a0682765d6a426aaf76d1c88c95224ad72a44090f264cc0&
16:45 <+bridge> <murpi> @learath2 Could you please recompile @SkinDB? It seems that the changes from this [PR](https://github.com/ddnet/discord-skin-upload-bot/pull/2) haven't been applied yet.
16:46 <+bridge> <learath2> building
16:49 <+bridge> <learath2> @murpi restarted
16:49 <+bridge> <murpi> @louis.place Can you try again?
16:51 <+bridge> <louis> works @murpi thanks
16:53 <+bridge> <murpi> Thanks :)
18:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> so who broke practice mode
18:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Was probably broken since the very start
18:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe
18:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> but it seems to be disabled
18:09 <+bridge> <learath2> It's disabled, because we found a bug that has probably existed since the start
18:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Is that specific enough?
18:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh the exploit
18:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> cool
18:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> has anyone stated what the bug actually is? - im interested
18:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> probably intentionally not
18:11 <+bridge> <meloÆž> makes sense that these messages got purged before turning off the feature ig
18:11 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm since practice is disabled perhaps there is no harm
18:21 <+bridge> <archimede67> Please share sir Learath2
18:22 <+bridge> <learath2> @murpi any reason you didn't share it? I'm tired I might not be thinking correctly ðŸ˜„
18:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> i respect the restraint
18:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> t0 mode related perhaps
18:26 <+bridge> <meloÆž> >  that has probably existed since the start
18:26 <+bridge> <meloÆž> > that has probably existed since the start
18:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah
18:38 <+bridge> <louis> my moneys on something atrocious like you go into /practice and deactivate a switch then on the same tick the practice team disbands and a new team is created and the switch is disabled for that one tick
18:40 <+bridge> <meloÆž> yeah i expect it has to do with the lifetime of a state that can be abused using practice somehow
18:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'm guessing that the exploiters have a satellite pointed directly at their ddnet server with a transmitter emitting cancerous amounts of gamma rays
18:42 <+bridge> <louis> alright bets are in
19:20 <+bridge> <jxsl13> hot take: he just forgot what it was.
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://docs.rs/arbitrary/latest/arbitrary/trait.Arbitrary.html#impl-Arbitrary%3C'a%3E-for-(K,+L,+M,+N,+O,+P,+Q,+R,+S,+T,+U,+V,+W,+X,+Y,+Z,+J)
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> epic rust

20:43 <+bridge> <murpi> Yes, just like any exploit it's better to wait until we have a fix for it, else people could use it on ddrock for example too
21:03 <+bridge> <learath2> What on earth?
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz rust lacks variadics rn
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its made from a macro
21:58 <+bridge> <learath2> How is this a variadic though? It's bizarre
21:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 its implemented more times for different num of arguments
22:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this is just the impl for lots xd
22:00 <+bridge> <learath2> It looks more like just a very roundabout way to cast an array of bytes to struct
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> this looks like disgusting C preprocessor shit that you'd theoretically be trying to avoid
23:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> @scrumplex do you still host a skinprox instance? looking for your list of hosts
23:15 <+bridge> <teero777> This? https://skins.scrumplex.net/
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
23:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> i tried proxy.scrumplex.net and skinprox.scrumplex.net :feelsbadman:
23:16 <+bridge> <teero777> :owo:
23:23 <+bridge> <scrumplex> ðŸ‘€
