02:53 < Chucky_> hi deen 
10:11 < laxa_work> deen: I am at school, I'll try the server.
11:18 < laxa_work> deen: ok, I feel like the pathing to launch server on Mac OS is fucked
11:19 < laxa_work> the easiest way is to use terminal and then launch the server using a storage.cfg
11:19 < laxa_work> then it should be good
11:19 < laxa_work> or maybe I am doing it wrong and DDNet-Server.app should go on some other place than Application...

16:50 <@deen> hi
16:50 < laxa_work> hi
16:50 < EastBite> hi deen 
16:50 < laxa_work> I have written about mac stuff deen, you should read my text from ~ 11:20
16:51 <@deen> i did, but i can't fix the mac stuff
16:51 <@deen> You can talk to HMH or fix it yourself :P
16:51 < laxa_work> just provde a storage.cfg with good path and mac uers should be able to laucnh server withut using terminal
16:51 < laxa_work> I hate my mac keyboard grrr
17:06 <@deen> Noone fixes map bugs except me =/
17:07 <@deen> I haven't fixed for one day and already 6 threads in forum
17:08 < EastBite> that's not how it should work^^
17:09 <@deen> When I ask people to fix the bugs they say they don't want to do it and won't report any anymore
17:09 <@deen> Really difficult to find helpers
17:11 < EastBite> but there are so many mappers
17:11 <@deen> yeah, but they're lazy. some don't even fix their own maps
17:15 < EastBite> players who want to report a map bug should upload a fixed map versions aswell
17:15 <@deen> i tried, they won't do that
17:16 <@deen> "too much work" they say
17:16 < EastBite> well, you could add a rule and remove threads if they don't listen :D
17:19 < EastBite> deen: didn't ddnet have a bug tracker for maps before?
17:21 <@deen> yes we did
17:21 < EastBite> so it didn't work out well?
17:21 <@deen> and people said it's too complicated, so they didn't use it and I had to write their stuff in there myself
17:21 <@deen> EastBite: it's no problem for them, they just won't tell about bugs
17:24 < EastBite> fixing map bugs also is more like a dirty job
17:25 < EastBite> we would need a map manager as webservice with webgl map editor
17:25 < EastBite> about 4 clicks should be enough to fix a single tile bug
17:28 <@deen> no^^
17:30 < EastBite> then you need to hire somenoe for money, otherwise nobody will do it^^
17:36 <@deen> the discussion is probably moot anyway, since ddnet won't live much longer
17:44 < EastBite> why wouldn't it live much longer?
17:44 < EastBite> the ranks might be really important for some players
17:45 < EastBite> you could just keep the servers running
17:46 <@deen> nice people are working on ddrace bots to destroy ddnet
17:47 <@deen> and they want to make them public
17:47 < EastBite> coding a racing bot is a big challenge
17:47 <@deen> nono, not an autonomous one
17:47 <@deen> just to help people make better times, finishing harder maps
17:48 < EastBite> hm that sounds kind of normal
17:49 < EastBite> won't destroy the fun of ddrace
17:50 <@deen> but it will destory ddnet ranks and points
17:50 < EastBite> I guess about 40% of the top runners didn't use a normal client
17:56 <@deen> i see most of them using ddnet client
17:56 < EastBite> and what do other games do about cheating? :D
17:57 <@deen> they have accounts that cost money and ban players, which costs them money
17:57 < EastBite> hm ya right
17:59 < EastBite> in an opensource project a web of trust might fix the problem in the same way
18:00 <@deen> please no
18:01 < EastBite> I'm just speculating
18:01 < o_be_one> hi :)
18:01 < EastBite> hi
18:06 < laxa> ddnet will live deen, coding such bot is not easy at all.
18:06 < EastBite> but it is easy to add small/mid advantages
18:07 < laxa> I really don't get how
18:07 < laxa> please enlight me :)
18:07 < EastBite> left/right movement for example
18:08 < laxa> don't need any bot for that
18:08 < laxa> if people are smart
18:08 < laxa> they could use macros 
18:09 < laxa> deen: could I ask you to do a little thing ? :p
18:10 < laxa> I guess, when you get last finishes on ddnet.tw/rank, you also get the rank, could you display it ?
18:10 < EastBite> deen also said that he currently is busy :P
18:11 < laxa> ah fuck
18:11 < EastBite> already*
18:11 < laxa> I thought he wasn't anymore, since he talked to you :p
18:13 < laxa> I wanna code the plugin for nimda, that displays rank
18:13 <@deen> laxa: they have it working already
18:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Tobii- opened pull request #39: Fix: Rcon spoofing protection bans clients after password change (DDRace64...rconfix) http://git.io/6JPAcw
18:14 < laxa> weird
18:14 <@deen> that nimda plugin shouldn't use the website, otherwise it only prints records every 20 min
18:14 < laxa> oh
18:15 <@deen> i could make that part of the site dynamic
18:15 <@deen> or we just scratch the idea because then the ddnet channel would be spammed all the time
18:15 < laxa> like you said, I make a variable config
18:16 < laxa> that set the rank number you need to get to display it

22:23 < Savander> nice
22:23 < Savander> it works for?

22:23 < Savander> ore more?

22:34 < EastBite> cool
22:34 <@deen> But now I need an interface so you can add people to comparisons without editing the URL
22:34 <@deen> I don't think normal people like editing URLs
22:35 < EastBite> yep
22:35 <@deen> that means i have to play around with html forms =/
22:35 < EastBite> :P
22:38 < Savander> javascript, "Add nickname" make new form
22:38 < Savander> send everything to get
22:38 < Savander> XD
22:38 < Savander> <lol>
22:38 < EastBite> js not needed
22:41 <@deen> i'll just do standard html forms and then parse them and redirect to the proper site with /name1/name2/name3
22:41 <@deen> or any better idea?
22:41 < EastBite> nope that's good
22:44 < laxa> Nice, but I won't use it, I don't think a lot of people will use it.
22:45 < laxa> I hope you'll have stats of people using it :).
22:45 < laxa> I am so happy ! Did my first pull request on github, it was accepter <3
22:55 <@deen> good job, laxa
23:00 < laxa> ok
23:00 < laxa> I got something weird
23:00 < laxa> #0 6 * * 3 /home/laxa/Teeworlds_servers/scripts/restart_server.sh
23:00 < laxa> it's in my crontab
23:00 < laxa> the script works fine when I use it, but when crontab uses it, it doesn't work
23:00 < laxa> any idea why ? x
23:02 <@deen> wrong path
23:02 <@deen> wrong environment variables
23:02 < laxa> all path are static
23:02 < laxa> can't be wrong
23:02 <@deen> wrong shell interpreter
23:04 < laxa> So weird, have no clue =x. And I added an echo in the script, I didn't received any e-mail about it...
23:05 <@deen> forgot the shebang?
23:05 < laxa> I'll check
23:05 < laxa> nop
23:07 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/qJjKPFbV
23:07 < laxa> top is the ServerLaunchScript called by the bottom of the page
23:08 < Savander> i don't remember
23:08 <@deen> environment stuff missing
23:08 < Savander> but crontab don't use
23:08 <@deen> most likely PATH
23:09 < laxa> how can I fix / debug ?
23:09 <@deen> nohup with full path
23:09 < Savander> environments paths?
23:09 < Savander> you need e.g
23:09 <@deen> or set PATH
23:09 < Savander> echo -> /bin/echo
23:09 < Savander> whereis <name>
23:09 <@deen> echo is builtin in bash :P
23:09 < Savander> but its example
23:09 < Savander> grep
23:09 < Savander> not i guess?
23:09 <@deen> correct
23:10 < Savander> root@ddforce:~# whereis grep grep: /bin/grep
23:10 < Savander> xD
23:10 < Savander> what is "nohup"?
23:11 < laxa> man nohup :)
23:11 <@deen> detach from terminal
23:11 <@deen> so the process doesn't die when your terminal closes
23:12 < Savander> ah
23:12 < Savander> i use screen
23:12 < Savander> ;-;
23:12 <@deen> i use it all the time for ddnet
23:12 < Savander> i prefer screen
23:12 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/run-all.sh
23:12 <@deen> I wouldn't like to have 150 screen sessions running^^
23:12 < Savander> maybe
23:12 < Savander> but i have scripts
23:12 < Savander> so i can close all screens
23:12 <@deen> screen wastes memory!
23:13 < Savander> close only screens for each gametype etc
23:13 < Savander> meh, 
23:13 < Savander> 43 servers 
23:13 < Savander> -> 430mb using ram with players
23:13 < Savander> i have 1gb
23:13 < Savander> so i don't care
23:13 < Savander> :P
23:13 <@deen> RAM is always low on DDNet
23:14 < Savander> and! First time i heard about nohup 
23:18 < EastBite> I use tmux
23:19 <@deen> dtach!
23:19 <@deen> dtach - simple program that emulates the detach feature of screen.
23:20 < EastBite> what do you need that for?
23:20 <@deen> i use it all the time
23:20 <@deen> my irssi runs inside a dtach session
23:20 <@deen> all my terminals actually, so I can just restart X and they keep running
23:21 < EastBite> didn't try it yet
23:23 < EastBite> hm dtach and tmux seem to be pretty similar
23:23 <@deen> not really
23:23 <@deen> tmux is a multiplexer, like screen
23:23 < EastBite> both have panes and stuff?
23:23 <@deen> no, dtach does not
23:23 <@deen> dtach just detaches your session and reattaches it, that's all
23:23 <@deen> i think?
23:24 < laxa> why is it better than screen then ?
23:24 <@deen> it's more lightweight!
23:24 < EastBite> okay then I just saw the wrong screens
23:24 < EastBite> screen is really old and ugly
23:24 <@deen> the screens use window managers
23:24 <@deen> terminal window managers*
23:24 < laxa> kill `ps aux | grep -v "grep" | grep "/home/laxa/Teeworlds_servers/" | awk ' { print $2 } '`
23:24 < EastBite> tmux is like a modern screen with nicer features
23:24 < laxa> crontab doesn't like this
23:24 < laxa> why ?!
23:24 <@deen> i don't like it either
23:25 < laxa> xD
23:25 <@deen> because one of these programs is not in the PATH
23:25 <@deen> do an echo $PATH
23:25 <@deen> and look what's different from the normal one
23:26 < laxa> boah
23:26 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/compare/deen/milk/
23:26 < laxa> it's different :p
23:26 <@deen> Top right corner
23:26 < EastBite> http://ddnet.tw/compare/deen/milk/east/
23:26 < EastBite> works
23:26 < EastBite> also I'm the awesome one there
23:27 <@deen> Rank unranked?!
23:27 <@deen> ah, i stop counting ranks at some point
23:27 < EastBite> lol this is strange
23:27 <@deen> what?
23:27 < EastBite> Rivendell1133:5430:3030:3080.74.74.
23:27 < EastBite> ^ bad c&p
23:28 < EastBite> yes I shouldn't have ranks there
23:28 <@deen> you finished with milk in team?
23:28 <@deen> oooh
23:28 < EastBite> :D
23:28 < EastBite> I finished every map with him :P
23:28 <@deen> eeeh
23:28 <@deen> congratulations i guess
23:28 < EastBite> ye
23:29 < EastBite> I'm a top rank player you know
23:29 < laxa> deen: any idea why the crontab doesn't send anymore email with output ?
23:29 <@deen> you have to write on stderr?
23:30 < laxa> ok
23:31 < laxa> Wtf is wrong... Even when setting the proper PATH, it's not working -_-
23:34 <@deen> i think it's fixed
23:35 <@deen> crazy python
23:35 < EastBite> oh I have some better map ranks then milk
23:36 <@deen> yeah, he doesn't play for rank
23:36 < EastBite> Points (8427 total)
23:36 < EastBite> 1. with 6800 points
23:36 < EastBite> Team Rank
23:36 < EastBite> 4. with 1776 points
23:36 < EastBite> Rank
23:36 < EastBite> 2. with 1961 points
23:36 < EastBite> ofcourse not
23:36 <@deen> that just happens because he has so many finishes
23:36 < EastBite> hm yes
23:36 <@deen> but i've never seen him speedrun anything
23:37 <@deen> we could do ranks divided by points, but then people wouldn't finish maps, except when fast
23:37 <@deen> which i don't like
23:37 <@deen> we just have too many maps for global ranks to be meaningful, noone can finish them all
23:38 <@deen> It's a lot more reasonable on Novice
23:38 < EastBite> it also is fun to "collect" map finishes
23:38 < EastBite> I actually wanted to finish all novice maps
23:38 <@deen> Yes, so many points addicted players
23:38 <@deen> comparisons may help, because now you can compare to your friends and try to finish the maps they have
23:39 <@deen> Rolf asked me to make it so the 4 ddmax people can find maps none of them have finished
23:39 < EastBite> reminds me to other games
23:39 < EastBite> 4 ddmax people :D
23:40 <@deen> Obst, Rolf, Ark, hohesC
23:40 < EastBite> we all were ddmax players
23:40 <@deen> yeah, but they are admins, testers and stuff
23:40 < EastBite> ah
23:40 <@deen> like laxa!!
23:40 < laxa> ?
23:40 <@deen> you are ddmax admin!
23:41 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/players/deen/
23:41 < laxa> Well, I am not sure xD
23:41 <@deen> Compare button, top right
23:41 < laxa> I still have rcon if that's what you mean
23:41 < laxa> but I am not really considered admin anymore I think
23:41 <@deen> aaa also admin!
23:41 <@deen> Anqel too!
23:42 <@deen> noother is the only ddmax admin not playing on ddnet?
23:42 < laxa> noother doesn't play teeworlds anymore
23:42 < laxa> for a long time
23:42 < laxa> I am trying to motivate him to come play next tournament :p
23:42 <@deen> or watch it!
23:42 <@deen> watching tournaments is so much fun
23:43 < laxa> noother is more of a gamer I think
23:43 < EastBite> you only here from noother if he has to fight with ddos
23:43 < laxa> he has more than 2000 games on steam
23:43 <@deen> crazy
23:43 <@deen> i haven't played any game except teeworlds for years
23:43 < EastBite> I'm just testing games whether they run well on linux and delete them afterwards :D
23:44 < laxa> 1504 games my bad
23:44 < EastBite> ah
23:44 < laxa> and he plays on linux, but maybe with wine
23:44 < EastBite> interesting
23:44 < laxa> he is a true fan of challenges too
23:44 < laxa> !wc noother
23:44 < Nimda> noother is ranked 35 from 10225, linked to 53 sites with an average of 28.38% solved. noother has a totalscore of 202413. noother needs 1357 points to rankup.
