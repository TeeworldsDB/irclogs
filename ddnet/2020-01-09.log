04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> yo i got a question
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> bcs of the ddnet ts3
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> i got banned before like 2 years ago idk
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> reason: "you know why"
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> i think 2y is enaugh ban maybe a bit more maybe a bit more light idk but loooong time
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> so if some one would ask some whone who could ask some one who can unban me would be great
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> ty
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> ‚ù§Ô∏è
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> the ts3 is dead but idk ask whoever runs the serv
06:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> laxa runs it
10:14 <+laxa> Cha: what do you mean by its dead ? Its been up and running since many years and some people are still coming
10:15 <+laxa> Bambikiller: its not your judgement to make. I have no idea what you did, but since I banned many people, I dont have people complaining about other's people behavior. I dont wanna make the police and deal with people issue. A banlife is a banlife, next time, think about your actions before actually doing them.
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Another solution to not having to deal with peoples issue is giving them a bit of freedom üôÇ
10:19 <+laxa> They are free to create their own channel and stuff on my teamspeak and go and leave as they want, isnt it enough ?
10:19 <+laxa> They also have the freedom to switch to any channel and private message anyone
10:19 <+laxa> This second part is actually what got some people banned, because they were switching to other channel to annoy people
10:20 <+laxa> Or some other leaked some private pictures of others
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Well seems like you spend some time dealing with bans
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Leaks will find other ways
10:20 <+laxa> Yes, and I dont want deal with that
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yea then why do it :p
10:20 <+laxa>  <ChillerDragon> Leaks will find other ways // this comments say it all. Because it will have other ways, it should stay unpunished ?
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm
10:21 <+laxa> It really makes me angry to read such bullshit
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Punishment is wrong anyways
10:21 <+laxa> I dont wanna have this conversation anyway, leads to nothing
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It should be censored imo
10:21 <+laxa> you cant censor Internet
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Punishment leads to anger and revenge in my opinion
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> You can‚Äôt ban the internet either
10:22 <+laxa> Yeah, but on my Teamspeak I can choose who to ban or not, thats the current topic
10:23 <+laxa> people have freedom, if they dont deserve it or dont follow the guidelines of the teamspeak, they are ban. Period.
10:23 <+laxa> end of discution
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
10:23 <+laxa> People not respecting the freedom of others should pay the consequences. Thats my opinion.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I see
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And who decides who has to pay the consequences?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The person who does not want to deal with the details?
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Imagine I filed a complaint with faked screenshots a dramatic story and a friend proofing it. Would you ban?
10:26 <+laxa> Yeah, thats a biased opinion but I tried to quickly analyze "every complaint" that was made. Most people complained about people switching to other channels. Its pretty easy to analyze with the logs.
10:26 <+laxa> If I couldnt decide who was wrong or not in mood to deal with that, I just ignores it
10:26 <+laxa> but yeah, thats biased, I am not a judge or anything
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ok no but that sounds good üôÇ
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Your ‚ÄûI do not want to deal with it‚Äú scared me a bit
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But checking logs and ignoring on missing evidence sounds great ‚ù§Ô∏è
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I guess you do a good job there. Was just my weekly attempt in the war of bans.
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> BTW isn‚Äôt it possible to rate limit channel hopping? Or even rate limit it for specific persons instead of banning.
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Banning always feels like fighting the result of the problem not the actual problem.
10:31 <+laxa> it doesnt fix the problem. I dont wanna loose time finding the configuration for that then
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Why wouldn‚Äôt it fix it?
10:31 <+laxa> You can still switch channels
10:32 <+laxa> and I dont think teamspeak offer such feature anyway
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But after a few times too slow to be annoying
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm :/
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/Yp?c review my attempt at writing more c++ish code
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pls @heinrich5991 &&|| @deen
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pstd ‚ù§Ô∏è
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/664803820638961675/image0.png
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh rip line numbers :/
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 is FILE and fprintf c++? :p
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really, but those are only for debugging, they also triggered the elitist people in ##c++
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> üòÑ
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seriously, I thought ##C was unfriendly but that C++ channel...
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you aren't using smart pointers, 50 templates and boost, they just don't help at all
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> c++ sucks
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> smart pointers can be nice
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was @Learath2, not ChillerDragon
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But in this case, it'd be a lot of work
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I think this is a level of C++ where I can't really say much
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `m_LastID` is thread-unsafe and misnamed (it's the next id)
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't seem to like the `= nullptr;` initialization inside the class, do you? ^^
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I hacked lastid in to let me draw the graph, I should get it threadsafe
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 oh, I'm just not used to it
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should definitely initialize like that
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't you just use the node's addr as the ID?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in C++, I think you'd not deal with function pointers but rather accept a template parameter for the function so that you can call it with lambdas
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should also read up on std::function
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think the nodes address would work with graphviz
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not? I thought it can be an arbitrary string
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well "-" didn't work too well in labels when I used -1 as null
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> example dot input ply
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plz
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I can't really generate it anymore
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I had `l-1` as a node
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://stackoverflow.com/q/18444406
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like you can use pointers as names
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the hyphen was probably the problem
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but stuff without hyphen should work without quotes I guess
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what r u working on?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Getting used to c++17
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And learning katakana
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im working a lot with golang
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Good compiled language for backend
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi , i replaced https://update4.ddnet.tw/%s with my link and created update.json in my host with new version , but client does not read the update.json , when i launch DDNet client it says DDNet 12.8.1 is out! ( i changed the last version ) and when i press Update it says update failed. whats wrong?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Bambikiller: its not your judgement to make. I have no idea what you did, but since I banned many people, I dont have people complaining about other's people behavior. I dont wanna make the police and deal with people issue. A banlife is a banlife, next time, think about your actions before actually doing them.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Wtf are these words
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> The reason I was banned is so dump
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well do you know the reason they give it to you?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> I got banned bcs I chilled there and player who don't like me they go to a admin they know who ban me for no reason
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> "you know why"
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Fuck ddnet admins I know 2 now and both of them really bad admins
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i wonder if it's a new admin or it's from before 2 years
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well you can share your confidence here so those admins can be settled
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or mods i don't really know
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> I hope good admin will see and make bad admin leave fucking ddnet
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> I mean what ddnet got of those useless shit
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then don't say it to jao :troll:
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the ts is not regulated by ddnet admins
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its laxas own personal ts and jhe was kind enough to let us use it
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> But I am here to find a ts admin
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> he answered
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> hes the admin of his own ts and decides what happens on it
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you can go to #off-topic for any manner tbh, here are just development reports and related stuff
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> He is stupid af
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> see it as a branded ddnet ts not an official one ran by us
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Laxa is fucking dumb
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> whatever u say thats not helping ur case and wont get u unbanned lol
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sounds like an old guy got accepted as mod
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also i personally would trust his judgement
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> But I can make her mad
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Maybe she try now ask admin here to ban me xs
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> alright, one question since i dont have anything to argue, what can you offer as an example for your ban appeal?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> to get unbanned
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> I got banned bcs player don't like me and go to admin they know to ban me I remember that and than cunt owner like laxa came and think they are right with it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> That's stupid
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> For real
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> when was it? when you got banned
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> 2y ago maybe
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u got banned for leaking personal pictures
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Wtf
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> ?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so you did not abuse any manner of bug, not swear any higher role staff and not harm the server in any way
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hmm seems like 2 years without these reasons arent suppose to be this long
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> No wtf haha no Haram
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wait
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i see
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> personal data sharing is really a crime i guess
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Uhh it's not blmap
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> especially if everybody can be harmed by this and targeted by anyboidy
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> I think
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bambikiller> Ddnet and bw not same shit sorry for your bad arguments
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Bambikiller lol if you speak wkrh this language i would have banned you too on my teamspeak. Why would i want people with a bad additude hanging around and ruining the mood.

19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @jao you banned that idiot?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Good job. One less
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/664913280027983899/image0.jpg
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Bois ipv420 with ips up to 999.999.999.999 xD
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I love how these movies always have some semi relatable elements and then they change it in a hilarious way
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It‚Äôs like tech comedy
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> lmfao
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> background is always falling binary
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> with the "Attacking Firewall" green progress bar
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and they type non stop without watching screen
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I wonder if it is made on purpose or people actually don‚Äôt know it better in the movie industry
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I mean I get that matrix style stuff looks cool but all the code snippets would look the same way if they were slightly less random
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> i think its on purpose to look cool
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> some movies have actual code if theres like a coder on the directing team
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> but they usually dont hire a coder just for one scene
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it‚Äôs on purpose because it doesn‚Äôt matter
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it‚Äôs fast sequences and shit
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant notice it unless you pause
