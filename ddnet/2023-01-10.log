17:10 <+bridge> <Alexander> Someone should add a copy button to the server info tab for ip address
17:10 <+bridge> <Alexander> Cause I see people screenshot the ip in #reports which makes it harder for mods to join
17:11 <+bridge> <murpi> Robyte already did: #6245

17:12 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Doesn't ctrl+c just works fine?
17:13 <+bridge> <murpi> It does in the server browser, but hes refering to the server info tab
17:13 <+bridge> <Alexander> Epic
17:13 <+bridge> <Alexander> Yeah but less tech savvy people don't know that they can use ctrl + a and ctrl + c
17:14 <+bridge> <Alexander> A lot of people still rely on right click > copy
19:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im bummed, it looks like even ppl in the open source reverse engineering world use IDA instead of guidra, which honestly i cant blame, why would ghidra use an anncient python 2 version for scripting
19:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> guess ill have to put a hat
19:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and sail
19:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> There is also java for scripting in ghidra
19:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> I also much prefer the decompiler output of ghidra ngl
19:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the ff14 community decided on using IDA
19:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is some support for ghidra but it looks like an afterthought
19:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs
19:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just want to load the existing work, it requires me to use python 2 and install a dep onto ghidra via pip, which is not possible cuz older pip support is not supported
19:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it simply doesnt work xd
19:09 <+bridge> <deen> No idea why such an ancient Firefox version has a community still
19:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> XD
19:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> deen the troll
19:09 <+bridge> <deen> Makes more sense than Final Fantasy 14, since that's even older ðŸ˜„
19:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
19:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why do cool games need to use c#
19:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> all the interesting things i wanna mod use it
19:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my life sucks
19:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> Well unity is probably the reason for most
19:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> unreal supports c# right
19:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think ffxiv uses unreal 3
19:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway terraria is xna and uses c#
19:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> factorio uses lua, blegh
19:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> Unreal has no scripting in it
19:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> No c# either
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> meh i probs shouldnt get into reverse engineering with such a big thing  such as ffxiv
19:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or idk
19:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> Do some crackmes
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah they use this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_Engine
19:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye  started doing some some time ago
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but its like programming, its more fun if u do something that interests you
19:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yep, do some teeworlds bots maybe?
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are u 100% they always include backdoors
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> otherwise i would just look at script kiddy code
19:17 <+bridge> <Learath2> Not always, but you see some very funny stuff
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if u know some send me a dm
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for research purposes
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (first time i said this legit kek)
19:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> There is one popular bot client that has all the licenses built in, so the guy has to update it whenever he sells a new one ðŸ˜„
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
19:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can try to reverse engineer noby's verified client
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @noby
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but would noby but a backdoor
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but would noby put a backdoor
19:20 <+bridge> <Learath2> I didn't spot one. Goodguy noby
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i found a target to check
19:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whose name i wont mention to not invoke  the wrath of heinrich
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u do it all from scratch or u somehow loaded some symbols from somwhere?
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or used the source code as help
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> from tw
19:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well having knowledge about the layout of tw probs helps
19:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so it wont be as reaslitic as a closed source game i guess
19:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> I once tried to import system.h to help. But I usually do just go at it from scratch
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u just import the exe right?
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> does importing dlls help
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk if u can even do that
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> iit probs doesnt make sense xD
19:50 <+bridge> <axel_vestin> is there a way to get map splits from server?
19:52 <+bridge> <ReiTW> u didn't spot it cuz of nobyC
19:52 <+bridge> <ReiTW> u didn't spot it cuz of nobyC :giga_chad:
20:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 any good resource that doesnt involve buying a book to learn more
20:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> Mh, no idea. I learned just poking around and watching youtube videos
20:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i think there are more yt vids than blogs
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer written
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess too many h4x0rs like videos
21:00 <+bridge> <Shire> .

21:07 <+bridge> <KDaniel> rust ist already installed*
21:07 <+bridge> <KDaniel> or is the version important?
21:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that doesnt look like a rust version problem
21:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but the linker struggles, so either the symbol is hidden for some reason
21:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> Looks more like a linking issue, but I dont speak the german
21:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or the linker doesnt work with that bridge

21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> When you do /save on a map, the server says something like currently:
21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> ```
21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> Use "/load abc" if the save was successful or "/load Onion Tomato Burger" if it failed.
21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> ```
21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> I think the message was different some versions before.
21:41 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> Welf changed that because we had problems with the dbs i guess? The message is very confusing imo because the user does not know what the code is exactly, is it possible to change that?

21:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah I was never very happy with that. I think we are about to change it
21:45 <+bridge> <Patiga> > Team save in progress. You'll be able to load with '/load abc' if save is successful or with '/load panda hers union' if it fails
21:45 <+bridge> <Patiga> > Team successfully saved by Patiga. Use '/load abc' to continue
21:45 <+bridge> <Patiga> yes, can probably be improved, Zwelf should know best what is possible there

21:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why not for 2022
21:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think Zwelf or deen wanted to try making save codes non-unique
21:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> (Team members + map + code) would be unique instead
22:00 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Yeah, that would be the fix. The problem with that would be, that we would not be able to give hints about which player is missing/which player is not in the team when loading.
22:00 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Yeah, that would be the fix. The problem with that is, that we would not be able to give hints about which player is missing/which player is not in the team when loading.
22:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ye idk if I like that. What was the issue that made us randomly generate codes anyway?
22:01 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Note that the "Team save in progress" message is just an additional message when the database connection takes long. The final message which save code to use will come later.
22:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Can't we first make sure the code is unique and available, insert it into the db with a null save so it cant be loaded yet than save the team?
22:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, except when the db is unavailable
22:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why using old rust
22:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> should be new enough
22:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @KDaniel what did you do to get this error message?
22:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what did you try to compile? how did you load ddnet into msvc++? which version of ddnet is that?
22:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> It should still end up on the local sqlite, maybe we shouldn't plan around the exceptional case? It is a little weird what we do with the random code
22:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you propose happens when the save code is a duplicate? it's simply lost?
22:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the code currently inserts it into the local db first (this way makes sure that it'll definitely persist), then inserts it into the global db, and then removes it from the local db again
22:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but for the local db, it can only use the random code
22:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what might work is only mentioning the random code after a short timeout
22:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> In the case of a hopefully unlikely duplicate we can manually append a number or sth
22:10 <+bridge> <KDaniel> I have created my folder with 
22:10 <+bridge> <KDaniel> git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
22:10 <+bridge> <KDaniel> and then I have a cmake gui with which I run the cmake and the configure and build. Then I tried to run client as well as server. Rust etc was already installed before
22:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then we can't tell the user the save code
22:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because we don't know hte number while saving
22:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'll try that as well, haven't worked with the cmake gui yet
22:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want, you could try the native cmake integration in the meantime
22:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> How about we keep a list of save codes in memory incase the connection dies, so we atleast know most of the codes
22:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> Just how long of a database outage do we have to be prepared for anyway?
22:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> completely gone
22:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hours
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> ```
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> e] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (project):
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> [cmake]   The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> [cmake] 
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> [cmake]     C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/Llvm/x64/bin/clang-cl.exe
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> [cmake] 
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> [cmake]   is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> ```
22:12 <+bridge> <KDaniel> if i try to compile and build it with vscode and select native cmake
22:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> with native, I meant opening the project folder (without using the cmake gui) with msvc++
22:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (unless that's already what you did)
22:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because vscode != msvc++
22:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this is why I was confused. but you used msvc++ and not vscode?
22:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> Mh, maybe we can special case the connection being alive? Idk I just don't like the UX with this
22:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree the UX could be improved
22:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we could output the save code only after a delay of 1-5 seconds
22:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> either the right one (if saving works) or both (if saving still didn't work after 5 seconds)
22:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @KDaniel the path `C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/Llvm/x64/bin/clang-cl.exe` does not exist on your system?
22:16 <+bridge> <KDaniel> i done a clean start
22:16 <+bridge> <KDaniel> i done a clean start... gimme a minute
22:19 <+bridge> <KDaniel> ok after i deleted out and build folder what got created by cmake gui or vscode.. msvc++ created the build folder and its running perfectly... but why sometime my msvc++ dont trigger the configure process if i open the folder
22:20 <+bridge> <KDaniel> this was first time the error happen to me since years
22:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know why it doesn't configure sometimes
22:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps because it's already configured?
22:21 <+bridge> <KDaniel> nah... i often try it like that. if its not get triggered i open cmake gui and then it works
22:21 <+bridge> <KDaniel> but thanks ðŸ™‚
22:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you're welcome ðŸ™‚
22:23 <+bridge> <KDaniel> you are all using msvc++? 
22:23 <+bridge> <KDaniel> like why not switching to vscode?
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we all linux fanboys
22:24 <+bridge> <KDaniel> didnt you use macOS?
22:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vulkan disagrees
22:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the build doesn't work in vscode?
22:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> Linuxgang

22:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gentoo gang
22:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> it works fine on windows for playing
22:27 <+bridge> <Chairn> less for developping ðŸ˜„
22:27 <+bridge> <KDaniel> :FeelsAatlantisMan:
22:27 <+bridge> <KDaniel> playing and programming on windows but like using servers i run it on linux
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but it's great that you're trying it out ðŸ™‚ deen also improved the mac build once he started using macos ^^
22:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> robyte is using windows
22:28 <+bridge> <KDaniel> the problem is im a big nub debugging on linux
22:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so best is to ask him, if vscode works, he might uses with with mingw tho
22:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have to debug more the macos issue
22:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i dont like using my mac
22:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6172
22:31 <+bridge> <KDaniel> ahh i got another question... i got a custom Server and want to write unit tests for it but i never saw it how you test connection dummies to server.. just the headless client thing.
22:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we only have the headless client/integration test thingy for that, unfortunately
22:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no good testing for this, sorry
22:32 <+bridge> <KDaniel> yea saw it on github actions. Is there away to controll the headless client.. not only giving command on startup
22:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you'd have to ask chillerdragon
22:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it is controlled at runtime
22:36 <+bridge> <KDaniel> i will do ask him some day.
22:56 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> Is there a reason we dont just give a random one if the db connection gets a timeout?
22:57 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> Is there a reason we dont just give a random code to the user if the db connection gets a timeout?
22:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, db connection might take a long time but not return an error
22:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hence I want to give the random code after the timeout
23:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> new version ðŸ˜… 
23:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
23:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> prepare for reverts
23:47 <+bridge> <Chairn> I see only translations commits, one from Robyt and yours
23:53 <+bridge> <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2  Could you update antibot on official servers?
