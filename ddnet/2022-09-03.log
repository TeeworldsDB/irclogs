08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it took me way to long to figure this out on my own LOL
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but now i'm at a point where i just need to test it and hope everything turns out well
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> One last thing before I submit: Is there another way to do this?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015521888417611786/unknown.png
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I did crunch it down like how the switch case in the hand position is treated, so that's a tiny bit better,
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I guess we can talk about it during submitting
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we usually do (float) style casts not float()
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ohh. Okay, thanks!
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This is C++, there are lots of different ways to do this. I think your way is fine. This way might be faster because it's just an array lookup, so O(1): 
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   static float s_aWeaponsFireDelay[] = {
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_HAMMER] = (float)1, // your real value here
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_GUN] = (float)2,
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_SHOTGUN] = (float)3,
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_GRENADE] = (float)4,
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_LASER] = (float)5,
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     [WEAPON_NINJA] = (float)6,
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   };
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   static_assert(NUM_WEAPONS == 6, "s_aWeaponsFireDelay has to be adapted to new weapons");
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   float Delay = Weapon >= 0 && Weapon < NUM_WEAPONS ? s_aWeaponsFireDelay[Weapon] : 1.0f;
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> To get rid of the magic number: `static_assert(NUM_WEAPONS == std::size(s_aWeaponsFireDelay), "s_aWeaponsFireDelay has to be adapted to new weapons");`
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Very useful! I'll try implementing that to see if it works!
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ends up with a lot of errors, mainly stating that `"WEAPON_X" is not a variable`
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It worked for me: https://gist.github.com/def-/803848b73547c508b8e968b45ad68c1d
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Odd. It might just be my Visual Studio then. I'll look into it tomorrow when I wake up.
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Odd. It might just be my Visual Studio then. I'll look into it tomorrow when I wake up, It's kind of late here.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Voxel is it possible to make the afk thing an option? I don't know how it looks like with like 10+ tees afk next to each other, also did you test in freeze how it looks?
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I could try and make AFK state an option. And in freeze the tee sits normally, holding no weapon.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Alright
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can also do it the way the server does it
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2346f221e1e938a686608404b502654aadf39901/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L603
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> didn't know that was possible till I saw some code from some XDP examples, this is amazing

13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Erik van Velzen Adam did some cool work! But just to be clear, I never thought you're being insincere with your intentions. I just don't think blockchain projects fit well into TW/DDNet
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Ok sorry for that just wanted to make the point you're right it had to be on a different topic

15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as already said by deen, you can use an array because enum values are automatically generated as following numbers starting from 0.
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> You don't need the float cast, it is implicit with the division by float number
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'll impliment an array cast soon
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't think that's necessary
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i guess but
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> anybody on the master issue?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what master issue?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> can only see half servers
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 560 instead of around 1020
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Chairn seems like i'm not the only one having that issue
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Harper_breey> It's a cryptocurrency investment which you can start with as little as $200 and earn a minimum of 8% profit weekly. You can also earn up to 16% profit weekly depending on which investment plan you invest in.

18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is master2.ddnet.tw a real running master or?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ReiTW
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> had the same
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1015680582983880914/unknown.png
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which master do you have set? ddnet.tw or ddnet.org ?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tw probably, i havent touched anything
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but its working again, it was just on that day
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i had like only a few servers, maybe 2 browser sizes
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's DoS attack, should work again
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah okay
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> someone really wants to destroy the whole game
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we really need to get blockchain in the game to prevent this :troll:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, same as for the last ~7 years non-stop
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yup. I always wonder how many problems someone has to have in order to do something like this without a reward
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Attacking big companies often is connected to getting money or whatever
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> seems fixed
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, deen fixed it
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea saw the msg
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Erik van Velzen To be honest, the idea of using crypto currency as a main objective for a game like this wouldn't cut it, since this game never received any micro transactions outside of third-party purchases from some teeworlds servers' services.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> My honest opinion about this would be that, we would kinda need a rework for a client which supports this idea.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> But rather to invest fully in crypto currency, it should be an alternative payment option of currency, under a well made trading system.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So, instead of using crypto currency **only** to **play some games**, we should concentrate on making a trading system, where we can sell quality items, like skins for any Asset (tee skin, weapons, particles, animations, etc) and have them under real life currency, so as a micro transaction would be.
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> It might also cause some trouble over Europe's gambling addiction rules, if crypto is being comforted on trading sides as part of interest to the game.
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> It could backfire real fast
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> summary:
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> shitty idea
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tf2 market ddnet version
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> sort of, I would like that tbh
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> ðŸ˜‚
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Davide what ðŸ¤¡
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> say it bravely
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> ?
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what would we sell in the ddnet market?
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well, if the client would be restricted, so that it gets skins from the ddnet skin database and **based on profile data** :justatest: , some skins would have different prizes, depending on quality, then it would be sold like that
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> what ddnet doesn't have it usage of the forum's profile system as part of login to ddnet
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> > It might also cause some trouble over Europe's gambling addiction rules, if crypto is being comforted on trading sides as part of interest to the game.
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> > It could backfire real fast
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> = Shitty idea
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> what ddnet doesn't have is usage of the forum's profile system as part of login to ddnet
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> How to ruin a good game:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> That's what I meant
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah that's what I was mentioning :v
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I thought it was for rudeness, mb then
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also with how moddable ddnet is wouldnt you think ppl will just... install the expensive items?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> with the current state of the client and the database, which is both accessible by anybody and open-source, yeah.
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it's not possible to do.
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> People wouldn't like microtransactions at all
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> true
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it has no benefits, but some people prefer on "having more value over the poor"
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so basically little monopoly
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> If you have the opportunity, try to lookup the first incoming IPv4 address(s) from the DoS if possible. It could be feasible that one of my scripts was used where I implemented an extra secret arg which you need to pass, otherwise the server will spoof the first packet(s) with its real IPv4 address(s) and false calculations.
