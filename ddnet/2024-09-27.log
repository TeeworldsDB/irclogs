02:15 < bridge> <Ewan> what‚Äôs up with you
03:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm 0.6 skin support for 0.7.6? xd
03:13 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds good
03:14 < bridge> <Ewan> don‚Äôt 0.6 and 0.7 skins have different dimensions? maybe you could just autodetect skins and store them in the same place
03:14 < bridge> <Ewan> assuming there aren‚Äôt conflicts
05:57 < bridge> <totar> Chiller queues up the PRs to submit them all at once lol
05:59 < bridge> <totar> this PR has flakey tests?

09:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> when you're back in germany we can go hiking one day :owo:
09:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> when you're back in Germany we can go hiking one day :owo: - i would also invite heinrich and fokkonaut, given these two are climbing/bouldering(?) iirc so they might be interested as well
09:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> or you can both play dis map https://ddnet.org/maps/Chill-32-Let-39-s-32-Climb-32-3

09:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> first time i see `bool32` xdd
09:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> is bool32 even a built-in type in c++ ?
09:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think it's a typedef to u32 or smth
09:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> sounds more like a typdef/enum to m

10:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> reference is a pointer with some weirdness, change my mind
10:05 < bridge> <oxyzo.> use skype instead
10:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also referenced are trol
10:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also references are trol
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> how so
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> i like int `func(const int &ref) {};`
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> more than
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> ` int func(int *ref) {};`
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> i also dislike that i have to dereference a pointer if i want to access the value
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> e.g `std::cout << *ref << std::endl;`

10:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> std
10:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> when you look at function call you don't know if it's passed by value or by reference
10:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> sry i'll add `using namespace std` next time :(
10:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i got fucked by it many times
10:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my skill issues probably :\
10:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> using namespace only hides the std
10:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs better to be open about your stds so others know
10:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> i love me some std's...
10:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> it's called "jump to definition" and it's great!
10:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The only thing cool in C++ are classes with methods
10:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my reptile brain only looks for `&` in function calls to know if it's passed by value or not
10:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: my language has methods on structs üòè

10:29 < bridge> <teero777> references can't be null aka. will always point to some memory. is 8bytes just as a pointer on 64bit systems
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah true, pointers always have to be initialized or they contain fancy garbage

11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> > kTLS lets the kernel (and, in turn, any network interface that supports it) take care of encryption, framing, etc., for the entire duration of a TLS connection... as soon as you have a TLS connection.

11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> > For the handshake itself (hellos, change cipher, encrypted extensions, certificate verification, etc.), you still have to use a userland TLS implementation.
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got dropped from 176.9.114.238:8341 and cant reconnect can anyone reproduce?
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can connect to other ger2 servers just fine
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok im back in after 3 minutes
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> weird
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah seems like my route to germany is really bad
11:31 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> chiller
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> did you like just randomly timeout from the server
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i have issues like that too
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea while staying connected to another one at the same time
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i blame the country im in
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i have to restart my game to rejoin
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im 200 ping away on a fakin island so i guess the bamboo routing drops me sometimes
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt have to restart just wait 4 minutes
11:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i had to wait until  my tee disconnected
11:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> if i didnt restart
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have a fixed cl_port not sure how much a restart would do 
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao all GER2 servers with 14 and less players work all with more players i can not connect to xd
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i miss germany
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm its not the player count its just only a few servers that work. Its weird because its the same ip. So it shouldnt be routing right?
12:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You need to set cl_port to 0 if you want to avoid this, it's a firewall thing
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ger2 has a firewall?
12:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> at least on ger10
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i never had issues with the fixed port in germany but good to know that it might happen
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when return to ddnet development fokko?
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need those 128 players

15:43 < bridge> <teero777> i found what i actually wanted to do btw
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the menu has capped fps
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> refresh rate of your monitor

15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> why lto false?
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs code-units costs like 30s extra compile time
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and lto like 5 minutes xD
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that build is already insanely slow
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what gpu melon has?
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rx 7900xtx
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> from btop and nvtop my gpu is at 100% and my cpu at 3%
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a 3080
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> üíÄ
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> why dont you just ping me
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> why jupsti
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its normal, the bottleneck should be the gpu
15:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 6k fps not bad
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> compare it to normal ddnet on linear
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a madman and ill do a lto build with std included
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki what i'd actually find interesting is, if you press f1 -> `dbg.bench true` -> quit -> start client and show the log of the terminal then
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that shows how much time is spent in some stuff
15:54 < bridge> <teero777> make integrated flamegraph
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is tract-core
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> why is there some inference ai thing in dd-pg xd
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's for the noise cancellor for proximity chat
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet ai powered
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok its linking the final binary
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> lto ftw
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> made in germany
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently it's as good as the AI thing discord uses
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quite impressive
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> still building...
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess lto is single threaded
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's thin-lto which is a lot faster IIRC
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and produces similar results
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want the max
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh its done
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> 6 mins only
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with mold it should be multi threaded i think
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least to a certain extend
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#lto
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat was the build command again?
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just cargo build and cargorun?
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lto is esp good for dead code elimination, so maybe lto-thin is worth a try
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> `cargo +nightly build --release -Z build-std=panic_abort,std  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> `./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/ddnet-playground`
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak xd
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so complicated
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cargo +nightly run --release
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think i have enough disk space for this
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> with -Z build-std=panic_abort,std it builds the std with the local cpu features
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> avx512
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what ryo is doing is, that he hopes to get more fps. but sadly it won't do so
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i get same fps xd
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki do this
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to know
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i get 4k fps in ddnet client
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc rust moment
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> do i join a server?
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> or just quit
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quit
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> start client
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quit

16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> this seems same
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also a lot
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mine takes half the time

16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u use pipewire?

16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh is sound nvidia too?
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only if u use hdmi

16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> (mine is faster)
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is basically the x11 window
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet kde is simply slow in that xD
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow ddnet has so few deps
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quite impressive actually
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we'd count deps that i added in cargo.toml files.
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be like 10 times as much xD
16:44 < bridge> <patiga> same üòÖ
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> 2 factors contributed to this:
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> - matricks kept it minimal and every maintainer since then has paid attention to not add any deps unless necessary
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> - It's so annoying to add new libs with our current setup and C++ in general
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, esp the second always kills me üòÑ

17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my cargo.lock is > 10k lines
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i hope i can remove some stuff, and improve build times a bit
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on the other hand side, all these massive libs are just so powerful and easy to use
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> Well in exchange for long build times you technically get a more optimal binary
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i honestly wonder why dd-pg performs so good
17:07 < bridge> <0dpododdododo> who ask
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has more FPS than ddnet on twgame, which is a wasm module
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so WASM beats native
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
17:07 < bridge> <0dpododdododo> who ask!!!
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> asked who?
17:07 < bridge> <0dpododdododo> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/960609967281434674/1114247923056771213/attachment.gif
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> Well you wrote dd-pg from scratch what we have is a mess that grew naturally
17:08 < bridge> <0dpododdododo> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1088553777927295120/1097521249586008104/gif.gif?width=858&height=670
17:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> some people concern me...
17:09 < bridge> <0dpododdododo> thank me to my countributioin
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, but i use lots of hashmaps, and with wasm lots of heap allocs
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and all this shit that should be slow xd
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> Can you go contribute somewhere else?
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks senpai
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> Heap allocs and hashmaps and stuff have constant overhead. Our mess has linear and polynomial performance
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah true, i think i didnt purposely ever added linear searches or similar
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe in the UI
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not in the game
17:12 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> there will never be enough linear
17:12 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289243216000061490/2024-09-27_17.10.46.png?ex=66f81ccf&is=66f6cb4f&hm=365b612bee4aa015ad04df558bb320d5476625441413531197eeec6e56b2e221&
17:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait till Linear¬≤ comes up
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> If you allocate on the heap, once, it's not really much worse than a stack allocation. 
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> If your hashmaps allow constant time lookups whatever overhead there is to using them is most definitely much less than the performance penalty of an O(n^2) lookup üòÑ
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you fill the memory you allocate, heap allocs are very close
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spuhpointer/stack-vs-heap-benchmark/refs/heads/master/filled2.png
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (non filled for comparision)
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spuhpointer/stack-vs-heap-benchmark/refs/heads/master/noinit2.png
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> This is allocation cost, right? It shouldn't matter if you are allocating once or twice. Only on the hot path should this matter.
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> It also depends a lot on the allocator
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also depends on the size
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> This graph isn't too too useful imo. The linear cost of filling the memory obviously dominates. Which should be almost exactly the same for both heap and stack allocations
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all i can say is that with WASM modules for physics it must allocate every frame rn, bcs i cannot deserialize into an existing buffer yet
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I guess that would be a decent improvement. Why is it not possible yet?
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the vec in vec problem. I'd need to almost write a custom serde deserializer
17:20 < bridge> <louis> buffer = vec<vec>
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u have a vec of vecs, then the inner vecs get destructed if u clear  the outer one
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The thing is, it won't improve performance
17:21 < bridge> <louis> is that a rust thing?
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i tried native twgame module, the heap allocs are simply negatible
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the sentence "benchmark your app to find bottlenecks" is just so true
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not. Heap allocs are tiiiny overheads with modern arena allocators
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> Unless you are doing millions of them, or you are in the 90s and you use an allocator that calls sbrk on every malloc
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we as humans are always super hysterical about heap allocs, or linear searched or hashmaps or whatever.
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if they are actually the bottleneck is hard to say üòÑ
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The hot path is also not the hot path.
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is always even hotter pathes xD
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> optimizing float_to_int in the game physics for example was worth it
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even tho it does nothing than converting floats to ints xD
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> Well ddnet is living proof that O(n^2) algorithms can be used just fine
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true üòÑ
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The hot path is also not the hot path.
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is always even hotter paths xD
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> I should do another perf on a full server to see if there is anything low hanging
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> Iirc antibot is the biggest cost rn, but I don't know it good enough to mess with it
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> And noby has a very special way he writes code
17:28 < bridge> <timakro> hi can someone review my PR please https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9047
17:28 < bridge> <timakro> i changed it from draft to ready for review
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds very scary. I'll take a look üôÉ
17:28 < bridge> <timakro> thx :)
17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> i chcecked before and i dont think we need star in hud
17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> you already type /team /practice /invincible to get it so you wont just get it by accident
17:29 < bridge> <timakro> /invincible toggles so i thought i might be useful, but i see your point
17:29 < bridge> <timakro> up for discussion
17:29 < bridge> <timakro> /invincible toggles so i thought it might be useful, but i see your point
17:30 < bridge> <kebscs> just chat message "You are now invincible: immune to freeze,kill tiles etc" would be sufficient i think
17:30 < bridge> <learath2> We want to move away from server messages being indicators for stuff as much as possible
17:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> NOT THE GRAPHS AGAIN
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are the best i have
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i always use them now
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i post them once per month until someone gives me better ones
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> yea but taking space in hud and hud image for something that would be used once a while isnt good imo
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> and its a chat command so confirmation message makes sense
17:32 < bridge> <louis> @timakro do u need a hud icon?
17:33 < bridge> <louis> invincible tees should have enchantment glow from minecraft that would be sick
17:33 < bridge> <timakro> no i don't **need** it
17:33 < bridge> <timakro> yes that would be the best because it would tell you AND other players that you are invincible
17:33 < bridge> <timakro> not sure how to implement it though
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> It shouldn't take up space in the hud if it's not on.
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> We can always make the hud image larger, clients crop to the size they need so older clients wouldn't be broken
17:34 < bridge> <louis> i meant
17:34 < bridge> <kebscs> i like hat message more üôÇ
17:34 < bridge> <kebscs> i like chat message more üôÇ
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> You ask @jupeyy_keks and hope he is in a good mood and is willing to help
17:35 < bridge> <louis> oh the yellow hud icon is nice
17:35 < bridge> <louis> not the rainbow though
17:35 < bridge> <timakro> i think even the yellow doesn't perfectly fit with the other icons tbh
17:35 < bridge> <timakro> but this is the pinnacle of my graphic design skills
17:35 < bridge> <timakro> also let's hope nintendo does not sue...
17:35 < bridge> <louis> can't we add support for multiple nameplate icons in space of the strong/ weak hook area?
17:35 < bridge> <kebscs> search for you are now in solo part string something like that
17:36 < bridge> <louis> and have a ‚≠êÔ∏è there too
17:36 < bridge> <kebscs> and -1 sends for all clients
17:36 < bridge> <timakro> i'm talking about minecraft enchanted item sheen
17:36 < bridge> <kebscs> ah alr
17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its possible to do a SmolMap, a hashmap that is initially stack allocated
17:37 < bridge> <timakro> i didn't even know you could see strong/weak hook now. how to enable it?
17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> like smolstr
17:37 < bridge> <timakro> hi ryo ^^
17:38 < bridge> <kebscs> appearance>name plate
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> Isn't this display a debug only feature? It's really not the best idea to have the only display of a feature be in debug
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even understand the request after reading it 5 times
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> How to make tee glow like minecraft enchanted items glow?
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> indeed, dont optimize prematurely, do flamegraphs and profile
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh, we'd need uv-animations
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks btw in rust u can use cargo flamegraph
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think they simply move the texture coordinates
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i often use it
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> also in rust u can also use this https://github.com/mstange/samply
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's epyc
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> it makes perf stats in firefox profiler format
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> its dope
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> try it
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> Also don't code like you have no brain wrinkles
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> firefox profiler shows flamegraphs too
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> Don't optimize early but don't write a brute force algorithm because it's quicker and we must deploy
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, but by not optimizing prematurely i mean if something that u dont know will improve perfomance and takes like a lot of effort u should first check if its relevant
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> which often do take a lot of effort
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc u shouldnt add bubble sort
17:43 < bridge> <timakro> I'd have thought you'd need to render the entire tee (body, eyes, feet, 0.7 tees have more components) to a off-screen buffer first and apply the shine effect there and then render the buffer to the screen. But I don't know if ddnet has the graphics APIs for that
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho openbsd did it
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they got away with it till not long ago
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> On a scale of 0 to impossible. How hard would that be with the 69 different backends we support?
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a way to make it easier
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> :LFG_EvilKermit:
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why hard? it's ez
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u just need to change uv coordinates
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except u want max perf and do it in the shader
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u need to analyze the skin texture too
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that can be done on cpu
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. use the outline texture of skins
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and make that your glow effect base
17:45 < bridge> <timakro> what's an uv animation?
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://tenor.com/view/minecraft-gif-22453064
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> xDDD
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> minecraft rain is UV anim too i think
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they simply have a repeating pattern
17:46 < bridge> <timakro> i mean technically, what does it do to the image and how
17:47 < bridge> <timakro> isn't this just a texture that's shifted every frame imposed on top?
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess it moves the texture along the object or smth
17:47 < bridge> <timakro> it seems more complicated than a moving texture but a moving texture might suffice for us
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, but if u want a pixel perfect glow
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need a stencil i guess
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or a shader
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> It's not too hard to do in a shader, but we have gl1.5 too which I'm sure doesn't support it. I don't even think we pass enough to the shader to control it tbf
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> glowy tees pog
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> Holo tee
17:48 < bridge> <timakro> my idea would have been to render all the tee components (body, feet, eyes) to a buffer, then apply the shine texture to the buffer and then render the buffer to the screen
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 A minecraft enchanted tee
17:48 < bridge> <timakro> but idk how to create an off-screen buffer
17:48 < bridge> <timakro> or render to it
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd suggest you don't do the glow effect
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> That is definitely not possible in gl1.5 iirc
17:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> enchanted golden ~~apple~~ tee
17:49 < bridge> <timakro> gl=opengl?
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's super ez to add bad performance wiht offscreen buffers, stencil buffers etc.
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. u change from read-only rendering to read-write
17:49 < bridge> <timakro> we need just 64 off screen buffers, they can live forever (one per tee)
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> What about just generating some shiny particles around the tee like ninja or freeze?
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah would be much easier
17:50 < bridge> <timakro> sounds like a more practical solution
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> I would probably just have a sin wave rotated, pow'd multiply the out color, but again idk what I would do for gl1.5
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want uv anims for quads on maps, that would be cool xd
17:51 < bridge> <timakro> how shitty is gl1.5 if it doesn't allow to render to a off-screen texture/buffer lol
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do you even mean with offscreen texture
17:51 < bridge> <timakro> but yeah i wouldn't wanna add the backend code for multiple backends to create and render to buffers either way
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> offscreen textures are super hard xD
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> opengl 1.5 was released on     July 29, 2003
17:51 < bridge> <timakro> wow okay
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow it's so new?
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought it's much older
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1.5    July 29, 2003
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2.0    September 7, 2004
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2.1    July 2, 2006
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3.0    August 11, 2008
17:52 < bridge> <syrinok> People wanted to add particles (louis I think) when someone removed the server message when hitting powerup tiles, after it got reverted. Should probably do the same to these
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3.3    11. M√§rz 2010
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> first sane opengl version
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4.3    6. August 2012
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vulkan 1.0 compatible version
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks what exactly do you mean by "uv animation" btw? Animating the uv mapping? How does that help?
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah dunno, i thought we only need a circle above the tee
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then i realized that will look shit too
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so just forget what i said
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without a shader it will look shit
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> This exact effect is what I had in mind and I would probably achieve it in shader by multiplying the outcolor. But I don't think we can do that here, right? I don't think we have the information in the shader and just directly no shaders in gl1.5
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> Another way that comes to mind is a stencil buffer, but again I don't think we can have those before gl3.3
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289254704358100992/image.png?ex=66f82782&is=66f6d602&hm=9e367dbbdb261e0b54f72c6411a3927311a00e3f67efb7e2dc578bec4fbccdde&
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah good question.
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are 3 options:
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - this minecraft pickaxe is a real 3d object, then it would even work in ogl 1.5
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - this pickaxe uses a shader like u said
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - they use a stencil buffer + uv anim with a "normal" quad, which would work too in ogl 1.5, but i think stencil buffers are only an extension or smth
17:58 < bridge> <timakro> can we draw a texture masked by another texture?
17:58 < bridge> <timakro> like an alpha mask
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with a shader that is ez ig
17:59 < bridge> <learath2> How about a glow effect done on cpu like the glow skins in the db?
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without, dunno
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure but that wouldn't be animated
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except u want to upload a texture every frame
17:59 < bridge> <timakro> i think this is beyond what's possible without changing a lot of graphics stuff in ddnet
17:59 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah but I guess it would be an indicator that's not too too hard to code
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://inspirnathan.com/posts/65-glow-shader-in-shadertoy
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://tenor.com/view/super-mario-world-snes-super-nintendo-2d-platformer-yoshi-gif-23210200
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, you might need to fall back to what louis suggested with the small star rendered above the nameplate
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they just change the color and add some particles
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
18:00 < bridge> <timakro> so a halo drawn behind the skin? is that how the skindb glow works?
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> Or some particles
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we need 1995 tec
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> :lol:
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://inspirnathan.com/images/content/posts/65-glow-shader-in-shadertoy/gif-1.gif
18:02 < bridge> <learath2> I think so. Inflate the outline, each step of the inflation is less alpha
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> the enchant in minecraft is a texture
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> "/assets/minecraft/textures/misc/enchanted_item_glint.png"
18:02 < bridge> <timakro> maybe the halo could be star shaped and rotating
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u send it?
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am interested
18:02 < bridge> <timakro> ah you mean basically render a re-colored scaled up version of the tee behind
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> That's kinda what I had in mind yes
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> With some falloff so it doesn't just look like a chunky tee sticker
18:03 < bridge> <timakro> falloff=soft edges?
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah
18:04 < bridge> <timakro> and how would i do that -.-
18:04 < bridge> <totar> This uses sdf so you need jump flood pass first
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> The exact same way the outline is rendered. Instead of rendering outline texture, render the inflated glow version you generated
18:04 < bridge> <timakro> i can't generate anything though
18:05 < bridge> <timakro> i can just render the existing body texture and change scale and color
18:05 < bridge> <timakro> i think i might experiment with a rotating maybe size-pulsing semi-transparent yellow/white star thing behind the player
18:05 < bridge> <learath2> You can on cpu when loading the skins generate it. Idk it might be too slow and unnecessary
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289256721692491828/image.png?ex=66f82963&is=66f6d7e3&hm=97dadc674beb59948eeb0a00b1b025cc65f4a6ce50b52aa8904c43337db4fcc9&
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it looks like this
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant find it rn
18:06 < bridge> <totar> Scaling isn't the correct operation because it only works with convex shaped objects
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk where prism launcher saves minecraft instances xd
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> That is absurd. Now I'm curious how it works
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then they most likely use stencil or have a 3d object
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess the black is invisible
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its probs a shader cuz resourcepacks cant change how its animated
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks is there really no way to animate/modify a texture without loading it again on gl1.5?
18:07 < bridge> <totar> https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cty3R3 you want this
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> You can modify the textures AFAIK, we do it with the text atlas. But then you lose the original
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except for simple colors? i dunno
18:08 < bridge> <timakro> you may enjoy https://www.dwitter.net/ - it's basically shader art that fits into 140 bytes
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean the static pipeline probably had some kind of multi texturing support for alpha masks
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet u can do what minecraft does

18:10 < bridge> <learath2> Actually, maybe we can just accept that gl1.5 won't show this effect. I think all our other backends have shaders where this effect is easily done
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> drop ogl1
18:10 < bridge> <timakro> yeah many of them use an encoder to use the full 256 states per byte instead of only valid utf8
18:12 < bridge> <learath2> it's hard to even find docs about the old fixed function pipeline now üòÑ
18:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> btew

18:13 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, EUR is pretty much dead compared to RUS and CHN
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> why we dont have influencers
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> curious there arent many asian devs yet
18:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> be one
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess language barrier is too big
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was about to make a mom joke but im old now
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> Actually there seems to be some stencil buffer support in gl1 üòÑ
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that doesnt mean you can create a window with stencil buffer xdd
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> üôÉ
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stencil would defs work
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> There is also `TEXTURE_ENV_MODE`, I wonder if that can work somehow
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST); // by default not enabled
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glStencilMask(stencilMask); // allow writing to stencil buffer, by default (0xFF) no mask.
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glClearStencil(clearStencilValue); // clear stencil value, by default = 0
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glStencilFunc(func, ref, mask); // by default GL_ALWAYS, 0, 0xFF, always pass stencil test
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glStencilOp(fail,zfail,zpass); // by default GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, do not change stencil buffer
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT); // clear stencil buffer, fill with (clearStencilValue & stencilMask)
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> from wiki
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I can see `TEXTURE_ENV_MODE` `MODULATE` working somehow, let me mess around with it a bit üòÑ

19:18 < bridge> <timakro> can someone explain what dilate does to an asset? i never understood that
19:19 < bridge> <patiga> it edits transparent pixels. it changes their color to that of a non-transparent pixels in its neighborhood
19:19 < bridge> <timakro> but there is clearly still some transparency left after, right?
19:19 < bridge> <timakro> so it only partially does this?
19:19 < bridge> <patiga> it doesn't change the transparency, only the color values
19:20 < bridge> <timakro> ah
19:20 < bridge> <patiga> this fixes issues with interpolation and mipmapping

19:36 < bridge> <teero777> 6 gives the same
19:37 < bridge> <patiga> ah, thats fair
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> I actually do not understand what is goign on here so I'll just stop messing around with it
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> As soon as I try to use more than one texture unit it just starts rendering cursed stuff
19:38 < bridge> <teero777> not fair
19:38 < bridge> <teero777> i want to be a literal ant
19:38 < bridge> <patiga> well thats sadly not easily possible ^^
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> every file in ddnet that starts with graphics or is part of the graphics pipeline just sucks
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad but true
19:38 < bridge> <patiga> the script would need to optimize the tilemaps on the fly, or replace the tilemaps with quads layers
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> backend sdl
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sucks
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> graphics threaded

19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> backend_vulkan
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sucks
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> I know you don't know the fixed function pipeline very well either but do you happen to know why I can't use `TEXTURE1`?
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u enable texture1?
19:39 < bridge> <teero777> quads gud
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u first need to enable the "name"
19:40 < bridge> <patiga> not that great as a replacement for tilemaps, the tile textures will leak into each other
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok nvm, i thought `(GL_TEXTURE1);` but apparently that is newer opengl already
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> WTF
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);`
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> I just did `glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);` then `glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);`
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it''s opengl 2.0 tho
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> ActiveTexture is apparently 1.5
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec15.pdf
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not how it works
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> TEXTURE_2D is active anyway
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> i would play it ngl
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> after u activated texture1 u do `glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, m_vTextures[TextOutlineTextureIndex].m_Tex);`
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> The spec suggested texture 2d is per texture unit, that's why I enabled it again :/
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2a64dac091f089f13fd4645399bcce8b38da5814/src/engine/client/backend/opengl/backend_opengl3.cpp#L1150-L1153
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see how i even active texture0 afterwards again
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's only to set the texture stuff
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok, well it probably isn't wrong
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to call it
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just leave it there
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> I don't want to bind a texture to it, I want to sample into it using `GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE` `GL_REPLACE` like they do on the wiki https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Texture_Combiners
19:44 < bridge> <patiga> :o looks like the script already optimizes the tilemap textures
19:44 < bridge> <patiga> I guess one could implement non-power-of-two-scaling, but then you'd need to resize the tilemap textures in weird ways
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
19:44 < bridge> <notzxpixty> where i can find line like ``` player if hooked tee ```
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> I basically wanted to just sample whatever texturing you do into texture0, then use `GL_COMBINE` on `TEXTURE1` so I can multiply the final color
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how did u obtain texture1?
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the texture target
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, good question, it's not bound to anything, perhaps that's causing the issue
19:45 < bridge> <teero777> i am afraid this part is impossible even at 4x xd

19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Is there a way to bind an "empty" texture to it? I don't really want to use anything from it. The texture environment is literally just replacing every color with the color from TEXTURE0 now

19:48 < bridge> <teero777> xD
19:48 < bridge> <teero777> the proper one
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> very important is `glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);` after u done
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> If I'm not reading the spec wrong, this should just be replacing the final color for everything by whatever the color was in texture0 which is just whatever we normally do

19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> state stays
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> idk what texture ends up getting used at the end though
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> opengl before 4.5 really sucks when i think about it xD
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> isn't it the currently active one?
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since u never bind any, u probably get texture 0
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Atleast if I do go back to texture0 afterwards it changes nothing
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some driver specific invalid one that is purely white
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> @patiga does it scale envelopes too?
19:51 < bridge> <patiga> I hope so, though I don't remember
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> ```c
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> 
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> float t[4] = {0.8f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f};
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> 
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_COMBINE);
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> glTexEnvfv(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR, t);

19:53 < bridge> <learath2> 
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> ```
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> This doesn't do any cursed stuff, but it also does nothing
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but what do u expect to happen
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> It's supposed to multiply all colors with t
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> of texture1?
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> It's supposed to multiply all colors of TEXTURE0, with t
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> You can see my SRC0 is set to `GL_TEXTURE0`
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok why do even switch to texture 1 if it's unused
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway, i dont understand this env api xd
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> Good question, because if I do it just in texture0 I seem to lose images somehow üòÑ
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> this is real ddnet
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> this is REAL DDNET
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> If I enable combine on texture0 and do the modulation I lose the insides of the text
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289284778645913620/perfect.png?ex=66f84384&is=66f6f204&hm=6f9d37fd92f64519eeaae5814c71b13caaeedfeac8edf9788d7c4e19f040341b&
19:57 < bridge> <teero777> looks like some 2014 custom client xd
19:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://x.com/KangarooPhysics/status/1625423951156375553
19:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/2740/
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but looks kinda correct
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> So I thought if I don't mess with texture 0, but instead multiply texture0 with the color to get a texture1 it might work üòÑ
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> it is very close, but idk what happened to the text üòÑ
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> This API is indeed certified weird. They just bolted it on because the fixed pipeline has no way to combine textures otherwise
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but set GL_CONSTANT for the src1 color but never specify the color
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who should that work
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it kinda looks like it's missing some calls
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> You can only specify one color, it's `GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR`, `GL_CONSTANT` pulls from that
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> The alphas also look right, so idk what's happening to the text there
20:02 < bridge> <learath2> aanyway, I don't get it and you don't seem to know this ancient api either, so I guess it'll just have to be a mystery
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe driver bug
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> üò¨
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> Even just multiplying it all with white which should do nothing ruins the text
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe you are onto smth
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> text is alpha only
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> alpha channel only
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u specify the alpha 1?
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_SRC0_ALPHA, GL_TEXTURE0);
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only see SRC0_ALPHA
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> but the mode is REPLACE not MODULATE
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> So it's just taking texture0 alpha and replacing it with texture0 alpha
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> it should be noop
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as if i understand what that means xD
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289287249753673798/image.png?ex=66f845d2&is=66f6f452&hm=4952f5cec42fb90fd193557b39a1b460fa9bbe164624f9570ec6506010c64db9&
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe it's UB to not set the SRC1_ALPHA tho xd
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> What do you mean by alpha only?
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uses the alpha channel only
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> I set it to modulate and set it to multiply by 1 too, it's still black so that's not it
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no RGB
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Hm so normally it's white and the outline is just lower alpha?
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's probably just getting black
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since RGB of the texture is 0
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> That would explain it
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Hm so normally it's black and the outline is just lower alpha?
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> But wait, how does it appear white then?
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the normal rendering API doesnt fetch the RGB components at all
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it simply fills it with 1
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, this is above my paygrade. Idk what I'm doing that prevents that
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> Somehow changing the texture environment is breaking that, even if I'm literally only taking the texture and not doing anything to it üòÑ
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's probably that env api that simply uses rgb here
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can special case it with text
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to use constant 1
20:24 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks is there a debugger for this dinosaur?
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could force opengl 3.0 with backcompat and hope that renderdoc accepts it xd
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else really no idea
20:26 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how people worked with this damn, so annoying
20:26 < bridge> <learath2> you would think a state machine wouldn't be really hard to debug
20:27 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I didn't even check if my driver supports multitexturing tbh
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt your have a 1997 pc
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> what if he is using nouveau
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is like a teleport to 1997
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> 32 üòÑ
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> bit?
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> wuh
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> 32 texture units
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
20:30 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I'm now very annoyed that it just won't work
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> I thought my iems kept breaking but apparently the filters get clogged from earwax vapor condensation
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> which is like
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> alright
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk how to clean them effectively
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> alcohol does not penetrate
20:30 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can I pay you a euro to figure out why the stupid text won't render properly?
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is your code on gh?
20:32 < bridge> <learath2> No but it's just

20:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> time to boot ogl 1
20:35 < bridge> <learath2> and this is what I've been referring to for the spec https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec15.pdf
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 what color do u want the text?
20:41 < bridge> <learath2> I just want it multiplied with t like everything else

20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you also want the non textured things colored or what? üòÑ
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> No, just textured stuff. But now I understand what went wrong üòÑ
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> At some point I somehow forgot this is applying to textures not the final framebuffer
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks in any case, can you ignore text somehow?
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u disable env somehow?
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, set `GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE` back to `GL_MODULATE` and the color back to `0, 0, 0, 0`

20:47 < bridge> <learath2> You are so cool
20:48 < bridge> <learath2> The GL whisperer
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well then simply do that for text textures.
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cmd is called `Cmd_TextTextures_Create`
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i simply saved that they are text textures xdd
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```c++
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> TextureCreate(pCommand->m_Slot, pCommand->m_Width, pCommand->m_Height, GL_ALPHA, GL_ALPHA, CCommandBuffer::TEXFLAG_NOMIPMAPS, pCommand->m_pTextData);

20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> such a GL whisperer
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> Now that was underwhelming üòÑ
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> Sadly this api is not enough for making the enchant effect
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what you're trying to d o
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what you're trying to do
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> If you could somehow get the UV coords into TEXTURE1, you could probably do something that moves across the tee, but it doesn't seem to be available in the api
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> So you'd probably have to create a texture on the cpu with the coordinates in the colors, put that into a texture unit and use that instead
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> tunnel vision
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> Was investigating whether an effect like https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1289251835831386214 is possible using the old fixed pipeline
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> what textures are you trying to apply it to
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> the text?
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> Could load the texture in there and multiply but to get it moving is an issue since you don't get the coordinates of the fragment at all
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> The tee
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds awesome
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> for super
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> Also still couldn't really figure out how to get the damn second texture unit working anyway

21:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
21:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust pros, is there a way to get `op` value in such a case?
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> match expr {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     ExprBinary {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         op,
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         left,
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         right,
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     } => {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         if let (Some(dest), BinOp::Add | BinOp::Sub) = (dest, op) {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             let (dest, dest_new) = if let Destination::Memory(_) = &dest {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 (self.arch.alloc()?.dest(size), true)
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             } else {
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 (dest, false)
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             };
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             self.expr(*left, Some(dest.clone()), state)?;
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             let (src, src_new) = expr_to_source(self, *right, true)?;
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>             match op {} // i need to match on op here
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         }
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     }
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     _ => (),
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> };
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's no joke
21:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i want to match only between `BinOp::Add` and  `BinOp::Sub` :\
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still have that
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the if
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im blind
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think that behaves the same
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> It won't go to the next match case, no?
21:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah, it will match on any `ExprBinary`
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the next match is literally _ => ()
21:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have other
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u still get the same result
21:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just didn't paste that xd
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then move them into this one
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> I think you want something like
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> match expr {
21:08 < bridge> <learath2>   ExprBinary {op} if checkopwhatever => {}
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> }
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> ```
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> No?
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> I don't know if it's possible tbf but match guards or whatever it's called
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> There is iirc also an if let guard proposal that has been open for the last 6 years iirc
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> There is iirc also an if let guard proposal that has been open for the last 6 years
21:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> match op { SomeCase => {}, SomeOtherCase => {} } should work ig
21:12 < bridge> <learath2> `if matches!(op, BinOp::Add | BinOp::Sub)` should still work in the match guard
21:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> `match op { SomeCase => {}, SomeOtherCase => {} }`
21:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye but when match on `op` later it wants me to cover every variant
21:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i guess that's not a good idea
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> Did you try mine?
21:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i tried this
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> As a match guard?
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @milkeeycat can u show your whole code?
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the whole big match
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> true, leak it!
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> let us gossip over it
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you'll be nitted
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Just cover all the cases, just put the unreachable macro on the catchall
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nitted picked
21:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's my power move
21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> milkeeys daily dev questions is what keeps me up to date
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> don't know wat to do, slap `unreachable!()`
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> Just unwrap unchecked everywhere, does rust know better than you?
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> match expr {

21:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> lgtm
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what's your problem with handling everything in one ExprBinary scope?
21:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's what im doing
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289304730459308105/image.png?ex=66f85619&is=66f70499&hm=5749335f8f623e910bf898ca514d419aaf50f99c32c87b56b1c9a1f0e44e38fb&

21:17 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah ngl I don't see why not just have one `ExprBinary` with a `match op` inside instead
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> Not like you won't unpack left and right for some binary expressions
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah man AI has spoken!
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> `Overall, this is a well-structured approach to handling binary expressions in a code generator. It covers the main cases and provides a solid foundation for further development.`
21:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> but it told you to get back to work
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why mods bully my :feelsbadman:
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why mods bully me :feelsbadman:
21:21 < bridge> <robyt3> A gold sparkling effect for invincibility would definitely be easier than tinkering with the graphics backends

21:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> now bring back 2009 rainbow tee with it and i say we ship it
21:22 < bridge> <louis> wauw looks nice
21:22 < bridge> <louis> can we add more particles in the png files for confetti and this then?
21:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> extend confetti? ¬∞-¬∞
21:23 < bridge> <learath2> I was just curious of the possibilities of the old pipeline that's all
21:23 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, would make sense to add more sprites for confetti and invincibility. right now they both use the same sprite as death particles
21:24 < bridge> <louis> they just need the üéâ  particles
21:24 < bridge> <louis> and invincibility could have these thingies

21:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
21:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there's even syntax with `@`
21:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks did you know that? 0_o
21:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> what does @ do ? bind the value (Add/Sub) to op if it matches?
21:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> honestly here it does nothing useful because it's the same as using `expr.op` itself xd
21:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i didn't know it's even a valid syntax

21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah that solves your issue ig
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u seen the new github design
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that line height kills me
21:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I disabled the commit feature preview since it's was so bugged
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i add the ellipsis char to the text?
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> "Custom‚Ä¶" is square
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> Custom[]
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> std::string("Custom") + FONT_ICON_ELLIPSIS
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> also square
21:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't mean as a font icon
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> Custom\u2026 only this works but not clean
21:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Just as text
21:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Just copy the text from my comment
21:45 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289311940492918937/image.png?ex=66f85cd0&is=66f70b50&hm=f056c1b4f2194fb275642739537fdc101ac89fa2687bddddbc28c210cdbe3bf3&
21:45 < bridge> <kebscs> and i get this warning

21:47 < bridge> <kebscs> yes i have it and it becomes square
21:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Change the encoding in your editor to UTF-8
21:56 < bridge> <kebscs> ok time to fight with visual studio on how to do that
21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it doesn't really make sense to make the invincibility thing look fancy ‚Äî it's not even a normal gameplay feature but just something for /practice
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's defs funny how suddenly learath starts to invest into ogl 1.5 just for a rarely used feature during gameplay :lol:
22:01 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i had to enable some hidden menu option and then change save encoding XD
22:01 < bridge> <kebscs> but works now
22:11 < bridge> <totar> do any of you know of any visual DB schema designers that aren't terrible?
22:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> DBeaver ftw
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> brain
22:13 < bridge> <totar> This works until you have like 20 tables and it gets really annoying to avoid mistakes
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm not kidding, i really  like https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver
22:14 < bridge> <totar> yeah I'm looking at it now
22:14 < bridge> <totar> which part of the docs has the schema stuff
22:14 < bridge> <learath2> The word you are looking for is "ER Diagram". You can google around there are dozens
22:15 < bridge> <learath2> I used dbdiagram.io for a screenshot for my db course

22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cute
22:22 < bridge> <totar> @blaiszephyr should I get dbeaver from github instead of the website?
22:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> i dont actually remember how i got it :kek:
22:23 < bridge> <totar> oh
22:23 < bridge> <totar> I ended up on dbeaver pro website somehow
22:24 < bridge> <totar> ok nvm
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tja
22:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> how does one specify the entities of the server again? - or is that map specific? i completly forgot
22:38 < bridge> <totar> idk it feels kinda clunky if you're trying to quickly sketch a schema from scratch, for maintaining an existing one it seems good though
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh wait you're trying to sketch one
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> i thought you wanted to display your existing one the entire time
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> mb
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> LOL
22:39 < bridge> <totar> lol
22:39 < bridge> <totar> well eventually I'll want to actually use the schema but right now I just care about it being fast to change so I can try ideas
22:40 < bridge> <furo> It's sent by the server here, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2a64dac091f089f13fd4645399bcce8b38da5814/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L630-L632
