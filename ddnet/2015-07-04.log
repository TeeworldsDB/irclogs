14:13 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 b359238 def: Re-enable broadcast for old DDNet client version
17:32 <@deen> eeeee: i hope it's fine that I run GER2 in case GER suddenly goes down. I keep reminding xrothx to transfer GER to me but still don't have it so no idea when it will go off randomly
17:36 <@EastByte> deen: does nfoservers allow some kind of transfer?
17:36 <@deen> EastByte: yes, worked for USA
17:36 <@EastByte> ah
17:36 <@deen> and I immediately figured out how to reduce the cost from 10 $ to 6.80 $ per month ;)
17:37 <@EastByte> huh?
17:37 <@deen> they currently have a special where you get 25% off and you can transfer your existing server into that
17:37 <@EastByte> nice
17:37 <@deen> so the server keeps running, ip stays and you pay less
17:37 <@deen> so I really want GER now, it's called "spring vds sale"
17:37 <@EastByte> that would be nice
17:37 <@deen> not sure how they'll keep having it
17:38 <@deen> oh, and i paid for a whole year, because it's been running for nearly 2 years without problems, saves another bit
17:38 <@deen> I hope TW on Steam happens soon, and I hope that USA gets more players then
17:39 <@deen> heinrich5991: how's that going? ^
17:40 <@deen> oh, and I'm just back from the lake, great weather for cycling there, haha
17:41 <@EastByte> I went swimming in the morning
17:41 <@EastByte> you did cycling at 36 degrees?
17:42 <@deen> it's 39°C here I think, but yes
17:43 <@EastByte> well
17:43 <@deen> It's actually survivable if you empty a water bottle over your head
17:43 <@deen> and it's just 20 km
17:43 <@EastByte> 'just'
17:43 <@deen> not the 100 km to university and back :P
17:44 <@EastByte> you aren't cycling to university every day are you?
17:44 <@deen> i used to do it once or twice a week
17:44 <@EastByte> ah
17:44 <@deen> now I'm not going to university at all^^
17:44 <@deen> but when I do, then by bicycle
17:44 <@deen> didn't buy a train card for this semester
17:45 <@EastByte> so what about your master thesis?
17:45 <@deen> I'm writing that at home
17:45 <@EastByte> that's nice
17:51 <@deen> shit
17:51 <@deen> Meskalin is using the Baumalein client to manipulate votes on ddnet now
17:51 <@deen> he lets dummies of all the users join any server and makes them vote what he wants
17:52 <@deen> we could easily auto-exclude the client but then he just changes it to look closer to ddnet client until the difference isn't recognizable anymore
17:52 <@EastByte> I'm pretty sure that it's ip spoofing
17:52 <@deen> nope, the guy is saying it's not
17:53 <@EastByte> the guy? Meskalin?
17:54 <@EastByte> the vote command in his client only executes lcon -> vote yes/no
17:54 <@deen> no, someone else who has connections to Meskalin
17:54 <@deen> a "spy" :P
17:57 <@deen> chile player numbers are terrible since the ping jumped to 150 for half our players
17:57 <@deen> hoster still ignores me
18:00 <@deen> not a single bug with the win64 client so far, I'm surprised!
19:39 < Nimda> Cucumber by Fňokurka oo7 just released on Brutal at 2015-07-04 19:35
19:54 < eeeee> deen: i'm gonna reboot ger2 to resize it to the next big instance type, just in case
19:57 <@deen> eeeee: hopefully not now, it has players =/
19:57 < eeeee> whoops
19:57 < eeeee> ^^
19:57 <@deen> really? =/
19:58 < eeeee> sorry :(
19:58 <@deen> there were 100 people playing on it
19:58 < eeeee> i ddin't realize, thought it's empty as usual
20:48 < NooBxGockeL> Hey guys, im trying to think of useful project to learn myself webdesign and webprogramming... Any ideas ?
20:59 <@EastByte> deen: I was wrong, the vote cmd indeed connects a dummy
21:01 <@deen> EastByte: =)
21:02 <@deen> yay, ping on Chile went down for people from 150 to 18!
21:03 <@deen> NooBxGockeL: clearly make something cool for ddnet website!
21:08 < NooBxGockeL> Hm, yeah i thought about that, but i couldnt figure out what... Also im trying to teach myself scala with googleplay and maybe angular and bootstrap and i doubt from quickly looking at the imported .js files that the ddnet site is using that :P
21:09 <@deen> we do use bootstrap on http://ddnet.tw/status
21:09 <@deen> aaaaand I have 95% packet loss on ddnet.tw
21:10 <@deen> really funny how the server is not down, but having 95% packet loss
21:11 <@deen> maybe someone is mad, i did just ban a blocker a few min ago
21:13 < NooBxGockeL> Could only try and port or make up a quick sketch of something redesigned. Hmmm... Is there any feedback of the current website, stuff that could be done better or something ? ^^
21:13 <@deen> NooBxGockeL: Soreu and Savander are working on a redesign of whole ddnet.tw, if you want to help
21:14 <@deen> i think they also have some professional web designer helping them
21:16 < NooBxGockeL> deen, hmmm i dont think they use the stuff i wanna learn, but ill ask them. Also, its kinda funny how the ddnet teamspeak has user named "saaviknudes plz" xD
21:16 <@deen> Only laxa has admin on that server, i tried to reach him about that a few hours ago =/
21:24 <@deen> On average a DDNet client is started once every 15 seconds
21:25 <@EastByte> making some statistics right now?
21:25 <@deen> not really, just for fun
21:25 <@EastByte> ah
21:26 <@deen> but i need some for the birthday thing
21:35 <@EastByte> hmm
23:26 < WolfAlex> deen: could you enable sv_vote_kick for your mods on the zcatch servers?
23:29 <@deen> WolfAlex: what do you mean? to disable vote kicks?
23:29 < WolfAlex> yep
23:29 <@deen> sure
23:31 < WolfAlex> hm mod is gone ._.
23:41 < WolfAlex> yay
23:41 < WolfAlex> now i'm banned
23:41 < WolfAlex> :D
23:42 < WolfAlex> lovely admin was to lazy to recheck the ip
23:42 < WolfAlex> (id)
23:47 < WolfAlex> deen: would like to know the reason why i'm banned 
23:47 <@deen> i didn't ban you, WolfAlex 
23:47 <@deen> banned where?
23:47 < WolfAlex> wait
23:47 < WolfAlex> zcatch server
23:48 <@deen> which?
23:48 <@deen> reason aimbot?
23:48 < WolfAlex> my ip is 109.91.38.130
23:48 < WolfAlex> banned for 50min
23:48 < WolfAlex> for no reason
23:49 <@deen> oh, wtf happened there?
23:49 < WolfAlex> XD
23:49 <@deen> someone banned 16 ips
23:49 <@deen> I'll check the logs
23:50 < WolfAlex> well these ips are from jxsl13 (join-ing(?) and kickvoting sb)
23:50 < WolfAlex> thats why i asked you about that sv_vote_kick ...
23:50 <@deen> ah
23:50 <@deen> so i guess someone just accidentally banned you =/
23:50 < WolfAlex> :( 
23:51 <@deen> all the other ips are from the same subnet
23:53 <@deen> i unbanned you, mistakes happen, sorry =/
23:54 < WolfAlex> np, it's not that i'm totally innocent, i joined with a dummy while the mod/admin was trying to get rid of jxsl13 xD
23:56 < WolfAlex> okok
23:56 < WolfAlex> this time
23:56 < WolfAlex> i've did nothing
23:56 < WolfAlex> just joined
23:56 < WolfAlex> and banned for 3245 min
23:57 < WolfAlex> talk to your mods and tell them not to ban just anyone from [ friends ]
23:59 <@deen> I don' even know who that guy is^^
23:59 <@deen> I'm not really in command of the zcatch servers
23:59 <@deen> they're mostly run by Savander and .me'
23:59 <@deen> but I'll try talking to him when i can join the server
