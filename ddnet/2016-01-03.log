00:10 <@deen> what happened to the planned ddnet client release? anyone still planning that?
01:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vutjs
01:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master c78ade0 def: Fix bug where timed out people can connect more than sv_max_clients_per_ip times
01:43 < WolfAlex> EastByte: -_- you told that deen?
01:53 <@deen> WolfAlex: told what?
01:54 < Henningstone> WolfAlex: uh-oh
01:54 < WolfAlex> deen: oh ok, nothing ._.
01:55 <@deen> i get a feeling that most of the people attacking ddnet are its main players
01:55 <@deen> it's really a shit community when your own players ddos, write exploits etc
01:57 < WolfAlex> eh why, i've told last week east that more clients can connect with that timeout thing, but i wanted to do a proof first ._.
01:57 <@deen> players and developers*
01:57 <@deen> i'm not just talking about you, more the general idea
01:58 < WolfAlex> "just talking about you" :( you think i attack ddnet? 
02:07 < WolfAlex> deen, sorry but i've never harmed ddnet in any way i can think of, although i dislike some ddnet decisions. i've even tried to help where i can (not much since i'm not a c++ dev)
02:07 <@deen> well, other people who dislike ideas make insulting videos or just ddos the servers. always great solutions
02:09 < WolfAlex> thats just stupid from them, if they can't argue about what they dislike, just ignore them.
02:10 < WolfAlex> but ddosers/flooders are a problem :/
02:52 < Henningstone> deen: 
02:52 < Henningstone> do you have a minute?
02:52 <@deen> Henningstone: what?
02:52 < Henningstone> WolfAlex: and I want to show you something... quite funny ;)
02:53 < Henningstone> just search in the server browser the players "wolf" or "Henritees" and join us =)
02:55 < Henningstone> you are right, obvious. It depends on the IDs
10:49 <@EastByte> deen: the last time I heard about the client release was before hi_leute left
10:50 <@EastByte> iirc someone also started working on a new feature list but I cannot find the chatlogs

23:49 < TwItCh__> Hi can someone help me getting points to work on ddnet teeworlds server
23:52 < laxa> What do you mean ?
23:52 < laxa> On ddnet servers ?
23:52 < TwItCh__> No Im running my own server
23:52 < TwItCh__> connecting to mysql server using mysql.cfg file
23:52 < laxa> read scripts from deen on the repos, they should teach you everything you need to know hopefully
23:53 < SPYRES> I love the words "hopefully" xD
23:53 < TwItCh__> I don't know which scripts to look at, Ive looked at a view
23:54 < TwItCh__> at a few*
23:54 < Ryozuki> i think poitns is the hardest thing
23:55 < TwItCh__> It is, but once I understand how it works it's fairly easy, it's just deen has added lots of extra features
23:58 < TwItCh__> How can I test of the scripts are connecting to the mysql database
23:59 < SPYRES> that the scripts*
23:59 < TwItCh__> *if
