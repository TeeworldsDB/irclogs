07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Fuck
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can anyone confirm this? "while in a stopper, your velocity vector parallel is set to 0 every tick (and you are also given a doublejump if the stopper is vertical). Since stoppers don't actively push you out, the tick that you enter the stopper will determine your position, as you will be stopped immediately after. This is the reason why when walking or falling into a stopper, your position will fluctuate based on how you entered. This also l
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> took a long time cus im typing on my phone :justatest:
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> @louis leak part
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> pollito part
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> "while in a stopper, your velocity vector parallel is set to 0 every tick (and you are also given a doublejump if the stopper is vertical)" yes.
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> "Since stoppers don't actively push you out, the tick that you enter the stopper will determine your position, as you will be stopped immediately after." yes.
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> "This is the reason why when walking or falling into a stopper, your position will fluctuate based on how you entered. This also leads to a special case when completely skipping a stopper in one tick - afterwards, your speed will be set to 0, and you will be given a doublejump if the stopper is vertical." yes.
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> get doublejump and speed y set to 0.

08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> what about how you don't get dj if you are hooking someone
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " velocity vector parallel **to the stopper direction**" maybe
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> it may because ur speed y is not bigger than 0.
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i think it also does when you are hooking someone above you
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> also how would you get dj by standing on stoppers then
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> i think it also relate about speed calculated from hooking and gravity, but i am not clear about it.
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> u can see speed is calculated earlier than tile(stopper)
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rhino> if u are interesting in, u can find this in  src\game\server\entities\character.cpp void CCharacter::Tick()
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ok i think i found it actually
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/469136b5e7c7ae30b5ea22aff59e9f0845e5452a/src/game/gamecore.cpp#L427
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> when you are hooking someone it calculates stoppers earlier than normal
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> so m_Vel.y is 0 at // stopper
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> if you arent hooking it clamps velocity after it checks m_Vel.y > 0
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga i was checking ur twmap code and i found this, actually the code on line 174 is unreachable, because ? on a Err always returns, thats why its always better to return errors using "return" when you creare ur own Err() like this

12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well almost all languages have a swap in their stdlib :D
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga how does the py script work
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah I hoped it would explain itself
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `generate_external_constants.py 6 ~/usr/share/ddnet/data/mapres ddnet_external.rs`
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and `generate_external_constants.py 7 ~/usr/share/teeworlds/data/mapres teeworlds_external.rs`
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (assuming you are on arch and have ddnet and teeworlds 0.7 installed)
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok i pushed
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki gitlab gives me the option to squash the commits, mind if I do that?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont mind
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> üëç
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga u should run cargo fmt too
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm scared
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but ye
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> scared of?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the amount of lines changed
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about 4k
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the future u can use this https://gist.github.com/hryniuk/e3f4ae34e37947d0ff55a3f63add90f8
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> @Patiga all the highlighted ones dont show any maps and Stop could probably be renamed to Stopper

12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks for notifying :), changes are already submitted
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Windows still having performance issues on newer sdl?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki scanned a bit over the files, and I dislike the formatting it does to the generated files. it messes up the arrays
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also I saw a weird thing it did to `src/lib.rs`:
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pub mod map_checks;  // comment1
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pub mod map_edit;    // comment2
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pub mod map_dir;     // comment3
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> was changed to
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> +pub mod map_checks; // comment1
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> +pub mod map_dir;
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> +pub mod map_edit; // comment2 // comment3
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm weird
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You dare question cargo fmt?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never had problems with it
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u show me the array thing
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You obviously wanted comment 2 and 3 merged
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :bluekitty:  definitely more concise or smth
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok do whathever
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki don't wanna paste the whole array here, too long
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'll send in pm
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've actually had no issues with cargo fmt either. Odd that it's messing up there
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/930434160286400522/unknown.png
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly this looks like a bug in cargo fmt
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe if u can find a reduced code version of it u can report it
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can reproduce it
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill report it
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah its really simple to reproduce o.o
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the arrays u can add the skip tag i told u
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't check but there was no relevant change in changelog
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I should just rerun it?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, with the new changes
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I also finally rebased to master ^^
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5168
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i opened it
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> next time I wanna open that issue myself :)
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki do you have a fix for the long lines of tiles or should I make one?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make it
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should wrap all the tiles in a div with some max weidth
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> width
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and display:flex the div probs
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with flex-wrap: wrap
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen the names and grouping I did might've been a bit confusing: HOOKTHROUGH_ALL is just new hookthrough (THROUGH is old hookthrough), PLASMAU is the unfreezing plasma turret. I mapped the freezing+exploding bullet into the freezing bullet
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so no plasmae?
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> as it is right now yes, should I separate it from the plasmaf?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, no. that's fine
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga weird some maps still report PLASMAE and some PLASMAF
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah I mixed up the names in my head.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> there are PLASMA, PLASMAF, PLASMAE, PLASMAU. F -> freeze, e -> explosion, u -> unfreeze, PLASMA -> freeze + explosion
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and I mapped PLASMA onto PLASMAF
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so PLASMAE should have the icon at index 220, PLASMAF -> 221, PLASMAU -> 223
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and PLASMA is mapped onto 220
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Any idea why we have 2 refresh rate sliders in the settings now?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> abit confusing
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> graphics thread and input thread
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Yeah, but why üòÑ
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can set both, they have different effects
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> there are a couple of settings which should be moved to different tabs
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> e.g:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Show name plates + name plates size, Show clan above nameplates, in General to HUD
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Show only chat messages from friends, In General to HUD > Chat Tab
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Refresh rate, In General to Graphics and rename both according to what they do
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Automatically record demos and the slider in, General to DDNet in the demo section
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> or do we have not enough space? ^^
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> layer arrows unseeable under blocks fix it place
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/930471432096477194/example.mp4
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like here i can't know how he did it
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> was holding A or some A and D or not move at all:zzzz:
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i suggest putting layer arrows ,up
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> How can project rely on other library being updated without their consent? This js bullshit is beyond me
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> But the bottom topic is probably of concern here too üôÇ
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn this has to do with how semantic versioning works
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl usually pin to the minor version
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g 4.2
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it actually means >4.2.0
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this troll guy updated it with 4.2.1 (or something equivalent, this is an example)
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also its more this guy being a dick
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he wants money but he licensed his project with MIT
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a brainless guy whose only achievemnt is a stupid color library things he did something big
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it actually means >4.2.0, <4.3
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29863672
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Yeah, but its still automatic, while in C/C++, Python or others, you decide which version you use and need to change manually, so its harder to exploit as a Remote Code Execution attack
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> whyd github suspend his account
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesn't make sense to me
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly on python
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can pin on minor too with requirements.txt
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn but its actually weird that if affects lots of apps
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because package managers usually have a lockfile
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so production code installs libs from the lockfile
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is always the same
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so they must have updated the lockfile to break their own app
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he wanted to delete everything he has on github i think and since lot of ppl want to use it github said no
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i am actually against this tho
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he should be able to delete it
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the same time its kinda pointless
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since git is not centralized
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a: buse
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> who owns the code when it was written by tens of people?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think anybody owns it, its governed under the license
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not a lawyer
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Who owns DDNet for instance? Deen? Matricks? GreyFox?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> What if tomorrow deen decides to just throw it away and delete the git?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Those are serious questions raised by the guy
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn idk what owning means, i just know u can do almost anything thanks to the license, what i think u cant do is change this license
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for this u would need agreement of every contributor
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + the fact that nobody got remuneration for their work
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its a bit weird to expect remuneration when u do open source
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, that sounds like a big flaw because you're stuck with constraint from maybe 10 years ago. Even countries constitution are more flexible
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > . Even countries constitution are more flexible
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they at least state how they can be modified
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modify what
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what i meant is that probably (im not sure) if you want to change from MIT to gpl u would need to ask every contributor if he agrees i think
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the source is still there, the question if someone would be up for the task to maintain the servers
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> him deleting git means nothing
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just have to comply with this <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet/ddnet/master/license.txt>
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can do whathever

16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> Isn't it allowed to make the license more restrictive? Forbidding that would be pretty weird because the MIT license allows making the code proprietary
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some licenses are compatible and some are not
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt allow to make the code propietary btw
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it allows you to use it for profit
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and or modify it
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that modification can be propietary but needs the original license notice
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is why GPL is superior
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any modification needs to follow gpl
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for true free software
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open source is a business interest they only want licenses like mit
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> yup

20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL "quixotic"
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > extremely idealistic; unrealistic and impractical.
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > "a vast and perhaps quixotic project"
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chillerdragon expand ur vocabulary
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this guy is so stupid why release your work under an extremely permissive license if you are going to be a little bitch baby when people use the license as written
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> :poggers:
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exactly as i thought
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he should have used gpl-3
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github was extremely out of line for banning him tho
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who the fuck is microsoft to decide what someone does to their project
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that too
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its microsoft

23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you wanted to have some API for the ddnet server at some point
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> was that for managing stuff like bans?
