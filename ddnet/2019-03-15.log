10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 btw, does cmake use the bundled mysql versions? I'd like to test that they work
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can you give testddr another color in the browser so its not confused with normal server so easyly?
14:32 <@deen> but it's still the same mod
14:32 <@deen> just with testing commands enabled
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen it uses them, but I don't know whether we have mysql-specific tests
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-DMYSQL=ON`
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Does anyone know why my client takes atleast 3 sec when i switch back to ddnet client from another window?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b no, but we have an open bug, so if you can help us figure it out we'd appreciate it
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b does it only happen in fullscreen mode?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen ^

18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 i will check this out soon.
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> It freezes and all input given will be repeated multiple times. So if you start writing during the frozen period you get really strange sentences
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao wat happened
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that guy kept asking me if i was a weeb
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont even know that name
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he misbehaved
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki i am also curiousðŸ˜¬
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> waaaaaaaaaat
