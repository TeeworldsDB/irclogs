08:34 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @Henningstone Interesting, want to make a PR ifdefing away all the additional mem_alloc stuff? Then we could try running it on DDNet servers and see the performance impact

14:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> yo, sometimes i dont know if i should put this stuff into forum or in discord. i mean on discord i can reach the right group of people instantly, but it might vanish when other continue to write over it

18:54 < nemo2> hm. maybe I should be asking here
18:55 <+nemo2> http://issues.hedgewars.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512  have y'all run into this?
18:55 <+nemo2> https://hg.hedgewars.org/hedgewars/file/a6f51ac9a3f2/hedgewars/uCursor.pas#l34   get crazy vals from SDL call if someone messes w/ xinput
18:55 <+nemo2> was thinking it was some SDL2 oddity
18:56 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
19:07 <+nemo2> SDL2 is probably the main reason it's been two years since last hedgewars release
19:08 <+nemo2> dealing w/ bugs in it stalled an already slow dev team even more
19:08 <+nemo2> ah well
19:17 <@heinrich5991> I don't know about sdl2. maybe deen does, but he's not always fast to respond
19:20 <+nemo2> he helped us w/ our last SDL2 bug
19:21 <+nemo2> (some bit of code they'd stripped out from 1.2 then had to put back in)
19:21 <+nemo2> we still have a bug when apply textures to images wider than... 16k I think, but solved that by using our own texture copier which in general was less WTF anyway
