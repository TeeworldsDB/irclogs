13:47 <+Hamid_Jigool> Hello
13:47 <+Hamid_Jigool> any body here?
13:50 <+Henningstone> hm, why do you need a linux executable when you cannot compile one?
14:02 < tee_> deen?
14:15 <+Hamid_Jigool> Henningstone: i can compile but when i run it can not connect to databse
14:15 <+Hamid_Jigool> so like last time i need to true compile of server_sql_DDnet
14:16 <+Henningstone> are you using the bundled libraries or your system libs?
14:17 <+Hamid_Jigool> no my system libraries
14:17 <+Hamid_Jigool> using system
14:17 <+Hamid_Jigool> for what?
14:17 <+Henningstone> ?
14:17 <+Hamid_Jigool> my compile is succesfully
14:18 <+Hamid_Jigool> but give me this error

14:18 <+Hamid_Jigool> fatal error: can not init sqlscore
14:19 <+Hamid_Jigool> when my server running on sql mode
14:35 <+Hamid_Jigool> whats mean of this?

14:38 <+Hamid_Jigool> 	if (HandleFailure) 	{ 		dbg_msg("sql", "FATAL ERROR: Could not init SqlScore"); 		return true; 	}
14:39 <+Hamid_Jigool> i found this on source
14:45 <+Learath2> deen, you around ?
15:33 <@deen> Learath2: sometimes, why?
15:34 <+Learath2> wanted to ask a nim related question
15:34 <+Learath2> do you happen to know whether asyncnet and asyncdispatch can work with unix sockets
15:35 <@deen> no idea, async is weird^^
15:36 <+Learath2> ehh i guess ill stick with nativesockets and selectors
15:42 <@deen> ^^ I don't know, you could just try or ask dom96 who implemented it
21:37 <@Nimda> Fluke by Aras & timakro just released on Brutal at 2016-08-28 21:33
