00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @murpi Spectating other people and exiting spec also causes the star glitch to happen
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it can be reproduced I can bisect and find what change caused it
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Skeith so I just pause and unpause someone in freeze?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Oh sorry, I just noticed it happened even when I didn't connect dummy. I'll try to make it happen consistently
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Hmmm, wait I might've connected dummy for a second, so I might be wrong about the above message.  Let me check my demo to see if I did or not, I forgot.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You can consistently reproduce the bug by connecting dummy @deen if that's good enough?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If it's related to dummy I have an idea
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I changed something there recently
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya, I did connect dummy, wasn't related to pause. üòÖ
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Basically, to consistently reproduce the bug, you put your tee in freeze, then you connect your dummy right as the stars appear when frozen. It also happens with the stars that pop out when you shoot your pistol @deen
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> got it
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Thanks deen
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i would love this as a feature to snap :(
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they are soo teeish yet so unique
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Souly ^
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats probably what you experienced too when you said weak still exists on my server. Hook strength is the same, collision to other tees is not.
05:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> `i am jkjk`
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> What do you think about this guys?
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> you guys swapped the order of the favorite server and the first finish in the website
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> is there a reason for this? personally, i think it looks worse
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> idk if it's intended
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Someone knows how to fix checks in pull request?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> fix_style.py is failing in my: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4573
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> `error: code should be clang-formatted`
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, it's always been that order. But I added the yearly points, so that's why the Favorite Server moved to next line
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is removing a display a thing u do frequently?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Who uses MacOS even
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @noby :thonkery:
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> docking station is life-changing product if you move often (not while playing actually)
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen maybe u can check <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/pull/33>
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but if it's only on last finishes then that's confusing
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I'd have to add it everywhere
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when can i see the changes live?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll give it a try
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ok
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> note that it only does it for last finishes times
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i wanted to test it first
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this thing
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/929328235634892840/unknown.png
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<3 Hydra <3> EN —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki I generated https://ddnet.tw/ranks/jap/ with it (with one minor fix)
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and now I have the bug that Firefox on macOS formats with AM/PM even though I set 24 hour clock systemwide. Time to file a bug I guess...
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it does it for me too
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its cuz firefox language is es to en-us
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and us likes this pm am thing
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i can force it to  be 24h but that makes using the local locale a bit pointless
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows am/pm when i set it to spanish too
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats weird
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new Date().toLocaleTimeString()
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "12:17:52"
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new Date().toLocaleTimeString()
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "12:17:52"
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i see why
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change in the js code
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> navigator.language to undefined
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/929333403495575572/unknown.png
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can also set hour12: false
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the options
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to disable am pm on any locale
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Firefox sux
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> use tor
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :troll:
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Can one of mantainers rerun checks on my PR?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4573/checks
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> thank you
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki thanks, works now
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> thank you @deen.
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Clang-format extension in visual studio has different behavior than clang-format checks on github.
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> This file was automatically refactored by visual studio :cammo: 
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4573/commits/e8718df49ca6782ac71232e99fadfe8202c3edfb
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> did your pr also send the correct weapon when in freeze? (I also tried something similar some time ago, for prediction)
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont remember
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it displayed the current held weapon
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> ah, I see. something like that would be nice to have for sending the correct weapon + also movement direction/etc when in freeze
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know, you have to use a specific version of clang-format, every version formats slightly differently
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Brave is actually the best browser, + you have an access to tor
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> (@·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti)
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the best browser is curl
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> üòÇ
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i think this feature is pretty usefull for new kind of parts @deen 
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> For example now there are already parts where u have to become unfrozen from a deepfreezed tee but those parts often pretty unstable. 
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> A passive tee that has full gun controll can make such parts better.
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> And you can still decide what ability the livefrozen tees has with The existing hook and hammer on off tiles
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im not sure we need more functionnalities that will be used only for a few maps
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i think you confused favorite server with last finishes
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/929376569259073586/asd.PNG
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i mean this
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> it was in other order
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> let me see if i can find old
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> More functionialities always good if they dont affect backwards
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> more functionnalities = more bugs = more abuse
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> no u
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Who is Zoozti?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its u
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> its me
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :konsti_zoozer:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pink rat
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> noby
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noi2coco> Is there any chance ranks achieved while not being in a team no longer give extra points? This would prevent a group of players taking over a server and kicking out everyone who joins.
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: rainbow bush
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> u dont get extra points for team 0 ranks, only some rank points that are already splitted from teamrank points
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noi2coco> but you still get extra points if you get rank one right?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noi2coco> but you still get extra points if you get rank one right? (in team 0)
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> You would get 25 **rank points**
