04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> i like that you implemented that not only the main gets muted when u spam but also the dummy gets muted
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> how about implementing that dummy cant vote too after the main lost a vote
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> thanks
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> how about implementing that dummy cant call a vote anymore after the main lost a vote
04:55 <+Learath2> needs more generalized access control based on ips, which we don't really have in place right now
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> PLSSSSSSSSS
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> play the map "Piranha" with opengl 3 on
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what i meant all the time its just ugly bcs its so high detailed @Dev
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in this case its not just ugly its unplaybale
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when i close my client the console still keeps open .-. any ideas what can cause this problem?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> windows10 btw
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> not correctly handling WM_QUIT or WM_CLOSE in your event loop
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> or the corresponding sdl events
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sometimes it just takes longer but latley it takes sooo long that i always manually qut it and i loose my settings and stuff
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use ddnet 10.7.1
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but maybe my computer just gets ol .-.
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> d
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> you can also srpress the console
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> I think via `--silent` or some similar flag
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the consolle is pretty usefull imo

20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @deen is it possible to upload source inside .zip also in the official website plz?
20:43 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-11.0.2.tar.xz
20:43 <@deen> like that?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> this is .tar.xz, but on winshit it is quite hard to unzip it with winrar
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> got errors
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/archive/11.0.2.zip
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then that
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> yea, you should add all .zip link inside ddnet.tw/downloads, but thanks ðŸ˜ƒ
21:04 <@deen> ah, now I understand what you mean
21:04 <@deen> I thought the people who need source, will manage to extract a tar file^^
21:23 <+eeeee> who the hell still uses winrar? just use 7zip instead, it handles everything better
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> +1
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and 7z algorithm is good
21:25 <+eeeee> iirc it's similar (or even the same lzma) as .xz
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone here has a domain with this registar? https://njal.la
21:29 <+eeeee> consider gandi.net instead, seems more reputable
21:32 <+eeeee> unless you're actually doing sketchy stuff with it
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just wanted some privacy
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not doing ilegal stuff
21:34 <+eeeee> yeah me too, and i'm just buying my domains from aws under a fake name -_-
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.e
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aws = amazon?
21:35 <+eeeee> yea, i'm already buying some vps and dns from them so it's just convenient to also have the domains there
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is aws better than ovh? not just for websites, i also have some tw servers for unique
21:37 <+eeeee> can't really recommend for tw servers, traffic is too expensive
21:37 <+eeeee> unless you buy the "lightsail", but then it's not really any better than ovh
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> ddnet chile is down ðŸ˜¦
