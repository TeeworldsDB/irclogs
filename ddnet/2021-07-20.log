11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> is there a way to color the friendmark?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> like the friendmsg in chat?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> is there a setting to color the friendmark?
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> all i can find is cl_nameplates_friendmark 1 0 but that just turns it on or off

17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> > File -> Save -> Map details
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord api says I'm being ratelimited, but in the headers it reports me having 8 more slots in the bucket I'm supposedly being ratelimited in
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it take more than one token?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> token? no there is one bot token
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> more than one slot?*
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, nope, atleast it always took one slot all my other previous requests
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my error handling became such a mess today ðŸ˜¦
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 how long do you think will it take for your bot to be deployable? The map debugging thing in map testing is kinda important imo, so it would be cool if maybe my change in the python discord bot could be accepted, even if the bot is just temporary
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can accept it, the bot isn't working though
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The thing is literally broken, why do you think I'm spending like 7 hours a day rewriting it?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh, I thought it was just that new maps aren't getting channels
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to take over dealing with @jao being gone I'd be more than happy to let you take over
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I didn't mean to put on pressure, I'm sorry if I phrased that badly
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the already existing testing channels work like normal though if i understood correctly?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aah, I forgot, you don't even have access to the old discord bot, right?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The python bot is more than likely fine and has a little bug somewhere, but I can't check it out, because it's running on a server I don't have access to. The owner of the thing is not here for more than 10 minutes to transfer it to a ddnet server and he doesn't care to elaborate on what's broken except for "It's a permissions issue creating channels"
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The bot has admin perms, what permission issue...
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that sucks, then good luck on the rewrite, hope you don't overwork yourself there :)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think those are fine, yes
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A tad too late for that, I'm already exhausted
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh man :/
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm sorry to hear that
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vacation coming up, a little bit of sea will fix me right up ðŸ˜›
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't think that I can be very helpful for the rewrite (?)
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt it, it's not really in a format that's conducive to collaborating on for now
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but please know that I really appreciate all the work that you are investing in those beautiful projects. I'm not following the ddnet development too closely, but I do see a lot of your work and I love what you are doing, thank you :)
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thank you ðŸ™‚

19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "die a painful death"
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dared remove the ping numbers
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to die
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anonymous()> Damn deen is too nice of a guy
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean its a pretty annoying update.
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also takes like 5 seconds for me to update the serverlist
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this in no way justifies the language used above
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but its understandable
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wishing another human death over a game update? ^^
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean its understandable he got mad. what he said ofc is just BS and should be ignored
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should get master3 running again
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it should become less than 5 seconds, hopefully
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anonymous()> I have a doubt tho idk if it only happens to me
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anonymous()> When I'm in a server and refresh the browser the game behaves like connection problem. It only fixes after the servers are refreshed
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anonymous()> But before the update it didn't happen at all
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why is it his way now? like why doesnt it put in server after server in my list
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it downloads all the servers from a https URL
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can see it there
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my serverlist takes less than a sec to appear
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the actual download should take no time at all
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye its defenetly my internet
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the connection establishing takes some seconds for some people
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but before i had at least something to look at before all servers loaded ðŸ˜„
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3914
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this update should make it a bit more bearable
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it won't clear the server list when refreshing, so you can look at the old list in the meanwhile
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cool
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anonymous()> What is this? Is it common?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can websites be embeded as a whole in the client somehow?  imagine if we could choose a map like we can on the webiste instead of somehow making the old voting system work
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can you imagine how long it takes for USA xd
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well actually it might also just be 5 seconds
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i didnt count
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 the bot doesnt have admin perms else it couldnt be restricted from some channels
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont know either what the issue is i can just repeat what the error message is
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you want to transfer the bot you can do it and dm me then i can help when i have time
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need to setup the git and postgres
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you have done that its not much more work
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We also need to move the db
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I'm guessing you have some crons making it run, also need to set those up
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the db is generated from files
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the crons i can tell you yes
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> most what u need is in git
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, while you are here can we please do this, just don't disappear for like 30 minutes and I think we can set it up
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> okay try with the git and posgres first
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 someone already made a setup guide in the repo
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can just follow that
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no its def faster now
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> at least for me
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> before it'd be like u have to wait 8 seconds for the last servers to register in ur client
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> still
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now its just like 2 seconds for all of them to pop up
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for you its probably distance. for me its my shitty internet
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and u can do `leak_ip_address_to_all_servers` or smth to get the pings cant u
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh maybe
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also yeah i thought about this
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it would be cool to see people's player profiles
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it would be cool to see people's player profiles ingame
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk about new players but when i saw the ddnet map voting list for the first time i was pretty confused
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if we'd have a webkit lib, we could design the whole ui in html
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would ofc be awesome xd
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but makes the client 200mb or smth xD
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> has steam smth to automatically call the steam web browser and go into the steamoverlay?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> can someone copy the map that's currently being played on Trashmap? its from the guys with the 00:00s time
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://trashmap.ddnet.tw/server_list.php
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> can someone with access copy the map that's currently being played on Trashmap? its from the guys with the 00:00s time
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why don't you ask them
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how are you supposed to fill in the endpoints?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> i am sure that's a map they use for exploits
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we should stop talking here for now, the discord bot is a bit of an urgent matter lol
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> i am sure that's a map they use for exploits (i dont see a humanly-possible way to skip the start line on 0 to 100)

23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I doubt my python is better than yours but I'll gladly take a look
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It requires https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet.py to be loaded, which is in python2
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (it probably requires a very little subset of ddnet.py, but I couldn't isolate how much of it is needed)
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> shouldn't we update this to include NDL
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> shouldn't we update this to include NLD
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> by getting it to work you mean executing it and having it terminate without an error? ^^
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, I'd hope that also implies the json output isn't broken ðŸ˜„ so yes
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh, probably, idk if the cache that is generated even knows what nld is, it could still be doing just GER
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have no idea of the cache xd
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess just use best judgment
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the cache is really not supposed to be shared between machines like this imo, especially between python versions
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah wait this is python 2?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah no, just younger than python 3.8 apparently
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58825230/importerror-cannot-import-name-escape-from-cgi
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah that makes more sense
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `from html import escape` seems to work, next up it tries to import the module `mysql` which I seem to be missing
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you should be able to strip out the mysql part
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> found the package `python-mysql-connector`
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh `mysql` was actually just a script in that repo, now it tries to import `MySQLdb`, I guess I'll comment out that part
