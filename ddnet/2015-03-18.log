17:52 <@deen> Anyone have an idea?: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/173
18:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: does this guy have the newest version?
18:07 <@deen> Pretty sure he does
18:07 <@deen> He always reports compilation problems immediately^^
18:10 < fstd> ask him for a core dump?
18:17 <@heinrich5991> fstd: doesn't look like linux
18:18 < fstd> there must be a way of doing some sort of post-mortem analysis on windows, too
18:19 < fstd> (or he could reproduce the crash in a debugger, if reproducible)
18:19 < fstd> or at least hope to catch it by chance, if not reproducible
18:22 <@heinrich5991> not sure what your point is ^^
18:25 <@heinrich5991> oh, you were listing alternatives for asking for a coredump
19:53 < MattiaSuper> [19:49:14] HI
19:53 < MattiaSuper> [19:49:36] HELP ADMINNNN
19:53  * MattiaSuper [19:50:51] slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:56 <@heinrich5991> MattiaSuper: what's your question?
20:06 <@deen> he wants his ranks and points back after being caught botting
20:07 < MattiaSuper> no wonder the least points I've used only a map bot
20:07 < MattiaSuper> and Nelson tnp using bots do not do a shit?
20:10 <@deen> haven't seen any proof of him botting
20:41 < o_be_one> hi all
20:41 < o_be_one> lol fstd and eeeee :p
20:50 < Paralix> PEOPLEEEEEE
20:50 < Paralix> I would like to have a new council
20:51 < Learath2> a council for?
20:52 < Paralix> name :D
20:52 < Paralix> paralix you like the name?
22:02 < eeeee> sounds like an insult implying that your playing skills are on par with a paralyzed disabled person
22:53 < fstd> eeeee: you're kinda sorta an hour late and really should use my advanced ircdenoise tchnlg (patent pending)
