02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what should it do? ðŸ˜‚
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i mean that appears when u select the "tricktee" map
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> looks like you selected the line under it
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> wtf
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> my bad i never realized that was clickable
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ...
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Can you not read

06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :troll:
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @n000b i don't know if the nightly got updated (the page says every night 3:45am)
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> here is the garantueed  client with that fix try ^^ :
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/def-/ddnet/builds/21589414/artifacts
09:17 <@deen> nono, the nightly is manual now, only when I update it
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> also number of players wrong
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah good to know deen ðŸ˜„
10:47 <@deen> but yeah, the text in the post was clearly out of date, I added an update to clarify
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i could have just read the buildlog, it even said 2017 xd
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh thats nice
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> [2019-01-14 12:33:16][register]: WARNING: Master server is not responding, switching master
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> im using latest version server and allowed udp port via ufw
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah ur server will do that occasionally, if it just picks a different master and registers then there is no problem

12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> this is my problem
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what is the problem?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> look players
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> did u refresh server browser
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> yes
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> are u a spectator or something
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if ur in spec and u have the setting enabled to not count specs as players, thats the only thing i can think of
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> 
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/534336063326388240/issue.gif
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> im in game
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive never seen that before :thonkery:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> i can give ip address if you want try
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> or you can see server name :d
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i see ur server in the list with 3 players
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but the players are not listed
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> youre probably being flooded with info requests which is why servers do this
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/534338364921479179/Screen_Shot_2019-01-14_at_5.49.26_AM.png
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u need to use a network monitoring program like tcpdump or something to find which ip is sending the flood so u can block it
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or just block all udp packets with source port 80 because most flooders use this by default
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think they flood many servers at once because i see this type of traffic hitting my server as well
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/534339263265767444/Screen_Shot_2019-01-14_at_5.51.51_AM.png
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> hm what is the point of these? :d
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk why people do it
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but if u have a teeworlds server up and registerd to masters then it will probably be flooded by this type of traffic at least, if not actively targeted
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> so you are like being ddosed in a way?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> sometimes i get ddos but no this does not count as a ddos
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 99 Godfather> oh
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its only ~1000 packets/sec, all from the same ip and blocked by like 3 different methods
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> 
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/534344014909014055/dos.gif
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol yep
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> theres ur problem
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if u r on linux, do `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 80 -j DROP`
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and if the flooding is not coming from default port 80
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> (which it is but) do sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 106.13.13.0/24 -j DROP
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> i blocked with ufw i guess
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> hm nice server is normal now
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :happy:
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> will the next version be 11.8 or 11.7.3?^^
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Depends on whether we have any big changes
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Bug fixes and small stuff -> 11.7.3, big changes -> 11.8
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @mir http://106.13.13.29/ is a chinese website lul, looks like a bot :v
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> the ip that attacked u
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> some chinese ip address banned from my ssh conenction :d
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> some chinese ip address banned from my ssh connection :d
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeah well it's always like that
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> and it's funny to see logs of tested users
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i hate those, with a port different than 22 you get way less of them
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> doesn't need change port
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> im gonna use port knocking
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yeah they can always find which port it is, but by only allowing a group or a few users, only with keys and on a different port, you nearly never get any bots trying to connect, i have 0 of those in my logs for the last few days
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just setup a honeypot on 22
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:KirbyJam:434485279726764033>
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> just setup a setup
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and change real ssh to a high port
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Honey:heartw:
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Ryozuki no
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> the best would be to redirect 22 port to the current IP who asked to connect on it :v)
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Cuz CONNECTING ON HIS OWN MACHINE IS COOL
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you use ssh keys only (`PasswordAuthentication no`), it is infeasible for an attacker to get into your system. disable logging of failed attempts and the problem is gone
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its always nice to collect data
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about what they try to do
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> in a network sure but i wouldn't do that on the same server, just because another open port is another possible factor
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @heinrich5991 basically if you disable Password auth you have to disable PAM also
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well basically
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> true. it's disabled by default, but some distros might enable it for you
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki why store gigabytes of their attempts? at some point you have to prune them anyway
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @deen just create those accounts with a restricted shell or just with /bin/false :v)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 is teehistorian causing demos to be removed? I see lots of " failed to remove: demos/_8324_0_tmp.demo " on official servers during startup
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Delete teehistorian :feelsgoodman: :feelsgoodman: :feelsgoodman: :feelsgoodman:
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen teehistorian code only ever writes data
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, strange
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it shouldn't mess with demos at all
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, i'M seeing it locally too
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thought it's only on official servers
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then I'll take a look
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, these are new error messages
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yep
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> before the if was the wrong way around ðŸ˜„
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it only printed an error when the removal was successful
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teeworlds code always looks so scary. thanks for at least adding logging for these filesystem errors
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, I see the code
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1733-L1745
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, unconditional removing
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I guess it's not a problem here
