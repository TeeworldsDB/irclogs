15:12 < skeptar> is anyone Here? :?
15:13 < devnull> hello
15:18 < o_be_two> nobody is here right now :p
16:08 < tyurd> how I can fix this error? http://puu.sh/kllBs/ba8b90a89e.jpg
16:09 < tyurd> using latest source for github.
16:14 <@deen> tyurd: good question
16:14 <@deen> many got that error and I'm wondering how to properly solve it
16:14 < tyurd> ah
16:15 < tyurd> maybe wrong dependencies?
16:15 <@deen> as a quick fix you can install libcurl-dev and remove config.lua
16:15 < tyurd> ok
16:15 <@deen> but I think it's just a -ldl missing on the command line
16:15 <@deen> could you try bam release -v
16:15 < tyurd> sure
16:15 <@deen> then you get the line that fails
16:15 <@deen> I would like to see it
16:16 < tyurd> eh
16:16 <@deen> there should be an -ldl in it, you could try moving it to an earlier position
16:16 < tyurd> how?
16:16 <@deen> and running that line (it's pretty long
16:16 < tyurd> yea its pretty long
16:16 < tyurd> -ldl is there
16:16 <@deen> can you paste the line on pastebin?
16:16 <@deen> or gist.github.com
16:16 < tyurd> btw. how I can install "libcurl-dev"? would be awesome when its possible over apt-get.
16:16 < tyurd> yea sure, wait
16:17 <@deen> yeah, you can apt-get install it, but please let's first try to fix it the proper way
16:17 < tyurd> yea
16:17 <@deen> apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
16:17 < tyurd> ok
16:18 < tyurd> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/822877743a9d4594bcf4
16:20 <@deen> hm, works on my system
16:21 < tyurd> hehe
16:21 <@deen> what if you remove the -ldl occurences? (2)
16:21 <@deen> or write -ldl at the end only
16:21 <@deen> or at the start
16:21 < tyurd> wait.
16:21 <@deen> and what OS are you on?
16:21 < tyurd> Ubuntu Mate
16:21 < tyurd> VM
16:25 < tyurd> deen: which command? the first or the second g++ cmd?
16:25 <@deen> they should be the same
16:25 < tyurd> ah, oh
16:26 < tyurd> yea.
16:26 < tyurd> eh..
16:27 < tyurd> -ldl at the end looks a bit better
16:27 <@deen> how so?
16:28 < tyurd> wait im trying to reach the start
16:28 <@deen> i think it's caused by some cyclic lib dependencies
16:28 <@deen> so maybe we need to change the order of libs
16:28 <@deen> and i don't know why it only happens on ubuntu
16:28 < tyurd> when its on the end there only appear "Inkompatible version" errors
16:28 <@deen> then it worked!
16:28 <@deen> that's perfect
16:28 < tyurd> ah
16:29 <@deen> you've got a compiled client, right?
16:29 <@deen> ls -lha DDNet
16:29 < tyurd> yes
16:29 <@deen> great
16:29 < tyurd> :D
16:29 < tyurd> well now you know how to fix?
16:29 <@deen> i guess one day i should try to understand why libs have to be specified in this weird order
16:29 <@deen> yep, thanks!
16:29 < tyurd> nice, no problem!
16:33 <@deen> not sure if this is good enough, can you give it a try, tyurd?: 
16:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vn6Tb
16:33 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master b3f094b def: Some systems want -ldl as the end, so let's do that
16:33 < tyurd> yes
16:33 <@deen> maybe it needs to be pushed even further
16:33 < fstd> ahh
16:33 < fstd> some systems don't want -ldl at all
16:33 < fstd> this is a linuxism
16:34 <@deen> fstd: is it? we always added -ldl for all
16:34 <@EastByte> good to know
16:34 < fstd> yeah, and i always patched it away :)
16:34 <@deen> then make a PR of your patches :P
16:34 <@deen> Mac needed it too iirc
16:34 <@deen> and i didn't test anything else unix like
16:34 < fstd> all BSDs don't need -ldl and won't compile it it is present, their dynamic loading facilities are in the standard lib and need no extra -l whatsoever
16:34 <@deen> ok, then linux+mac only
16:36 < tyurd> deen: bam: done
16:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vn6Ik
16:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 596ee34 def: -ldl for Linux and Mac OSX only
16:36 <@deen> tyurd: great, thanks
16:36 < tyurd> np
16:36 <@deen> tyurd: you might still want to install libcurl, libopus etc though
16:36 <@deen> we just ship them for convenience, ideally you'd use your system versions
16:36 < tyurd> ok
16:36 <@deen> list of libs is here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#building
16:37 < tyurd> yup
16:37 <@deen> would be interesting to see if that's the actual list, after removing config.lua you should get "using pkg-config" everywhere
16:38 < tyurd> libcurl-dev could not found by apt-get
16:38 < devnull> apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
16:38 <@deen> or libcurl4-openssl-dev
16:38 < devnull> or openssl instead of gnutls
16:38 < devnull> depends
16:38 < devnull> yy thanks deen
16:38 < tyurd> ok
16:39 <@deen> wait, we need libogg-dev instead of libogg etc
16:39 < tyurd> I knew it 
16:40 <@deen> i should probably list all the dependencies
16:40 <@deen> what else do we need, libsdl-dev, libfreetype6-dev
16:40 < tyurd> yes that would be awesome
16:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vn6qE
16:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 012b20c def: Clarify required dependencies
16:44 < fstd> deen: you could cherry-pick 0e2a134c2a6635bfb7c7fc1fda791131a31cc88d and 69fe8ec1bc8900b517765d8cc4933e0b96df5104 which (apart from the -ldl issue) basically constitute my current patchset
16:44 < fstd> (both commits have been merged by vanilla upstream)
16:45 < fstd> (the 2nd one is not strictly required because ddnet is not in pkgsrc, but i might add it sooner or later, so it can't hurt)
16:47 <@deen> fstd: looks good, thanks
16:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/vn63m
16:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d276f2c fstd: add /usr/pkg to the list of paths searched for data files (this is the default installation prefix on NetBSD (pkgsrc))
16:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 522c413 fisted: support NetBSD
16:49 < fstd> \o/
16:50 <@deen> well, we should probably rename from teeworlds to ddnet in the install locations if we ever get accepted to some distribution
16:51 < fstd> yep, true
16:51 < fstd> (however, doesn't matter for pkgsrc, it has a patch framework)
16:51 < fstd> so that could be fixed on the fly

20:18 <@EastByte> all people complaining about laggs on GER2 but barely one is leaving the server
20:23 <@deen> server is pretty overloaded, stupid hoster =/
20:23 <@deen> 100 players should not fill 100% of a core
20:26 <@deen> they don't pass the CPU properly to KVM i think, instead emulating some generic CPU
20:31 <@EastByte> the vcore of the openvz container seems to have no limitations
20:31 <@EastByte> it's even faster than the cores of my i5
20:31 <@deen> yeah, until it's overloaded
20:31 <@EastByte> do you mean the host system?
20:31 <@deen> I've never seen such a low performance KVM
20:31 <@deen> yeah
20:31 <@EastByte> well, I don't think gametown will have many customers, I'm probably alone there :3
20:32 <@deen> cat /proc/cpuinfo just says "Generic KVM CPU"
20:32 <@deen> instead of the actual host cpu
20:32 <@deen> so if they're emulating some CPU, that explains the performance...
20:32 <@EastByte> yep
20:32 <@EastByte> model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3930K CPU @ 3.20GH
20:36 <@deen> i even explained that to them, but no response
20:36 <@deen> i think it would even be in their own interest to have faster KVM servers for free
20:37 <@deen> I'm also not sure if qcow2 is the right hard disk format for high performance...

22:05 <@deen> if anyone wants to see how it looks when a ddos reaches GER2: http://ddnet.tw/ddos.png http://ddnet.tw/ddos2.png http://ddnet.tw/ddos3.png
22:05 <@deen> ddos2 is when ddos, ddos3 without ddos
22:16 < fstd> interesting
22:16 < fstd> but 5 Mbit (or is it MB?) seems rather pathetic a ddos
22:17 < fstd> (according to the first image)
22:17 <@deen> yeah, that's usually just the start
22:17 < fstd> ah
22:17 <@deen> or what gets through the ddos protection already
22:17 <@deen> and then the ddos protection detects it
22:17 <@deen> and proceeds to block ALL udp traffic...
22:17 <@deen> i can ssh to the server, just takes 10 seconds to connect, then it's perfectly fine
22:17 <@deen> so for tcp it would probably stay kind of usable
22:41 < tyurd> deen: not sure if it belongs to ddnet but I can't open the console (F1) using Ubuntu Mate in borderless window mode
22:43 <@deen> weird
22:43 <@deen> same in TW?
22:45 < tyurd> i'll test. wait
22:49 < tyurd> yea same issue there
22:50 <@deen> strange, no idea
22:51 < tyurd> is there a shortcut for opening file explorer?
22:53 < tyurd> nvm, i should use google first
22:54 < laxa> tyurd: always
