16:42 < hannibal> deen?
16:42 < hannibal> hi
16:42 < hannibal> da?
16:43 < hannibal> find mich ingame hab ne frage ;D
17:32 <@EastByte> !twp east
17:32 < Nimda> east is currently playing dm1 on server : Antispoof test - Password: TERC.
17:33 <@EastByte> deen: ^ probably not usable for ddnet, this is a simplified way of antispoof
17:33 <@EastByte> using password as token
17:34 <@deen> hm, ok
17:34 < Sadale> interesting. Didn't know that this bot also works on non-DDNet server
17:34 < Sadale> How does the bot know that password? :o
17:34 <@EastByte> it's generated based on the ip address
17:34 <@deen> any idea why KoG Chile has lower ping than DDNet Chile, even though we're at the same hoster?
17:34 <@deen> it's really weird, same route too
17:35 <@deen> but constant 10ms difference
17:35 < Sadale> hmm. let me check in asia for some useless information
17:35 < laxa> Sadale: the bot doesn't know anything
17:35 < laxa> he is using EastByte API
17:35  * EastByte is backend for everything :D
17:35 < Sadale> laxa, I'm confused. But anyway.
17:35 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/Nimda3/blob/master/plugins/user/Plugin_TwPlayerStatus.php
17:35 < laxa> the code is here
17:36 < Sadale> lol. "Ubuntu teeworlds server"
17:40 < Sadale> deen, checked. The pings are the same from hong kong to KoG Chile and from here to DDNet Chile
17:40 < Sadale> both ~350ms
17:40 <@deen> Sadale: yeah, it's weird. i checked from all other ddnet servers, actually from some 1 has 30 ms lower, from others the other...
17:41 < Sadale> deen, it must be solar storm :p
17:42 <@deen> no, it must be shitty hoster^^
17:42 <@deen> and expensive one
17:42 <@deen> just checked 50 or so other hosters in chile, didn't find anything better
17:43 <@deen> the worst part is that most "chilean" hosters actually host in the USA
17:45 < Sadale> deen, :o interseting.
17:45 <@deen> iranian hosters are also often actually located in Germany
17:45 <@deen> much cheaper bandwidth and server hosting in Europe and North America
17:52 < Sadale> deen, interesting. It seems that you learned a lot about the subtleties of server hoster by running DDNet
17:54 <@deen> not sure it's useless knowledge
17:55 <@deen> but yeah, have to deal with bullshit of server hosting all the time
18:00 < Sadale> deen, you actually find the hosters directly? :o
18:00 < Sadale> (instead of asking a local person to help you to find a hoster)
18:13 <@deen> oh i ask them, but they rarely find good hosters unfortunately =/

19:53 < KinG__> hey
19:53 <@EastByte> hi
20:00 <@deen> hi KinG__ 
20:34 <@deen> so I'm trying to set up a new Persian server
20:34 <@deen> but that's kind of difficult with the server having 60% packet loss to the entire world
20:41 <@EastByte> unless you have a portable installer script
20:43 <@deen> the installer script would still need to transfer data
20:47 <@EastByte> hmm
20:47 < Savander> Hi
20:47 <@EastByte> hi
20:47 <@deen> hi
20:47 < Savander> What's u[
20:47 <@deen> It's now better and I'm coyping with 100 KB/s
20:47 <@deen> I'm setting up another Persian server
20:47 < Savander> Persian?
20:47 <@deen> soon we'll have tried every single hoster in Iran
20:48 <@deen> Persia = Iran
20:48 < Savander> ah
20:48 <@deen> They prefer the name Persia over there
20:48 < Savander> 300 Sparan
20:48 < Savander> 300 Spartan
20:49 < Savander> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/
20:49 < Savander> We shouldn't fight with them!
20:56 <@deen> KinG__: hi, copying very slowly to the server
20:56 < KinG__> deen:  why?!
20:56 <@deen> it has a bad connection to the rest of the world
20:56 < KinG__> hows the packet loss stat?
20:56 <@deen> i tried from USA and GER
20:56 <@deen> sometimes 60%, now only 10%
20:56 < KinG__> wtf
20:56 < KinG__> u mean this is worse than server we had before?
20:57 <@deen> probably from outside iran, yeah
20:57 <@deen> don't know how it is from inside iran
20:57 < KinG__> i pinget it
20:57 < KinG__> 1% packet loss for me
20:57 < KinG__> hmmm
20:58 < KinG__> idk... but i'll buy a dedicated myslef soon that'll be good and we'll have no problem, just that idk when i can affort to buy it
20:58 < KinG__> around 15000$
21:00 <@deen> $?
21:00 <@deen> for what time?
21:00 <@deen> $ like USD?
21:04 <@deen> now much faster
21:04 <@deen> from 15 KB/s to 3 MB/s
21:07 < KinG__> yes
21:08 < KinG__> USD $
21:08 <@deen> for what time?
21:08 <@EastByte> 15 years hopefully
21:15 < KinG__> idk
21:16 < KinG__> no not like that
21:16 < KinG__> i buy the Case itself
21:16 < KinG__> hardware
21:17 <@deen> ok, 15k makes a nice server
21:17 <@deen> what are you doing with it?
21:18 < KinG__> game servers
21:18 < KinG__> selling vps
21:18 < KinG__> vpn service
21:18 < KinG__> and ...
21:18 < KinG__> making money 
21:18 < KinG__> hosting websites
21:18 <@deen> good luck
21:19 < KinG__> thx
21:32 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
21:32 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 542
21:32 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
21:46 <@deen> ok, server running
21:52 <@deen> next problem is: why does the memory usage of ddnet server grow so much and can we reduce it?
21:53 <@deen> something may be leaking or some heap thing is set to grow too large
21:54 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/mem-long.txt http://ddnet.tw/mem-short.txt
21:54 <@deen> first is a long running process, second a short one
21:55 <@deen> the first few anon memory blocks are the main difference
21:55 <@deen> 60 MB stored there, but what for?
22:05 <@EastByte> deen: why is there no heap marked in the mem map?
22:06 <@deen> it's all heap?
22:06 <@deen> or mostly
22:06 < WolfAlex> deen: projectiles flying out of the map? :D
22:06 <@deen> WolfAlex: yeah, i actually think it is something like that
22:07 <@deen> some dynamic thing being generated
22:07 <@deen> and becoming more and more
22:07 <@EastByte> can we exclude mysql?
22:07 <@deen> as the source of the problem?
22:07 <@EastByte> yea
22:07 <@deen> no, i think it may also be related to mysql
22:08 <@EastByte> hm
22:08 <@deen> because the zcatch servers have the same problem
22:08 <@deen> since Savander added mysql support to them^^
22:08 <@deen> no other TW servers have the problem
22:10 < Savander> cuz mysql support was taken
22:10 < Savander> from ddrace
22:10 < Savander> ;)
22:10 <@deen> yeah, maybe that code leaks
22:10 < Savander> or ddnet idk
22:10 <@deen> but i checked the code and ran it locally with valgrind and could never find leaks
22:10 < Savander> btw
22:11 <@EastByte> we'll need some kind of debugging/logging in production
22:12 <@EastByte> maybe by using a custom heap for the new operator
22:15 <@EastByte> deen, Savander: do you like my 0.7 skin? http://eastbit.net/priv/09_Aug-15-20_59.png
22:15 <@EastByte> looks pretty much the same
22:15 <@deen> ^^
22:15 < Savander> when you compiling zCatch with MySQL, you got some errors if you don't have mysql package installed,  which are used here https://github.com/savander/zCatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/ranking.h#L6-L10
22:16 < Savander> but i don't remember the name
22:16 < Savander> :/
22:16 < Savander> now i can't check
22:16 < Savander> ddnet hasn't problem with it ;P
22:16 < Savander> it's custom skin ?
22:16 < Savander> i mean, maded inside 0.7 ?
22:16 <@EastByte> yes
22:17 <@EastByte> I should make a 0.6 to 0.7 skin converter
22:17 < Savander> Nice ears :D
22:17 < Savander> 0.6 to 0.7 skin converter?
22:17 < Savander> what was changed?
22:17 <@EastByte> normal skins with custom colors
22:17 <@EastByte> 0.7 has more decoration options
22:17 <@EastByte> body, feet, markings, decoration, hands
22:18 < Savander> ahm
22:18 < Savander> i need to check this :D
22:18 < Savander> but i need to install gcc + bam + download sources
22:18 <@EastByte> :D, pretty old update actually
22:18 < Savander> bla bla
22:19 < Savander> http://savander.pl/upload/teeworlds-0.7.0-slope-linux_x86.tar.gz
22:19 <@EastByte> unfortunatly 0.7 dev is stuck again
22:19 < Savander> with slopes!!
22:19 <@EastByte> yea I hope they will be in 0.7
22:19 < Savander> (2015-05-08 version)
22:19 <@EastByte> so there is actually something new
22:19 < Savander> yup
22:19 < Savander> at this time
22:20 < Savander> Obst made  a map
22:20 < Savander> for slopes
22:20 < Savander> :P 
22:20 < Savander> We had some fun :D
22:20 < Savander> and i hosted a server for slopes for a few months
22:20 < Savander> :P
22:21 < Savander> Were few players sometimes! :D
22:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/v3L7E
22:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 1fd0f94 def: Better numbers in average time for /mapinfo
22:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master f79a0be def: Merge branch 'master' of github.com:def-/ddnet
22:23 < Savander> tw0.7 looks really cool
22:23 <@EastByte> dunno, its ui feels a bit blurred
22:24 < Savander> feels more modern for me
22:24 < Savander> :p
22:24 <@EastByte> might be
22:24 <@EastByte> well already oldschool since now we have metro style
22:25 < Savander> last official release was 2012 i guess
22:25 < Savander> we need something fresh
22:25 < Savander> it is!
22:25 <@EastByte> current players will hate it though
22:26 < Savander> maybe
22:27 < Savander> They will accustoms with it
22:27 < Savander> download my slope version and come to me haha! :p
22:28 <@deen> we could also introduce new features like that in ddnet
22:29 <@deen> and show players with an old ddnet / non-ddnet client that they have to update client to play this map
22:29 <@deen> might be interesting to add slopes
22:29 < Savander> after 0.7 release?
22:29 <@deen> no, right now
22:29 < Savander> ohm
22:29 <@deen> I don't plan after TW releases
22:29 < Savander> ^^
22:30 <@EastByte> what server?
22:30 <@deen> if anyone feels up for it. mappers would love it i bet
22:30 < Savander> but as i know,slope is not certain that it will be introduced
22:30 < Savander> Teeworlds.com.pl
22:30 <@deen> well, we can still introduce it on ddnet
22:32 <@EastByte> it always feels so hacky working on ddnet
22:32 <@EastByte> Savander: can't connect
22:32 < Savander> with my version?
22:32 < Savander> or your?
22:32 <@EastByte> your
22:32 < Savander> hmm
22:32 < Savander> maybe because now it's on my local
22:32 < Savander> computer
22:34 <@deen> EastByte: that's because it is hacky^^
22:34 <@EastByte> Savander: got version mismatch when connecting to local server :P
22:35 < Savander> o.O
22:35 < Savander> okaaay, its weird
22:35 < Savander> i played on it
22:35 < Savander> with obst
22:35 <@EastByte> deen: but ddnet can't continue like that forever
22:35 < Savander> 1 years ago xD
22:35 <@deen> EastByte: you'd prefer to rewrite it or what?
22:36 <@EastByte> complete cleanup or rewrite, yes
22:36 < KinG_> deen: how is it going
22:36 <@deen> KinG_: server is runnign
22:36 < KinG_> ok going to test
22:37 <@deen> EastByte: lots of work and lots of risk of breaking stuff
22:37 <@heinrich5991> (but you're not making it better by introducing new features like slopes)
22:37 < Savander> meeeh
22:37 < Savander> EastByte,  probably something wrong with linux version
22:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: surely not, but then ddnet should never have added any features
22:37 < Savander> :/
22:38 <@heinrich5991> nah
22:38 <@deen> and i don't think ddnet would even exist at all now
22:38 < Savander> i doesn't have sources so i can't compile it, or give it to you.
22:38 < Savander> i don't
22:38 < Savander> --
22:39 <@EastByte> wait for 0.7
22:39 <@EastByte> o/
22:39 < Savander> it was test feature xD
22:39 <@heinrich5991> I think that ddrace/ddnet should have just thought about some features a little more before introducing them
22:39 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: now that's a non-solution too IMO ^^
22:39 < KinG_> deen: some persian servers have name of    DDNet Ger test
22:40 <@deen> KinG_: right, my bad
22:40 < KinG_> deen: packet loss is pretty not much lagz but ping is too high i'll contact ISP tommorow
22:40 < KinG_> oh
22:40 < KinG_> my internet is bad
22:40 < KinG_> wtf
22:40 < KinG_> server is good
22:40 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: don't worry, Oy said it's being released this year
22:41 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: that's just one more thing to worry about
22:41 <@EastByte> :D
22:41 <@heinrich5991> I think it's nowhere near release
22:41 <@EastByte> doesn't look like it, yes
22:41 <@heinrich5991> and releasing it anyway would just be bad
22:41 <@heinrich5991> (e.g. we really need a solution to the spoofing stuff before 0.7)
22:41 <@deen> heinrich5991: meh, I'm not motivated to run ddnet much anyway
22:42 < Savander> btw heinrich5991, you like my "Main capsule" image?
22:42 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I thought you already fixed that?
22:42 <@EastByte> oh, now I understand
22:42 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yea, but either that needs to be merged by Oy or rewritten in a way he likes better
22:42 <@heinrich5991> if he's ready to merge, I'll happily rebase, but otherwise not
22:43 < KinG_> deen: it's good veryyyyy good i lag like hell in persian pro servers but tried playing in ddnet persian and it's so so much better
22:43 <@heinrich5991> but don't worry, that PR is only in the queue for...
22:43 <@EastByte> I don't think Oy's solution would be a lot different than yours
22:43 <@heinrich5991> oh, I missed my PR's third birthday
22:44 <@heinrich5991> ^^
22:44 <@EastByte> btw. are there some papers on how to do proper spoofing proof udp handshakes?
22:44 < KinG_> deen: can u run openfng too plz
22:45 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: I don't know. isn't sending a token that needs to be repeated pretty straightforward?
22:45 <@EastByte> hm if it's about network security there always are huge discussions on how to do things properly
22:46 <@EastByte> like with cert authentification
22:47 <@heinrich5991> you mean the discussions about CAs?
22:47 <@EastByte> maybe
22:48 <@deen> people are really hating ddnet anyway. don't like all the personal attacks
22:48 <@heinrich5991> people aren't hating ddnet
22:48 <@heinrich5991> the people who dislike ddnet the most are the ones writing you messages, people liking it don't
22:48 <@deen> example german video: https://youtu.be/0mC7XKQ1EaM
22:49 <@EastByte> well that's Forris
22:49 <@heinrich5991> the project is really big, it surely has people who don't like it
22:49 <@heinrich5991> but these aren't the ones who matter, at least as long they're few
22:51 <@heinrich5991> LOL
22:51 <@heinrich5991> the first thing he says in the video is that his opinion is not illegal to express
22:52 <@heinrich5991> https://xkcd.com/1357/, see the title text
22:52 <@deen> yes, that's a common thing, since I'm known as Kim Jung Deen since I introduced a Code of Conduct, which apparently censors any free speech: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1637
22:53 <@deen> KinG_: running
22:53 < Savander> There are the same people, who are hating ddnet
22:53 < Savander> over and over again
22:55 <@EastByte> hm
22:57 <@heinrich5991> mh. he cheats, makes a fake video.
22:58 <@heinrich5991> he says that you're declaring him as a cheater and complains about that – wait... he confessed to being a cheater, what's his problem
22:58 <@heinrich5991> will stop watching the video now, I don't like it
22:59 <@heinrich5991> (he complains about the other cheater not being mentioned so much. that may be a legitimate complaint, however, no need to make a hate video just because of this)
23:00 <@deen> for reference, the other cheater didn't manipulate others into fighting for him
23:00 < Savander> his behaviour is really childish
23:00 <@deen> and also didn't post pages of arguments and faked proofs
23:00 <@deen> and faked video etc
23:01 < WolfAlex> deen: but ddnet has done some pretty bad decisions recently
23:01 < Savander> btw, he insults others who's not accept his opinion
23:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: a code of conduct is a good idea IMO
23:01 <@deen> He's referring to this: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1759
23:01 <@deen> WolfAlex: yes?
23:01 <@heinrich5991> e.g. not discussing moderation is a neccessity for not allowing moderator witch hunts
23:01 < Savander> yes, codde of conduct is great idea
23:02 <@heinrich5991> the complaints about code of conduct are the same all over again, e.g. rust also has a code of conduct with exactly the same discussion
23:02 < Savander> people want to do everything they want
23:02 <@heinrich5991> yet I think the community induced by the code of conduct is better than the one without
23:02 < WolfAlex> deen: yes, the most important one is proably the http map downloading
23:04 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: can you lay out some reasons as for why this is a very bad idea? :)
23:04 < WolfAlex> sure
23:04 <@heinrich5991> I mean you're always encouraged to take discussions to github, where the new features get introduced
23:04 <@heinrich5991> I'm sure your voice will also be heard
23:04 < WolfAlex> since other servers can not host big maps (cause of slow downloading speed)
23:04 < Savander> they can't?
23:05 < WolfAlex> no they can't supply maps over http download
23:05 < WolfAlex> only ddnet can
23:05 <@heinrich5991> you could attribute this to ddnet's limited resources
23:05 <@heinrich5991> however, this does not make http download as a feature a bad idea IMO
23:05 <@heinrich5991> it's just the implementation that is a bit lacking
23:05 < Savander> add server_host
23:05 <@heinrich5991> but that should be fixable within a few lines of code
23:05 <@deen> well, i actually stole and simplified Rust's CoC
23:06 <@heinrich5991> heh :)
23:06 < WolfAlex> heinrich5991: no the downloading is _not_ the problem, the problem is that only ddnet servers/maps can use that
23:06 <@heinrich5991> ok, that sounds like a problem
23:06 <@heinrich5991> however, this should be easily fixable
23:06 < Savander> maybe it should works like fast download in Counter-strike
23:07 <@heinrich5991> you could e.g. send the URL instead of the map
23:07 < WolfAlex> yes :D
23:07 <@deen> sure, I'm welcoming a PR with that
23:07 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: and that it wasn't implemented the way I now suggest can be attributed to limited developer resources
23:07 < Savander> you need to put URL to server where maps is
23:07 <@heinrich5991> and I'm sure deen will be content with adding it
23:07 < Savander> maps are*
23:07 <@heinrich5991> (as evidenced by [23:07:35] <@deen> sure, I'm welcoming a PR with that)
23:08 <@deen> I'm just happy that we can reduce server load and cost with the http map downloading
23:08 < WolfAlex> but deen was against that if i rememver correctly (but i'm not sure about that)
23:08 <@deen> and it's not hurting other servers at least, it's neutral for them
23:08 <@deen> i don't remember a discussion about that idea
23:08 <@heinrich5991> an advantage for ddnet is a disadvantage for others though. it just didn't make the absolute postion worse
23:08 <@heinrich5991> but I totally understand why you added it for ddnet only first
23:08 <@EastByte> the ddnet client could indeed be a bit more mod friendly
23:09 <@heinrich5991> haha
23:09 <@EastByte> it's pretty dependent on ddnet servers + ddrace mod
23:09 <@heinrich5991> yea :/
23:09 <@heinrich5991> (just haha because that's the same people say to vanilla^^)
23:09 <@EastByte> ^^
23:10 <@deen> how is ddnet not mod friendly?
23:11 < WolfAlex> deen: wait
23:11 <@deen> we have support for race, ddrace, xxlddrace, 64 player stuff in other mods, disable zoom in non-race mods
23:11 <@deen> i don#t think I've ever not added a feature because it would be mod-friendly
23:11 <@EastByte> it has better mod support than vanilla
23:12 <@EastByte> well
23:12 < WolfAlex> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/30f0b9c8a21ece3240ec33bbe86d3fef542cd218/src/engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp
23:12 < WolfAlex> if i remember corret some parts are calling the isddnet part, so servers that are not ddnet servers
23:12 < WolfAlex> can not use these features
23:13 <@deen> WolfAlex: yes, but if you have a better idea for discovering those features, please implement it
23:13 < WolfAlex> well with my limited (no at all) skills i can do nothing xD
23:13 < WolfAlex> EastByte is my coder :E
23:13 <@EastByte> ^ this guy is so lazy
23:14 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: then take the advice that coding does cost a time, and not only a little
23:14 <@deen> for now all i can offer is to add any mod that uses those features to the list
23:14 <@heinrich5991> for example for the problem you're describing you'd first need to think of a solution before even being able to code it ^^
23:15 < WolfAlex> heinrich5991: sure, i know what you mean ... 
23:16 <@EastByte> do you guys remember fstd_ and eeeee's approach with the ddwar client?
23:16 <@deen> nope, never used any other client than ddnet :P
23:16 <@EastByte> iirc they wanted to make a mod friendly client
23:16 < laxa> ddnet made ddnet before event starting teeworlds :p
23:16 < Savander> xD
23:16 < laxa> *even
23:16 < laxa> Challenge accepted !
23:17 <@deen> laxa: actually yes, the client is from pretty early when i played TW, long before ddnet
23:17 <@deen> i mainly added 1 feature: disable quads
23:17 <@deen> so i can play with 60 fps^^
23:18 <@EastByte> this was one of my most important features aswell
23:18 < laxa> wow
23:18 < laxa> you must really have bad computers
23:19 <@deen> yeah, graphics card found in garbage can and terrible linux driver doesn't help either^^
23:19 < laxa> x)
23:21 <@deen> i don't accept buying a better GPU for a 2d game
23:33 <@deen> EastByte: if someone wants to pay me for a year, I'd rewrite DDNet as Hookrace in Nim :P
23:33 < Savander> deen, http://www.transformice.com/
23:33 < Savander> :>
23:33 <@deen> Savander: yes?
23:37 <@EastByte> deen: just do it without funding, working on it is fun anyways :)
23:38 <@EastByte> also there are people willing to help
23:43 <@heinrich5991> (rewrites are hard and can kill a project. consult your doctor before use. also see joelonsoftware's post about it)
23:44 <@heinrich5991> (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html)
23:48 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I guess you remember mineserver
23:48 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: no, I don't
23:49 <@EastByte> hm, a minecraft server written in C++, I'm pretty sure you idled in their channel back then
23:49 <@EastByte> they started a full rewrite and finally gave up
23:50 < Savander> https://github.com/fador/mineserver
23:50 < Savander> ?
23:50 <@EastByte> yes
23:50 <@EastByte> but Hookrace shouldn't be seen as a rewrite
23:50 <@EastByte> more like it's own independent game 
23:51 < Savander> but simillar to teeworlds
23:56 < KinG_> these run maps are pretty hard ^^
