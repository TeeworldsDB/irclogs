02:11 < bridge> <zhn> thanks kebs
02:17 < bridge> <kebscs> No problemüëç
16:08 < bridge> <swarfey> Do server flags to disable certain aspects of antiping already exist?
16:08 < bridge> <swarfey> i remember that being a topic a while ago
16:09 < bridge> <swarfey> some change in the latest ddnet client has made it so that touching hearts will be predicted as freeze. Ive been using the heart as a cosmetic for a while & now using antiping in combination with the cosmetic makes it really annoying to play
16:11 < bridge> <kebscs> right now only laser has no predict flag
16:11 < bridge> <kebscs> ive added pickup flags in <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10098>
16:11 < bridge> <kebscs> waiting to get merged, then can add no predict flag
16:12 < bridge> <swarfey> I see, thats really nice
16:12 < bridge> <swarfey> thank you
17:00 < bridge> <kebscs> whats TILEFLAG_OPAQUE
17:00 < bridge> <kebscs> and how to make the tile opaque?
17:00 < bridge> <kebscs> and how to use it, make the tile opaque?
17:14 < bridge> <patiga> it tells the rendering that anything behind those tiles must not be rendered (because the tile is opaque -> not transparent). It is automatically filled in by the editor. I'm not sure if it is actually getting used by the renderer right now
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> so it cant be used on the game tiles?
17:16 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs just noticed flags are xfflip 1, yflip2, opaque 4, rotate 8
17:16 < bridge> <patiga> iirc it is not used with game tiles
17:16 < bridge> <kebscs> so for pickups ill explicitly make new pickupflags
17:16 < bridge> <kebscs> and replace the opaque with no_predict if its not used
17:16 < bridge> <kebscs> ok ty
17:17 < bridge> <patiga> I'm unsure if that is a good idea, as long as there is space using free bits might be better
17:17 < bridge> <patiga> to avoid confusion
17:17 < bridge> <kebscs> wdym free bits?
17:17 < bridge> <kebscs> make reserved flag?
17:19 < bridge> <patiga> free bits as in bits which are not used yet. the opaque flag bit is used and probably connected to the same bitflag constants
17:20 < bridge> <patiga> ah, you want to create new constants
17:20 < bridge> <kebscs> so do i add opque here even though its not used?`PickupFlags = ["XFLIP", "YFLIP", "OPAQUE", "ROTATE"]`
17:21 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs using tileflag for pickups feel wrong for me so i want set them like this
17:21 < bridge> <patiga> ah yes I missed that, I thought you wanted to create a new bit flag for tiles
17:21 < bridge> <patiga> you are right
17:21 < bridge> <kebscs> also if someone wants to add no predict later so they dont use flag id 1 bcs its already xflip
17:21 < bridge> <patiga> no, then it does not really make sense to add the opaque flag
17:21 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty
17:22 < bridge> <kebscs> so ill remove the make no_predict in place of it and remove the opaque if its somehow sent by tile
17:22 < bridge> <kebscs> so ill remove it and add no_predict in place of it and remove the opaque if its somehow sent by tile
17:41 < bridge> <zerolacqua> does anyone know whether starting a local server from DDNet's client start page is the same as directly running `DDNet-Server`?
17:42 < bridge> <zerolacqua> When I start the server from the start page, it uses the server name from my config file.
17:42 < bridge> <zerolacqua> But why do I need to enter a username, and the password doesn‚Äôt work either? There‚Äôs only a password setting in the config, not a username.
17:43 < bridge> <kebscs> yes theres difference, if you start from client it adds a rcon password for auto auth
17:43 < bridge> <kebscs> it should auto rcon auth you if you dont register the server on public ip
17:44 < bridge> <kebscs> it should auto rcon auth you when connecting if you dont register the server on public ip
17:45 < bridge> <kebscs> only the default password has no username so its kinda confusing, but you can just press enter, leave it blank
17:47 < bridge> <zerolacqua> Thank you very much, that answered my question ^^
17:48 < bridge> <zerolacqua> maybe the wiki about lan server need update
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> you're a dev so maybe you can help, what settings you use or how you connect to it, that it doesnt auto auth https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10042
17:53 < bridge> <zerolacqua> i'll have a look on it. thank you!
18:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why rq @teero
18:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> chiller cant ping ppl
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @teero777
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teero was playing? alarm
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> learn teero
18:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I saw teero playin pg yesterday
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> addiction
18:51 < bridge> <teero777> i can't say
19:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: what should teero learn?
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno, history? or english?
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can't remember
20:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait.. i thought teero is done?
20:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> HuuuuH
20:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> @teero777 ignore what he said, keep on with that C grind my Goat
21:23 < bridge> <joshuastringer> 50$ gift https://e.vg/zzaHvNyUQ
22:21 < bridge> <teero777> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#History
22:21 < bridge> <teero777> learning history rn
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it's cool to learn but
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> in this economy
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you gotta find smth else xD
22:24 < bridge> <teero777> what else?
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i shouldn't assume you want to write code for trade
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but past that, in 5 years, when absolutely nobody is using C, maybe you'll feel left out bcs you don't know what they're using now
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> C is a perfectly fine language for many scenarios but nowadays it feels like the only people I see using C are doing it just because it's based or whatever
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teero is a kid
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he still goes to school
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:26 < bridge> <teero777> lie
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean, the peak of my open source output was when i was a sophomore in high school
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but i experienced this a lot, even with cpp, which is measurably more popular
22:27 < bridge> <teero777> i do know cpp very well too tho. c is just what im using rn
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Brooo
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You better know history by now
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What was the reason for WW1?
22:27 < bridge> <teero777> üòÄ
22:28 < bridge> <teero777> humans
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok you passed
22:31 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks tell what the 2+4 agreement was
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Uhhm...
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Was that west & east germany thing?
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4 is always about the 4 powers
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am better at medieval history üòâ
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok but also mostly about warfare there xD
22:33 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks how much time does it take 4 medieval peasants to take down a mammoth
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDD
22:33 < bridge> <teero777> they have clubs with nails
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1000 US navi soldiers vs 1000000 medieval swordsman
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> WHO WINS
22:33 < bridge> <teero777> swordsman ofc
22:34 < bridge> <teero777> bro even 1 000 000 monkeys would win agains 1k navi soldies
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends on ammo & distance ig
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah 1mio takes quite some time to take out
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on the other hand side the dead build a great wall
22:35 < bridge> <teero777> every soldier would need to defeat 1000 medieval swordsman. no way
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> piercing of modern weapons are insane
22:36 < bridge> <teero777> make a simulator
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
22:39 < bridge> <teero777> i hate the linux clipboard
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dito
22:39 < bridge> <teero777> is there a proper one somewhere
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are at least two separate on my system
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that annoys me
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i blame wayland & xwayland xd
22:42 < bridge> <teero777> how do u like my pfp
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> picasso would be jealous
22:44 < bridge> <teero777> made it better xd
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now i get it xD
22:45 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You my brother now
22:45 < bridge> <teero777> :greenthing:
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> linux doesnt have a clipboard, x does, idk how wayland does it
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but whats wrong with... whatever clipboard system
23:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> intel swoosh brothers
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> waat, b4 intel hires me I hate intel. it's up to them to change this üòâ
