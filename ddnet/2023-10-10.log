13:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that looks pretty well animated üòÆ
13:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the second video, too
13:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just the default app come with the hardware

13:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ahh
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's a rendering of your movements? it's not you who animated this character
13:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no. it was motion capture
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. forget what I said
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still neat, but I thought you made this character
13:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:

16:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Repeek Ethami is being not ddosed but spammed with clients :(
16:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Any idea how to counter it? I banned some versions but they still appeared as (connecting...)
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> who is Repeek Ethami?
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried banning the IPs they're connecting from?
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess a mod
16:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It was I.
16:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> they're too many tbh prob proxies or smt
16:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> like 4 players and 60 clients/proxies
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you saw 60 different IP addresses?
16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 58
16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I can dm them if you want
16:19 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok maybe someone just accidentally deleted glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) line :owo:
16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah forgot to remove the port sec
16:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok now the file with the ips is 58 lines long and 40 of them are unique (`sort file | uniq | wc -l`)
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interested in DM
16:23 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Maybe you had 6 players? IIRC I seen more addresses (tried to ban but it didn't work because new clients used new IPs). At that time I had `captcha` on the server (unique per-IP password added to the server name), it helped. Unfortunately I had to drop `captcha` support to sync with DDNet server info cache implementation.
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> see i was right!
16:24 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yes you were :owo:

16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> also change its color using that
16:25 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> idk how to record a vid of it xD
16:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah I had 6 Players. Tha'ts correct. So it filled everything with proxies 40 of them where unique
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> obs
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://obsproject.com/
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u use gentoo https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OBS_Studio
16:27 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i use gentoo btw :owo:
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> entering your IP addresses into a random proxy checker raises all alarm bells ^^
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could do some automatic bans based on that?
16:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> prob I don't know how though xD
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> This is what we used for a while, I think you can adapt it yourself for whatever `Provider` you find

19:24 < bridge> <chairn> yup, clock & voltage glitch, em injection
19:24 < bridge> <chairn> but low pay as intern, 550‚Ç¨
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its nice but becomes tiresome rly fast
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleast for me
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> How do people live with that wage even? Is it part time?
19:40 < bridge> <k2d222> In France an internship last at most 6 months and is paid roughly 600EUR (minimum but also very common) if it lasts more than two months. The maximum work time during internships is 35hrs/week.
19:41 < bridge> <k2d222> student precarity is a thing like everywhere, but also we don't pay public schools/uni so there's that
19:42 < bridge> <k2d222> and there's social security
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> So that's 7 hours a day, a standard work day, how are the interns supposed to earn the extra 1000~ euro needed to get to the living wage? üòÑ
19:44 < bridge> <k2d222> I was able to live with that for a while, but when you go to school you don't get paid at all so idk it's already something
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd like in any eu country
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt justify the salvery that this is
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt justify the slavery that this is
19:47 < bridge> <k2d222> how is it elsewhere in eu?
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its sad working people tend to accept the shit they give em
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean that mentioning social security and public schools is a given in eu
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> in spain its prob the same for internships, cant say since i didnt do any
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got myself into the real market asap
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> u lived with ur parents right
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u live in paris, im sure rent is higher than 600‚Ç¨
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> my first job was part time
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i worked 20h a week
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got like 550‚Ç¨
19:50 < bridge> <k2d222> nope in a shitty bedroom I paid 250‚Ç¨/month, not in paris ofc
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i was searching for a apartment in barcelona i looked at prices for bedrooms
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> they go easily to 800‚Ç¨ too XD
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i got myself a apartment for 800‚Ç¨
19:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> internships are just wage abuse
19:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i get 2100 now)
19:52 < bridge> <k2d222> I agree that in big cities its impossible to live with that, and I also agree that it's unfair btw
19:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> learath knows too much to be taken advantage of like that
19:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> he probs just lacks xp on how to deal with other devs in a company or smth
19:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but skill wise more than done xd
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> (altho i guess this is mostly common sense)
19:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks r u alive, havent seen u since a lot
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> Well where I'm from a lot of students are just dependent on their family, I'm guessing that's the case most anywhere else
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> The only reason I'd be okay with getting paid below poverty wage would be if I were really curious
19:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk i doubt internships are fun
19:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @k2d222 are u a dev? what langs u use btw

19:58 < bridge> <learath2> Fault injection does sound very intrihuing üòÑ I have been curious about it since the infamous nintendo switch jailbreak
19:59 < bridge> <k2d222> I graduated in september
19:59 < bridge> <k2d222> I do web dev c++ and some rust mostly
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> more rust more rust
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Replace the c++ with rust and ryo will like you
20:00 < bridge> <k2d222> for any new project rust is the go-to
20:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> my web dev stack is rust for backend with axum + sqlx + postgres and frontend with sveltekit + tailwindcss
20:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want a nice local cache in rust, i recommend mocha
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki I've been thinking of doing a rewrite of ddnet
20:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok not mocha its moka
20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/moka-rs/moka
20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> In portable C99, the best language ever
20:01 < bridge> <k2d222> I'm surprised you're not using yew for frontend
20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm frontends are a bit green and the perf is killed by wasm not having direct dom access but needed to go through a js loop for it
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> so yeah
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm frontends are a bit green and the perf is killed by wasm not having direct dom access but needing to go through a js loop for it
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 also called ANSI C right?
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ansi c sounds more ancient
20:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw my wasm experiments https://github.com/edg-l/wasm-stuff
20:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> using wasmer
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> ANSI C is lame, it's for actual old people
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> C99 is fresh, only 2 decades old üí™
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust is soon a decade
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1.0 was released in 2015 iirc
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> so 2025
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> I wish I paid more attention to rust in 2015
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> same
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> I could have been one of the cool people that know everything about it
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> like heinrich
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> his secret persona is a contributor iirc
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a coworker who is inside the rust-lang github org
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> used to contrib docs
20:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> matricks is also an og rust contributor iirc
20:06 < bridge> <chairn> internship is not the same as job
20:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> fancy words
20:07 < bridge> <chairn> as a student, you can get CROUS residence where rent is around 300‚Ç¨ to 600‚Ç¨ depending on the type of room
20:08 < bridge> <k2d222> good luck finding a crous in paris though
20:09 < bridge> <chairn> i had a room with 392‚Ç¨ rent
20:09 < bridge> <chairn> 11m¬≤ with everything included
20:32 < bridge> <learath2> Surely but interns are also human and have all the same expenses as the other humans, no?
20:34 < bridge> <learath2> Like if housing or food was free for interns I could justify paying them much less
20:36 < bridge> <k2d222> with the same argument, students should be paid to go to uni, do you believe that should be the case?
20:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> tell me about them üôÇ
20:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can get a generous student loan in germany when your parents aren't rich
20:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you only have to pay back half
20:38 < bridge> <learath2> School doesnt have to be a full time commitment, and most civilized countries do already help atleast a bit (tax benefits, student pricing, great loans, even some living expenses in the nordics). But sure in an ideal world I don't see any harm in supporting students through their education.
21:18 < bridge> <chairn> i agree, but i cant change law and how public service works
21:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm sure @gotroyb would be interested ;)
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```rust
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> #[repr(C, packed)]
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> should probably not be packed (in interface/src/lib.rs)
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 isnt it unsafe if u have padded bytes
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what you're doing but that would only be the case if you are de/serializing structs as a whole
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> which is unsafe in other ways
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> reading uninit bytes in rust is ub
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> k
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft its said holding guarantees in unsafe rust is harder than c++
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://users.rust-lang.org/t/is-it-ub-to-std-copy-padding-bytes/75993/4
22:02 < bridge> <reitw> CROUS :justatest:
22:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's more unsafe if you have `repr(packed)`
22:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :o
