05:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> has the door prediction just always been baad
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is none
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> The bot doesnt show polish flag in records @deen
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, fixed
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will show up in the future
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> how do i disable random save names?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> like i put ./save 12a and it says ./load slip blop gay shop
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> choose a save code that was not used yet
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> any chance we get a password manager in ddnet client? One that generates, stores and autofills server passwords, rcon passwords, save/load and has support for custom mods using /register and /login?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> meh
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> copy-paste ingration is usually good enough for pw managers, use an external one
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> i do but its just bad UX to tab out of the game and manually paste
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> also i assume most ppl dont use pw managers at all or not for tw so they tend to forget, reuse and pick bad pws
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> but ye just asking so no chance i accept that
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the better way to solve this problem is by having one proper account in ddnet client
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then you don't need all of the other pws

14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have a player's game crash after these lines
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> any idea why?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> obama?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> if something is wrong its obama deals
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie the failed to chains are irrelevant, some code we forgot to remove in one version
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I tried a lot of things, he just can't open the game for some reason
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it really crash? I had a field day trying to debug something similar, turns out it wasn’t crashing but it was raising an exception deep inside ntkernel which was handled further along but vs had turned on app verifier on the image name but hadn’t turned it on
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hadn’t turned it off*
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I've sent him a teeworlds client with CJK support for now
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask him to try rename ddnet.exe to something else
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Does path change count? Cuz he downloaded multiple versions of ddnet in various folder, none of them works
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tried forcing opengl_major to 1?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> He doesn't have a config generated
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Only some empty folders
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Path change doesn’t count. Ntkernel knows nothing of the path, it only gets an “image name”
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Ok
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> It's like 1 in the morning. I'll try ask him tomorrow
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho it’s unlikely he turned on app verifier on ddnet somehow 😛
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe it’s some chinese spyware? A lot of trojans use the gflags to monitor applications
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Maybe
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> He is running on Administrator
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Which is <a:eyesshaking:712037394626642040>
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Which is <a:eyesshaking:712037394626642040> concerning
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol who even runs as administrator wtf
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, the only way to really figure this out is a debugger
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Lots of chinese who buys computer from a mall or something
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Lots of tech support just make administrator as default account to avoid ppl asking about uac
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Windbg and cdb are standalone, so if you want to try get them to try one, that’s the easiest
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> They all use windows 7 too
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will only get us addresses but I’ve gotten pretty decent at reverse engineering them, since we have no symbols 😛
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should we ship RelWithDebInfos?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Feelshackerman
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably not
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We probably should build relwithdebinfo, and strip the debinfo
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With windows the pdb is already separate so no extra work
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there was a tool for linux that split the debinfo
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I mean it is probably his pc being fucked up
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No need for a tool, linux has split dwarf
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then we really should be shipping like that. It’s really not fun to reverse engineer from just addresses
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21179
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -gsplit_dwarf
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Do you all knows what 360 is and i'm not talking about xbox.
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Norton?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Well more like mcafee but kinda
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> It does weird things to unknown prograo
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, btw do any if you know how E1 or T1 recover from clock slip? Or even how do they handle the start of transmission?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know E1 has a set pattern in TS0 every other frame but how does that help when aligning to the start of the frame? Any TS or even unaligned parts of the bitstream could contain the pattern
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DabestDucc> found an frickin troller, help me
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DabestDucc> multimap
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just ping moderators in #general probably
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @DabestDucc we have #reports for that
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Oh he did
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Nvm
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DabestDucc> bruh this dumb guy called yigit is annoying
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can be annoying too if you would like to see
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DabestDucc> no pls
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> help im addicted to rust, i should code more ddnet
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or i feel guilty
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> good addiction
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_OmgMask:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe im too safe, need ddnet for some taste of memory unsafety
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and spaghetti after all
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ertee :D> Mom's 🍝
