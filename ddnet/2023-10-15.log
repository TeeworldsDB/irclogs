13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> why sdl alpha blending weird?
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> first is how it looks pre-blending
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> second is how it should look
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> third is how it actually looks. it’s dark in the middle

13:18 < bridge> <Ewan> gross link watermarks
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sdl?
13:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
13:30 < bridge> <Ewan> sdl
13:30 < bridge> <Ewan> the sequel
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sdl = sdl2 library?
13:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yes lmfao
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sry but u give 0 information
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i assume you mean the SDL renderer?
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what blend mode do you use?
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> blend mode
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> sdl renderer or surface irrrelevant
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so which blend mode is blend mode?
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one minus alpha?
13:34 < bridge> <Ewan> SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so one minus alpha
13:35 < bridge> <k2d222> looks like the mask is alpha premutliplied and shouldnt be
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess SDL_BLENDMODE_ADD is the one that emulates that then
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or SDL_BLENDMODE_MOD
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u premultiply your own vertex color
13:38 < bridge> <k2d222> try all the blend modes until it works
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i did already
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> they are all not proper
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u get your request right: u want to have the alpha values of texture1 be multiplied with the text that u add
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> remade surf and specified rgba32 non premultiplied and still wacky
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have to do that in one render call
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not in 2
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> what render call
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's get the thing right first:
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you want the second text to be partially transparent at the outer edges right?
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and texture1 defines how much transparent it should be
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbh i don't know if u can do smth like that with the SDL renderer
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it seems very primitive
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u'd need to sample over texture 1 and multiple the alpha of this texture with the vertices that you render, when you create the second text
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i just want to blend the gradient texture over top of the source texture using a normal blending mode
13:44 < bridge> <Ewan> but i think there is a problem with their math since doing that creates dark spots near the middle
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it should be pretty simple
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, that looks correct to me tbh
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not really trivial imo
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> fwiw black is just for show
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> when drawing the gradient im actually using transparent
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but you need the information of that texture in a different render call
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> im using surfaces
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> render call = i want to draw these vertices
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yea we are not in gpu world rn
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me read what they are in sdl2 renderer
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> fwiw
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> sdl2 renderer is gpu
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> used with textures
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> surfaces is cpu rendering
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> texture = hardware backed surface
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> well it's more abstract
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but using the accelerated init
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> that's what it is
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah so you have full control over all pixels?
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't wanna do it myself but i could
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess u have to do it your own then
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i just wonder why their math is weird
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> shouldn't be hard u know
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163080820211322940/image.png?ex=653e466c&is=652bd16c&hm=6bef2f10b63adb325000ff64309771d869397e7feec8b63e73cfd949c6e4269c&
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u simply want to overwrite the pixels instead of making them transparent
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well that's one solution yes
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> no no
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like they're using color key internally or smthm
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of mathing on the alphas
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well one minus source alpha is your blend mode
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what you want, but they don't offer, is using the dst alpha value
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the alpha values written by texture 1
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> that is so ass
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u can do custom blending modes
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess ill check that out
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode(SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE,
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan>                                                          SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA,
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan>                                                          SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD,
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan>                                                          SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE,
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan>                                                          SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA,
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan>                                                          SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD);
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ugg
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163082197511716905/image.png?ex=653e47b4&is=652bd2b4&hm=61b7d7e8018e6b878fca5ffe5e43e760f0a04340cae5e93e642da82475363450&
13:54 < bridge> <k2d222> it should work as you expect with alpha blending and a properly generated mask. I bet your issue is the mask
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> tried mask and it didn't help
13:55 < bridge> <k2d222> by mask I mean the texture2 that has the gradient
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> you think that im making the gradient wrong?
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think this renderer has support for multiple texture sampling
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u cannot really mask it
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as u imagine it
13:56 < bridge> <k2d222> I bet it is a gradient from rgba(0,0,0,0) to rgba(0,0,255,255) which is not what you want
13:56 < bridge> <k2d222> you want rgba(0,0,255,0) to rgba(0,0,255,255)
13:56 < bridge> <k2d222> which is not-premultiplied alpha
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> im not doing color blending only alpha,
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> from blue to transparent
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> void RenderLinearGradient(SDL_Surface *surf,
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>                           const SDL_Rect *rect,
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>                           const SDL_Color *color1,
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>                           const SDL_Color *color2,
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>                           bool orientation)
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> {
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     SDL_Rect walking_rect = SDL_Rect(*rect);
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     auto *offset = orientation ? &walking_rect.x : &walking_rect.y;
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     auto *pos = orientation ? &walking_rect.w : &walking_rect.h;
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     auto starting_offset = *offset;
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     auto starting_pos = *pos;
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     *pos = 1;
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     for (; *offset < starting_offset + starting_pos; (*offset)++) {
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>         float fraction = (float(*offset - starting_offset) / float(starting_pos));
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>         SDL_FillRect(surf, &walking_rect, Interpolate(surf->format, color2, color1, fraction));
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan>     }
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> }
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
13:57 < bridge> <k2d222> define "transparent" htats the issue
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> this my fn
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 0,0,0,0
13:57 < bridge> <k2d222> try blue with alpha 0
13:57 < bridge> <k2d222> 0,0,1,0 or smth
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @k2d222 what you want is
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> render text1
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> render text2
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> put gradient over text2?
13:58 < bridge> <k2d222> yes it's not really mask it's overlya
13:58 < bridge> <k2d222> yes it's not really mask it's overlay
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or text generally
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if that's all the same text
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> cal them surfs ur hurting my brain
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> im like what text and then i remember u speak of texture
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean text this time
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ou
14:00 < bridge> <k2d222> it's a bit wierd to call it surface, that generally refers to smth els
14:00 < bridge> <k2d222> it's a bit wierd to call it surface, that generally refers to smth else
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> not in 2d
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft before applying the gradient
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u render the text in one go?
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> here's it with transparent blue btw
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163084043911438397/image.png?ex=653e496d&is=652bd46d&hm=d513c13f33f9a451bec9165eef2cffce616e1eea26aa8c19040c7ad92dce296f&
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:00 < bridge> <Ewan> what i expected
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then u want to put the gradient over it
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so basically what u actually want is
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> render the text on a seperate texture, that has no background color
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs one problem is that the background color is used during blending too
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which makes everything darker not only the text
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u want a pure alpha texture. and use blue manually
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok or let's do it differently
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is this black in first place?
14:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ~
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u do that manually by hand?
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or how should i understand that
14:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i replaced the transparent in my gradient fn invoc w black
14:05 < bridge> <Ewan> but it looks identical when i just turn off blending
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that sounds wrong to me already.
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should be white
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> when using 0,0,0,0?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok tbf it depends on the blend mode
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u just post the gradient here?
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the texture for it
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it's dynamically generated
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd have to dump
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> this is recreated
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> with same math
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, so u don't aim to make text transparent
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but simply overwrite it
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> oh wow sorry i didn't realize that's what u were asking
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> that's also a pretty good idea
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's ok. i was very confused here too
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> then bg can be whatever and not be a color
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, for this renderer your approach is better
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe faster and easier
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> but not better
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> if i want to have transparency effects in the ui like i usually do
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my approach requires to sample from 2 textures at once
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from the text-texture and the gradient-texture
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's the problem
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if u can do it without shaders 😄
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i mean u can do anything
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since it's on the CPU
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode lets you use source and destination
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> src color mode, src alpha mode, src blend op, dst color mode, dst alpha mode, dst blend op
14:10 < bridge> <k2d222> that's my understanding is it correct?
14:10 < bridge> <k2d222> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163086498929848321/image.png?ex=653e4bb6&is=652bd6b6&hm=7829960169105963651c826f5012c0a9980e672f9eb1bbf9cbc612ba60523fc0&
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> sorta but no borders on gradient
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> just the inner
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh then normal blending should work indeed
14:11 < bridge> <k2d222> eys
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> so why black
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> >_>
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to be sure, dump the gradient
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> k
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's the only way to be sure
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> time to import sdl2_image
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all your stuff does not happen on the GPU?
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> all cpu
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be much easier XD
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> not really for arbitrary rendering
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well at least not without shaders 😂
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
14:13 < bridge> <Ewan> oh my GOD i don't even have it
14:13 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163087343801081896/image.png?ex=653e4c7f&is=652bd77f&hm=d3644643eee026bf563218199ac5be079dfe47a61741a683a0c29b489078c4c9&
14:14 < bridge> <k2d222> sample a few valuess along the x axis should be sufficient
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> no it's rly 2 fn calls and i already have the thing set up now
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks msys
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163088153721192448/test.png?ex=653e4d40&is=652bd840&hm=76efae3b13291bca6ccbbaac0f8a0c5d3c9f45a6dbaf8335cd04a7e1b7f62e0d&
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> there
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> dumped
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ok
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you were right from the start then i guess
14:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate it when i'm right
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what u could try is dumping before gradient and after
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i blit that right on top of this
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163089085259337768/image.png?ex=653e4e1f&is=652bd91f&hm=796a60b956dd6e6b9eeb268ba89c65466710911af710b5fd5b15667fa0963e2b&
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i could imagine one reason why it's wrong
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u overwriting the final alpha values with values close to 0
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and at some point it uses that texture to render it to the screen
14:21 < bridge> <Ewan> unfortunately i don't think that's possible cuz the gradient texture gets blitted to the button + the button gets blitted directly to the window's surface
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> that's the only alpha stuff happening
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> and i'm only touching the values in the gradient fn
14:22 < bridge> <k2d222> I insist that the img has the issue of premult alpha, and that produces the black result that you have as expected. the region with alpha = 0 must have the correct rgb values.
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> where would this premultiplication be happening
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> my interpolation fn is unbiased
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> uint32_t Interpolate(SDL_PixelFormat *format,
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan>                      const SDL_Color *color1,
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan>                      const SDL_Color *color2,
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan>                      float fraction)
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan> {
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan>     return SDL_MapRGBA(format,
14:22 < bridge> <Ewan>                        static_cast<uint8_t>((color1->r - color2->r) * fraction + color2->r),
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan>                        static_cast<uint8_t>((color1->g - color2->g) * fraction + color2->g),
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan>                        static_cast<uint8_t>((color1->b - color2->b) * fraction + color2->b),
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan>                        static_cast<uint8_t>((color1->a - color2->a) * fraction + color2->a));
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan> }
14:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean it would make sense, but i wonder when this multiplication should happen
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have experience with sdl2 renderer?
14:23 < bridge> <k2d222> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_BlendMode > the described blend mode function indicates that it expects non-premult alpha
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but like, he dumped the texture
14:24 < bridge> <k2d222> yet the image gradiend dumped has premult alpha
14:24 < bridge> <Ewan> that might be png encoder
14:24 < bridge> <k2d222> i mean, "premult alpha" not really, it's just a normal gradient from opaque blue to black transparent
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to me the color looks right
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in gimp
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft can u write to the pixels directly?
14:26 < bridge> <Ewan> how low level
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like set all alpha to 1 after your whole calculation
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of the surface
14:26 < bridge> <k2d222> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163090578238611487/image.png?ex=653e4f83&is=652bda83&hm=fd4f27b9a891c8482d24fd2a21ba1db1f91c44336ca16ef2ec7984afef29eede&
14:27 < bridge> <k2d222> top=ewan btm=me
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yeahmm
14:27 < bridge> <k2d222> it does fade to black
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah i see
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i could but that's exactly how it displays with alpha blending off
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i will try blending opaque blue to transparent blue
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @k2d222 is right actually
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean gradienting
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163090858862727248/image.png?ex=653e4fc5&is=652bdac5&hm=e53463840663a13245d6d79ca0d98416c2e2ad2175b2e377950e5363aae7c039&
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> u know
14:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean yea that's what im doing
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> 0,0,00
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> 0,0,0,0
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i disabled alpha layer
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u simply use the blue all  the time
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only make alpha go 0
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it does work but it's not desirable
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163091098537836606/image.png?ex=653e4fff&is=652bdaff&hm=2fe583920c57a15bf9e01a15732d0ec16e365fea873860124c06a997c55b6609&
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u dont want any color gradiation
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you dislike about it?
14:29 < bridge> <k2d222> what is that not what u want??
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i am just wondering how it is that pdn can create the exact correct gradient from scratch when i use 0,0,0,0 as the second color
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but now that i look at my mockup gradient i see that it's the same blue and all that changes is the alpha. so pdn must be doing something 'smart' under the hood and changing my black transparent to something more appropriate
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> cool i guess
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> since that's what i was comparing it against i thought black was not the issue
14:30 < bridge> <k2d222> it does exist yes
14:31 < bridge> <k2d222> some programs do that
14:31 < bridge> <Ewan> would have been nice to know 30 mins ago
14:31 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
14:31 < bridge> <k2d222> they un-premultiply alpha and copy neighbor alpha in pixels that have alpha=0
14:32 < bridge> <k2d222> it's a bit hacky but allows correct antialiasing at opaque-alpha edges in some cases
14:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
14:32 < bridge> <Ewan> quite hacky
14:32 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not expected
14:32 < bridge> <k2d222> unity does that iirc
14:33 < bridge> <k2d222> what is pdn?
14:33 < bridge> <Ewan> paint.net
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do they do this?
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do they dislike loosing color values?
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how does that even help restore the original color if alpha = 0
14:36 < bridge> <k2d222> to avoid interpolation artefacts at sharp opaque->transparent edges, but I think that was in fact not what was happening for @mpft
14:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s the gradient tool, it may just be for this exact scenario
14:36 < bridge> <k2d222> I read about it recently leme see if i find the article for you
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but do we speak about pre multiplied textures, with a blend mode that is addative?
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> check out my awesome hue interpolation
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163094039218888724/image.png?ex=653e52bc&is=652bddbc&hm=29a833fd6381ef574301159194da3938b473848982111fdf0287daf0b6c35f71&
14:41 < bridge> <Ewan> even tho my rgb interpolation does it just fine
14:41 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163094238158925954/image.png?ex=653e52eb&is=652bddeb&hm=8f8e0a857eabeea9d25e8cb476c2cfb3f25ff7dfdc173fae6bae6f032a4dce28&
14:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanted to try it
14:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not high tech enough
14:42 < bridge> <k2d222> heh, apparently I remembered it incorrectly, still good to know about, here's the source
14:42 < bridge> <k2d222> https://youtu.be/d6tp43wZqps?si=rUkq6fjBGbiI19G6&t=627
14:43 < bridge> <k2d222> good video to watch overall btw
14:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i like my buttons
14:43 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163094913408311370/image.png?ex=653e538c&is=652bde8c&hm=dd2137603e387dbd56c0d46103998103f51cfbae8cf9e4402c49cd464a2ae4ec&
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet has the same problem btw
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in ddnet we call it "dialate"
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pre multiplied textures have one obvious problem
14:45 < bridge> <Ewan> dilate*
14:45 < bridge> <k2d222> loss of precision?
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they remove accuracy if u use them with u8 color components
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> precision is better word^^
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ty 😄
14:46 < bridge> <k2d222> I never know the difference between precision and accuracy, but precision exists in french
14:46 < bridge> <k2d222> I never know the difference between precision and accuracy, but precision exists in french and not accuracy
15:01 < bridge> <Ewan> same thing
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dump it again
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> watcha workin on
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks futuristic xd
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> idk im just making stuff
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ive been helping this guy do some sdl stuff and he needed a gui
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and i always knew a gui in sdl would be very easy to do i just never had to do it
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> so im doing it
15:04 < bridge> <Ewan> but not for him just for fun
15:07 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet gui system is very logical but not readable in code. It's a nightmare to come back to some gui that you made months ago and try to get what's going on
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet gui system is filling rects xd
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> it's immediate mode nonsense
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> yes. good rects
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ruthless on the cpu
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> egui does similar, but is still nicer to use imo
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> egui sux
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> qt win
15:08 < bridge> <k2d222> immediate is good
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> qt vloat
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> for a game ui maybe
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> qt bloat
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> not if it's installed on your system as a shared lib lol
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stuff like React is cleaner imo for GUIs
15:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ew
15:09 < bridge> <Ewan> webb
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean the idea
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not javascript xd
15:09 < bridge> <teero777> I've never seen a frontend in C++ that isn't a mess
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is probably bcs they don't give enough shit about performance xd
15:11 < bridge> <k2d222> platform native widgets
15:11 < bridge> <Ewan> qt is very performant
15:11 < bridge> <k2d222> or wxwidgets
15:11 < bridge> <Ewan> rly wxwidgets LMFAO
15:11 < bridge> <k2d222> no I'm kidding
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> c++ is simply no language to write simplistic code in
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least not with the current standard
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> 3000 loc for a settings menu xdd
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rust for example is a bit better. bcs of auto moving stuff
15:12 < bridge> <k2d222> UIs are very descriptive and cpp is very imperative, xmls et.al are relatively good to describe uis
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but rust is sometimes also too explicit
15:13 < bridge> <Ewan> more
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> typescript allows annoymous data types etc.
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that simplifies code often
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> void* :justatest:
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> + everything is shared pointer basically
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:15 < bridge> <k2d222> i've seen a codebase use std::variant<string+hashmap<variant>+int+float+bool+....> and that was quite clean in fact
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> qvariant
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> XDDD
15:15 < bridge> <k2d222> oh
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> weren't u shader coder?
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or do u also know cpp
15:15 < bridge> <k2d222> I know cpp
15:16 < bridge> <k2d222> some of it 🙂
15:16 < bridge> <Ewan> every time i do gui in anything but qt i feel like blowing my brains out
15:16 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing make sense like it does
15:16 < bridge> <Ewan> this is why they can charge thousands of dollars for a commercial license
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> JSX is the cleanest way to describe an UI imo
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or TSX
15:17 < bridge> <Ewan> have you used qt?
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> never used qt. What's so good about it?
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not for a project bigger than a few buttons
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^ but maybe u can explain this
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i used stuff like java ui(whatever it was called), win32 native UI, VCL
15:19 < bridge> <teero777> I can see the link to the wiki page incoming xdd
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> u thinking of swing
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i will explain later when my brain is not tied up
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i scroll through this. i have to say it's basically like most oldschool GUI libs
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://qt-wiki-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/images/6/69/Beginner-Pretty-Button.jpg
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> debatable 😂
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont like oxygen
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> There is a thing like qteditor right?
15:21 < bridge> <teero777> Time to make a ddnet gui editor
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft look this example in comparision
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a function is a gui component
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and u use hooks to track the state
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that gives a clean hirarhy
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that gives a clean hierarchy
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbf, javascript is slow af 😂
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's defs an obvious problem
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rust alternative
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the biggest plus for egui is that it's insanely easy to write the backend for it.. so u can easily integrate it into your own game engine
15:26 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the same appeal as imgui
15:26 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the same appeal as dearimgui
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's basically the rust version of it xd
15:26 < bridge> <Ewan> bleh
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i could use html+css i'd prefer that tho.. even tho it's already very bloated xd
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it simply is more powerful
15:29 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
15:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i've used that the second most but it's not my second most favorite
15:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish u could just figma it all
15:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i did this mockup in figma lol
15:30 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163106607945752626/image.png?ex=653e5e70&is=652be970&hm=07fbe79e4cb54d09041f08a9a95a9c6dbc7f3575553c2bf7ae8435a7a3d5a7e7&
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u become ddnet-ui dev
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hehe
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i've done a bunch already
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robyte's enemy
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it's horrible
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> there is so much to optimize
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> makes me sweat even thinking about it
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i actually dislike most is having to use static objects for the GUI IDs
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that basically makes it impossible to reuse any code
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since if two objects with same ID are on screen, both are the same
15:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> should just use pointers
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> smh
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should try to automatically guess the IDs
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like egui xd
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only very rarely u need to set IDs manually
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> same for react btw
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea

18:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Ah, true that was also an idea we had
18:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ye
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> At the very least a trampoline so we can do updates properly
18:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> one day i started with tauri but i forgot
18:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> my small request about econ in client is to support more than 1 console xd
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, then let's remove the main window at that point
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and add a "skip launcher" option
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and write in rust
18:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> wth is launcher
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a launcher
18:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> in tee paradigma
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> Grenade launcher
18:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> like mc launcher
18:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> and what will change
18:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> one launcher to launch ddnet client only xd
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can move like updater into it
18:39 < bridge> <robyt3> The main reason why we need it is to detect the client crashing, so the launcher can change the graphics settings
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can select graphic settings
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> updater, file integrity checker, easier to do in rust because decoupled
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can have multiple client support xd
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> move news there
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> totally not why i want this
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> download a software vulkan driver
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> driver updater
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> All of those would be much better in a launcher, though given this community’s distaste of everything mew, I’m sure someone is getting shot for it
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> new*
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 that would be you sir
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as long as it has a clear visible "skip launcher" it's ok i think
18:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Launchers are always disliked I guess
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 we should invent a developer that doesnt exist
18:40 < bridge> <gerdoe> i will launch ddnet client manually without launcher if it will be a thing in the future
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> and put the blame on it
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> I’ll do the commits and move to new zealand to hide from the cultists
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> so no actual person is harmed
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> we just say that dev did it
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it doesnt exist
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> our ugly main screen isn't really better IMO
18:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> its good actually
18:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> as simple as it needs to be
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> I would honestly have an invisible trampoline
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> Only visible when stuff is getting updated or a crash happened last launch/this launch or some button is held to open gfx settings
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> We should invent an entire admin actually, they could be responsible for everything
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163155132939255818/image.png?ex=653e8ba2&is=652c16a2&hm=acd6065175cbf07e239de1c7905215d94ff58b2306ca90e332738ad06b5c620f&
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if someone wants  to chat with it
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> we put it behind chatgpt
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want it like this
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> missing ddnet-rs
18:43 < bridge> <gerdoe> shawshank reference
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2.0 = rust
18:43 < bridge> <learath2> Mhhhhhhhhh do we have to have multiple client support :pepeW:
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> :ahendmymiserableexistence:
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs heinrich dislikes breaking backward compability
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i dont see any other chance to promote a new client
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:kermitsuicide:977666002659721236>
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> You want to make a backwards incompatible client just to spite him? 😄
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> break compat in every way, while improving obv
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to make it so ddnet has a chance to get better
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but as long as half of the devs are against it
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> change map format, change protocol, disregard old distros and use newer dependencies
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i prefer we just support both
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> No, don’t improve anything, just remove all backwards compat, that would be hilarious
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just to troll
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove opengl 1 and 3.3 support
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan master race
18:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> u
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> And 2
18:46 < bridge> <gerdoe> 1.4 is best renderer
18:46 < bridge> <gerdoe> old tee vibes
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> Wait did we already remove gl2/3.0?
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> also compile with a newer glibc just to make people update their distro
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> use trunk kernel
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, u can continue waiting
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should use all vulkan 1.2 and 1.3 extensions
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes xd
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ALL
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> We should make a kernel driver that only works on the very latest kernel, than have the userland client make sure that the module is loaded
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if we dont need them
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> Every game has a cool kernel driver now
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then blame gpu drivers
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> bugs
18:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Nice, I'd love to also learn Windows driver programming :monkaStop:
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> We can also check that gpu model matches the pattern 40xx
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> the requirement is to always add the ad injector or telemetry
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise ur driver wont be accepted
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
18:50 < bridge> <robyt3> The driver comes with better anticheat than VAC :justatest:
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> I did a couple things once, mostly just experimenting
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets add a ring 0 kernel anti cheat
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> No one would trust us tbf
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> Including you 😄
18:51 < bridge> <robyt3> It would be impossible to install the driver on Windows without allowing untrusted drivers somewhere
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> Extremely popular games get to shove it down peoples throats because what will you do? Not play VALORANT?
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> We apply for and pay for a driver signing certificate ofc
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so all maintainers agree we need launcher, epic awesome
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
18:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Only like $200/year
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> I bet we’ll all disagree on what it should be like 😄
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that's why i talked about it
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robyte now knows what i need
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> And the players will hate it even if it’s completely invisible because it’s hip to hate things
18:54 < bridge> <robyt3> It's would a nice separate project for someone to start in rust
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as said, fat ass  "SKIP LAUNCHER BRO, NEVER SEE IT AGAIN" button
18:55 < bridge> <robyt3> The launcher could be invisible the entire time like @learath2 suggested
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> They will know that it exists and be annoyed at that
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> we all agree the launcher will be written in rust
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> safety first
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> No, it’ll be written in electron
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> JSX 💪
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 400 MB for the launcher
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2mb for game
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> 1GB atleast
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> Also let’s make it 32bit
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets use SDL2 renderer
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> if we dont need to render web, a launcher with rust and iced
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> the average memory usage would be like 5mb i think
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://iced.rs/
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the launcher just needs a fancy background image tbh
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u almost can't fail
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> look at any game launcher
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they pretty simplistic
18:57 < bridge> <robyt3> If we want to support news then we need HTML I guess
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
18:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless it's really simple like in the client
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> we just parse the html
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> and display it ourselves
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> a rly simple html renderer
18:58 < bridge> <learath2> The launcher should just be invisible
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> aka just parse bold tags
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> and links
18:58 < bridge> <learath2> :PepeCross:
18:58 < bridge> <robyt3> With regex
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> insert SO question here
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first time should be visible to show discord links etc.
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> similar to current main page inside client
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or home page
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's there to replace that page
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 we could also add feature votes in launcher
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163159149115363498/image.png?ex=653e8f5f&is=652c1a5f&hm=762c8851c4fc3237ff9f079d19b7053afc06edebac419d35dc4e21216c801443&
18:59 < bridge> <robyt3> It shouldn't be extra work for deen, so it should either parse the news directly from the website or directly from the info json
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> I meant as in no gui should ever exist for it, except for an emergency gfx settings editor and crash reporter
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> run server goes into LAN tab
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest is also in server browser
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye info json
19:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> rss less goo
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bruh we need 4k raytracing
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, ddnet but with god rays
19:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Next to "Run server" I'd want a Settings-icon button to configure the local server
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/sun-nicolas-cage-nicolas-cage-sun-bright-morning-gif-5550039
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> On widescreen I really would want a side panel with the news in it instead of hidden away in a corner
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fine, but imo we don't need it there. could also be in LAN tab.. but yeah
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno
19:01 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, would also be useful to have the "Run server" button in the LAN tab
19:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Otherwise I always start the server, go the LAN tab, and need to refresh again
19:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't exactly like a separate window before launching the client. I'd be fine with one showing up if the ddnet client doesn't show up itself. otherwise it's just a distraction. firefox doesn't open a launcher either
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> See, there is no way all of us ever agree on anything 😄
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he said he doesnt like a seperate window
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that also applies to the current main page
19:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just open it in the browser at that point IMO
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> I highly doubt that’s what he meant. I’d bet money on it
19:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I agree ;)
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does firefox have that screen?
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, it’s the home screen
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> This thing
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163160942268399647/IMG_0739.png?ex=653e910b&is=652c1c0b&hm=286fc4755d105a890f0dbed2e07f5e994ed93a39671457636c5e629e883b5466&
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, not everyone has to agree
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is a skip button
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> Someone should just make the bare minimum invisible launcher and push it through quickly at night before all the devs wake up
19:07 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe no one will even notice
19:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> invisible launcher seems fine
19:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it doesn't delay the start too much
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> Ideally it should just do a couple `stat` calls, a handful of `read` calls, and an `exec`
19:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably fork and exec?
19:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think a launcher would be meaningful if you could set different mods or smt like mc. But in the case of ddnet we have no mods :O. (I'm talking about the client btw).
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here, finished the launcher
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163161777253666967/image.png?ex=653e91d2&is=652c1cd2&hm=ba62fae66a3e483a508a97d1ed6f36067388088382bef2fadd03075eb00002fe&
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it should open first time
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to emulate the home page
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which will be gone
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> discord link etc.
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this one
19:21 < bridge> <learath2> See no way we all ever agree on this 😄
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we don't have to
19:21 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think the main menu should be going anywhere. You already decided it's gone
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> heinrich says he wants backward compability bcs he doesnt want to drop support for 1% of players
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so we can effort to have a launcher for another 1%
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's useless after seeing it once and has no "don't show again"
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so yes
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> decided
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> Very team player, much wow
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> team player
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> #7258
19:23 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7258
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone pro
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1 person against
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very team play
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so then tell me your reason against it, if u dislike it so much
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> I don't dislike a launcher. I dislike that we are removing the main menu. I like the main menu
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you feel like the main menu looks good?
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> visually
19:30 < bridge> <learath2> It's lacking a news section imo, it can use more density. But overall yes, it looks decent imho
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe moving some stuff around, sure. But removing it completely isn't something I'd be for
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't want to lie, i find it rather ugly.
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Imagine you start a game and this is the first thing you see...
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> add a twinbop
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> some fanservice
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> What do you think is wrong with it?
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> It has our logo, it has buttons for all the things you might want to do. The browser interface is far more overwhelming to someone that just opened the game evr
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> Ever*
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> similar to what you said, i dislike it being so open
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the icons look weirdly placed (behind the button)
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the logo should be wider (go over the buttons)
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Quit" just looks shit
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bottom right fits nothing like bottom left
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the symmetry is missing here
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we could e.g. in the right bottom show the current tee, and put a customize button
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to give it more personality
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> It's only so empty in widescreen btw, it looks better composed in 4:3
19:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> was about to say that xD
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but i guess most ppl start it in 16:9
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least frist time
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I would love to maybe add news or maybe the tee as you say to it in widescreen where we have the space
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and our theme maps are also rather boring
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe bit more grass etc.
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not just a sun with wrongly animated clouds xD
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> But removing it, I honestly haven't ever thought about. I think some sort of hub page like this is necessary for people starting the game for the first time
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well launcher does that 😂
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, maybe if we add launch flags to the game and launch into a certain page, but even then that's meh UX, we don't want people closing the client and going back to the launcher for the hub page
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the main page can stay
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should just not be default
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> once u seen it, u probably never care again about it
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> It should be the default. People that don't want it should disable it themselves
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least all ppl i know asked me how to disable it
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hidden in the settings
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not very user friendly imo
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> It's mostly for new people. 1337 haxors and cool gamers that have no time for menus can disable it
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @totar didnt even know it about 2 weeks ago
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and he is like top notch client dev
19:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> isn't it a new thing though?
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> Not very new
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was there since the main page exist
19:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O I too didn't know it. Just recently saw a conversation about it and I thought it was added recently
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @totar didnt even know it about 2 weeks ago (https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1147989915351662602)
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly never once felt like that one extra click to get into the game was an inconvenience but I have a feeling that I'm not allowed to make that comment since my playtime last year was too low to have any opinion
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i open client 5-10 times per day
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sucks
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i die internally
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> But dw, I started playing with murpi again. I'll be allowed opinions soon
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wb
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I open client around 10-20 times too but never felt it to be a problem.
19:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just tap doulbe enter ;)
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> I actually open and close the client a lot too. I play fng between games of league
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but was it also no problem when it got introduced?
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now it's in your muscle memory
19:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The main screen was introduced? Wasn't it always there? xD
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly? No I never even thought about it. I was playing a lot back then too
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was introduced in like ddnet 14 or smth
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> around steam release
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> The first time I thought about the extra click was a couple weeks ago when people were talking about it in here
19:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah yeah
19:48 < bridge> <totar> I use the demo from launch enough that I don't mind the main menu
19:48 < bridge> <totar> I use the demo viewer from launch enough that I don't mind the main menu
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the button also exist in the server browser
19:49 < bridge> <totar> So small
19:49 < bridge> <totar> Idk 90% of the launch time is the client loading not clicking the menu
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me client starts instant
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hardware issue 😂
19:50 < bridge> <totar> Bruh how
19:50 < bridge> <totar> Does skins make it slower
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100%
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we load everything single threaded
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one after each other
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u have the storage access delay every time
19:50 < bridge> <totar> Mmm
19:51 < bridge> <totar> I still thinks it's nice to have it, makes it feel like a real game
19:51 < bridge> <totar> I still think it's nice to have it, makes it feel like a real game
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Someone needs to add lazy loading of skins 😄
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Or just load them on a separate thread
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before we need a main menu, we need better music
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
19:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Optimally, someone needs to write a better job system first 😄
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, doing it PROPERLY is very hard. Technically io bound jobs can be scheduled much differently than cpu bound ones
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> Folly and similar future/promise solutions have 2 separate pools for those
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> Then you get into stuff like chaining where you need to think about what gets executed in which pool when.
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's why we need ddnet 2.0
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> Sometimes you want the chained job to go back in the queue, sometimes you want it executed inline
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it starts instant
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> In Rust one just ignores all that complexity and hopes tokio devs have it all right, maybe we should use a library for it too?
19:55 < bridge> <robyt3> That's why we need ddOS, so you can reload DDNet into memory immediately and your OS is the launcher
19:55 < bridge> <robyt3> That's why we need ddOS, so you can preload DDNet into memory immediately and your OS is the launcher

19:56 < bridge> <learath2> No OS, only ddnet. We can put the launcher into MBR
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> Loads too fast. I don't like it
19:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw what happened to Chiller? It's been a while since I saw him
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> He overdosed on 0.7
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> after robyte said he dislikes 0.7
19:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah it all makes sense now
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> direct rq
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> He was so close to getting his 0.7 support into the client
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> But then chaos
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't dislike 0.7, but adding 45 TODOs was a bit too much
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's ok, come to the jupstar side
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> newer is better
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> quality > quanitity
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> performance is everything
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when a user starts ddnet he must feel "I deserved that"
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Except when it comes to frame count? 😄
19:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Remove all backwards compatibility for next April 1st
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if the quality clearly overweights the fps argument i can live with that
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but everything should feel instant
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and smooth
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> You need to get to 5.391 * 10^44 frames per second ASAP
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> We can render directly into spacetime
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163174726018027540/test.mp4?ex=653e9de1&is=652c28e1&hm=e7ac4b7a63f33a562e83e74465ddfe717e0da57955742ecd7205fe0b7948f19d&
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instant server joining
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> another short flex
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> If just looks wrong, you need to add a couple sleeps
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need to hook into javascript
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> call sleep
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then go back
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> full js runtime deps
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> Start a 68030 emulator, sleep on there in a nop loop, then go on
20:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ddnet 2.0 should have split screen support
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kek
20:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> and mutli mouse support
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u want another flex?
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's actually hard xd
20:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye ik xD
20:05 < bridge> <k2d222> x11 multiple mouse support is hilarous
20:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried implemented smt like that with libinput but it's so hard that I didn't get anywhere
20:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1147541187671113748
20:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah yeah I remember that xD
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbf that's more the power of using no global variables
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> than anything else
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i archieved similar stuff with cpp version
20:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> But I meant split-screen support as being able to plug another keyboard and mouse and play with those too. So it goes hand in hand with multi-mouse support :/
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, the problem here is really just winit support for it
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i'd say it's ez
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if only x11 supports it, then it probably untested af xd
20:09 < bridge> <robyt3> I thought about a demo player preview in the browser but that would be equivalent to creating an entire new client inside the client due to the global variables
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my client is constructed so, that u can view demos ingame even
20:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm as k2d2 said x11 mutli pointer support isn't good. I think the only viable solution would be to use libinput for linux and equivalents for win/mac/bsd
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbf i don't have demo support yet xD
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just thought about the hierarchy
20:11 < bridge> <robyt3> If it's structured well it shouldn't matter if the snapshots and messages are from a server or from a demo file
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i hope i can hurry a bit until like end of the year
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i can maybe show some stuff
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> currently i worked on DPI aware UI
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with zooming support
20:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Why is our jobpool only using two threads anyway?
20:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Is probably go for `2 * std:🧵:hardware_concurrency() + 2` many threads for now
20:51 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd probably go for `2 * std:🧵:hardware_concurrency() + 2` many threads for now
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why the 2*?
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> `std:🧵:hardware_concurrency() + 1`
20:52 < bridge> <robyt3> So more threads can wait on I/O
20:52 < bridge> <robyt3> We don't assume the jobs are all doing useful work, no?
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> will be funny to have a job pool with 34 threads
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah right we dont use green threads
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> The idle threads would be waiting on a semaphore so that's fine. Though their stacks would be allocated, but I think our stack footprint is tiny on job pool runners so it just might be doable
21:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> on android? is mobile client coming back after all?
21:09 < bridge> <robyt3> It improve the code quality even if Android is unused right now
21:11 < bridge> <robyt3> We could probably compile an Android version, but then people would complain because there is no input method unless you connect mouse/keyboard/controller
21:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> No joystick buttons like the other mobile client?
21:12 < bridge> <robyt3> We'd have to add something like that, I don't know other mobile clients or even the old version we have
21:23 < bridge> <chairn> especially for small games like ddnet
21:26 < bridge> <chairn> it will eat the last MB of memory on potato PC 😄
21:26 < bridge> <learath2> The game will truly be ruined forever
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of launchers do u use lmao
21:27 < bridge> <learath2> Powered by electron
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but srsly, a simple launcher shouldn't be a problem xd
21:27 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, we are just joking around
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> An invisible one or a simple one is not even a resource consideration
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> An electron one I would just leave the team over
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, chairn is serious af xd
21:29 < bridge> <learath2> He is a phd afterall
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then, i take it back
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is allowed to use win7
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> He is serious about the earlier comment though probably. People do dislike launchers
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Launchers are often done completely wrong, just add extra clicks and spyware
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> Waaaay back in 2004 when I first started gaming people didn't like launchers 😄
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, this was soo common, cluttered weird apps full of ads
21:34 < bridge> <chairn> first comment is kinda serious, second is joke
21:34 < bridge> <chairn> invisible one is probably fine, i think users shouldn't need one more click to start the game
21:34 < bridge> <chairn> psychological barriers are powerful repellents
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, which ppl u mean?
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> minecraft launcher is quite liked i think
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they like launchers like origin
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs they arent just launchers
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are whole OS
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> back in 2008- i remember launchers from MMOs
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not talking about any specific person. I'm just thinking back to my time playing shitty mmorpgs and gunz
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> looking forward to download the game
21:36 < bridge> <chairn> now that i think about it, we could have separate map editor and skin manager, stuff like that
21:36 < bridge> <chairn> though mappers will probably dont like not being able to map and chat at the same time
21:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163198887717244979/oee1p5ll9gf71.jpg?ex=653eb462&is=652c3f62&hm=8689dedb0e630baa82b5c7c6f57e315817f69bf245c3b82651e6a4aa1af451d1&
21:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> good memories
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> The private servers that ditched the launcher were always appreciated
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> classic mmo launcher
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> Grandchase was such a vibe. I hosted a private server for a couple months
21:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i played grand chase back then
21:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> also another one about golfing
21:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> weeb ofc
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm and more stuff

21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was an advanced weeb already kek
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> this game was on wii too iirc
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> I used to play grandchase, florensia, metin 2, knight online. Some very meh games
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is a golf mmo
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PangYa
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> Funnily enough I think the first anime I ever watched was like when I was finishing up highschool. I resisted the weeb for very long
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> they put dragon ball (bola de drac in catalan) on tv
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i got anime from tv
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> also one piece
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> dragon ball dub in catalan is iconic
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> (im talking about when goku is a kid)
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/kid-goku-kid-goku-clapping-gif-21748543
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> this
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> the catalan dub itself has fans, it was that good
21:41 < bridge> <learath2> When I was a wee youngling, we had anime on tv aswell, but I got unlucky. Erdogan got elected and decided anime was degeneracy, so I never got to watch any
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> big f
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> We had dubbed one piece and dubbed dragon ballz
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> here now they even put modern anime
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was demon slayer on tv
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> saw*
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> If demon slayer was aired on tv in turkey, they would shoot up the channel nowadays
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:43 < bridge> <learath2> Waaay too much fanservice in that one
21:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> Ware is ddnet fan service?
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> well not that much but i guess
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1163200656862101545/Dota_patcher.jpg?ex=653eb607&is=652c4107&hm=2c6dc5710f26ee128222e6f5e7444efcd05710e7053e4306acf0d09de9f0b75e&
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> we need to make a oldschool ddnet launcher

22:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ye xd
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u know that game?
22:01 < bridge> <AssassinTee> please don't
22:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think itried it
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i played it xd
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to max lvl xd
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the launcher was cool, bcs everything that is white in the pic above was transparent
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so shenlong went over the edges
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> This gui was cool for a while. Lot's of transparent irregular guis came out for a moment

22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it got recommended to me
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probs bcs google knows we talking here
22:37 < bridge> <learath2> 😄
22:42 < bridge> <murpi> Developers now: Let's just add DLSS/FSR as an excuse to not optimize
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> Ew
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 does windows do lazy allocations for thread stacks?
22:46 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know, but I wouldn't really expect it for Windows. You can specify the stack size when creating the thread (one of the 0's means default)
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what even is the current default stack size on modern windows?
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i remember it was like 16 KBytes
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> some day xd
22:46 < bridge> <robyt3> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-stack-size
22:48 < bridge> <robyt3> "The default size for the reserved and initially committed stack memory is specified in the executable file header"
22:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Whatever is specified in our file header then ...
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> k
22:55 < bridge> <learath2> On linux we could madvise away the threads stacks after a while
22:55 < bridge> <learath2> We very rarely have more than one job usually
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on linux stack is lazy allocated anyway
22:56 < bridge> <robyt3> That could change quickly if we load every image in another job
22:56 < bridge> <learath2> But as soon as we use it it'll be forever allocated
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 8MB or whatever ur limit is, is really just the limit
