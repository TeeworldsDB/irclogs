05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> parallelism was one of the main reasons behind the rust port but they haven't yet added that feature ig
06:04 < bridge> <Teero> the fish is sadly unemployed

09:48 < bridge> <Assa> hmm here the 18.x version row would be interesting
09:53 < bridge> <kebscs> What happened 18.9
09:57 < bridge> <Assa> there may be other things beeing measured here, I noticed that the player doesn't have a freeze ninja animation on some older clients for example
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> also the hud is different, but there was also a map rendering regression in between
10:04 < bridge> <Assa> do we want to optimize "only show gametiles" ? because we could easily do that already on map load, but this would prevent beeing able to toggle it
10:10 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure this is the now fixed skin issue visible here, because you see it between 19.4 and 19.5, and not (much) map rendering related was changed between this verions
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all my fps gone
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> That is unbelievable amounts of variability between the versions. Did you control for everything? Did you measure a couple times? Did you average?
10:42 < bridge> <totar> it says "worst 0.001" so you'd expect variability
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, that's what I missed on the graphs
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly the avg also has an unexpected amount of variability. We have been steadily ruining the performance it seems
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> At 18.9 we started to ruin it even faster. Then it seems we returned to our previous trajectory for 19.5
10:45 < bridge> <totar> yeah I'm also curious what happening in 18.9
10:45 < bridge> <totar> when was the new HUD update?
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember exactly
10:48 < bridge> <totar> damn it was way back in 16.3
10:48 < bridge> <totar> damn it was way back in 16.0
10:49 < bridge> <totar> not even on the cahrt
10:49 < bridge> <totar> not even on the chart
10:51 < bridge> <totar> hmm there's like 9 versions between 17.4.2 and 18.9.1 so I'm probably not gonna find it skimming the change logs
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean we had a few versions with the broken/slow skin loading stuff
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd have expected 19.5 to be fast again
