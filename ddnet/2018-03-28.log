00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty @deen c:
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd what happend? closed lul
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip me getting in the web dev list of ddnet
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i like how the yt  hash starts with ``eZ_`` xd
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "Oh, didn't see that, made the same change right now. Thanks anyway."
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/41#issuecomment-376690076
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye i found that too
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so he was doing the same thing xd and found my pr aftwards?
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats sad .-.
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how was he even that fast
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the video was public 20 secs
02:58 < jxsl13> :O
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon Just happened to be ingame where the video was announced to be uploading/uploaded
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I checked it out immediatel. Only checked my emails afterwards, that's when I saw your PR
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> who want's a free VPS xD
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen nice that you are fast at updating videos at frontpage .-.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Sad that i didnt make it into the web contributor list xd i really want to get in there
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @ReiTW | Blizzard yes sir
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon You'll find something useful to contribute, don't worry. Or just run a spell checker over it..
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lot's of things to fix on that sit
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lots of things to fix on that site
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 do you have some example? c:
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the ridiculously long server specific ranks pages (ranks/solo), the misaligned "Points calculation" part on ranks page
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh true thats missaligned
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But those might not be in ddnet-web repo
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i suck at aligning things anyway xd
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm does some1 know how i extend my bunch of .acc files by another value?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tried
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``` echo "0" >> *.acc ```
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it didnt let me .-.
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``` -bash: *.acc: ambiguous redirect ```
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `for file in *.acc; do echo "0" >> "$file"; done`
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff thats a lot of typing
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shit bash
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ty c:
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> BTW, has anyone tried to teach a neural network to play TW in a fasion similar to OpenAI Gym environments? https://gym.openai.com/
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk his name anymore was some dude trainign it on gores
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he was live on twitch
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it was very interesting to watch o.O
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I myself haven't seen neural nets playing TW yet â€“ but a couple of other AI strategies ðŸ™‚
13:59 <@deen> @bob_fasul If you do so for DDRace with 2 players, please call it Siamese twin AI
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2p neural net o.O
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it would be so great
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I actually meant https://blog.openai.com/universe/ xD
14:00 <@deen> U
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I actually meant <https://blog.openai.com/universe/> xD
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> well, it would be nice to have multiple agents cooperating indeed
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> but I doubt it would be easy to teach it DDRace
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> especially since some maps require lots of thinking (e.g. Koule 7, where 3 players must cooperate from the very first stage)
14:02 <@deen> just train it on teehistorian data :D
14:02 <@deen> lots of successful teams playing
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> yea, might also work, first some supervised learning on teehistorian or just random demos, and then unsupervised learning on various novice maps
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> bet it would be very good at solo maps :
14:03 <@deen> Well, the first problem would be how to define progress, how to get closer to finish line
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just train it on @N9mkOik's races
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> (supervised learning is when the correct answers are known beforehand, unsupervised is when it tries to guess the answers based on some raward)
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> (supervised learning is when the correct answers are known beforehand, unsupervised is when it tries to guess the answers based on some reward)
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> well, we might get some people to finish the race, and then guess progress based on position compared to position of those people
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I mean, get the nearest position on their path, then check what was their time at that point -- closer to finish would be closer to end time
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @heinrich5991 might work, why not
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> @ChillerDragon what's a web contributor list?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/graphs/contributors @Rockus.~ the only ranking what matters
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> ah okay
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is there still no fix for players with high times (300min for example) listed at the bottom of the scoreboard
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just increase the default value from -9999 to -999999
20:18 <+eeeee> or the players could just hurry up and finish faster
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no u
