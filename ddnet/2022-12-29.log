08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your set up is bizarrely broken. Idk how on earth debug would find a compiler but release not
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would do it. But so far I also only got local host running I didnâ€™t test Heinrichâ€™s fix yet. Not sure when I find motivation to do so
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Mahdiyar)
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> We need it now because Iran's Internet is becoming national
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> sounds like a cool thing! are you excited? But for gaming we will be always seperated due to ping zones :(
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait national
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> not international
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> It is exactly international
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> It is in a bad state, that's why we made this request
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> im a bit busy this morning if i dont forget i can have a look later if i can get it running
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Ok
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Thanks !
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the problem you are having @Mahdiyar. I have a bit of time this afternoon, maybe I can help you fix things
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Is it possible to give you a server that only has MasterServer Build inside? And do you configure apache2 and nginx?
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Iran's Internet is going to become international and we will make the MasterServer public so that others can join the servers.
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> If you can do this favor for us
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @Learath2
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> This is our problem
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If iran is going international then u dont need ur own master right?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just use the international one, aka ddnet one
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> maybe
10:34 <+ChillerDragon> wait you said you are "becoming national" which is it now? international or national? xd
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think he means it's going national, so intranet only
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> yea thought so too
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it broken for you or what? ðŸ˜„
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Jupeyy_Keks i have mailed before glew maintainer to ask version bump, he respond "Yes, it's about time, agreed."
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> date is Thu, Mar 10, 2:04 PM :D
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh nice thanks
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can only take 2 more years^

17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Can we drop support for Windows XP officially? I'd like to use `RegGetValueW` and `RegDeleteTreeW`, which are only available starting with Windows Vista.
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> both arent working anymore idk
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we already did
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with discord sdk i think
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno, can u reproduce?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> ok, it's just our dependency on the Windows API that's still only based on Windows XP
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/zy4ct8/getting_mentioned_in_a_random_issue_on_a_random/
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> guess it was just a matter of time
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> With 16.6 DDnet crashes sometimes for me. Backtrace with symbols: https://termbin.com/q7tb

21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u reproduce it?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> sometimes. It's kinda random
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> can't reliably reproduce it
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> so hard to bisect
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what are u even bisecting? ddnet or mesa xd
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, sounds fine to bump it to Vista
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> but I still use windows XP..
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and u can continue using it ðŸ˜‰
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when nobody looks i also use win98 bcs its the best os
