00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> prediction bugs out if you're shooting a weapon and start chatting (shotgun and laser too, but not as spectacular)

00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, how about being able to rotate the weapon entity so that weapons could be displayed vertically instead of horizontally?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> makes no sense to be honest
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> since holding a gun like that, would be brutal
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> not holding it like that, just displaying it like that on the map
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> on the map huh
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and indeed, wouldn't make much sense like a lot of other features that are just used from time to time, yet give bigger variety of options to use

01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> confusingf
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> confusing
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i meant for the gun
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for the sword looks nice
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Any ideas about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2495 ? If not, I'd set up a test server with fake players to test this
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what was the script that got the serverinfo?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> > btw, how about being able to rotate the weapon entity so that weapons could be displayed vertically instead of horizontally?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Soreu 
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Yeah would be good for design purposes and doesnt change the gameplay.
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Idk about vanilla support
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as rotated ones still show up in vanilla, I'm fine with this
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> hi, my friend got problem, as he saying his mouse rmb didnt work so he switched to another one, opened game and his game became fresh, he didnt update client, is there way to restore his old cfg?
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> if there is no config in the teeworlds directory and he did not make a backup its gone @Kicker
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> its always a good idea to backup the teeworlds directory regulary since data loss should always be expected
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> depending on the client used there might be a backup/different version in %APPDATA%\teeworlds (assuming windows)
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> ok thx
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @ChillerDragon that vote passed quick

21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 scripts/teeworlds.py
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> do you guys think its bad style to use shellcode in ~/.bash_aliases ?
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> idk how differently alias files get parsed? i am thinking about refactoring my aliases to create them using a eval loop
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594589070.png
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> i mean it works but idk ...
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea and dont tell me i can only use 1 loop ;D
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think alias files have any special handling at all
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea thought so too so its just for seperation right? I could also do that in my bashrc i guess
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> having 20 aliases for 1 cmd lmao
