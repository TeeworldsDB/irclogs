11:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #131: skip static libgcc linking if it's not available (DDRace64...mac_build) http://git.io/W0ouZg
11:22 < laxadedi> why those guys would ddos the server between 6 and 10 ?
11:36 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
11:41 < laxadedi> again ?
11:42 < laxadedi> those guys wants the death of teeworlds or what ?
11:55 <@heinrich5991> no, either they want to populate their own servers or just like being in power
12:21 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671
12:22 <@EastByte> be careful :)
12:45 <@deen> shit, guess the attacks will keep coming now
12:46 <@EastByte> we would need to find out who causes them
12:46 <@deen> I'm currently on a train, will be back in the evening
12:46 <@deen> EastByte:  I know who does it
12:46 <@EastByte> u do?
12:47 <@deen> Just join a blocker server and they tell you how they did it
12:47 <@EastByte> hm
12:48 <@deen> same guys as always
12:48 <@EastByte> kk
12:48 <@deen> they just have a stronger botnet now
12:48 <@deen> or they're using their client as a botnet, not sure
12:49 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
12:49 < coffee> mm
12:50 <@deen> don't think they're running their own server right now
12:50 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
12:50 <@deen> when i was on ddnet blocker server, they said "deen can't ban us, or we down the server" 
13:15 <@deen> Would be nice if we had an anti-ddos provider in europe that can deal with 40gbit/s while not costing 400 â‚¬ / month
13:24 <@deen> Or maybe I should go to the police after all
13:25 <@deen> It's always the same guys and I have their names and photos after all
13:26 < coffee> It could be really useful ?
13:31 < seymour_> thats so fucked up that people would ddos servers that run off donations... wtf
13:41 < laxadedi> deen: I think you should be realistic, you'll never find a really good hosting solution with that good ddos protection for cheap :(
13:42 < laxadedi> I guess, filing a complaint to the police can't hurt, but I don't it's going to be really useful :s
15:36 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!

20:51 < CookieMichal> Hey!
20:51 < CookieMichal> deen: What's with DDNet GER?
20:52 <@heinrich5991> CookieMichal: afaik it's being attacked
20:53 < CookieMichal> heinrich5991: but DDNet GER has DDoS protection, doesn't it?
20:53 <@heinrich5991> I have no idea, but I think its outage is related to attacks
20:53 <@deen> CookieMichal: yes, but so far all attacks were at max 20-30 GBit/s, now the attackers are up to 40 GBit/s and it's too much for the protection
20:54 <@deen> so the provider disconnects us for 4 hours
20:54 < CookieMichal> Uh..
20:54 < CookieMichal> That's bad :/
20:54 <@deen> 12 hours of downtime in the last 2 days =/
20:56 < CookieMichal> o.0
21:00 < CookieMichal> How long does typical attack take?
21:00 <@deen> I don't know
21:00 <@deen> they shut us down immediately for 4 hours if it's too much
23:51 < CookieMichal> DDNet rekt
23:51 < CookieMichal> just a second ago
