02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try more modern methods :

11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 what is this for?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cant mod clients just send a faked checksum?
11:18 <+breton> GER2 Novice on 8300 is blocked again
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> tracking trolls that use vpn and fake names
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Only if they know that such feature exists ðŸ˜„ So psscht
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Yeah, no advantages in doing much computation to generate a pseudo random string
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it wont make graphic bad?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno what you mean by bad, but GL 3.3 is the only renderer that buffers text and batches particles
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It should look better than GL 2.0 and 1.x, which are both the shittest versions(but you should default to 3.0)
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It turns on entities, if you prefer to play with design remove that line again
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> health HUD and score hud are pretty much useless with ddrace
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they just block screen space
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also play without nameplates(have a toggle), very nice for gores, dunno what mod you play
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Smetanolub\: oh but if you play on a laptop with intel graphics, I still dunno if the windows drivers are fixed yet
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 it seems like especially my server is not in the http master very often. what could be the reason for that?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only a restart fixes it usually
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i didnt spot huge differences in the register process, so i just have the 0.7 way
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc without token etc, but in general i didnt notice any other big differences
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i check whether i am registered?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> server says i am registered in rcon
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're registered on which master?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is your server's IP address and port?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I would try to use this tool for you: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/67091b4727a9730df496c2c5bfaf2aed90c30489/tools/src/bin/serverlist.rs
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2022-January/030670.html when debuginfod for ddnet? ^^ does something like that exist for windows?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> no i have pc
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like there is not much docs about it rn tho
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://debuginfod.archlinux.org/packages
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also doesnt have many packages yet
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh true, that's not a lot
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it possible to have passwords inside teeworlds/ddnet hyperlinks?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hyperlinks?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you mean: 1) for joining via steam friend list? 2) connect links as currently handled by the ddnet client or 3) connect addresses by the http master?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean "possible" as in "possible right now" or "possible to add"?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing it isn't possible right now, so possible to add
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and where? connect links?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I mean 4) 1+2. So in general could it be possible to share links that one could click and join a passworded server that include the password
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In a backward compatible way where old clients can still use the new links but get a password prompt?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe not for steam
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take that, steam people should be up to date anyway
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and also not for 2) ðŸ˜¦
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only 3) ^^
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that's sad :/
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be really useful for services where we launch servers on demand
