02:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> how do i bind numpad keys?
02:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> "NUM1"?
02:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> kp_0 - kp_9
02:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> oh thats a weird syntax
02:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> stands for keypad
02:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> technically there are more than just numbers on a numpad
02:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> for ex. `kp_plus` i think it's called
09:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> clang-format isn't liking `src/engine/server/server.cpp`
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nvm github action seems broken
09:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> You have to use the correct version of clang-format, which is a bit annoying
09:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> on Arch Linux I use clang-format-static-bin from AUR. scripts/fix_style.py then uses that

11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Because of this, I will now have to ban all future contributions from
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > your University and rip out your previous contributions, as they were
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > obviously submitted in bad-faith with the intent to cause problems.
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 oof
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Interesting
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just wow...
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you know that we have no way to remove a directory in tw code?
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually agree with the ban
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are wasting time of ppl who do work and dont even get paid
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its rly disrespectufll
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twin-cities.umn.edu/
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this entire uni banned :OMEGALUL:
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely, I would ban their ass too, wtf is this
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone updated their firefox?
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new tab style
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont dislike it
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the theme changed overall
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didnt yet

12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boti.> waterfox :justatest:
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they have some updates on their phone app since a while
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> complete redesign
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they now sometimes fail to open the entered URL
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only opening a new tab helps
15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> should be default logo, looks much better ðŸ˜„
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alola firefox
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/834423286011789332/unknown.png
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> that background ðŸ˜„
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> can't unsee :â–¯
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the https server browser now has a way of pinging each server (through a command)
17:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's left is now automatically pinging the server you're currently on
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 can you also add compability for the old server info, some servers arent listed as > 16p even if they support it
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> ?
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/834448387419406376/unknown.png
17:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @WAV check what the key's name is in the binds menu (bind something you don't need to it)
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> where's the binds menu
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> oh you mean that
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> settings â†’ controls
17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª I'd love to get rid of it, but if it cannot be helped, I'll implement it. it'd have to be on the server side, so independent from the PR
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª it looks like it's mostly KoG servers that have this problem. I'll try to help them support the new protocol
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the fstd protocol has the problem that the client cannot know if the server supports it
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has to guess
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw for me this happened when i joined a  server it showed the ping in the browser
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm with the newest version of the PR?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its only on kog appearently
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with old version
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet shows 0 ping
18:08  * bridge_ [freenode] <timakro[m]> uploaded an image: (1124KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qfbXBUnmsYtmFEPGcdLwRjki/image.png >
18:09 <+bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Somebody knows the OSI model? My best guess for the layers 2=ethernet 3=ip 4=udp 5=tcp? How far off am I?
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both udp and tcp are 4, I think
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks good otherwise
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ethernet can probably be both 1 & 2
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> Finished all Strongholds :D
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The tcp ip model doesnt map extremely well to the osi model
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ethernet is indeed both 1 and 2 btw
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any firefox user with using the updated firefox?
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a rly funny bug
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/834507081805594654/unknown.png
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently these special letters make the tabs HUGE
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdddd
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet can relate to firefox :PepeA:

23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> Does it mean they will add some files to target the said exploit?
