03:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tght> teeworlds shaders pls
03:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> evil fix, destroys ddrace, way to over exaggerate, geez
03:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't have merged this one either tbh,  not without deleting all the ranks
05:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 their most important point was, you dont know which are cheated because teehistorian is not that old.
05:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 respect for the fact you almost dont play lately but still coding and fixing stuff for ddnet with the sometimes toxic community.
08:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- opened pull request #1268: Revert stopper fix (master...revert) https://git.io/fAToi
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> Just keep the old maps with their old physics will solve the problem and is the best approach :feelsamazingman:
09:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> All maps before teehistorian keep old physicsðŸ¤”
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen did u fix it now?
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I just reran the script
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to connect to ddnet channel of irc?
11:46 <@deen> :
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> or it's closed for all? just for vip
11:46 <@deen> use an irc client and go to #ddnet on quakenet
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to go 'on quakenet'?
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i can't understand what it's mean
11:47 <@deen> You have to use an IRC client and connect to the quakenet network
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can i use web-client?
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can i use a web-client?
11:47 <@deen> yeah: https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=#ddnet
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> thanks very much
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i'm banned
11:48 <@deen> :D
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> so, irc channel isn't for all?
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> just for people which have role "Developer" or another, yeah?
11:48 <@deen> Weird, apparently you're right
11:48 <@deen> Maybe it's to prevent spam
11:48 <@deen> laxa: ^
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hm
11:49 <@deen> Or maybe we banned webchat entirely
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> maybe i must use another nick
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> or ban doing for ip?
11:49 <@deen> it's about the ip, but webchat is always the same ip
11:49 <@deen> so i guess if one webchat user was banned, maybe all are
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hm
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i will try usual client of irc
11:59 <+laxadedi> deen: what ? I dont see what concerns me (afk eat)
12:00 <@deen> I thought you're the expert on bans :D
12:00 < Quantum|2> I'm here, hello
12:03 <@deen> hi Arseniy 
12:03 <+Arseniy> hi
12:04 <+Arseniy> Do you want something from me?
12:05 <@deen> Yeah, please fix our bugs: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
12:05 <+Arseniy> I got new window and thought you're wrote to DM. :\
12:06 <+Arseniy> So, I don't think I can do this.
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> @deen  ye i have acces
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/481767614964695060/unknown.png
12:13 <@deen> triki: and what's the client printing on the cmd window?
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> Old or new?
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> client
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> this client i download today, start clisent and press update.
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/481768956273754112/unknown.png
12:18 <@deen> So the download is fine, maybe saving the file isn't working
12:18 <@deen> Do you have permissions to overwrite ddnet-info.json in the config directory?
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> 1 weak ago all was okay
12:19 <@deen> yeah, it's weird, a few people seem to be having this problem and we have no idea why
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i can advice something
12:19 <@deen> or is there a ddnet-info.json.tmp file? if so, delete it
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> where ? old or new&
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> nvm
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> delete
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i can advice something
12:21 <+Arseniy> Try to delete line "add_path $USERDIR" and start the client
12:22 <+Arseniy> It probably can help to you
12:22 <+Arseniy> If ddnet-client isn't have permissions to change everything in config_directory it will help
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> so im update
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> update complete
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> i del ddnet-info.json and ddnet-info.json.tmp
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> and the client "saw" a new version
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> :D
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <triki> and successfully updated
12:27 <@deen> ok, so we'll still have to figure out why we lose permissions to overwrite ddnet-info.json (and we should log something about that error at least...)
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wombat> @n000b and you are going to watch all teehistorian demos? :tee_thinking:
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&p=66504#p66504
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Hi since, Ryozuki mentioned the tutorial project I got some messages from people about it. You can take a look here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/612. If somebody is interested, especially mappers and someone of the admins with access to the servers would be needed to find potential problems feel free to check it out and give ideas/feedback/contribute.
15:00 <@deen> Wombat: You can analyze them automatically
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <snail> :GWfroggyFeelsBaguetteMan:
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> :GWfroggyFeelsBaguetteMan:
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> when finish flags back
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Wombat Actually could analyze all maps where we have the top rank and see if they flew through stopper in their run, if not then disable that behaviour on the map
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (not sure if that's a good idea though, just a possibility)
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> that still leaves couple of hundred maps where u donâ€™t have the top rank
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> well I guess u can filter maps that donâ€™t have stoppers
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> then maybe the rest is a reasonable number to check manually
17:32 <@deen> but you'd also need to remove/analyze all saves on those maps
17:33 <@deen> sounds quite difficult in sum
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Does someone know "translator" of code, which will give description of code, which you have pasted?
17:43 <@deen> :D
17:45 <@deen> Good luck with the Turing Award you're obviously going for
17:46 <@deen> We can't even determine if a program will ever stop running, not even talking about *what* it will do: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> asd
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> strong for my brains, rly
17:50 <@deen> My approach would be to post it on stack overflow, then post another comment with a fake account giving some wrong explanation for what the code does and people will come and correct it
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what is the stack
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> in your mean??
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> in your mean?
17:51 <@deen> https://stackoverflow.com/
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> 0.0
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> this site like a github or bitbucket?
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> deen
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Are you here?
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> the meta stuff of the link literally tells u what the site is xd
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> "Stack Overflow - Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers" it's?
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> + the description below
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Wikipedia page might give you a lot of information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow

18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> so, big amount of letters too strong for me because i'm russian and can't read big texts :\
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but already registered :DDD
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> who can send me bam.exe for Windows 7 x64?
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> I can't to compile vanilla version of teeworlds, idk why
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Teeworlds requires bam to build, so first you need to get it somehow or build yourself.
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> * so first you need to get *bam* somehow or build it yourself.
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> fixed, but

18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @RafaelFF vanilla for sure, not ddnet anymore
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> yep, he asked specifically for "vanilla version of Teeworlds".
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> thanks very much for help, fixed my problem without ur help but u're good dude
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> because u can advice something, even it unusual
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github haxx0r squad i need ur help
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what are submodules
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and why the heck did ddnet sneak into my bbnet scripts as submodule
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woops
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nvm
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> bbnet is like a abibas :D
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> abibas the jew?
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> no
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUAnh88X9nQ
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that abibas?
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> nonono
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> u must understan
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> u must understad
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> u must understand
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> adibas
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> do you know the company "Adidas"?
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
19:39 < Quantum> Abibas is the fake of Adidas.
19:40 <+Quantum> Adidas manufacturing fake clothes
19:41 <+Quantum> and bbnet sounds like a abibas
19:41 <+Quantum> two D and two B too :D
19:41 <+Quantum> but i don't think thats bbnet is the fake of ddnet
19:41 <+Learath2> They are trying to say bbnet sounds like a knock off ddnet :P
19:42 <+Quantum> Who are "they"?
19:43 <+Learath2> You and "@Arseniy Zarche", who might or might not be you.
19:43 <+Learath2> So I addressed you as plural just to be sure :P
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> I'm Quantum
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Sometimes I can't write to discord
19:51 <+Quantum> I have problem with tuning my vanilla (local) server
19:52 <+Quantum> When I have write 'tune gun_speed 300' (for example)
19:53 <+Quantum> server's message is 'gun_speed changed to 300.00
19:53 <+Quantum> and
19:53 <+Quantum> resetting tuning due to pure server
19:53 <+Quantum> 'resetting tuning due to pure server'*
19:54 <+Quantum> Who can help me to fix this problem, idk how
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> disable pure server
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sv_gametype mod
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> NO ONE TALKS ABOUT FINISH FLAGS WHERE ARE THEY
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> EXPLAIN
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> thanks @deen
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what finish flags @|UroboroS| Rockus.~ ?
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to understand it: `a += Spreading[i+2];`
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> :\
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> ahhh, finish flags
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> u must use DDNet window in ddnet client
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> isn't internet, DDNet window
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkobot> i guess he means the flag quad from naufrage @ChillerDragon
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faceless> Btw, have a question, if ive finished map on ger2, but currently ger2 is down so i hadnt got points for finishing it, will this finish be saved in database, or it would be lost?
22:14 <+Learath2> @Faceless ger2 isn't down, I can connect to it just fine
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faceless> Sure, i have no lags there, but ddnet.tw says that ger2 is down and when i finished map, i had no message that i got points
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ger2 had some network troubles, the rank is still there it just didn't make it to the other servers, most prolly
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> There should be a server message about that btw
22:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> that we have written out the rank and will add it manually later
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm, @deen can you take a look at htop on ger2?
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, can't reach ger2
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faceless> I got message only about time, about points not
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen `1345 teeworl+   5 -15  685568  45196  12840 R 100.0  0.1  46:06.92 DDRace64-Server`
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so?
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> If a server gets lots of packets it uses 100% cpu to parse those
22:24 <+Learath2> Oh I thought we didn't even run anything on 8303, misread
