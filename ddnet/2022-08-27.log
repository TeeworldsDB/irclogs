09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Erik van Velzen tell me why would you invest in developing crypto related stuff on a free, open source platformer, where the category doesn't match the needs?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> As in you'd expect profit from it by having developers make a gamemode, which requires currency to do anything in the first place
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Making a teeworlds replica with a unique gamemode is the way to go for finantial investment, not betting addiction / microtransactions on a free open source game
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> There's a huge risk of when my products if it will succeed
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen>  open source 
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Could copy paste the same projects a thousand times
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Does devaluing my or our platform
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> The key here is to build it in a way that people won't leave and stick in
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that was not my point
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> my point was profiting ftom it, especially if you risk losing more, than is worth investing
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> my point was profiting from it, especially if you risk losing more, than is worth investing
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> my point was profiting from it, especially if you risk losing more, than is worth investing (onto the project)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Well the betting aspect is basically my first example
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Phase one one-on-one the company does not take anything winner takes all
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's not really betting . skilled-based.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> To make this absolutely legal is another question
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> In phase 2 it would be based on nfts particular on the skins of the players
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> To keep people stick in game I would need to build a open marketplace where people who make the most beautiful skins. (Moderated)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Will be selling it on the platform with royalties.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Phase 3 DD race default map
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> $0.15 entry into the map one week later the fastest three players will win the pot üçØ company profits and map creator profits.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> New map gets chosen by the players themselves with a cost
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Map creator and company profits 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Phase 4 the exact details are not figured out yet
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But it should be something like back and front end developers that are fixing and updating the new t worlds platform
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Are earning money....
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can someone ban this guy
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Someone asked him a question then he responded
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably the most ridiculous thing i have read in this server
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do we have the ability to block federation on the master server ü§£
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> damn
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> thats some high level scam
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lucas_jooj> I legit thought it was a scam message at first glance
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lucas_jooj> all it missed was a t.me link
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> imagine someone joins your server and be like "helo i select dis game for my block‚õìÔ∏è thingy bitcoin stuff so u richz and i richz too"
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> XDDDDD
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dude reacted with heart emote... do u think he has even played the game before
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stop bullying the blockchain man, he wants to make fat stacks üíµ
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I will bully him until he leaves, only way to "ban" him really
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mfw intolerant leftist
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> yo Erik how much money are you willing to invest into that thing?
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> can i ping names with spaces?
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> @Erik van Velzen
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> @"Erik van Velzen"
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can yes, don‚Äôt need the quotes
13:19 <+ChillerDragon> oh cool thanks for the feedback
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> @lucas_jooj here u get your t.me link hrhrhr https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=133729#p133729
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I wish I didn't, I still didn't get a proper answer tho
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> love being radical
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> @lynn are you in game right now?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> can i someone pm u?
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> somehow*
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wdym
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh thank god im not the only one thinking he should be banned
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least someone has my back
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not saying he's breaking any rules im saying he's a public nuisance
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i already calling him out yesterday
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> @lynn could u join a tw server or irc so i can chat with u in private? :)
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and goes against everything we stand for
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was*
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hi chiller
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> long time no see
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ChillerDragon: why not just message me on XMPP?
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i thought i offered this to you in the past
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lynn@nekomimi.be
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> @Erik van Velzen why does it need crypto and blockchain? for me it sounds like a classic monetization of a video game. It sounds very centralized and non blockchain related to me. Could you enlighten me.
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he just wants to make money
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> @lynn never hopped on the xmpp hype but i remember someone mentioned it here lemme see
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> he said it himself in his "intro video"
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xmpp is legit
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki you do not need crypto to get money
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> been in the Blockchain industry for 10+ years
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i know
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> he just wants money
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> can weechat do xmpp?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i think
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> should
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/sleduc/weechat-xmpp
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or use dino
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> or what client u suggest lynn?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> decent client
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for linux
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://weechat.org/scripts/tag/xmpp/
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> hot logo
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i recommend dino or gajim but idk lately
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> don't pay much attention to XMPP these days
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> yikes idk how xmpp wrks
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> are those random servers trusty to register? xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1661600088.png
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ChillerDragon: bro if you think that logo is hot, have a look at dino's https://dino.im/img/logo.svg
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> meh you can just use like another open one
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like uhh
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 404.city
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga yes i meant that logo xd
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> im hooked
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is one based in France that I can't remember
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> good.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :p
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> really nice
13:39 <+ChillerDragon> aaa password fails SASLprep dafa
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> apparently it does not like spaces in the password like woot? now im ip banned xd
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wtf

15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like spain isnt the worst this time kek
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well we get our gas from the south
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you know who doesnt want spain gas to go upwards? france, cuz it would fuck their electricity economy kek
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so spain cant sell it to the others
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they gotta rely on russia
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how is sweden doing so well?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is how

15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> <a:pepeW:818574752892452925>
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how is france doing so bad with almost 70% of their energy coming from nuclear?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> didn't they cancel nuclear power?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> everyone except france did
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> not a green energy blahblahblah
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> really strange then
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe all of these stations are russian xd
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Russia, US, Ukraine,  and France all have significant amount of nuclear energy generation
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually japan seems to have cancelled nuclear energy too üòÑ
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah do we start our half yearly why nuclear energy(fission) won't be the future already?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> üçø xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üòÑ
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_PopcornThumbsUp:
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not today, we are doing energy prices today
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok, just today i saw a video about a pumped storage power plant thats being built in the south.
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> insane projects
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Yes it is a game to be monetized
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> In multiple directions players earned money map creators earn money tee skin creators earn money
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Back and front end does earn money
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And the company earns money
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> It has to be this way otherwise it won't stick
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Yes
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> You would need to put money on the app but the app would be controlled by only you that app is outside of this company
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tomas> As far as I know, more than half of nuclear is off in France, because of maintenance and other reasons
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If that's true that'd explain a lot. That‚Äôs horrible timing üòÑ
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 32 out of 56 reactors are currently under maintenance
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Also with the ongoing drought, river based reactor needed to slow down to comply with regulation on rejected water temperature
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not at all, the reason is that it would cost a lot of money while not benefitting France
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> moreover, is it wise to invest so much money into a fossile energy that everyone is trying to get out?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spain has been trying to get this done since 15 years ago
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its clearly an economic interested that france is against
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> first time i heard of it was today üòÑ
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> economic interest for who?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why does windows swap so much ?...
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gem.wiki/Midi-Catalonia_Pipeline
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh looks like the idea was revived recently
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spain-says-gas-pipeline-france-possible-8-9-months-2022-08-12/
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reuters.com/article/france-spain-gas-idUSL8N1963VJ
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it? xD
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The MidCat Pipeline was initially pitched as part of the broader EU effort to reduce the bloc's dependence on Russian energy imports by shipping more gas from the Iberian peninsula to the rest of Europe. The project was cut into two sections. The first part is called the South Transit East Pyrenees, or STEP, and is meant to continue the existing abandoned line into France for 120 km, at a cost of about ‚Ç¨440 million. France would cover t
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > In 2015, the project was awarded a ‚Ç¨4.15 million grant from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility for pre-construction studies as well as the public consultation for the implementation of the first phase of the project on the French side.[12]
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The pipeline was cancelled in January of 2019 after being blocked by French regulators following a determination that the pipeline was not financially viable.[13] The ‚Ç¨3 billion project ‚Äì which was prioritized for EU support by EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca√±ete in the EU's list of 'Projects of Common Interest' (PCI list), alongside 100 other gas projects ‚Äì was last April found to be not financially viable under most scena
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good resume
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> summary*
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well they probs didnt know in 2022 we would have a gas crisis
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I've been since 2010 
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And actively busy in it 2013 until now but I guess since 2019 I kind of slowed down 
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And now I really really deeply want to get this game built
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> You can join me here
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> https://discord.gg/3C27acjG
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he now is here spamming
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i want to join this purely for the reason to see it fail
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> man we're doing a lot of demo revamps huh
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> damn he really made a server
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> (@Erik van Velzen)
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, all cults have their church
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> :yes:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Mmm , nothing special just a place where people can chat
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #5774
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5774
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> So first you're saying I'm a scam please be banned
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And now I'm trying to tell people that are interested to go somewhere else so you're not bothered and now I'm scamming you like how brutally
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 90¬∞ turns you're making
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Again rarely I speak
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Mostly answering others peoples questions.
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Please be kind to yourself and to others
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Bro he literally said spamming not scamming but now that you mention it that‚Äôs probably what you are doing
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Sorry I'm dyslexic misread that.
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this was a scam from the start
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm feeling threatened all the time basically everybody is trying to kick me off and I'm just trying to get my words spoken and I'm looking that I'm looking for a developer that knows exactly how to code this game
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I said I would pay you 33 euros to prove me wrong
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Any other attack you may have to me right now or anyone else or just cowards no one is coming front to take it
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> imagine getting paid 33 euro to then lose it instantly when you gamble it in crypto teeworlds
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'll pay you cash no bloody crypto coins not in game just now
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> sounds like ur getting mad my guy
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> You say you aren‚Äôt scamming but got weirdly defensive at the sight of a similar word, and even if your intentions are good a budget of 2000 is scamming whichever dev you want to do work for you anyways
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm trying so badly to get any real response from some good developers here
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> >good develoupers
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> whats your definition of that
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If the plan was for phase 1 to be complete for $2,000
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> There could be some more money on the table it really depends
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Someone that at least knows the ins and outs of the game back end front end
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And can implement payment structures within detailed code
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you feel threatened, nobody forces you to stay here üôÇ
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally all devs have seen ur stuff already
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody is interested
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get it in ur head
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk why you want other ppls say on it. its literally open source, add it yourself
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> He can‚Äôt but he knows how profitable play to earn games can be so he wants to hi-jack this community into one of those
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> He can‚Äôt bc he‚Äôs not a dev but he knows how profitable play to earn games can be so he wants to hi-jack this community into one of those
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess most active devs have seen your proposal already and I‚Äòd interpret their silence as a lack of interest.
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone was really worried about how i responded to this guy, but seems like everyone went in harder xD
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I checked his name in game. He doesn't play
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> barely any points
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://ddnet.tw/players/Bitcoin/
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> note the playtime in the last year and only finished one moderate map
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> he wants to piggyback on the success of others on a FOSS project for his own gains. I suppose he is running out of crypto ventures to explore? I mean, come on, I'm sure there are easier communities to fuck over, ones that are already monetized. Everything about this is a joke
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @lynn too new to remember active vanilla community :greenthing:
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> he said he plays since many years
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> He specifically referenced DDrace in his post...
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> afk emote isn't rendering for timeouted tees,  dunno anyone notice it
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Erik van Velzen  anyways, as a reminder, we are open source developers and as deen said the silence speaks volumes. Building crypto infrastructure on top of Teeworlds is in demonstrably poor taste, and I hope you give up early and go elsewhere. You're wasting your time as you know it and time is money!
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> most likely bcs of b99d8dc2595d0914b9a844dad7b98b0aaedca8a8
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Erik van Velzen  anyways, as a reminder, we are FREE and open source developers and as deen said the silence speaks volumes. Building crypto infrastructure on top of Teeworlds is in demonstrably poor taste, and I hope you give up early and go elsewhere. You're wasting your time as you know it and time is money!
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> on tee worlds not on dd
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Everything you said was contextualized as DDrace specific. "map creators" and "DD race default map" and "fastest three players"
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how the hell else am i supposed to interpret this?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> he says hes dyslexic
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> he wrote it himself?????
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeha
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ddrace is supposed to be some later phase, but yeah the idea itself totally goes against teeworlds'/ddnet's mentailty
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im confused but anyway, what you said was specific to DDrace and since you don't play and no one knows you you're not going to have any luck
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm using  speech to word
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just please go make a mobile game
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or like
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ask minetest
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Zwelf
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just stop wasting your time lol
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah he'll have better luck getting some random indie dev to make a unity game for this
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you spoke English fine in the video, unless I'm misunderstanding something
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do you just mean you're speaking into your phone to text?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Correct
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That could be possible
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> The problem there is they would need to learn the code base
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That costs lots of time and that would cost me extra money
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you know what would be cheaper and easier? making a damn mobile game
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you really only care about the money (seeing that you don't play personally) just do something easier
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> stop wasting time with a free and open source community and find someone who is actually on the same level of morality as you
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's incorrect I absolutely love this game well DD race is something totally different
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> You mentioned DDrace specific things in your post like 3 times
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I won't reiterate
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Exactly phase 3
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> No you mentioned it earlier than that too
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I guess I have I wasn't too clear about it
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's no codebase to learn when making something new, they can use tools that make it easy to make something from scratch
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this channel reaches IRC Matrix and Discord and no one has responded to you about the project
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> take a hint
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But that would take at least three to four months
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I spoke already with a couple of people face to face not digitally
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you truly love the game, why do you want to undermine its FOSS values by monetizing it?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone who truly loved the game would not advocate for this
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> LOL it did not take murpi 3-4 months to learn to make basic changes
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If you've watched the video it explains could you imagine that everyone is making money
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Not the losers but everyone else is
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so clearly so far you have not engaged in the community nor do you understand anything about the technical side of things
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I watched the video
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> No I'm not a developer
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm dyslexic
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But I damn bloody want this game built
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @murpi feel free to confirm but im almost certain it didn't take this long
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> developing anything takes lots of time, making a game from scratch using an engine might be actually faster in the end than frankensteining teeworlds
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Explain to me in 3 sentences why you want the game built. Why should I as a player want monetization?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I don't have the time I have a family that I need to take care of
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Exactly what I said, it doesn't take that long
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there are tons of devs that already understand the codebase but I doubt they will work with u
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> then frankly I'm offended that you think the best thing for your family is to try injecting your crypto views into a FOSS project. If it was really about your damn family you would do something safer
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Go make a mobile game, go monetize your own idea
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Guaranteed it is at least possible instead of impossible
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I want to do something that I love
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Not just hacking away
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Well I think you need to refocus on what is important to you. If your family is more important than what you love (which it should be) then reevaluate and redirect your course. Ofc you love crypto so I don't expect your values to be in line with mine, but I can at least hope for that much
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I actually have tried that
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> It costs huge tremendous amount of effort
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And return you just get crap
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This game is absolutely amazing lots of bugs have been fixed it has been played by so many people
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If I start something new that's a problem people wouldn't understand the game and they would need to learn it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's just not what I wanted I wanted something that is already there people know how to play it and know what the rules are
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> So far you've wasted at least an hour talking about this
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Nothing much in the crypto space at all
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> An average dev makes about... oh idk in Europe but in America we make 100k yearly which is about 50 USD per hour
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> You could have 50 USD so far instead of working up the wrong crowd. Tick tock
21:48 <+xq> I like that you want to make Teeworlds more competive by "supporting" them and trying to make a way of 1on1 eacother. Which cool due to how dead the vanilla side is :( BUT for me it ruins the one thing I really like about the game, which is that anyone can just launch the game up and start playing (as I understand it, you want the player to put something in before they can start playing, which would
21:48 <+xq> create the need for accounts bla bla).  
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Monetizing the game incentivizes a balance of scarcity and need. NFTs inherently succeed due to this and since you have been doing this shit for 10+ years you should know it is not equally fair for players. If you care about the game, you would focus elsewhere and play in your free time or even dev for it, but you don't
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is a lot of text to read
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> everyone will insist that P2E games are "more fair" to their customers but it's the same shit. It's just a more public version of extortion.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I play Teeworlds for fun. So does everyone else. We are not interested. Have a good day
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> As I said it's not our platform where the money is kept
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But that is an old idea
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Myself and so many other players worldwide always have seen gaming as such but never as a way to make money
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> In the context of skill based gaming and creation of skins and maps
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Sorry I'm not interested in this discussion anymore. I tried to help you make the best choices but that's all I can do. People have been monetizing free to play games for forever. They have not "always seen" it for fun. There's a split in the community and we are on one side
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> The only problem I see here is that you have straddled the fence. Get back on your side
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Besides, have you even considered how many players Teeworlds has? This is not profitable, find a bigger game or come up with your own idea. I'm not replying further
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I thank you for being kind I'm not so hard on me
