01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> warnings will be ok
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> but points restriction sux
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes points restriction bad, i was suggesting a warning
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> add chatvoice proximity
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> f3
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PINGUI> :monkaS:
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to add a small "intro" screen to maps. E.g. when you join a server you get something showing you the map, it's difficulty, maybe the things it has like jetpack, ninja etc.
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Could you remove ratings and finishing counter (0/12 maps finished) from FUN server on the site?
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If you like the fun category to stay on site anyway
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Because it really distracts when you want to finish everything and there are just 12 unfinishable maps
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think some of the fun maps can be finished
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I don't want to add more special cases
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I will look into some of the maps and see if you can finish them
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> how to increase fps?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> when there are hd graphics I get low fps even when my pc can handle it
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Nooback cl_refresh_rate 0, gfx_refresh_rate 0, opengl 3 enabled
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> what should opengl do?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> better performance
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> maybe tw doesnt have perms to get more performance
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> from computer
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In your GPU driver you can try disabling power saving
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and if you have integrated + dedicated gpu, switch to dedicated
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> could someone help me? like a week ago i started lagging very hard in teeworlds (only) and while im playing it feels like the server is getting ddosed, but its just me and my internet connection is good at any other things. i have already tried turning off every programs running in the background, also the game's steam version, non-steam version and even older version clients. they didnt work and i cant think of any other solutions.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try lan cable instead of wifi
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try using a different network, like a phone hotspot
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what kind of lags are they? for me the picture just freezes like 1-2 seconds sometimes
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its rly inconsistent though, i should probably downgrade to a lower version and play on it for a while to see if it happens there too
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> im playing on lan cable
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> the kind of when the server is under ddos and you randomly lag into the freeze or whatever, but its only just me
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^ would you describe those lags like i did mine ~1 year ago? (never found a solution though)
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and does it happen to you all the time or occasionally?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> it happens like in ever 6 seconds, but its not like yours that it delays my movement. i try to capture it if i can. cant describe it that much better
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think he means his packets are getting dropped abunch
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like a hook will hold for too long / not hook at all and movement wont register to the server so u kinda "teleport" to a diff location and speed then where u think u would be
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its rly annoying for gores players
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> at 5 sec you can see it clearly
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/797138676349403136/DDNet_Client_2021-01-08_17-15-53_online-video-cutter.com_2.mp4
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> but the video is laggy so you cant smh wtf stupid discord :feelsbadman:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If the lags with slow internet connection caused by package loss I just know the right solution to fix it
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> add voicechat proximity
18:51 <+ChillerDragon> @Krumplee so its the network for sure and not fps? maybe show some of your graphs when pressing ctrl+shift+d and ctrl+shift+g
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> for sure, but okay
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @Krumplee i have the exact same problem btw
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Krumplee disabled skin downloader
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Dry Wall you too
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> how? xD, im newbie when it comes to non gameplay
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I had no problems with the skin downloader at first, but at some point it started to lag even multiple times in a race, then I disabled it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Dry Wall settings -> tee -> download skins OFF
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> oh ill try but very recently i turned it on
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> so if anythign as i remmebr it happende before the downaloaded skins
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think it should fix it, but we you have to try it :D
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @fokkonaut bam bam bammmmmm, it still hapens 😄
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on KoG gores Server?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> yes
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> same
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @fokkonaut on all servers but smallest glitches and ping porblems on gores is lethat
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> lethal*
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> and as much as all the pc geeks say its wifi reltated its not, its pc related
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, kog servers are pretty bad or getting ddosed often, not sure
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @fokkonaut even non kog serves do that
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> it happesn any map any mode, novice, gores, fng
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What kind of lag? Just a random lag spike and you are in freeze or what?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @fokkonaut if describing in details, imagine all your commands are done properly. e.g u press d you go right, you press hook it hooks, but my character in self moves literally a few pixels which for someone like me who playes this game for long i can notice it, and it mentaly throws me off
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mh
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> but the things is other pc's in my house which get exactly same mbs upload and download dont get is, so its either my pc and ddnet not getting allong, or my specific wifi card instaled is super cheap
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> because even when i brought my pc to my bros house it still had same bugs and his mac recieving same speeds didint have. (same goes for pc's in my house)
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> its not wifi related, at least on my routers wifi, either my laptops wifi addpater is fuqed or my hardwear adn ddnet dont get allong
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you try saving your settings, restarting the game freshly and if it works just manually restore your important settings? Maybe there is a setting thats not "correct". If it didnt help you can simply use your saved, old cfg file again
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> seems liek a lot of work i mean any ddnet version which actually works on my laptop (btw many dont even launch) have the same bug
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, okay.
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> so it doesnt realy seem like a setting prob, its my pc for sure, just dont know hat xD. either way gores is 💩
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does a normal Teeworlds client work?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> same goes for teeworlds btw
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> i just use ddnet due to its mods and extras
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> so yes its my pc
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That sucks
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok, sorry I cant help, maybe someone else with deeper knowledge can help
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen, learath, heinrich maybe
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Dry Wall in task manager give DDNet client realtime priority
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and check what other programs are running and consuming resources
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @dee forgot how to give reltime priority sry
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> @deen
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't know, ask google
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably in task manager right click and priority -> realtime or something like that
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Krumplee restart PC(not shutdown, real restart), update drivers, try clean game config
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Restart your modem
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> okay thanks! will try this
21:55 <+ChillerDragon> try updating to 0.7 :p
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PINGUI> Oh my god, your my fuck*ng idol.
