00:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how is it called. we call it the "schick live standort bruder"
00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how to do that on discord

00:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> all these social media platforms store the metadata in their db and then strip it off :D

06:56 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i assume its currently a array. if so then you would need to change it to a vector to let it exspand
06:57 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also would make ddosing way easyer given they could just leave and reajoin a bunch on a bunch of ips instead of sending a gigabit/s of data

14:36 < bridge> <9ahl> ?
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> .
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> .
14:38 < bridge> <9ahl> yes he was kicked
14:38 < bridge> <9ahl> out of point and afk for too long if I remember correctly
14:45 < bridge> <9ahl> One of the requirement to apply to KoG is to reach the top200 leaderboard, ChillerDragon is currently at **4318** points whereas the top200 is currently at > **11 500** points 
14:45 < bridge> <9ahl> (and obviously afk for too long)
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> im sure a lot more people in kog are not top200 anymore xdd
14:51 < bridge> <teero777> at some point they were top200
14:54 < bridge> <9ahl> Yes it's being dealth with
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> wait whaaa
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> only 200 people are allowed in kog?
14:56 < bridge> <9ahl> KoG is a clan
14:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> its the King of Gores clan after all
14:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> makes sense
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> makes cents
14:56 < bridge> <9ahl> top 200 is just to apply
14:56 < bridge> <9ahl> you can be top1 and be rejected
14:56 < bridge> <9ahl> (which happened many times)
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> damn
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> haha how many times did top1 want to get into kog lmao
14:57 < bridge> <9ahl> you'd be surprised
14:57 < bridge> <9ahl> almost every top200 players applied over the years
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are females subtracted from the top200 count?
14:57 < bridge> <9ahl> they just forget that being friendly and a nice person is also a requirment
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know hwo to tell macos cc to use a dylib in a local directory
14:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> fuck you and your friendliness ahl! <a:Dance:799350877466787840><a:Dance:799350877466787840><a:Dance:799350877466787840>
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know in linux u can do
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> -a ./thing?
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> cc -l:./dylib
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> At what time? Runtime or compile time?
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt work on macos
14:58 < bridge> <9ahl> I should come more often in ddracenetwork server
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> cc -l:./myshit.dylib
14:58 < bridge> <9ahl> I'm not used to see people not in Tee Directory

14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller ask about kog in offtopic pls
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs they are queens of gores
15:00 < bridge> <9ahl> they have a "Queen of Gores ___ is here" when they join

15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using C to bench a program in my lang
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> wehn ddnet accounts solve the ukraine russia conflict, will kog switch? because making a kog account takes more time and effort than making ddnet accounts
15:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> IIRC avo said he will only switch if he has full control over it
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> works on linux
15:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> or something like that
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> not on macos
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> that is unfortunate
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> i want to play on kog servers
15:02 < bridge> <9ahl> You'd have to ask that to KoG admins, I'm the manager of the clan KoG, managing events and members the rest is not on my end
15:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> ok enough KoG talk in #developer
15:03 < bridge> <9ahl> yes sir
15:03 < bridge> <Solly (dum dum)> soreey melon
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Set the install name for your dylib to `@rpath/mylibname.dylib` using `install_name_tool`, then link to it with `-l @rpath/mylibname.dyliv`
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats this sorcery
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u give a example
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to use install_name_tool
15:05 < bridge> <teero777> @9ahl you would be losing like 50% of kog members if you actually enforced top200 xd
15:05 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349745061151375371/image.png?ex=67d4378b&is=67d2e60b&hm=5ebc59ae4a236d4d9badbca170a551e692c36873273b5f11a4d0b19db2f43c6f&
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> Well can you first check what the install name ends up being? Idk what rustc does. Do `otool -l ./mylibrary.dylib`
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> Look for `cmd LC_ID_DYLIB`
15:06 < bridge> <9ahl> let's talk about that in #off-topic
15:06 < bridge> <9ahl> this channel is not for kog related stuff
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> Load command 2
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki>           cmd LC_ID_DYLIB
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki>       cmdsize 48
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki>          name factorial_rs.dylib (offset 24)
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok this is rust one
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> the one from my lang is different
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> /Users/blabla/Documents/blabla/bench/factorial.dylib
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> ok, this is the issue, on mac libraries can only be linked to using their "install name" if you have an absolute install name, you have to link to the absolute path
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> why mine is full path
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can change the link behaviour
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing rustc either has a flag for it or if it doesn't expects you to change it with `install_name_tool` after
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> let args: Vec<_> = {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>         #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>         {
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>             let mut args = vec![
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 "-dynamic",
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 "-dylib",
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 "-mllvm",
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 "-L/usr/local/lib",
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 "-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib",
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>             ];
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>             args.extend(objects.iter().map(|x| x.as_str()));
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>             args.extend(&["-o", &output_filename, "-lSystem"]);
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>             args
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki>         }
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is what i do rn
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk why i add mllvm
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Is this calling llvm or sth?
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i removed it
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does nothing here
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> -mllvm is to pass args to llvm
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Whatever this is calling it might have a flag `-install_name`
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> it calls ld
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> -install_name name
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki>              Sets an internal "install path" (LC_ID_DYLIB) in a dynamic
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki>              library. Any clients linked against the library will record that
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki>              path as the way dyld should locate this library.  If this option
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki>              is not specified, then the -o path will be used.  This option is
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki>              also called -dylib_install_name for compatibility.
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> ld on macOS should have that flag, pass it and give it a relative path or an rpath relative path
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Try `-install_name mylib.dylib` first, that should be enough
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> (relative install names are not a great idea honestly, you usually want an rpath relative one)
15:14 < bridge> <learath2> Or an executable_path relative one if you only want this loaded from right next to the executable
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> So something like `-install_name @executable_path/libmylib.dylib` on the library and link with `-L. -lmylib`
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> People don't like that Mach-O deviated from linux in its linking but I honestly kinda like the way they did it with the special paths `@executable_path, @loader_path and @rpath`
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> mm but rn its not finding the rust one
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> wym "the rust one"?
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 2 dylibs
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> Load command 2
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>           cmd LC_ID_DYLIB
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>       cmdsize 48

15:17 < bridge> <learath2> does it find the "other one" now? and what install name did that one end up getting?
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm i prefer to use install name tool here
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont want to set install name for the compiler itself
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz this bench is a niche thing
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> Well you can set the install name with `install_name_tool -id 'whatever' libmylib.dylib`
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok that sets it but it doesnt find it
15:23 < bridge> <learath2> Can you show me the linker line?
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> install_name_tool -id "${name}_con.${libext}" "${name}_con.${libext}"
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki>     cc -march=native -mtune=native bench.c -L . -l:./"${name}_con".${libext} -l:./"${name}"_rs.${libext} -rpath . -o bench_"${name}"
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> install_name_tool -id "${name}_con.${libext}" "${name}_con.${libext}"
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> cc -march=native -mtune=native bench.c -L . -l:./"${name}_con".${libext} -l:./"${name}"_rs.${libext} -rpath . -o bench_"${name}"
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> without the :./ doesnt work either
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> And can you show me the error?
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill dm u

15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> omg
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> I like this guy
15:49 < bridge> <teero777> what is this abomination
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```c
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :- include(stdio).
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> int func main
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> { 
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     puts("Hello, world!");
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return 0
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> }.
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:49 < bridge> <avolicious> I am not Mr. KoG as I am just there to keep the servers running, no clan or player related stuff
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> where’s the accountability smh
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```c
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> int func main {
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     list[int] var my_ints = list[int]:new(17);
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     size_t var size = *(list[int]:capacity(my_ints));
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     for(int var i = 0; i < size; i += 1)
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     {
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>         list[int]:append(my_ints, i*i)
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     };
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     for(int var i = 0; i < size; i+= 1)
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     {
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>         printf("%d squared = %d.\n", i, list[int]:get(my_ints, i))
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     };
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki>     return 0
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> }.
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> just look it up it takes 5 sec
15:50 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: should've asked qshar
15:50 < bridge> <teero777> im sorry but that looks horrifying
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry. i cant actually do anything you see. it’s not my job you see
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> :nouis:
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> my manager just looked at our jira board in a zoom bcs i said i couldn’t find anything to do
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> we had one card in the backlog that was already done bcs of the way i originally wrote the thing 😭
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> this other company is fucking us so hard we cannot progress
15:52 < bridge> <Ewan> my manager just looked at our jira board in a zoom mtg w me bcs i said i couldn’t find anything to do
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> " i said i couldn’t find anything to do "
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> that is ur  first mistake
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> never do that
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the job world
15:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I was looking for a memory leak but found out of bounds access :feelsbadman:
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats worse
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> ASan support for your language when?
15:56 < bridge> <Ewan> well it was in standup so u get put on the spot
15:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's in ddnet codebase :kek:
15:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my language doesn't need tools
15:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it simply has to compile, it's enough for me
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> I basically woke up and looked at the board while everyone else was talking and i just said “ngl im looking at the board and im kinda stumped”
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> sadge
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> if it compiles it works
15:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> :gigachad:
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always try to go to the daily meetings ith atleast something done or saying im working on smth
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> same
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if i finished i already know the next thing
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> some social engineering
15:57 < bridge> <Ewan> u don’t understand how behind we are
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean u have a great point as well
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but that’s what ive been doing this whole time between now and when they were supposed to have delivered before
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u have other coworkers that are newer u can word stuff in a way that u let others do the tedious work
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> now we have worked past like every feature we possibly can without having this API functioning
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s been like over 6 weeks of these ppl dragging their feet
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but in this field, u can extend im working on x for a bit longer than other fields
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> because how abstract it is
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> no one can measure difficulty exactly
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> use that for ur advantage
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless its p obvious
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i guess in compiler dev its not
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yea lol
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not always as simple as we expect here but web dev is very different
16:00 < bridge> <avolicious> you can say this in compiler dev as well, no?
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i meant in compiler dev it may not be obvious if smth is easy or not
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur task is to write a test for X, maybe in web where u have already a big framework for it its obvious its ez and quick
16:01 < bridge> <avolicious> ah, but this applies to some webdev stuff as well
16:02 < bridge> <avolicious> Authentication & Authorization for example
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> u gotta test on ur smallest measurable components
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> testing auth is eh
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> my org now requires all commits to be signed with a valid key
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> which i already did forever
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> chad
16:02 < bridge> <avolicious> It should be enforced everywhere
16:03 < bridge> <avolicious> it has nice git integration and is built into
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> they already went militant with no password auth in cli
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i think enforcing PATs is good enough for most things
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> wats PATs
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> personal access token, you don’t need strict identity verification for hobby OSS projects on github
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> just to make sure that it’s not compromised
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and a token does that fine
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> we talking abotu commits tho
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
16:04 < bridge> <avolicious> just sign the commit
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyone can push a commit in ur name and email
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyone can push a commit using ur name and email
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> not if u have identity set up like that is what im saying
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> how does a personal access token prevent someone forging commits
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u dont use signatures
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> because it’s hopefully a unique token in use on only one device
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont mean a commit pushed by u
16:05 < bridge> <avolicious> Do you also Sign-off commits besides of signing them?
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it binds your email/name to ur gh account when you set it up right
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if we should start signing our commits and our releases
16:06 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
16:06 < bridge> <avolicious> Its basically just used for the linux kernel mostly 😄
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i dont
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> --signoff right?
16:07 < bridge> <avolicious> yeah
16:07 < bridge> <avolicious> or -s
16:07 < bridge> <avolicious> git commit -sS to sign off & sign
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think u cant set it up automatically
16:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean if it was as simple as i am describing code signing wouldn’t exist so there’s an added guarantee of accountability there, my point is just that it need not be enforced for all users
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> A 2-out-of-N signature for the final releases would be a decent idea to defend against a rogue dev or a stolen domain or a hacked server
16:09 < bridge> <avolicious> Using this during the deployment or within the pipeline?
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> For the final releases that get put on the downloads page
16:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Ah, yeah makes sense
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> and the auto updater can verify these too
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> so even if you aren't paying attention you'd be covered
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> so even if you aren't paying attention you'd be protected a bit
16:11 < bridge> <avolicious> But how would you distribute the trusted certificates?
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah the "bootstrapping problem"
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> The client can have the bundle, so after you download it once it's solved. The issue is verifying the original bundle, I guess we can do like debian and on our next meetup cross-sign eachothers keys 😄
16:13 < bridge> <avolicious> Setting up a legal entity, signing contracts
16:13 < bridge> <avolicious> There is a ddnet meetup?
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Was, we discussed many important things
16:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Or are you talking about the CCC thingy?
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> look at this very descriptive graphic
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349762538086203462/image.png?ex=67d447d2&is=67d2f652&hm=2c37655728250ab38e3b917e119aaccb6d379751f85098e65dba53c81266b55a&
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> proper
16:15 < bridge> <avolicious> Who was part of this meetup? 😄
16:15 < bridge> <avolicious> Chiller
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller is in canada
16:15 < bridge> <avolicious> It was recently?
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye like a few days ago
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> idk if the people who were there want others to know that they were there, idk the rules
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i saw lerato flying
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> I was there 😄
16:16 < bridge> <avolicious> I thought it was a meeting 😄
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> learath, me, robyt, jupstar, zwelf, patiga, metamufin
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich
16:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> can't meeting be secret meeting?
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> I guess ryozuki doesn't share the same concern 😄
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean ig
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> We discussed many important ddnet related things
16:17 < bridge> <avolicious> Meeting rules are sent upfront, so you know whats the deal
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ops
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that's why you let people sign nda
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean most ppl know they german knowing we met idk what psyops ppl can do
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> where was deen
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh deen too
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kek:
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> deen is very cool person
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> are you implying others are no as cool
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> are you implying others are not as cool
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> no all are cool tbh, it was rly nice to have a room full of good programmers
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'm certifiably uncool for being a C enjoyer
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> I felt discriminated against the whole time
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
16:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :GreemDev:
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> lot of rust projects
16:19 < bridge> <avolicious> Nice, so we finally migrate the codebase to rust
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> We should also look into code signing for the final releases I guess, maybe that'll help with the windows defender false positives we get from time to time
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> well jupstar is on its way
16:20 < bridge> <Ewan> would it
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> the pluggable physics he has is amazing
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm physics
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> module
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> u downlaod the physics from server and get instant free prediction
16:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to sign the binary itself for that to work iirc, with a real cert from a CA
16:20 < bridge> <Ewan> or u can buy one from azure iirc
16:20 < bridge> <learath2> they don't really document it, but I bet there is some level of trust factored in
16:21 < bridge> <avolicious> But then DDNet would step away from Teeworlds, no?
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> there is one provider that gives a nice price for open source projects
16:21 < bridge> <avolicious> I hope AGPL license
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah ddnet-rs breaks teeworlds compat
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also breaks ddnet compat
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @avolicious it also has rly nice stuff
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> like u can see other ppl skin on weapons
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> It very intentionally breaks all compatibility
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u keep ur own weapon skin
16:21 < bridge> <Ewan> if the game can play the same then i dont think anyone will care that much
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and skins can have custom death sounds
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and gun sounds
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> As long as people port all the mods to it yeah no one should care
16:22 < bridge> <avolicious> Will there be still custom servers or just ddnet servers then?
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> As long as people port all the mods to it yeah no one should notice even
16:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yea it was fun when i messed with it. only thing about it is, lots of edge cases still to be caught all around
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> That part is completely the same, a masterserver you can list your servers on
16:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> pluggable wasm physics implyes mod compat i think
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> next time i'll support u
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just amazed @jupeyy_keks did all this alone
16:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe schitzolion will add  ddnetdown to ddnetpp
16:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe schitzolion will add  ddnetdown to it
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> next meetup I'm inviting some old people that can protect the honor of C with me
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> nice
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 dont invite the guy that flames me for using agpl
16:23 < bridge> <avolicious> Is there any governance planned & released?
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> @totar u coming next time? xd
16:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think i could learning rust to a degree that i'm comfortable coding anything for ddnet-rs before it releaes
16:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think i could learn rust to a degree that i'm comfortable coding anything for ddnet-rs before it releaes
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie just learn a bit everyday
16:24 < bridge> <teero777> just learn as you go xd
16:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i learned c++ cuz ddnet
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i learnt c++ cuz ddnet
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> For ddnet-rs? Not that far ahead. I'd guess all the same rules from current ddnet would apply
16:24 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not implicitly challenging as long as u have google beside you, it literally just takes some time
16:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i just need to somehow learn how to only compile my rust code less than 10 times for 50 lines of code
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i ported a small cpp project to rust to get a handle on it
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> Your brain needs to tune into the borrow checker frequency
16:25 < bridge> <avolicious> Ah okay
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> one thing is maybe accounts are nearer
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> we just need QUIC
16:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> plus i don't have anything worth writing in rust other than that one tracker for teeworlds.cn
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich has some stuff nearly done iirc
16:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe godot-rust 1.0 could change ti
16:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe godot-rust 1.0 could change it
16:26 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah we figured out that accounts are quite close to actually being done, QUIC mostly works so we just need to motivate heinrich with good vibes to wrap it up
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> try teehistorian stuff
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the latest fad
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a secret thing in the meeting
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i wont tell
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz its secret
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
16:26 < bridge> <Ewan> secretive
16:27 < bridge> <learath2> secret thing from the meeting is a secret
16:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that ryo just ratted everyone out
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> 🐀
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> where is konsti lately
16:27 < bridge> <Ewan> if i went & was there present for convo i would probably want ppl to know i was there
16:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> lmao
16:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349765926438043648/image.png?ex=67d44afa&is=67d2f97a&hm=df4644d4e6d003025c323c06d46ce91b80588c0701493b34d34e78b956c3840f&
16:27 < bridge> <Ewan> if i went & wasn’t present for this convo i would probably want ppl to know i was there
16:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i got DMCAd
16:28 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
16:28 < bridge> <Ewan> first time?
16:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> actually yes
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmaoi
16:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Code signing should help. We could also preemptively upload releases to virustotal and then manually to AV vendors with false positives :justatest:
16:28 < bridge> <avolicious> But its actually nice that you managed to setup a meeting 😄
16:28 < bridge> <avolicious> But its actually nice that you managed to setup a meeting 😄 & you had a great time
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> Not a bad idea actually
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> Should I create an issue for it so we can discuss it?
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was kinda nervous
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> or perhaps maybe there is an issue already
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> I remember talking about signing before
16:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> AC related?
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie what did u get dmcaed
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ac?
16:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> switch emulator
16:29 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, sounds good, I don't think we have an issue about making releases more trusted yet
16:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> anticheat
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> I already deleted & remade my fork of the project based on someone’s gitlab archive but 2020 was fun <https://github.com/clownacy/cse2>
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> about what?
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> meeting
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> im kinda shy :owo:
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i envy u cuz u know german
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish i could speak fluidly more

16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
16:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i still got that domain
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a hetzner notice
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> for shady stuff
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz someone used it with weird stuff
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i deleted it
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
16:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh well
16:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349767092550762538/image.png?ex=67d44c10&is=67d2fa90&hm=85ff7211d97a5d3341d921eb0298747db4e3af827e068ec5f62d8057ddb086e5&
16:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> learath2 can't even read it now
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats this project
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> was it one of those reflection attacks
16:32 < bridge> <Ewan> or non ddnet
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> no, they used the short url on ilegal webs i think
16:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it's just shazam
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> oh is that teel.ink
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> makes sense :brownbear:
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft how much does a flight from ur place to barcelona cost
16:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> for teehistorian
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not sure, I would need a passport as well though
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> does anyone want teel.ink for anything tho
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i still have it and idk what to do with it
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/138424
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> this is too rust for me to understand
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> trait MyTrait {
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fn foo() -> impl Future<Output = ()>;
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> fn bar<T>(_: &T)
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> where
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki>     T: MyTrait,
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki>     T::foo(..): Send
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> {}
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 it fixes the problem of requiring impl Future to always have a Send bound
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can specify it at the use site
16:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> do you still want the invite for the thing i've DMed you or you decided you don't care
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> instead of the trait
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > we currently lack the ability for users to declare bounds on the anonymous types returned by such functions at the usage site. This is often referred to as the Send bound problem, since it commonly affects futures which may only conditionally be Send depending on the executor that they are involved with.
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Return type notation gives users an intuitive way to solve this problem.
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> async-trait crate here always added a +Send bound
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> because some executors require Send
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> like the work stealing one from tokio
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i looked on expedia and anything within the next 4 months is ~$700
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> round trip
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> tho there are ways around that like booking later & not flying directly
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> tho there are ways around that like booking for later & not flying directly
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> I do care, idk why I keep forgetting it, my brain doesn't seem to work all that well anymore
16:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> reinvited
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
17:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> wtf
17:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> so you can like, input a demo and itll rummage through the entirety of teehistorian to find a matching demo?
17:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> no comment on that yet
17:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> cuz idk what's the scope for it yet

17:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl what do you mean by afk? I do still play kog. I have my account migrated since forever. Check my login logs. Does loosing rank 200 really get you kicked? Will the other kog members be kicked too?
17:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl why was i not informed that i have been kicked? I have been running around with the clantag all the time
17:39 < bridge> <9ahl> You are welcome to come into my dm’s for a more detailed explanation
17:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki there is no bridge to offtopic
17:40 < bridge> <9ahl> Why not have a discord account ?
17:40 < bridge> <9ahl> Feels weird to be discussing KoG related stuff in the wrong channel on the wrong discord
17:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl i am still waiting for kog to add a bridge but yes its a bit weird
17:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> "muh data"
17:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl lets meet in game?
17:44 < bridge> <9ahl> Sure
17:44 < bridge> <9ahl> I’ll be home in around 30min
17:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oof
17:45 < bridge> <hectavoxel> gigachad emoji is so corny
17:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> in general
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
17:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @teero777 wtf are you generating in vc
17:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i see deepseek in thumbnail
17:48 < bridge> <teero777> repetetive code i am generating
17:58 < bridge> <9ahl> alright I'm online on kog, come
18:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I don't think my Bluetooth headphones works properly on mobile discord
18:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
18:04 < bridge> <9ahl> I won't have time later, come
18:04 < bridge> <teero777> he doesnt see replies btw
18:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ChillerDragon:
18:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Maybe I should stream my project too so I don't slack
18:06 < bridge> <louis> how
18:06 < bridge> <9ahl> he does
18:06 < bridge> <teero777> bro he is on irc xd
18:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Idk. I was in vc for awhile I don't think they heard me very well
18:07 < bridge> <louis> oh
18:07 < bridge> <louis> i always rage when bluetooth headphones go into call mode
18:07 < bridge> <9ahl> he answered back from a message in offtopic tho
18:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Or I'm just too quiet cuz mom's asleep
18:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> he checks matrix way less than irc.
18:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> That's his personality
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> Chillers personality is not using discord
18:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> And being under no roof
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> and international drug trafficing or sth
18:10 < bridge> <louis> i wish i could not use discord easily
18:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I wish I am ballsy enough to troll in vc. Cuz I can't even talk without anxiety creep

18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @9ahl: I said oof because now I’m outside
18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I try to find a tw client sec
18:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> "yo bro can i have your phone for a few minutes, i need to have a discussion"
18:44 < bridge> <9ahl> I'm not online anymore, will be later tonight
18:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ok im here @9ahl 
18:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i didnt find u
18:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl go join SECRET TESTS server pw is 123
18:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ong omg
18:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy who else is streaming?
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> are you referring to the big streamer age with milkeeycat and jupstar back in 2024?
18:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> or modern melon type shit streaming? or did i miss a new event?
18:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> WDYM MODERN MELON TYPE SHIT
18:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> :VAngy:
19:09 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> just trying to figure out how fred suddenly thinks about streaming. What made him think about it.
19:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> he gifted me a sub yesterday!
19:19 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh i see
19:21 < bridge> <9ahl> can't find that server
19:25 < bridge> <imilchshake> YES PLS
19:26 < bridge> <9ahl> I'm there
19:26 < bridge> <9ahl> not gonna wait forever tho
19:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> nice
19:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @9ahl ping me next time im not here
19:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> im there now
19:45 < bridge> <9ahl> now
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 btw, when only array length is set, it's still possible to initialize less elements:
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```cpp
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     static const char *s_apTest[100] = {
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         "only one element kek",
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     };
19:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, I guess `static_assert`s are better then
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> he doesn’t, he just has the IRC intuition
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no mechanism to see replies in irc
19:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can "ping" him on matrix by typing ChillerDragon or Chiller tho iirc
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> iirc irc is really cocky
19:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ._.
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it probably wont
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> on nixos i have headset unit mode disabled & it’s only a playback sink
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> because if it enters duplex mode then it probably will fall back on SBC to get both streams of data where they need to be
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah on phone the only solution i have ever had to shitty headset issues was buying the headset for the phone
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> need some fancy aptX headphones for androids to do it & AAC for an iPhone
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah on phone the only solution i have ever had to shitty headset issues on a phone was buying the headset for the phone
20:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve also had the mic just not work but that’s all in discord’s domain of control & you can hardly rely on them for literally anything
20:02 < bridge> <Assa> uh I have a project build on raylib, can I ask you in the future for issues I experience? 🙈
20:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> teero was streaming in discord vc
20:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ do you still change fng2?
20:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i have some pending prs there
20:31 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I had to afk for a while but I did read all your messages @9ahl thanks for clarifying sad that there is nothing that can be done. But it all makes sense now.
20:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I removed the clantag so its official now. https://github.com/ChillerTW/GitSettings/commit/7f1e951811c90aca94fb83abfc5e6610a2fb0406
20:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: join `DDNet` clan xd
20:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think i might create a battle fly clan
20:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> something like DragonFlight in memory of the best clan DragonFight
20:34 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I was more proud of the KoG clantag than it is cool to admit. And I am sad that it ended like that. But its also cool to be available again for clans.
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In which sense
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> that is lame
20:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: just become top200 and ask to join again
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> they get to use your dozens of gores maps and you get nothing in return
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> not even a notification that you were kicked lol
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> kog administration seems severely lacking in the executive department
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i will not go back to kog. First of all i will not reach top200 and i am now too upset to reapply. Getting kicked without being notified after so many years is not nice.
20:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ pinged u here https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/pull/327#discussion_r1994192607
20:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye :feelsbadman:
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> this just reinforces my belief. kog sucks
20:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont like having differently called fng configs that do the same thing
20:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i would send a pr but my last few prs are unresponded to since september
20:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats why i ask
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you really made useful prs?
20:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> useful
20:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
20:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its me after all
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> both to the 0.7 branch
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so useless
20:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ok if i send a 0.6 pr to rename a config what do you think?
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you also ssh into my vps to fix the configs there
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i name them false spike quite often
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. sv_team_score_false
20:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> well maybe we should first talk about the naming before we do sshing
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe the naming even is from openfng
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can't remember
20:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> do you like the word false?
20:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> to me the word "wrong" sounds more correct but im also not a native
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, idc ig xD
20:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no opinion on it at all?
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> absolulutely not
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> absolutely not
20:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> because its C++ or because its english?
20:42 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> or because both sound good to you?
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i simply don't care
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask chatgpt what the best is
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and take that
20:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont trust chatgpt with that
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll post your msg
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ask if it agrees
20:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its all flawed
20:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its a text generation model you can prompt it in any direction
20:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its not a "good decison making" model
20:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so you still in 2025 say ``sv_false_spike_freeze`` sounds good @Jupstar ✪ ?
20:44 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> then there is no need for a pr
20:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> then i will simply take the same in ddnet-insta and we match
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> false or wrong spike is basically the same for me
20:45 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan help
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> incorrect_spikes
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
20:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you spike in enemy spikes and get punished with freeze for it how should the config be called that determines the amount of seconds @Ewan 
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how about sv_penalty_spike
20:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> is ``sv_false_spike_freeze`` and ``sv_wrong_spike_freeze`` equally correct?
20:46 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> sounds like the spike gives a penalty
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad_spike
20:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> bad bot
20:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> omg he ignores me?
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad bot
20:47 < bridge> <DDNet> :(
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> discrimnation once a again
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are discriminating yourself
20:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i rly need a new discord with a bridge to avoid spamming ddnet developer. fng and kog are only borderline on topic
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad bot
20:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> :(
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> honestly just use discord in browser
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even works on phone
20:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i rather use matrix
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then do that xD
20:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no its horrible
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then invite everyone you want to talk to to canada
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> full cost
20:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> lets solve the fng thing here. Will be quick once ewan is back and i open my own discord this summer!
20:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> jupstar i had nothing booked to spend the night when i arrived you do not want to know how much money that stunt cost me
20:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> also the immigrations lady was giving me a really hard time. They made me wait 4 hours in some room because i had no destination address for them.
20:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i am full broke now
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you cannot convince me someone wants to travel to canada
20:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats what she said
20:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its cold
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did you visist linus tech tips
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what are u even doing in canada
20:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> haha not yet
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fighting polar bears?
20:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i also realized that 2 days ago he here
20:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i always thought he is in the us somehow
20:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no polar bears here
20:53 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> omg where is Ewan
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in canada probs
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> montreal is like almost usa
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how boring
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought u somewhere in the north
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i was in the shower
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> whatsup
21:06 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan read the log how to name the config and which is better
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> what’s a false/wrong spike
21:07 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i wrote it all omagawd dont make me respam the wall of text
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the imposter spikes
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i see u discussing it but not a description of what the feature actually is
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> granted i’m on phone
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a player gets frozen, if he grabbed a frozen opponent into the opponents spikes
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wrong spikes prob
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> opposing team spikes
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe just sv_opponent_spike_freeze
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xddd now what chiller
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> false/wrong isn’t vague bcs of the word, it’s bcs of context
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> they’re equally correct imo but when talking about teams i’d tend towards wrong bcs there’s no true team, just the one you’re on
21:19 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if wrong is only a bit better than false and jupstar doesnt care at all we can also keep it as is and i will use the same name
21:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ or do you feel like changing it?
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i still dont care xD
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just name it for your mod as you want
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> create an alias if u want to support both
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u want to pr it, make sure false is nowhere used
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also not in fng.cfg
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and don't expect me to review
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> such a cold maintainer
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think that's a fair trade. i click merge, but chiller has to be careful xd
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway i still think opponent is the best word here even if it’s a few more characters
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i would rather have to type 3 more characters and be sure of the function than have ambiguous ones. and since i didn’t immediately understand what the existing cfg item was based off its name, maybe that’s needed
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but the q is if a person that doesn't know it's usage would understand wrong less than opponent
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ig if you really want to make it intuitive you have to use an even longer name
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sv_sacrifised_into_opponent_spikes_freeze_time_in_seconds
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sv_sacrifised_into_opponent_spikes_penalty_freeze_time_in_seconds
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> sv_freeze_actor_on_opponent_spikes_kill
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh it’s in seconds? thought it was a bool
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> even worse 😂
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> this is literally how i write things out so i see the humor but yes i agree
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> just learn to fingers fast
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you what
21:51 < bridge> <teero777> he fingers fast
22:06 < bridge> <Ewan> only a 15 minute delay
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or you are not as fast as you say 😏
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 15 min, no?

22:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dev chat is getting oddly spicy
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349852148351107093/IMG_7747.jpg?ex=67d49b47&is=67d349c7&hm=12c90867306830356c0a84f46ccde5b4dc6607e710860385716ac0ab20c9767e&
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we were talking about fng
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i blame chiller
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349852186267619501/IMG_7748.jpg?ex=67d49b50&is=67d349d0&hm=723604e2a00204558169340b39922f1b7cc3df7aa2f493afe4831611b60c6732&
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> im out with the dogs
22:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> fng is so fun
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro you have quite some nice landscape
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mountains
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> snow
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> colorado is known for this
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just that non americans lump it into USA and stop paying attention
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but yea it’s why i am so conflicted in leaving this place xd
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> on one hand my government is functionally shutting itself down, on the other hand it’s work to move
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nature has smth that big cities cannot give you
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i would prob leave the country if i moved
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to where
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> canada is a pretty obvious choice
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't forget to visit chiller
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> similar landscapes in the yukon, free healthcare, same timezones
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> free healthcare? how does that work
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> high taxes
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i’d need to be naturalized or w/e tho
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s always more complex than it sounds
22:15 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ are your configs open source? or how do i do the careful sshing part?
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah just the default config in repo
22:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> do you use defaults?
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont modify these values somewhere
22:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> gangster
22:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1741900594.png
22:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> lemme quote my self
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> also strongly considering germany but i fear the americaphobia there would be too much
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a pretty respected place in the u.s.
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont think that is real
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe not phobia
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but aversion/prejudice
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in the view of germans only 50% of americans are stupid af, so all fine
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> if we could just be rid of the stupid that would be great
22:20 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> in my bubble americans are welcomed
22:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> we dont bully them
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> but we have designed our society to be reliant on them instead of encouraging them to better themselves
22:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but go to canada instead there you can buy legal weed!
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> which is real and possible for the VAST MAJORITY of them
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i am trying to stop weed tho
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s making it so i never really get rem sleep
22:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> then go to germany
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> never really get to reflect in idle moments
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s bad
22:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> germany is goat for healthcare
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> almost like it’s a worthy investment or something
22:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but tbh i have the feeling scandinavian places are the best 
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd recomment netherlands, sweden or finnland tbh
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are all pretty modern
22:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> lol josspit same thought
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> netherlands is close to germany if you want to visit it
22:23 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> quitting weed -> netherlands
22:23 < cantfindme> finland healthcare seems good
22:23 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> wowo ircer
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and their super markets allow to checkout by yourself xdd
22:24 < ChillerDragon> we have the same in germany
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes
22:24 < ChillerDragon> i hate it
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but slowmany always behind
22:24 < ChillerDragon> i pay for the human service!
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's better than going to the cash register
22:24 < ChillerDragon> i refuse to feed money to a machine
22:24 < ChillerDragon> computers were a mistake
22:24 < ChillerDragon> i want to hand my physical money to a human hand
22:25 < cantfindme> i thought all countries had self checkout machines?
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only place i know in my city is rossmann xdd
22:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how is rossmann not bankrupt yet?
22:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how did it survive schlecker and tengelmann?
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i pay for their service to self checkout
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you are right
22:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how now we reached offtopic i will go afk sorry #developers
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's essentially the same
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> np good bye
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i rq too
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> all seems like a good idea
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> when envisioning places to move i have northern Europe in my head in a cluster
22:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nordics used to be peak now we kinda mid
22:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or well, Finland and Sweden at least
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i have had self checkout at my grocery store for like 10+ years
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they actually keep the service lanes closed entirely unless there’s super high traffic
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> much cheaper to have an idiot watch over & make sure they don’t steal than to have as many people as there are registers on staff, doing somewhat intensive work
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> plus ppl are so antisocial now
22:44 < bridge> <learath2> Have any of you used Automa before? It's quite cool when you have a batch task in the browser that's annoying to do
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> what is it?
22:44 < bridge> <learath2> This is my humble bundle redeem script, it goes through all rewards, claims all steam ones, logs failed ones with their reasons
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349860823623008287/image.png?ex=67d4a35b&is=67d351db&hm=cb5f0452100723dd6a511dd2b20eedfe785ffea0551b7d1f70296d156866425f&
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
22:46 < bridge> <learath2> gives me tables like these
22:46 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349861079899177060/image.png?ex=67d4a398&is=67d35218&hm=6bccd7a81ac424d3581c03b526e04f436eb9e6bc9d081576086b05af11346249&
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> is it like integration testing with a gui
22:46 < bridge> <learath2> It's basically autohotkey with access to browser internals, so you can click on stuff by css selectors or xpaths
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> You can do stuff like loop through all elements that match a css selector, it can also take screenshots, so you could build a diff based test for your website with it
22:49 < bridge> <learath2> Also I have a soft spot for this kind of node based programming, so it's perfect for me 😄
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> that is cool
23:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I mean I guess but I'm not like an expert
23:35 < bridge> <Bota> I have somne weird behaviour with DDNet and Windows
23:36 < bridge> <Bota> Only when ddnet opened - Some parts of my screen get "frozen" I notice this often in dicrod when i scroll chats. The application is static, I wait a bit and it works again
23:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ do you want me to also rename ``pKiller->m_Stats.m_GrabsFalse`` to ``pKiller->m_Stats.m_GrabsWrong``?
23:37 < bridge> <Bota> Also other applications "Freeze"
23:37 < bridge> <Bota> Its kinda getting annoying
23:37 < bridge> <Bota> Id appreciate some help

23:39 < bridge> <Bota> my gpu
23:40 < bridge> <Bota> And I can tell its ddnet, beceause i have a fresh windows install
23:40 < bridge> <Bota> 1 hour olkd
23:40 < bridge> <Bota> 1 hour old
23:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Which fullscreen mode are you using? Have you tried a different mode?
23:40 < bridge> <Bota> Right now Windowed fullscreen
23:41 < bridge> <Bota> I can try a diffrent mode
23:41 < bridge> <Bota> Tho idk how to reliably reproduce the issue, it kinda happens random
23:41 < bridge> <Bota> ig i can test for a day and see
23:46 < bridge> <Bota> ima go sleep now ill test diffrent modes the next day, then i will get back to you
23:46 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, try different fullscreen modes and also with Vulkan/OpenGL
23:46 < bridge> <Bota> k
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> europeans, if u wouldnt mind sharing, what is average cost of living in your areas
23:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there was a nice website for this but it's probably not super accurate due to all the stuff happening recently
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont just wanna poke around random cities idont know on those sites tho
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i looked up some countries of interest and the cost of living calculator made them seem reasonable but that's not reliable data rly
23:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Cost of living is at least close to reasonable *everywhere*
23:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> otherwise people wouldn't be able to live
23:59 < bridge> <Ewan> not true
