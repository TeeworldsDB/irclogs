18:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't know if you missed message but: <quinerr> hi, i'm curious about the use of config_retrieve/config_store/dilate/map_diff/map_extract/etc. do I need to put them into some packages?
18:50 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> don't understand that question
18:51 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> they are tools for mappers or people who run ddnet servers
18:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's not the guy from debian or smth ?
19:15 <@deen> I don't know
19:16 <@deen> I guess you could package as ddnet-server, ddnet-client, ddnet-graphics-tools, ddnet-map-tools if you want to
19:25 <@Nimda> WSMS by Element Finland just released on Solo at 2017-09-15 19:23
19:56 <+eeeee> don't mappers need a local server to test their maps during development? might make sense to just package tools with server in that case.
20:22 <+Ryozuki> eeeee, they also have this option https://trashmap.timakro.de/
21:32 <+eeeee> but they still have to upload the map manually there, right? local server has auto reload when you edit the map i think.
21:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> let's make external map editor
21:42 <+eeeee> why? i've heard mappers wanting better integration of editor and client instead (like keeping the tee at the same position instead of respawning at the start on map reload)
21:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> also extrenral programs throw sharing violations if the map is running in server
