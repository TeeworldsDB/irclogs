00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> is there a way to increase server side or client side the number of calls to "OnSnapInput " ?
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I think you can send twice as many snaps as is usual by turning on `sv_high_bandwidth` (or similar)
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> great option! thanks!
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> why does that say "LAN use only" in the tooltip
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's not a useful tradeoff I guess
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> its useful with bad ping or pocket loss. true ?
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'll make things worse if the client is limited by bandwidth
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'm not sure how realistic that is

02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 i propose we use a hash thats faster then sha256 maybe even sacrifice cryptographic swcurity atleast under attack
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blake2b is faster and cryptosecure
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something like the metrohash is an order of magnitude faster
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @xy0 these CNET variables are not defined in the source those are  generated by some python scripts in datasrc like network.py it will create a new source folder in the cmake build folder. So it usually builds fine but during development it can show be tricky to check the definition of those and they might show up as errors.

10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Rip irc
13:14 <@heinrich5991> @Learath2 faster hashs are a good idea
13:14 <@heinrich5991> didn't do it at the time because sha256 was already available
13:15 <@heinrich5991> sacrificing security under attack is counter-productive; that's especially the time when it matters
13:15 <@heinrich5991> otherwise the protection against reflection attacks is pointless
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> Ah okay I see, thanks @ChillerDragon
17:10 <+breton> so... https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1967 was marked as done. What should happen next? The server is still not in the list
17:41 <@deen> breton: sorry, fixed
17:41 <@deen> I added it on the wrong server
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just so that ddosers can attack it
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> infclass on ddnet :tee_thinking:
17:51 <+breton> deen: yey, it works now, thank you!
