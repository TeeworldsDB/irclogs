01:10 <@Nimda> DontMove by =xPeke= just released on Solo at 2016-10-23 01:08
01:46 <+Ryozuki> wtf?
01:46 <+Ryozuki> Who released it?
01:47 <+Ryozuki> oh didn't saw forum xD
02:00 <+Songoku> kps=kilo packet per s... i think
11:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: is it intentional that the normal chat sound in ddnet is the loud one?
11:20 <@heinrich5991> used in vanilla for highlight
11:40 <+Ryozuki> yeah, sometimes it get's annoying
11:40 <+Ryozuki> specially with 64p chating
13:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #565: Swap normal and highlight chat sound (master...pr_swap_chat_and_hilite) https://git.io/vPb6z
14:50 <@deen> heinrich5991: well, in vanilla they switched it around
14:50 <@deen> at some point, but originally they had it exactly like we do
14:55 <+Henningstone> what about an option? Maybe some people like it the way it is...
14:58 <@deen> sure, just switch around the sound files in your ~/.teeworlds/audio
14:58 <@heinrich5991> it could be reverted by renaming the files
14:58 <@heinrich5991> not sure if the autoupdater interferes
14:58 <@deen> only if the files ever change
14:59 <@deen> anyway, i made that change 2 years ago or so, why are you guys noticing now? :D
14:59 <@heinrich5991> because I tried out the ddnet client again, and that's the thing I noticed most
14:59 <@heinrich5991> so I'm probably biased towards the vanilla variant
15:00 <+Henningstone> funny, that is the thing I noticed most when I tried out vanilla again :D
15:00 <@heinrich5991> mh
15:00 <+Henningstone> It's just a thing of getting used to something I guess...
15:00 <@heinrich5991> but... it kinda makes sense to have the loud sound for highlights, right? :)
15:01 <+Henningstone> totally :) Anyhow, I always though someone just highlighted me whenever a chatmessage came in ^^
17:55 <@Nimda> Aimlicious by Aoe just released on Brutal at 2016-10-23 17:52
18:01 <+Ryozuki> released it
18:01 <+Ryozuki> and a ddos attack appeared
18:02 <+Ryozuki> so :(
19:15 <@deen> Ryozuki: yeah, like always
19:16 <@deen> anyone have experiences with myloc.de and serverbiz.de or other suggestions for ddos protections in germany?
19:18 <+Ryozuki> ovh has nice ddos protection
19:18 <+Ryozuki> and, never used that pages, not german 
19:45 <@deen> ovh never worked for us
19:45 <@deen> server was unusable with every single dos attack
19:45 <@deen> i mean ovh blocked my ip when i pressed f5 in browser, how useless is that?
19:46 <@heinrich5991> when you held down f5?
19:47 <@deen> nope
19:47 <@deen> just a single refresh loading 30 pngs and bam, ip banned for 5 min
19:52 <@heinrich5991> what
20:03 <@deen> that's their ddos protection apparently
20:08 <@heinrich5991> mhmh
20:08 <@heinrich5991> great
20:13 <+Ryozuki> mm
