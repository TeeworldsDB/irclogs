00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ```Some programmers once asked Guido van Rossum whether 
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Python would ever support braces. Since that day, braces have 
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> been available through a __future__ import:
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> >>> from __future__ import braces
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki>   File "<stdin>", line 1
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> SyntaxError: not a chance```
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i found this funny xD
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol

16:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #975: Add feature to disable votes when a mod joins (master...dd_pr_moderate) https://git.io/vbjH8
18:10 <+nemo2> yeah, it's that kinda attitude that irritates me most about python
18:10 <+nemo2> "there's only one right way to do things, and it is guido's way"
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the voting code looks horrible ðŸ˜¦
18:20 <+nemo2> interesting feature request
18:20 <+nemo2> I don't think we even block people from kicking me when I have mod powers. 
18:20 <+nemo2> much less block votes
18:21 <+Learath2> you probably don't have half the trolls we have :P
18:21 <+Learath2> funvotes pass so quickly mods can't stop them sometimes
18:25 <+nemo2> Learath2: we have a few very persistent ones
18:25 <+nemo2> Learath2: they got pretty bad. but...
18:25 <+nemo2> Learath2: I dunno. I think they got tired of it.
18:25 <+nemo2> Learath2: also, we allowed players to flag nicks as "enemies" that would autokick once they joined a room
18:25 <+Learath2> I really feel like rewriting the vote counting code, but I can't really test it alone
18:25 <+nemo2> only works if you're the room controller tho
18:26 <+nemo2> I guess the difference is you guys don't have the "room admin" vs "server admin" since all the rooms are servers
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @Learath2 Write a sandbox for unit testing it
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> So you can simulate having players on the server voting something specific
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> (not sure how realistic in ddnet code though)
18:41 <+Learath2> I don't think we have the unit testing framework in place for it
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> i think heinrich added some unit tests
18:42 <+Learath2> how about I write sth reasonable looking and we test it on the servers? :D
18:42 <+nemo2> wow. you guys *are* organised
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nemo2: it's more how I wish it would be, not how it really is, haha
18:42 <+nemo2> https://hg.hedgewars.org/hedgewars/file/tip/tests/lua  these are the only tests we have...
18:42 <+Learath2> I'd need an entire working CGameContext instance to test it the way heinrich did it
18:43 <+Learath2> nemo2: we are slowly adding tests for the new components tho
18:43 <+nemo2> oh.. unc0rr has some server stress tests come to think of it
18:43 <+nemo2> but that's it
18:43 <+nemo2> nothing that could be considered a unit test
18:43 <+nemo2> unless you define the "unit" as "the entire engine"
18:44 <+Learath2> I'll just write something reasonable and test it with a couple people
18:44 <+nemo2> lol. that's usually our approach too ðŸ˜‰
18:44 <+nemo2> Learath2: I checked in something to hash-check lua scripts recently, and thought I had it working, until a german player joined
18:45 <+Learath2> :)
18:45 <+nemo2> just fortunate he actually joined. or it would have gone into release crashing the german localisation
18:55 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: welp. I think I'm going to prune my server list
18:55 <+nemo2> I'm literally just hanging out on this server due to ddnet
18:55 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: see you in irc://irc.freenode.net/hedgewars irc://irc.freenode.net/ddnet
18:56  * nemo2 waves
22:38 <+Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/aed21dea this isn't too easy :P
