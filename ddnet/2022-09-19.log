00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> On practice it is also one of the reasons why someone does not update to newest version (personally I don't agree on this but).
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The users of previous versions have no troubles, they had all servers in the list.
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I can't find the words to say what I think about the attackers (maybe they need some medicine) but we have what we have.
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think this is a reason not to upgrade
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is the first time we had such big problems
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with the backward compatibility
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the attacker would probably be glad if we were to switch back to the old master servers as they're a lot easier to attack
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they don't have protection from reflection attacks e.g.
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and they can collect player ips for more effective attacks against servers
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also instead of us reverting to the more vulnerable protocol, why not encourage 95% of the other hosters to migrate to the new one?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We'd need an easy diff for them to apply
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, that'd be great. unfortunately, it's no easy diff because the mods don't have libcurl, I think
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I can hack something together
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess somoene has to do it against vanilla tw (0.6?) and then hopefully the diff will apply well to most mods
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Just give like 1 year to people to implement https registering to their gamemode (with some help maybe?) And maybe do not support 0.6 anymore + implement it in 0.7
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> If not already
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen you said we needed 1 more reference for the ddnet wikipedia article right?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this it?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I doubt it

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Use Python
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I don't know what you want to do but Python should be the best and most easiest way I guess
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> it's kinda react
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> :D
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> frontend
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check the console, does it have any errors?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> yep
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> D:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe the errors can tell you what's wrong
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> read them ^^

18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please post errors the next time you ask ^^
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's an error that has to be fixed server-side
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> will u change something on server side. or i have to find other ways? :D
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> changed

18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> yea
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> also i want to have own servers there
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, nice 🙂 sounds complicated too, though ^^

20:14 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like some application uses up so much cpu that my whole system freezes for like 10 minutes. Nothing works anymore not even moving da mouse :c
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nais vscode in fast
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wot
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vscode is in typescript
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so this has potential to be faster than vscode
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it looks like vscode xd
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> vscode faster than vscode?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that vscode or what
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> aah well ur msg wasn't clear
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> vscode uses electron
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> which is known to be memory consuming, and slow I think
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> vscode is the fastest and slickest electron app i know by far
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah its pretty well made true, but rust is still faster
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> @heinrich5991 are there any news with the wireshark-dissector?

21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> only cause vali my friend i ddos? bro u just ddos my home wlan
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> i dont understand how you can have such an big server

21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you need therapy xD
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> It's like blocking in a server. If someone blocks you it's not the right thimg to block back.
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel dont even argue with him please, we have enough proofs :)
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Eh, alright
