00:44 < bridge> <APFFF> Does the Server know when you are spectating someone?
00:45 < bridge> <highlightwf> Ye
01:01 < bridge> <APFFF> Does the server know exactly who is specing who?
01:02 < bridge> <furo> Yes
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> otherwise you would not be able to see the tees unless you did /showall
02:07 < bridge> <teero777> This would work if the client only sent the camera position. But it also sends the id of who you are speccing. I think that was the question
02:07 < bridge> <teero777> Even tho you could check that even if the client didn't send any info about who they're speccing
02:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> #someone4president
02:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we start a vote to make SP | Someone ddnet admin?
03:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think chiller can see the vote
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> current standings are 5/1 in his favor
05:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
06:15 < bridge> <art0007i> anyone know why there is a `-1` at the end of these 2 lines? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/render_map.cpp#L591-L592
06:15 < bridge> <art0007i> 
06:15 < bridge> <art0007i> it just seems to make things look weird in my opinion because it cuts off 1 pixel from the edge of the tile

07:31 < bridge> <zhn> cuz old mapres were shifted :justatest: afair
07:31 < bridge> <zhn> any experts of tile render there
07:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> patiga is pro
07:32 < bridge> <zhn> chiller does my pr affect any existing mod?
07:32 < bridge> <zhn> because now id predefines tunes for all mods
07:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think so
07:32 < bridge> <zhn> it*
07:32 < bridge> <zhn> and my pr makes it only for ddrace and ddnet
07:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not sure i would have to test it
07:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so many things to think about 
07:34 < bridge> <zhn> if you have time and will pls
07:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also why u ignore ma comment xd
07:34 < bridge> <zhn> because i couldn't figure out how ur issue connects with my pr
07:34 < bridge> <zhn> what exactly is wrong
07:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then ignore the issue and only respond to the question
07:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is tunes ddrace tiles
07:35 < bridge> <zhn> because if server wants to predict ddrace tiles its supposedly ddrace based
07:35 < bridge> <zhn> and needs these tunes to operate
07:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i disagree
07:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gun curvature and speedups are two different things
07:36 < bridge> <zhn> but now it does affect all mods
07:36 < bridge> <zhn> what do you want, to remove ddrace tiles check?
07:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why have PredictDDrace and PredictDDraceTiles if tiles does not mean tiles
07:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn well as proposed in the issue i might even want a PredictDDraceTunes flag :p 
07:37 < bridge> <zhn> i want to fix vanilla demos, not to make another protocol entry xd
07:37 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder how it works good in game and doesnt in demos
07:37 < bridge> <zhn> something is wrong
07:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but why did you add predicttiles whats the use case?
07:38 < bridge> <zhn> if server sent no predict ddrace but predict ddrace tiles xd
07:38 < bridge> <zhn> why would u need to predict ddrace tiles and not to have default ddnet tunes
07:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which server does that? and why does that mean that the tunes are ddrace based?
07:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn ddnet-insta
07:38 < bridge> <zhn> also it affects only demos
07:39 < bridge> <zhn> do u send predict ddrace tiles in ddnet insta?
07:39 < bridge> <zhn> i would 1 tick freeze by prediction if u did
07:39 < bridge> <zhn> on health pickup touch
07:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well yea thats what https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8923 is about
07:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> currently vanilla weapons plus ddrace tiles such as speedups and stoppers is a mess to get predicted correctly
07:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your pr looks like it would make it even worse and i dont see the use case
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> why would u need speeders and stoppers in vanilla xd
07:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its cool?
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> join jsaurus server with ddnet
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> pew pew with shotgun
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> and pistol
07:40 < bridge> <zhn> move to demos
07:41 < bridge> <zhn> and voila
07:41 < bridge> <zhn> wrong tunes by default
07:41 < bridge> <zhn> join any vanilla server
07:41 < bridge> <zhn> even infclass is affected
07:41 < bridge> <zhn> its 7 year issue that was introduced by defaulting ddrace tunes
07:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes sounds good to fix that but my question stands
07:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why ddracetiles 
07:42 < bridge> <zhn> tell me what it would break in your current setup
07:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it just seems wrong
07:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tiles should mean tiles
07:42 < bridge> <zhn> what exactly
07:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your prediction is not about tiles
07:43 < bridge> <zhn> what about ddrqce tune zones? arent these *tiles*?
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm
07:43 < bridge> <zhn> i wouldn't mind if theyre handled differently
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea imo this should be PredictDDraceWeapons
07:44 < bridge> <zhn> it affects only demos btw
07:45 < bridge> <zhn> if u will encounter anything like that in the future we can hop in making new protocol entry
07:45 < bridge> <zhn> i just don't want it to be protocol dependent
07:45 < bridge> <zhn> unless existing ones
07:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not prepare something clean now for the future?
08:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the prediction code is such a rabbit hole. TIL the ddnet client hardcodes a specific hammer tuning for fng https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f9df4a85be4ca94ca91057cd447707bcce16fd94/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp#L334-L346
08:10 < bridge> <totar> I guess tuning can't work if you're a vanilla server?
08:11 < bridge> <totar> or the server simply doesn't care about correct prediction
08:32 < bridge> <zhn> everything is fine ingame
08:32 < bridge> <zhn> demo tunings fuck ups on these hardcoded values
08:33 < bridge> <totar> I'm not taking about demos
08:33 < bridge> <zhn> what then
08:34 < bridge> <zhn> but vanilla servers have their tunings :justatest:
08:34 < bridge> <totar> Why doesn't the fng server simply send hammer strength tunes so the client doesn't need these hard coded values?
08:34 < bridge> <zhn> for the same reason why ddnet tunes are hardcoded ig
08:34 < bridge> <zhn> idk which though xd
08:35 < bridge> <totar> I think it's not the same but ok
08:35 < bridge> <zhn> afair jupeyys or whatever fng we have has hardcoded strength instead of tuning
08:35 < bridge> <zhn> not 100% information
08:36 < bridge> <totar> Why do demos need tunes at all? They run physics?
08:36 < bridge> <zhn> demo is just replaying received snapshots as far as i can tell
08:37 < bridge> <totar> so how can tunes mess it up
08:37 < bridge> <zhn> so its a game runningz actually
08:37 < bridge> <zhn> @totar
08:38 < bridge> <totar> That doesn't answer my question
08:39 < bridge> <totar> I just don't understand why tunes should affect the demo
08:40 < bridge> <totar> Do you mean the demo playback is wrong or the demo saving is wrong?
08:40 < bridge> <zhn> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1281049686911746069
08:41 < bridge> <zhn> ah waiy
08:41 < bridge> <zhn> wrong one
08:41 < bridge> <totar> Is it saving or playback tho?
08:41 < bridge> <zhn> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/824745028311711814/1281009696853069886/sg_demo_bug.mp4?ex=66f1e3bf&is=66f0923f&hm=b95ac0163dbd126afd638081cf2fd8625f33fdd0bcc15209b6675d9ac73ab7eb&
08:42 < bridge> <zhn> and it was like this for a long time
08:42 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
08:43 < bridge> <totar> Can you just answer the question I don't have my pc to test it
08:43 < bridge> <zhn> wdym by saving or replaying?
08:43 < bridge> <zhn> both
08:43 < bridge> <zhn> rendering is just capturing demos playback
08:44 < bridge> <totar> If you save the demo on a patched client and play it back on an unpatched one does it work?
08:44 < bridge> <totar> 
08:44 < bridge> <totar> If you save the demo on an unpatched client and play it back on a patched one does it work?
08:45 < bridge> <zhn> only playback
08:45 < bridge> <totar> That's ambiguous just put yes/no for each
08:45 < bridge> <zhn> you can watch this demo with patched client and everything is fine
08:46 < bridge> <totar> Ok thanks
08:46 < bridge> <zhn> im typing in -2 by celcius, just wait pls xd
08:52 < bridge> <zhn> hm interesting what if i hardcode gravity to 0 xd
08:52 < bridge> <zhn> would demo also try to render it like this
09:01 < bridge> <totar> Are gun projectiles not part of snapshot data?
09:01 < bridge> <totar> So the client has to predict them during playback?
09:01 < bridge> <totar> so weird
09:02 < bridge> <totar> I thought for sure they should be in snapshots so idk what's happening
09:20 < bridge> <zhn> @fantrapreal can you stop please
09:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> block him to stop reactions
09:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> easy solution
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> An idea to ponder and consider:
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> We already have few states Default, Freeze, Deep Freeze.
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> Is it possible to somehow make a new state?
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> let's call it "Mechanized"
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> ofc need two blocks like a Freeze / Unfreeze, but for this state.
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> (for example Mechanize / Unmechanize)
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> One gives this state and second removes state from Tee. 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> Tee with this state "Mechanized" is like a frozen Tee.
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> Player can not control it by inputs,
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> but Mechanized Tee can be control by another way.
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> By touch to the {Mech Command Blocks}.
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> for example:
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> if state of Tee is "Mechanized" and it touches to Mech Command Block "HOLD LEFT",
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> then it will automatically hold it's virtual key [LEFT] all time...
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> until it touches another {Mech Command Block} "RELEASE LEFT"
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> It can hold or release he's virtual keys [LEFT, RIGHT, JUMP, SHOOT, HOOK]
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> and change look direction (by touch to Mech Command Blocks).
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> 
09:59 < bridge> <zabenom> i think for it need 13 blocks or more...
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 1)    "Mechanize"            set state "Mechanized"
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 2)    "Unmechanize"        clear state "Mechanized"
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 3)    "HOLD LEFT"            starts holds it's virtual key [LEFT]
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 4)    "HOLD RIGHT"        starts holds it's virtual key [RIGHT]
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 5)    "HOLD JUMP"            starts holds it's virtual key [JUMP]
10:00 < bridge> <zabenom> 6)    "HOLD SHOOT"        starts holds it's virtual key [SHOOT]
10:00 < bridge> <patiga> they are part of it
10:00 < bridge> <patiga> at least their existence
10:01 < bridge> <patiga> in the snapshot they only store their start point + direction, not all that much
10:01 < bridge> <patiga> so the client does need to work out the flight path of the projectile
10:02 < bridge> <patiga> yes they also run a subset of physics, its called "dead reckoning" in the code
10:04 < bridge> <totar> Server should send parabolic coefficients :kek:
10:05 < bridge> <patiga> in essence, as long as a tee doesnt change inputs and doesn't interact with projectiles/tees, it will be viewed as easily predictable (with dead reckoning, a subset of physics)
10:05 < bridge> <patiga> so a tee with none of the interactions will not show up as changed in the snap to save space, and the client kknows to predict the movement of that tee
10:05 < bridge> <patiga> thats also why teecore has a `tick` field. with it you know how many ticks of physics this tee needs to advance
10:05 < bridge> <totar> I assumed this was only used during actual gameplay to save bandwidth
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> I was hoping that too, but then I needed to implement it for my demo renderer
10:09 < bridge> <patiga> this could get lost in this chat, maybe post your idea in #town-hall or open a github issue :)
10:13 < bridge> <totar> Sounds kinda cool but also probably a nightmare to implement.
10:14 < bridge> <totar> I think except for hook and shoot you can achieve most of the same effect with freeze and speedups but probably not to the precision you want
10:16 < bridge> <zabenom> thx i do not know where is allowed write ideas that's why i write here thx i will write it in town-hall 
10:16 < bridge> <zabenom> github issue <--- i do not know where is it 😄
10:20 < bridge> <patiga> are you sure your grid is correct? pls send that mapres
10:20 < bridge> <patiga> that -1 is only in affect if your renderer doesn't support array textures, in which case that range is inclusive (as texture coordinates) and thereby needs -1
10:20 < bridge> <patiga> note that your renderer peobably supports array textures
10:21 < bridge> <patiga> :heartw: town-hall is a good place, a github issue is not required
10:23 < bridge> <teero777> You should probably open an issue for a feature request since it will get lost quickly in this channel
10:24 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> he knows already
10:24 < bridge> <patiga> I already redirected them to #town-hall , github issues tend to be complicated ^^
10:25 < bridge> <zabenom> i added that message in town-hall with tag Features it's correct?
10:25 < bridge> <patiga> looks good 👍

11:02 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> are you anti rust?
11:02 < bridge> <teero777> just a joke
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> that repo was already shared
11:02 < bridge> <teero777> oki
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> it misses the point completly anyway of rust
11:02 < bridge> <teero777> im doing rust right now!
11:02 < bridge> <teero777> i couldn't be antirust
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> even if the implementation may (and probs have some CVEs), or even if there is a broken thing in a very obscure code that breaks the borrow checker
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust is still useful
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> in c++ u just need to pop a empty vector to get a segfault
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Exception safety
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> > If the container is not empty, the function never throws exceptions (no-throw guarantee).
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Otherwise, it causes undefined behavior.
11:04 < bridge> <teero777> i mean that would be a skill issue
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> all is skill issue
11:04 < bridge> <teero777> yea
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> just dont code
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> no segfaults
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> go start a farm
11:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> Can I join
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/honest-word-its-honest-work-it-aint-much-it-aint-much-but-its-honest-work-gif-13763573
11:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> I take care of fishies
11:05 < bridge> <teero777> just do some asan/ubsan/tsan and almost everything is easily solveable
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> copium
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> we do that in ddnet
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i still see segfaults in issues
11:05 < bridge> <teero777> and else you'd just panic
11:06 < bridge> <teero777> it's still a crash xd
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> panics are controlled
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> segfaults arent
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> its far from the same
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> a panic is like a thrown exception in c++ kinda
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway being panicless is easier than being segfaultless
11:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> You wouldn't reach the state of a panic unintentionally like you would a segfault
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its not comparable
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> panic != segfault
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> also panics can have user friendly messages
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can pinpoint a issue faster with that msg
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> a segfault a user faces usually just has an address
11:07 < bridge> <teero777> sometimes i just don't like ownership stuff in rust. i feel like i could write the same thing in c or c++ in less loc
11:08 < bridge> <teero777> the crate system and stuff are done really well though
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont care about locs that much
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust maybe has more locs due to style not code itself
11:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> "uwu, my tummy hurts at reading the file, file not found"
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact c++ has longer names usually too
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi mom i want a std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource
11:09 < bridge> <teero777> im not talking about style xd
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it makes no sense to relate locs to ownership
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl dislike ownership because it 90% of time finds their code is faulty
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> most ppl are dumb
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> C++ gives me the sheer power to shoot my own leg off and I like it!
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> you probs have some UB issues in your code
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u wont know it
11:10 < bridge> <teero777> idk i can do fancy smart stuff in c++ that juggles memory but if i know all the cases nothing goes wrong
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> "if i know all the cases nothing goes wrong"
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> said everybody
11:10 < bridge> <teero777> ubsan is there
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> yet it segfaults
11:10 < bridge> <teero777> skill issue
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah ur skill too probs
11:11 < bridge> <teero777> ye you can't always do it first try xd

11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> just a quick google

11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust doesnt miss, but it tradesoff some valid cases
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ubsan is nice, but its just a monkeypatch
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> like the bare minimum
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> have u considered zig?
11:14 < bridge> <teero777> 940 is not even ub, 75856 is nothing you would not notice
11:14 < bridge> <teero777> not yet
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> hoping to see another great lang popping off
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> building on rust greatness
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> zig is not that tho
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the comptime is interesting
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/mstange/samply
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ur pr is missing a li tag
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks, will fix later
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> what is li an abbreviation for?
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> list item
12:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but the html element is just `<li>`
12:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 maybe we can publish ddnet on https://f-droid.org/ once the android port gets out of beta 🙂
12:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> with the announcement from @heinrich5991 (1287179183205781575) I wonder if you can use dns poisoning in order to make people download hacked clients. Does the ddnet client check the certificate before updateing?
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> certificates are checked
13:05 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah. I plan to release a small update to the beta this week. if that doesn't add any news bugs we could think about building a real release for the website and f-droid.
13:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe we should switch default graphics backend to OpenGL for Android though, since Vulkan is unstable for some users and the memory usage is also too high for some users
13:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give an example?
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @headshotnoby btw, old client versions are unbanned again, all the different ported versions should work aagain
14:04 < bridge> <murpi> Ellipsis is python are so confusing. I thought its only used for a field that is required but can be set to None, aka code that doesn't exist yet, but apperantly the actual intended use is in the numpy which adds a multidimensional array types
14:05 < bridge> <murpi> I'm using them as a placeholder in my code anyway :greenthing:
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😄
14:39 < bridge> <art0007i> it's 1024x1024 and each grid tile is 64x64 px, but it can be noticed with basically any mapres with a symmetrical tile, and rotate it 180 degrees it will be 1 pixel off (this is how I originally found this issue), here's a picture with ddnet_walls and it still has this.
14:39 < bridge> <art0007i> 
14:39 < bridge> <art0007i> also I think that code is ran regardless of if your renderer supports array textures, I don't see any check that would prevent it.
14:39 < bridge> <art0007i> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287755270310854697/debug_wall.png?ex=66f2b30d&is=66f1618d&hm=2e97f768cc82d08775ee9ed732ec92ef36911ebb180b83c1201b7acf5f1268ac&

14:41 < bridge> <patiga> this line checks the renderer https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f9df4a85be4ca94ca91057cd447707bcce16fd94/src/game/client/render_map.cpp#L603
14:42 < bridge> <patiga> but tru, your mapres appears correct
14:44 < bridge> <patiga> have you tried out a different renderer backend?
14:44 < bridge> <art0007i> I have not. will try it now
14:44 < bridge> <patiga> could you send me the map?
14:45 < bridge> <patiga> (I'm on my laptop where map stuff is kind of a hassle)
14:45 < bridge> <art0007i> ohh so for some reason my render was opengl 1.5, switched to vulkan and it does not chop off the last pixel
14:46 < bridge> <patiga> ah nice, yea opengl does some buggy stuff
14:47 < bridge> <art0007i> here's the map if you still want it
14:47 < bridge> <art0007i> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287757163489394741/debug_wall.map?ex=66f2b4d1&is=66f16351&hm=f523deb4ab9961753dfce16e3c282c83d6cd0a542251ea9779efbb8139d1920e&
14:49 < bridge> <art0007i> but I don't think it should ever chop off the last pixel even if your renderer doesn't support array textures
14:57 < bridge> <patiga> yea its definitely not perfect
14:57 < bridge> <patiga> my guess is that it solves some other problem, maybe texture bleeding, where you'd see the edge of the next tile or something similar
15:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Without the `- 1` you get small gaps between tiles when zooming in with OpenGL 1
15:04 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287761533757034496/image.png?ex=66f2b8e3&is=66f16763&hm=9bbe68fca3296d4914ed77921d52c9f13ec1ec57ebb2b83dec1b83e1a06a8c7a&

15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @learath2 did u know about this?
15:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, what's the use case?
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, looks interesting
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> I'm too young to have used Usenet. It was just about to perish when I started internetting
15:11 < bridge> <art0007i> I still see those either way, but I guess with the -1 it's less visible

15:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Seem like it's related to the mipmap level. You can replace all `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` with `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST` and `CL_LINEAR` with `CL_NEAREST` and remove the `- 1` to get rid of the gaps, but everything will be more pixelated then.
15:22 < bridge> <robyt3> (replace in `backend_opengl.cpp`)
15:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> usenet is big

15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> building a project with llvm deps kek
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its more a linker thing tbh
15:55 < bridge> <headshotnoby> yeah they work now
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/01_chapter.html
16:28 < bridge> <louis> it has use? i just use it like pass 😹
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> @patiga Unable to find installation candidates for twmap (0.6.2) on MacOS M2 via Poetry 😄
17:21 < bridge> <patiga> I haven't looked into cross compilation to macos yet, currently there is no twmap for macos on pypi
17:22 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah 😦 Noticed too
17:23 < bridge> <patiga> you can ofc always build the python module locally
17:23 < bridge> <patiga> if you do start to use it on macos regularly, I'll try to get it into my release process
17:23 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, I tried to integrate the compile with poetry, but I havent managed so far
17:24 < bridge> <avolicious> I would use it on a atleast weekly basis as I have to stay long in the office, so I can work on it our maps-workflow 😄
17:25 < bridge> <patiga> I'll take a look tomorrow or in a couple of days later. if I forget it and you have that problem again, feel free to ping me :)
17:26 < bridge> <avolicious> Sure, I can try to build too & submit it into the build process if you want to
17:26 < bridge> <avolicious> Maybe gitlab ci?
17:27 < bridge> <patiga> would be neat :)
17:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> i've been using neoqwertz as my keyboard layout for a little over a week now and i'm loving it so far, highly recommend it for people coding alot on a german keyboard layout, much easier to type things like {} () " ' | ~, ( and since it's an executable it's not as annoying to setup like other keyboard layouts)
18:00 < bridge> <01000111g> just dont use german keyboard :kek:
18:01 < bridge> <01000111g> I use US keyboard with EurKey layout (US with alt+a = ä etc)
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> i very much dislike the US key layout :P
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> so beautiful :harold:
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287806940172390470/image.png?ex=66f2e32c&is=66f191ac&hm=3def196dc40a2dc9850d757e9a726ebecd1bf932995c92a60d3284a4a41da0db&
18:14 < bridge> <teero777> ah yes
18:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> teero when try it out
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> tf
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> what us key layout is that?
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine doesnt look like that
18:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> nah its the one i currently use :kekw:
18:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> it uses modifiers so i dont have to lift of my fingers to type anything, pretty neat if you get used to it
18:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287810167915810877/image.png?ex=66f2e62e&is=66f194ae&hm=ca4fca59dc77c05c395af28a6eb4907f514dedcfec2ce4fd754463df1ce698c8&

18:18 < bridge> <louis> qwerty is ok for typing but ye lots of coding symbols are in annoying places
18:18 < bridge> <louis> which mac?
18:18 < bridge> <louis> i saw macos is getting a rly nice update
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> m3 max pro iirc, it has 36gb ram
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :pepeW:  how much was it
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr i think its over 3.5k€, but i got it for free my company gave it for work
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> ayo???????????
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not mine but i can use it for anything
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> as long as i work here xd
18:20 < bridge> <louis> lmao are those math symbols latex or unicode characters
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want ur devs to be productive, specially in rust, provide them with good hardware kek
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the cost to $$ ratio is insane
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> only bad companies dont spend on hardware for devs
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think for example in nvidia 1 dev equals millions in profit
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> or more
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> hard to estimate tbh xd
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but when im at home i use my nasa pc

18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny i swapped when i compiled some rust stuff
18:22 < bridge> <louis> where 1440p
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> both
18:22 < bridge> <louis> otherwise nasa pc
18:22 < bridge> <teero777> gonna build cyberdeck with that layout
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk i never got into 1440p

18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how to type tyhe ñ there

18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u hold the n
18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can type ñ

18:33 < bridge> <learath2> You can do like Compose - ~ - a to get ã but I don't have a compose key defined 😄
18:33 < bridge> <louis> i guess id rather have it as a super key near the middle of the keyboard
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> hum, what do you code on normally?
18:34 < bridge> <louis> normal us ansi
18:34 < bridge> <louis> i also use a lot of latex for school
18:34 < bridge> <louis> things like escaping curly brackets always drops my wpm to 50 or smth
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I'm just not a fast enough typer to notice, or maybe since I used to code on turkish Q this one feels very good relatively

18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft i have a fiio k7 bt
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> it claims to have aptx iirc
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its 200€ tho
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> A bluetooth DAC is an interesting concept
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine has BT

18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use it with usb on pc
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> it runs nice on linux
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to try a audio interface, but apparently its wierd for audio interfaces to have RCA outs???
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just wanted to connect my mic with XLR instead of usb c
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> huh, wym?
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> most audio intefaces i searched on amazon dont have rca
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287819837975953518/81o0MFg75SL.png?ex=66f2ef2f&is=66f19daf&hm=295967ca650fdfbbd4010bab1f56991bedf64712c1c2ede7eced14d95e52c463&
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> should i use a audio interface AND my DAC?
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I guess these things all have ADCs in them
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> interface for inputs only?
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and dac for output
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want RCA cuz my monitors use rca
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> aptx lossless is a new codec
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> different from aptx
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> but seems too new
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody has it yet
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> Well yes, and I think I understand why they only have digital outputs, they probably mix in digital
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u think about this combo?
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287820366185631876/image.png?ex=66f2efad&is=66f19e2d&hm=c94803bbde1256f58af6c0517dc134ea277727cc1a5d40784f33efd142210b64&
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> its in my wanted list
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> upgrade
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287820422225723452/81d4tUj7RiL.png?ex=66f2efbb&is=66f19e3b&hm=522f03bb72f951b64b35443aa210eb254c0dc311de8b414dc6602fc854b046d0&
18:58 < bridge> <learath2> I haven't looked at speakers in a decade now, I've always been a headphone person
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i love speakers
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont use headphones
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u have lot of hair btw?
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think il lgo bald in 10y
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but for now im good
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i prefer no headphones
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i would just buy presonus eris
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is that
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> calculate what driver size based on ur room's volume
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> monitors
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like more how the vulkano look
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> I have a very meh hairline but it seems to have kinda stopped going back, so idk. It's a coinflip for me
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> the presonus are very proven monitors
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but ye
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> ive never heard of the other brand
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> so i cant speak to it
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> Why do you want an audio interface anyway? Don't trust the ADC inside the mic itself?
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> aparently my mic is quite low
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i probs need a interface to drive it better
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> with XLR
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using it with usb-c
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> a good interface has a very high quality DAC in itself
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> you wouldnt need both
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using this mic
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287821434428854416/image.png?ex=66f2f0ac&is=66f19f2c&hm=fa53584485e66987dee97bf66fd35f981f32b8c9f5f73170d8a8bc2d3103f80a&
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell me a good interface with rca out
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> rn i have scarlett solo out to headphones in the front, speakers in the back, at2020 in via. XLR, and i have a 1/4 TRRS input for recording musics
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i bought 1/4" TRS to RCA
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> cable
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> works very well
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it losless?
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just a different connector
19:03 < bridge> <Ewan> rn i have scarlett solo out to headphones in the front, speakers in the back, at2020 in via. XLR, and i have a 1/4" TRRS input for recording musics
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a 100€ table xd
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> would be cool to have it connected to the interface too or smth
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> expensive cables are audiophile bait
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a 100€ mix table xd
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> just buy a decent gague
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> The "lossy" part of the process is going from A -> D or D -> A
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> After that's done there is only cable losses for analog and no loss for digital
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> o
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> mixer
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
19:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> my interface has volume knobs for the inputs so i have no need
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought u misspell cable
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> Things like XLR to usb-c adapters hide an ADC inside there, that's why there is loss
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ^
19:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> XLR is analog right?
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
19:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats special about xlr
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesnt destroy ears
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> when not plugged in
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> no exposed contacts
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> and the cable usually locks in
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean the plug pop?
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> well if u touch a TRS connector it makes crazy sounds
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> not like i connect or disconnect my cables
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> bad for really high volume
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> audio mixing bugs/delays actually can deafen ppl at live shows
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> pops from buffer underruns lol
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> they care a lot about that
19:07 < bridge> <learath2> XLR is also balanced, balanced cables eliminate environmental noise
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i have to write a docker thing now
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> (TRS is also balanced)
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> RCA is unbalanced
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> all TRS is balanced?
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> are all jacks TRS?
19:09 < bridge> <learath2> No
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldnt depend on it
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> for sure
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> my headphones have the big jack
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt mean anything right
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just that u dont need adapter for most hifi equipment
19:11 < bridge> <Ewan> there is a reason the bigger jacks are used
19:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but for headphones
19:11 < bridge> <Ewan> eh
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> your headphones probably don't take a balanced input anyway, if it's TRS it'll be left right ground, no balance
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> no they arent balanced
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> You need 5 conductors for balanced stereo
19:11 < bridge> <Ewan> balanced headphones usually take 2.5mm
19:13 < bridge> <learath2> (honestly the length of cable you run for your headphones doesn't pick up any significant environmental noise unless you have something in your house that is extremely noisy and poorly shielded)
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> and if u use IEMs u can (usually) use whatever kind of cable u want
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> that is why i was asking about bluetooth dac. i broke my last pair walking around and catching the cable on a drawer handle xd
19:15 < bridge> <Ewan> u can get IEM bluetooth receivers that are just 2 pin in but the only ones with AAC (need for my iPhone) are like $80 and if i can't even get lossless then it's not that worth
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> so i was considering a bluetooth dac instead that i just keep in my pocket
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> cable tucked away
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> Actually 4 conductors are enough, I checked my balanced 2.5mm cable and it's trrs, just 4 conductors
19:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i had a hunch but ive never owned any equipment like that lol
19:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to lock in tho
19:17 < bridge> <Ewan> bbl
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats lock in
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> focus
19:18 < bridge> <learath2> new zoozer phrase, "focus"
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it comes from champ select xd
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> im getting old :justatest:
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought for sure u would know it
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think its popular with that sigma gym bro stuff
19:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just go to gym and when i go i think about rust
19:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> hell yeah
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> not to accuse u of anything XDD
19:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> best time to go to gym is 7 morning
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> no kids
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and focused ppl
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> today  i went late at 17
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> kids doing shit
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> year
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i gotta get into it
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> gym expensive and they try to lock you into predatory contracts
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i found one that doesnt lock you in
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i pay 25€
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> per month or day pass
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> gym is a must tbh
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel so good afterwards
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> even if my day sucked
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i work out a home
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but its much easier at dym
19:25 < bridge> <Ewan> but its much easier at gym
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> esp when u mad and driving with nowhere to go
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i do that all the time
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> go to gym instead of meaningless driving
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> not meaningless
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleast u improve while mad
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i get to drive fast until the road or the weather puts the fear of god in me
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> then i go home
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> this may just be a Colorado thing
19:27 < bridge> <Ewan> speed limits essentially are not enforced on the interstate
19:27 < bridge> <Ewan> unless you do something actually dangerous
19:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it is meditative to drive really really fast
19:29 < bridge> <Ewan> we had the first rain of the season 2 days ago
19:29 < bridge> <Ewan> and there was a huge college football game so there was lots of traffic but only the opposite direction of the way i was driving
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> so i went out and put the windows down drove
19:30 < bridge> <Ewan> so i went out and put the windows down and drove
19:30 < bridge> <louis> how fast :justatest:
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> my speedometer is not the most accurate
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it read 100 in some spots
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> mph
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u translate
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> to km
19:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> 160
19:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> about
19:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Ewan's a stoner that speeds recklessly, poor dude's gonna perish
19:32 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i wouldnt be opposed
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well 160 is ok
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> 160?
19:32 < bridge> <Ewan> some of u guys have autobahn
19:32 < bridge> <syrinok> Just don't take someone out with you
19:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:32 < bridge> <Ewan> fair
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> ye
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went at 185 with a friend (he was driving) on a audi a4 from 2001 iirx
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i have 1999 honda accord with mechanical issues
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> so it takes a while to get up to speed
19:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it also has awesome death wobble
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a volkswagen tcross rline 2019  :justatest:
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just like that my car can start at level without giving gas xd
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> this may not mean anything to u but i was on us 36 going towards boulder so we have awesome mountainous terrain
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> treacherous highways
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it manual?
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so weird
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> here most are manual
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> they manufactured and sold both in that time
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there are domestic U.S. 1999 honda accords that are manual
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> just not mine
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> but auto should be more fuel efficient right
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i was considering doing a sequential transmission mod
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but that's expensive kid shit
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> the car moves.
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> in us u can mod ur car easily without beinh lawless?
19:36 < bridge> <avolicious> Thats a nice one tho 😄
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> here it needs to be approved
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u need to pass ITV
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> not at all
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on the mod basically
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye i like it
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of tards drive around with custom hellcats and the first time they get pulled over they get crazy ticket or their car impounded
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz they have illegal mods
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have driven a audi a4 from 2001 and a nissan micra from 2013 iirx
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i love my vw
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> (all manual)
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> my cousin has a 2003 subaru impreza
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> manual
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> he wont let me drive it
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> subaruuu
19:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Audi is great as well, had a few of them, but sadly often at the mechanic
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> german cars lately get a bad rap here
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> because they are expensive to maintain
19:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> toyota :3
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> honda :3
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur mom :3
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> immortal japanese engineering
19:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> cheap, don't die
19:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> no maintenance
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always wanted to have a cool mustang
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> if i buy another car in the next 5 years it'll be the v6 version of my car XD
19:39 < bridge> <avolicious> I am not into cars anymore... they get lame, even with 600+ hp... bikes it is guys

19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> Does anyone for whatever reason have a 1:1 screen
19:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> :cat_whaaa:
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> Does anyone for whatever reason have a 1:1 screen?
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> Death awaits
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i think chancho has crt but idk aspect ratio
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> but he can select 1:1 res
19:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> was never into cars \:D
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz crt
19:40 < bridge> <avolicious> You can die in cars too
19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not crazy about cars either
19:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Or you cross the street and someone ran you over
19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i love rust
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> There is someone complaining in a ticket that he gets grey bars with 1:1
19:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> tell them to send a screenshot
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure you can tell the very obvious difference between the 3 examples 😄
19:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> or it never happened
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> 1:1 is unsupported? i think we only do 5:4
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> so he will have the slightest bars
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> 18.5.1
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287831304943042644/image.png?ex=66f2f9dd&is=66f1a85d&hm=c83371fb1d2b27f59fb5e85d03bdcc88d60e09c3d986da235acf97c172766574&
19:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> ok, it happened
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> 15.5.4
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287831372756418673/image.png?ex=66f2f9ee&is=66f1a86e&hm=c3ef95b1376b87dcf60ffe95c335d484f51ff4949174e796536c9fa2fd71d69b&
19:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> whatga
19:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> whata
19:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> egirl tee
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> img dead
19:42 < bridge> <Ewan> for me
19:42 < bridge> <avolicious> I am driving cars, I am into motorcycles now and I am pedestrian sometimes 😄
19:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont see bars
19:42 < bridge> <louis> now i want a 1:1 screen
19:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> grey bottom where the map is cut off?
19:42 < bridge> <avolicious> xDDDD this is pain
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i think a decision was deliberately made to not support 1:1 between 15.5.4 and now
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> The odds of getting into an accident and the odds of surviving that accident is vastly different for a pedestrian, a motorcyclist and a car driver 😄
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> too hard for robsti to maintain compact UIs
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> If that's the case that's what I'll tell the dude. So it's just that we don't support the aspect ratio that's the issue?
19:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> odds of dying is always 50%
19:43 < bridge> <koshmarik1652> hello
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i believe so
19:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> you either die or don't
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> True, all odds are always 50%
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> depends on speed
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think at 70km ur nearly always ded
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> odds are always 100% if ur still around to calculate them
19:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> just odds when you have a choise of two things
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839915967798050878/1082773844177195130/3aa3c0f3c2ef3ab3-1.gif
19:46 < bridge> <avolicious> Glad to have 217 PS on 200kg, so 50% sounds good
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> At 70kmh you can most definitely survive in a good car, you will be maimed in a motorcycle accident and you will meet the big man himself as a pedestrian
19:46 < bridge> <avolicious> Speed doesnt kill, becoming suddenly stationary does
19:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> slide 500m in protective gear
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> if u drive fast u need to brake early and often
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> even if u cant see the thing that will kill u
19:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Okay, I havent done 500m yet
19:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Dont prepare for the ride, prepare for the slide ^^
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> half km sliding? xd
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah if you aren't wearing gear you'll likely lose a limb. With gear you get to slide around before a car runs over you at highway speeds
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i hit sketchy turns sometimes that 100% would have killed me had i not precautionarily braked
19:48 < bridge> <avolicious> Race track
19:48 < bridge> <avolicious> They are built to stop you pretty quick, even with 200 km/h+
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> did you know u dont feel the temperature itself with ur skin, but the transfer of heat?
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:49 < bridge> <avolicious> I wasnt enjoying it tho
19:50 < bridge> <avolicious> @learath2 This is how teeworlds looks on 32:9 😄

19:52 < bridge> <Ewan> basically
19:53 < bridge> <teero777> i would've won the lottery by now
19:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why im reading this now but itsi nteresting https://escholarship.org/content/qt3f4599hx/qt3f4599hx_noSplash_522d4a76ad081d5938284a3bfb4e85a8.pdf
19:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> some ppl say the human body is a perfect machine xd
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> not mine
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe some ppl
19:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u win lottery what would u do
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> retire
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> natural serotonin deficit makes life very hard for a very large portion of the world
19:56 < bridge> <avolicious> Not being in the ddnet discord
19:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant say that sounds perfect
19:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its one of the most interesting places
19:56 < bridge> <avolicious> You asked me what I would do. You can do what you'd like to do 😄
19:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> he just asked xd
19:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u can do that without winning lottery
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it's free
19:57 < bridge> <avolicious> True
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> kog #developer channel when
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> It's 50/50, you either win or you don't, if you think it's not 50/50 tell me the other option :GalaxyBrain:
19:57 < bridge> <avolicious> We have
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 🥱
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> kog always ripping ddnet off
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> xD
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> (i am kidding)
19:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u think if u knew how would u die it would change the way u act and change how u die or not?
19:58 < bridge> <avolicious> Accounts 👀
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> fair enough
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i still dont know what we're waiting on
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> jopsti's implementation seems very agreeable
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> why are we waiting on just him to port the changes xd
19:58 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes
19:59 < bridge> <avolicious> I would drive even more crazier on my bike 😄
19:59 < bridge> <avolicious> Enjoying as long as you can enjoy
19:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> now you can use this insider whenever someone aks for "what are the chances to ... or ..."
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> If you can change it, just knowing it will definitely instantly change it. If you can't change it, by knowing how/when it happens you might augment your behaviour if it's very close
20:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> asks
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> I would definitely live differently if I knew I'd get hit by a car in 3 weeks no matter what
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> And I'd make sure I'll be indoors on the day of, because I want to see how a car will get there to hit me
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> what if u knew for certain u would die as a symptom of old age
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> and you knew for sure you would have a long life
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily prosperous
20:02 < bridge> <learath2> Then I'd change nothing. It's just a normal death
20:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> truk-kun
20:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> truck-kun
20:02 < bridge> <learath2> If I'm guaranteed a date of death then I might change a couple things. I'll first start doing all the harmful things
20:03 < bridge> <avolicious> Are you talking about drugs now? xD
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> well why not
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> actually
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> Mostly smoking and alcohol to look cool
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> there are some amazing reasons why not
20:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://tenor.com/view/baver-truck-t%C4%B1r-uwu-truckkun-gif-13884462997268508512
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> the highs are higher maybe but the lows are much much lower
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> Since I can't get cancer who cares might aswell be 500% cooler
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> sobriety is wisdom
20:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> the black smoker lung is a hoax
20:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> the more you know
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> I'd get a motorcycle but I'm not told whether I'm dying of old age as a quad or not, so maybe not
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> assuming you had all of your limbs
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> smoking is terrible do not get into it
20:05 < bridge> <avolicious> You should
20:05 < bridge> <avolicious> Get a bike
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it can make you a different person within a week
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> you can preach all you want but the compulsion to smoke does not go away for a long while
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> but it's well established that you look 500% cooler if you smoke like a trucker
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> start smoking, so my stocks go brrrr
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> to be fair it also tastes disgusting, so maybe not. I guess I'd change nothing if I knew I'd die of old age at 90
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> you learn to love it after your third cigarette or so
20:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> try vaping, same result for my stocks
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> in my experience
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> nah, I tried getting into it for a while, it just doesn't work
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> immunity
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> I can get hooked to vaping or smoking shisha though
20:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> have you ever smoked weed
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> like real flower
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Something about cigarettes taste absolutely disgusting to me. It's like a mix of asphalt and burnt bush
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i got over the taste of cigs so easy bcs weed tastes so damn terrible
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> at least bad weed does
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> huh, I'd actually disagree, I kinda like the way weed smells/tastes
20:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> got no Tegridy Farm stocks, tho
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> not like I've smoked weed in years now
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i've enjoyed the taste of weed before but it's fancy shit my dad buys
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 14er pancakes is a good one
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but u probably cant get that anywhere else
20:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> what does this even mean
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> brand name + strain name
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i havent been doing weed for a week or so tho
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> good for you
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> either of my leads will test me
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i would be shooting myself in the foot otherwise
20:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's tegridy
20:11 < bridge> <learath2> I can't believe they drug test in the US for random jobs
20:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> integridy
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks. really it's terrible for someone my age
20:11 < bridge> <learath2> I can't believe it's even legal with the 4th amendment and all
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> one's a dev job the other is a govt job
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> they have their reasons
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i watched it undo basic executive functions that you learn as a normal person
20:11 < bridge> <learath2> If you were say operating heavy machinery I'd get it
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> even when not high i would spend several minutes formulating simple texts
20:12 < bridge> <teero777> weed at the workplace could lead to some unforseen table drops
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it jjust isnt good in that volume
20:12 < bridge> <teero777> (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> if i ever do pick it back up i'd hope it's when my frontal lobe is at least fully developed
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah very very bad if you are young, you can't afford to turn into a sea cucumber while your brain is not fully developed yet
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> but im becoming functional again ish
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> just dont smoke it if you're depressed tbh
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> too prone to over indulgence
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> We turned this place into #off-topic again. We should stop before heinrich comes online
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> I'll go find food
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> but also we’re the devs aren’t we xd
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the topic that the developers are discussing
20:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> was rust in the linux kernel a mistake?
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> the channel isn’t called development
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> I heard it was controversial but not why
20:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> is rust commnity too religious about their language?
20:17 < bridge> <zhn> only 10%
20:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> are those 10% loud enough to annoy 100% C devs?
20:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> 10% sounds a lot if I think about it
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> only took me 
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> ```
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> real    34m51.495s

20:20 < bridge> <teero777> sys    1m10.158s
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> ```
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> to compile ddnet :D
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> on a single core mini pc
20:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> sometimes you loose, sometimes someone else wins
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i genuinely believe rust evangelism is only counterproductive
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> it is a fantastic language, but it doesn't matter what it is, if you want someone to share your love for something you absolutely do not start by shitting on what they're using
20:27 < bridge> <totar> I wonder if in 15 years there will be 4 competing memory safe languages but rust will still be dominant because of legacy.
20:28 < bridge> <avolicious> there will be c++-ng
20:28 < bridge> <avolicious> there will be c++ng

21:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> roby at this point i'm convinced you touched every piece of code at least once :kek: - insane work
22:00 < bridge> <zaerin__> you are using nixos right?
22:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes
22:01 < bridge> <zaerin__> can you suggest some resources to learn it?
22:01 < bridge> <zaerin__> im considering switching from arch

22:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> and join his discord - i'm very active on it
22:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> he does great resources to understand what nix and nixos is, how to use it effectivly and some gimmicks inbetween
22:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> in general - keep in mind nix and nixOS is a declarative operating system, with nix beeing it's own scripting language
22:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> in general - keep in mind nix and nixOS is a declarative operating system, with nix beeing it's own scripting language, so even getting the most simplest of things like setting up docker can be annoying and time consuming

22:31 < bridge> <lukron55> what’s the probability that someone’s complied the code for xbox? (if it even works) i have a dev mode so as long as i have the file i can install it
22:31 < bridge> <zaerin__> I looked at the about page on youtube but didnt see the server
22:32 < bridge> <zaerin__> I was gonna look at a video description but I got caught up in the video and ended up watching it
22:33 < bridge> <lukron55> we nixOS just use void
22:33 < bridge> <lukron55> ew nixOS just use void
22:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> Lmao that shows it's a good video
22:34 < bridge> <zaerin__> Its the ultimate nixos tutorial vid
22:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> :owo:
22:35 < bridge> <lukron55> following up on this, would it actually be possible to compile it as an xbox game
22:37 < bridge> <learath2> Sure. @headshotnoby even has a ps2 port. Xbox should be easier
22:37 < bridge> <learath2> Actually wait not easier. You need directx on xbox
22:37 < bridge> <headshotnoby> summoned
22:37 < bridge> <headshotnoby> there's nxdk
22:38 < bridge> <lukron55> well i have very very little knowledge in any coding languages. i now have given myself a project
22:38 < bridge> <lukron55> knowing that’s it’s possible
22:38 < bridge> <learath2> What does it do? Gl to dx?
22:38 < bridge> <headshotnoby> xbox open source sdk
22:38 < bridge> <headshotnoby> xbox open source dev sdk
22:38 < bridge> <headshotnoby> however xbox homebrew is kinda finicky to work with from what i heard
22:39 < bridge> <headshotnoby> nxdk still has some bugs and the majority of homebrew was developed using leaked microsoft sdk
22:39 < bridge> <lukron55> is it? i’ve had no issues with it. then again im only emulating with it atm
22:39 < bridge> <learath2> Might not be the easiest starter project. You'll need to learn both gl or vk(to understand our gfx code) and dk (possibly old dk if you are compiling for an old xbox like the 360)
22:40 < bridge> <learath2> And our gfx backend is on the eccentric side to support gl1, gl3, gl3.3, vk
22:40 < bridge> <lukron55> wait my goal is to make it work as an app directly installed to the xbox. rather than emulating
22:40 < bridge> <headshotnoby> oh wait you were talking about modern xbox? xb one/series?
22:40 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, but as far as I'm aware the xbox doesnt have gl drivers
22:41 < bridge> <lukron55> lmfao yeah
22:41 < bridge> <learath2> So you'll need to write a directx backend
22:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i have a series x but no dev mode
22:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> HOWEVER
22:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> someone wrote some kind of mesa translation layer for xbox uwp, gl -> dx12 or something like that
22:41 < bridge> <lukron55> i would invite you as a member of my “team” but i think im apart of someone else’s so i can actually invite anyone
22:42 < bridge> <lukron55> well i like challenged
22:42 < bridge> <lukron55> well i like challenges
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> There is dxvk that runs pretty well
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you can get that to run on xbox
22:42 < bridge> <headshotnoby> honestly if that means i can get dev mode i'd love that
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> Wait that's the wrong direction 😄
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if there is vkdx
22:42 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i miss retail mode homebrew
22:42 < bridge> <headshotnoby> vkd3d is a thing
22:42 < bridge> <lukron55> @headshotnoby would it be possible to send the ps2 version of ddnet i wanna try emulate it on duck station
22:43 < bridge> <lukron55> same
22:43 < bridge> <learath2> How good is it nowadays?
22:43 < bridge> <headshotnoby> http://github.com/headshot2017/ddnet-ps2
22:43 < bridge> <lukron55> i can ask the guy who invited me. only reason i’m with his is because microsoft refused taking my money when i tried getting a dev account 💀
22:43 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i'm not sure if there's a .elf actions CI that auto compiles it though
22:43 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i'd appreciate that, thanks a lot
22:44 < bridge> <headshotnoby> not sure, i don't play many games with d3d 12
22:44 < bridge> <learath2> As long as you aren't one to get bored quickly it's actually pretty educational
22:44 < bridge> <lukron55> i have adhd. if i don’t complete it ill never forget
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> And it should be easy to develop, the first step would be to write a dx backend on windows no need to bother with xbox specfics until you get it rendering
22:45 < bridge> <lukron55> he got back quite fast. you can only have 3 on a team as it’s not a company and he’s got a mate and me and himself. sorry
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> And if it's well written enough we can add it to ddnet so we can have even more backends to support 😄
22:45 < bridge> <lukron55> it’s like $20 for a dev account
22:46 < bridge> <lukron55> if microsoft are feeling nice
22:46 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ah shit, sad
22:46 < bridge> <lukron55> awesome. well i’ll start researching everything and see what i can do
22:47 < bridge> <headshotnoby> btw isn't duckstation a ps1 emulator?
22:47 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah i meant the other one
22:47 < bridge> <lukron55> lmfao
22:47 < bridge> <headshotnoby> pcsx2
22:47 < bridge> <lukron55> that’s it
22:48 < bridge> <lukron55> @headshotnoby i’m still working on getting my own dev account. when i finally get microsoft to take my money ill add you to my team
22:48 < bridge> <headshotnoby> awesome
22:54 < bridge> <lukron55> oh fuck. visual studio won’t be available on linux will it
22:55 < bridge> <lukron55> vsc is i believe
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> tell me you don't understand NixOS without telling me that you don't understand NixOS
22:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> NixOS gigachads unite
22:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> Why do you need visual studio ? Or is it just that you're familiar with it
22:56 < bridge> <lukron55> well my plan is to port ddnet to xbox as a uwp app in dev mode
22:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Vsc works out of the box yes
22:56 < bridge> <lukron55> as a project for myself as i need to start learning
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> you can't do any UWP on Linux at all
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> the tools are not there
22:56 < bridge> <lukron55> i had only just though
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> that is 100% windows exclusive
22:56 < bridge> <lukron55> i had only just thought
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> that is all dependent on the WinRT runtime which is tightly integrated into the operating system and is not (nor will it ever be, most likely) covered by wine
22:57 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah no i understand why it doesn’t work
22:57 < bridge> <lukron55> i just hadn’t thought of it before
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:58 < bridge> <lukron55> my laptop will not run windows
22:58 < bridge> <Ewan> why?
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> if it's minimum system requirements you can circumvent that very easily
22:59 < bridge> <lukron55> it’s just that bad
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i see
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a 2009 imac that runs mojave
23:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it runs absolutely abysmally but it is much better than nothing to make sure my stuff still compiles on macOS
23:00 < bridge> <lukron55> that’s the specs. i have yet to install a screenshot application as i installed it raw
23:00 < bridge> <lukron55> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287881295971483668/IMG_3810.jpg?ex=66f3286c&is=66f1d6ec&hm=9ed51d1586aa1ff3ab25a1938e63c954d04ee963b6887805251b7f2a942f27cf&
