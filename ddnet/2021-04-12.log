00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you use that as home server? Or what purpose does such a board have in first place? ðŸ˜„
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I used to run teehistorian downloads on a raspi ^^
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cool, i like the concept of having a small pc do a single task ðŸ˜„
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> raspi is already quite powerful tho xd ran some emulators back when my brother got one ðŸ˜„
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the newest edition even has a vulkan driver if i remember correctly
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> quite cool ðŸ˜„
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Actually, what versions of macos is https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/738203698 supposed to work on?  Won't run for me on mojave, just want to know how far up I need to move.
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, used to be my home server running openbsd, bit was too weak at some point.
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> they are good as routers/firewalls too
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i couldnâ€˜t find the exact model i have, it has 3 lan ports i think
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://pcengines.ch/alix2d3.htm
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt even know a normal customer can buy such bords ^^
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> boot problems have to be debugged by serial port, since no gpu
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> savage
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and to compile new software i turned it off, ran the cf card in my real pc and compiled there inside qemu since it was much faster
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> so kind of annoying to use ðŸ˜€
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i donâ€˜t know, what error?
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 2 cores at that speed sounds hard to use
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now I wanna know @PopCorn181's stats
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830933978713423872/Screen_Shot_2021-04-11_at_5.34.51_PM.png
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sadness
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you click report?
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and show us the result
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> https://pastebin.com/raw/3LGiXYjR
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> not sure if this is of any use
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i vote for this guy:
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/807401738004463616
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he doesnt even have a opengl driver xd
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that alone is just gold xD
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830935015566475294/unknown.png
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @tela thanks. it looks like a packaging issue from our side
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Oh cool, thanks for checking :). Updating OS is not so easy on hackintosh so thats a relief lol
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems we are just missing a lib in the package
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i assume normal nightlys work?, then you can use that feature tomorrow
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> They have in the past, Ill check one right now.  Yeah I of course don't need that feature immediately haha
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> i play on windows vista
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> ya, newest nightly works just fine
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @PopCorn181 what's your CPU though? I think you can see that if you press win+r, type `devmgmt.msc` and press enter ðŸ™‚
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Is the $points bot meant to be out of date? @lynn was asking. I am currently 3808 and last recorded was 3.4k on the $points.
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> yes,
01:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> my cpu is going through 8% - 50%
01:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> has a feature ever been requested for a fallback skin for clients without your custom skin? my understanding is that if i have selected a custom skin i made, it will show the default skin for everyone else
01:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it sounds complicated to implement though... it should check the DB if it does not exist, and only then should it show the "Fallback skin" option
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can just replace the default skin
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> inside the client is a "skin directory" button, there you can just put a default.png
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think he meant, if someone doesn't have your custom skin he would see you as limekitty for example
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've suggested something like this a looooooong time ago ^^
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but how does it differ from just renaming limekitty to default
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> that others would see you as default
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's like if I use a skin that you don't have, you see me as default
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> with fallback you would see me as one of the vanilla skins
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so you basically want to send 2 skins to the server?
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> guess so
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i see
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but this made more sense back in 2017, now we have the skin downloader
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds interesting for sure, on the other hand why would u care how others see you :D, u can e.g. name ur custom skin limekitty
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> then you will see custom tees where they should be limekitties
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, depends on, if you want ur custom skin to be unique probably ðŸ˜„
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess unique to you and friends who have it
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> when make weapon skins be like regular skins where u can see others personal skins
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds interesting too, but would also need a regulated db ðŸ˜„
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh that'd be a nightmare
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> you would see aoe guns everywhere
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u could not add it to the db ðŸ˜„
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> lol i think itd be cool
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> also big artstyle clash unless you only add miper skins
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i guess but thats also kinda in reg. skins
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i see the issue with having to send 2 skins
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but there's a lot more tee skins and they're somewhat more consistent
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> gameskins are all over the place
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe im not familiar with the skin downloader?
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i think i found a bug with the rocket
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> idk if its the good channel
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> #bugs but i don't think anyone would complain if you said it here either
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> @lynn any skin from https://ddnet.tw/skins/ will be displayed correctly unless someone disabled the option for himself
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well, if i make a skin i still have to send it to my friend for them to see it right? without it getting approved for the db
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> its me or the hammer delay changed?
01:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what hammer delay? xd
01:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the animation?
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> wait i will send vid
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u have higher ping, it might feel like its delayed
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have to turn on antiping
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i dont know if you can see but im pretty sure the delay when we hammer someone changed
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830950830353547264/2021-04-12_01-40-53.mp4
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> want the rocket have new feature/bug
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, have u antiping on?
01:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> looks normal to me
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that a ddnet server? else it might also be the server?
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> all srv
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe i am wrong but its look weird
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DeÃ«ivid!> thereÂ¿s a delay when hitting another tee
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, i also dont play on 60fps, so i cant really judge.
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Only thing i can tell ya is, that your brain sometimes thinks that teeworlds physics feel a bit strange during training, like it changed.
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i had this in gores sometimes.
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Its really alot of factors, how you hold your computer mouse
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how close u are to the screen etc. pp.
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DeÃ«ivid!> there's a delay when hitting another tee
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm maybe cause i bought new wireless mouse so its possible i have little delay
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its a "gamer" mouse, you might want to make sure the polling rate is set to >1000hz
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its a "gamer" mouse, you might want to make sure the polling rate is set to >=1000hz
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> mn no its smth with the server
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i went on there and it feels different
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> also antiping won't predict the hammers correctly too
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> so i think smth changed
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, feels normal to me xD
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that on USA only or smth? XD
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 37.59.55.192:9404
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> come try
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> bombay BW server
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> not bombay*
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that ddnet server?
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> its not a ddnet server
01:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its strange on ddnet server tell me, then i join
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> same on ddnet srv
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wat
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> come on "naufrage" map
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am there
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> feels normal
01:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u also have ping of >70, and unstable
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, it feels a bit different with high ping, e.g. on usa, but not really delayed
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i meant on the serverside i dont think it was high ping since i use antiping
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess the hammer effect is just delayed or smth
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> plus it was bw which i think has some weird plugins
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> nots ure
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its the hammer effect tho
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like that collision effect
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that isnt predicted
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only the animation and the hammered tee is
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on jp server i see it ðŸ˜„
02:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i think its better like that, bcs then you know, where the hammer actually happened server side
02:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we should get it for dj too xd
02:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dummy copy isnt really smooth predicted tho xd
02:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830958260030537808/dc.mp4
11:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can anyone help me with this? :/
11:05 <@deen> with what?
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, no replies on irc, I see
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Sorry :D
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> emoticons rely on the current game tick, which is sent with each snapshot: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L605-L619
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Snapshots are only sent every second tick with sv_high_bandwith 0 (default), which causes the emoticons to not look good
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on nobys server you can see how smooth emoticons should look like
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tried to "fake" that snap inbetween with an empty snap only containing the current gametick, so that emoticons would look smoother, but that didnt work out and only gave me weird stuff like flickering scoreboard and others xD
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have no idea if its even possible to do so, but it sounded like a good idea to use a snap empty between each normal snapshot
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i can definitely not go with high bandwith mode for my 128 player server, tried that that would be too much cpu usage, i already optimized many parts of my code to fit 128 players
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Fix it client side
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt really know how, also that would have to go through vanilla too :D
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Well then they probably is no fix other than more snapshots
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess i just didnt do everything correctly with the empty snap
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should work
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Bcs tw is built in the snapshot idea
11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I also dislike it for some reasons but tw streams everything xd
11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Gfx network
11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Empty snap means basically reset all characters doesn't it?
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i thought an empty snap means if nothing changed inbetween the last snaps
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then no new data has to be sent
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no?
11:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I doubt tw has any "player disconnected" snapshot does it? It just stops sending that players snaps
11:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea i guess
11:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in 0.7 there are packets for that
11:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.6 doesnt have that tho
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I thought snapshots dont re-send everything at all the time
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i thought the only send pieces
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> from which values got changed
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats also why i thought i could put a small empty snap in there
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just updating the game tick
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L958-L961
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I am not 100% sure, but there are some Delta snaps
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But can't remember for what. Just saw it when I read some code
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be for everything
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L915
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, and if there is no delta so nothing has changed then it just sends an empty snap
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and that was exactly what i was trying
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or am i wrong
11:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno
11:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Is the Delta thing so clever?
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Wouldn't some component need to say if smth changed
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Also what if a packet gets lost t
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> teeworlds resends packets
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Would be inconsistent state
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nah, new snapshots update older ones
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> one packet getting lost is not a problem there, i htink
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> might lag for a sec
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It doesn't resend input packets for example does it?
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not entirely sure
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I mean like this
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Player disconnected, Delta sends difference. After the disconnect is always empty, but the disconnect is lost
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/shared/snapshot.cpp#L408-L409
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Then the client would never know
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think teeworlds has its serverside resend logic
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But anyway before I talk too much wrong stuff just wait for Lea or Heinrich
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, the client can check there too i think
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Thought the idea of UDP is not to resend if not critical and most snaps shouldn't thus
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I wonder if opengl to dx12 to Vulkan works with dxvk xd
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe that works on Intel xdd
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems like VKD3D is not ready enough for that yet ^^
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I edited that comment quickly a couple times, Iâ€™d also love to see the console and learn how you made it happen
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> @Jupstar âœª just tried zink, fps dropped to 150fps from 1.8k :\
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> zink on windows doesnt work
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> linux
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then u have to use mesa21
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> it's latest mesa
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have around 70% of native opengl
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then ur vulkan driver is buggy or smth
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh and also use GL 3.3 with zink
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think older GL version support isnt really done yet
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> i already use opengl 3.3 and mesa vulkan driver with amdgpu, dunno :\
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have amdgpu too, but it works fine
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe too new GPU?
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> navi
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> yea mb
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> also strangely i get much better fps on igpu when play ddnet, like 3x :\ mb navi drivers are not that good yet. igpu is vega based afaik
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i assume so, i read somewhere, that they just finished the vulkan drivers few days ago
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Ah ok it was just AMDVLK, which is a open source vulkan driver, but its not mesa RADV, which is the mesa open source vulkan driver xDDD
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why do they even have 2 xD
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah i see RADV isnt even from amd itself
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt even know, RIP
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> still performs sick ðŸ˜„

17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't use russian a instead of latin a
20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut idk. idea: check with what values the function emoticon render function is called to see differences
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not an own function
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> Is 1 (one) confusable with i (small case i letter, 9th letter)?
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in our code, yes
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> they don't really look alike
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's because some confusables for i and 1 look alike
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, 1 and i don't look alike
