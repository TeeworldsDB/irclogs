01:31 < laxa> EastByte: you are in France right now ?
01:40 <@deen> congrats laxa
01:40 < laxa> Thanks deen <3.
01:40 <@deen> about the demos, yeah it would be nice to have them, but it's too late now
01:40 < laxa> Why it is too late ?
01:40 <@deen> most maps have top ranks that will never be beat
01:40 <@deen> and everything runs fine like this now
01:40 <@deen> i would have liked them from the start
01:41 <@deen> and it's one of the things i want in hookrace
01:41 < laxa> Beh ;'(?
01:41 < laxa> I don't think you would have much to code to have it on ddnet.
01:42 <@deen> haha, you think so
01:42 < laxa> well, teerace has it working !
01:42 < laxa> everything is open source
01:42 <@deen> yet again, you're invited to port that to ddnet
01:42 <@deen> also support for it on the websites
01:43 <@deen> and no, we can't store the demos in memory, because ddnet servers don't have enough memory
01:43 < laxa> You don't have 1 gb of free memory ?
01:49 <@deen> no...
01:50 < laxa> Beh, bad then :(
01:50 < laxa> Go hookrace then.
01:50 < laxa> But it's gonna be same problem.
01:50 < laxa> Not enough ram.
01:55 < laxa> deen: crash on demo player.
01:55 <@deen> nice
01:58 < laxa> deen: pending file upload on skype for you.

08:58 < EastByte> laxa: No, I'm not in france
09:01 < EastByte> I needed to use a france ip to connect to your ts, since my ger one seems to be blocked
12:13 < CookieMichal> Good morning
12:29 <@deen> Good monring CookieMichal 
12:38 < laxa> EastByte: no IP is blocked, you should be able to connect on my TS from any IP.
12:38 < laxa> Except EryX's IP
12:39 < EastByte> it's a shared ip of a vpn provider
12:39 < EastByte> it might be blocked by ovh
12:39 <@deen> and this is why i don't like banning people, laxa.
12:39 < laxa> EastByte: I have online
12:39 < laxa> what message do you have when you try to connect on the TS ?
12:40 < EastByte> ts just timeouts on connect
12:40 < laxa> wtf
12:40 < laxa> what adress do you use ?
12:40 < EastByte> wait
12:40 < EastByte> do you mean the addr I connect to?
12:41 < EastByte> I tested tw.ddnet.tw and the proddrace (dunno) domain
12:41 < laxa> test this : ts.ddnet.tw
12:41 < laxa> ddracepro.net
12:41 < EastByte> ah I mean ts.ddnet.tw
12:41 < laxa> 195.154.72.184
12:41 < laxa> test this too
12:41 < laxa> this is really weird
12:42 < EastByte> need to init my vm first
12:43 < laxa> TS is working on linux 
12:43 < EastByte> ya I know
12:43 < EastByte> the vpn client runs in a vm
12:43 < EastByte> because it's not open
12:43 < EastByte> okay works now
12:44 < EastByte> only tested it for 2 times before
13:18 < Savander> hi
13:35 <@deen> hi Savander 
13:41 <@deen> Savander: did you wonder about how players are killed when /save is used?
13:41 < Savander> i know how
13:41 <@deen> tell me^^
13:41 < Savander> pPlayer->KIllCharacter(-2);
13:41 < Savander> in code
13:42 <@deen> in which file?
13:42 < Savander> don't remember which file, but wait
13:42 < Savander> a second
13:42 < Savander> :P
13:42 < Savander> I was looking for it recently
13:42 < Savander> and i found xD..
13:42 <@deen> I have it
13:43 <@deen> thanks
13:43 <@deen> because it's buggy
13:44 < Savander> kill protection or /save?
13:44 <@deen> save
13:44 < Savander> ahm
13:44 <@deen> it shouldn't be KillCharacter(-2)
13:44 <@deen> i think it should be Die(ownID, -2)
13:44 <@deen> oh wait
13:44 <@deen> that's the same, weird
13:45 < Savander> buy, what happens?
13:45 < Savander> btw*
13:45 <@deen> the switches are not reset
13:45 <@deen> when you save
13:47 < Savander> 	m_NumSwitchers = m_pController->GameServer()->Collision()->m_NumSwitchers;
13:47 < Savander> ?
13:47 < Savander> it save switch i guess? or not
13:47 <@deen> no
13:47 < Savander> switchers*
13:47 <@deen> just the number of switches
13:48 < Savander> ah wait
13:48 < Savander> but switchers are saved
13:49 < Savander> for team
13:49 <@deen> yes, but they are not reset
13:49 <@deen> you can open switches, save
13:49 <@deen> and then join the same team again, without loading
13:49 <@deen> and the swithces are still open
13:49 < Savander> ahh
13:49 <@deen> great cheat
13:50 < Savander> so then, when you /save, just reset switch at the end?
13:50 <@deen> that should happen automatically already
13:50 <@deen> i'm trying to find out why it doesn't
14:05 < Savander> where reset switch is ?
14:06 < Savander> deen
14:06 < Savander> someone have bot or smth
14:06 < Savander> repeat everything
14:06 < Savander> xD
14:06 < Savander> in one second
14:07 < Savander> repeat messages ofc
14:07 < Savander> "MADARA"
14:08 <@deen> so? he will just get muted
14:09 < Savander> bot ! xD
14:09 < laxa> Savander: tricks for you : grep -rH "string to search" location
14:10 < Savander> hmm?
14:10 < Savander> on windows?
14:10 < Savander> nice
14:11 < laxa> deen: I wanted to test a map, but it's not yet on testserver, it's called Spallok.
14:12 < laxa> Savander: on UNIX system lol, you don't have such feature on windows :(.

18:38 < laxa> deen: new bug !
18:39 < laxa> When having /showothers to 1, the progress bar on vote is empty.
18:54 <@deen> not for me
18:54 < laxa> well
18:54 < laxa> it's not cause of /showothers 1
18:55 < laxa> but sometimes it happens
18:55 < laxa> bar is empty
19:23 < laxa> Verification 7.1 finished
19:23 < laxa> 2 more 3 stars map to finish <3
20:04 < Savander> nolife xD
21:04 < Savander> Wow
21:04 < Savander> best reason to kick
21:04 < Savander> "AFK"
21:12 <@deen> ^^
21:12 <@deen> you were probably in the way
21:37 < Savander> nope
21:38 < Savander> at the start
22:09 < laxa> deen: please, can I update 3.9 to a decent version of the map ?
22:09 < laxa> there are no unfreeze at all
22:10 < laxa> it's a pain to play the map :(
22:12 <@deen> laxa: and then you get a better time than everyone else, nice...
22:12 < laxa> I honestly don't care about my time.
22:12 < laxa> But the map really sux this way.
22:12 <@deen> but other people will get a better time then
22:12 <@deen> it's unfair to change a map like this
23:12 < laxa> Yeah I know, but it's so annoying, what the fuck happend when the map was release then :(. I had the good version of my server.
23:17 < Savander> deen: idk why, but probably unmute doesn't work
23:17 < Savander> sometimes
23:20 <@deen> =/
23:29 < laxa> deen: what's correct bam command to compile ddnet ?
23:29 <@deen> bam release
23:29 < laxa> hum ok, I don't want the client xD
23:29 <@deen> bam server_release
23:30 < laxa> ok thanks <3
23:30 < laxa> Since you don't allow me to train on your test servers, I have to set up everything :@
23:30 <@deen> meh, you can train there
23:30 <@deen> just the testers come to me and complain
23:30 <@deen> test servers are holy for them
23:31 < laxa> well, I was training verification 3.9 and you came to tell me I wasn't welcomed
23:31 < laxa> so I'll make my own training server
23:31 <@deen> yeah, because testers told me that
23:31 < laxa> there are 3 test servers -_-
23:33 < laxa> server release has SQL inside it ?
23:33 <@deen> no
23:33 <@deen> server_sql_release
23:34 < laxa> If I launch the server without touching any .cfg command, just replacing my old ddrace binary, it should work properly right ?
23:34 <@deen> i don't know
23:35 < laxa> We will see that :p
23:35 < laxa> GRRRR
23:35 < laxa> compile failed...
23:35 <@deen> boost missing probably
23:36 < laxa> server without compiled successfully, and SQL did not, you say boost ?
23:36 <@deen> ah
23:36 <@deen> then i don't know
23:37 < laxa> Apparently it's boost missing
23:37 < laxa> What's the package name ? :)
23:38 < laxa> ok got it : libboost-dev
