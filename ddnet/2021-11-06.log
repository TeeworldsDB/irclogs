00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> hello
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> i wanna create my map for me and my friends
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> how can i do it?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ctrl-shift-e for editor
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> edit it, run your map on https://trashmap.ddnet.tw/ to test with your friends
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> how to place dirt blocks?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0ljtNtiijU
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Nick Joy ur deen-approved
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see what u meab
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see what u mean
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well my thought is that if you change the map in the editor, you will override player changes
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well I try the simpliest solution first.
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you just wouldn't
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe if ur editing when no one is playing that's fine
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> yup, multiplayer messes things up.
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could also combine the new map file in editor with the player changes
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but then u have to decide: who gets priority?
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably the map editor
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well since you are in the editor (and probably singleplayer), you wouldn't move an inch
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> while the game's running
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you have to restructure how map saving works too
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which is NOT an easy task i imagine
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you have to inject player changes before the normal ddnet editor write step
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well tee position isn't the issue
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's if they place tiles in game
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well, not the saving part, it would just simply overwrite it. But then the server needs to adapt on that change and somehow present entities which shouldn't be "spawnable" or something
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> ooooooor,
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea, I think if u save map in editor anyway, map reloads as normal
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only hot reload stuff (which isn't actually reloading btw) is just player updates
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> could use quads to present changes and use Qshar's KoG-Move plugin
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess i should just call it map mutability
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "hot reload" is not accurate in this context
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I started coding "hot realoads" once but never finished, not too easy
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> kog-move quads are updated each time and literally act like a tile
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> combining it with simple overwriting and proper reloads, it could work fine.
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes this was my idea
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> it's like adding interactive animations.
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> kinda
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds command blocks when?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> we have tunes for that :kek:
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean you could make the client understand mid-session entity change too
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no reason u can't
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye lol
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean arbitrary server command tune would be
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wowow
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but heavily abusable
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only good for custom mode
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and shouldn't be player accessible
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well building up a game using tunes is not ideal, rather just finding out certain features to make a fun mode.
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> (similar to mc command blocks haha)
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i still want a server that understands many modes
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and can switch between them
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> multiplexed modes + maps
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> you can like, make bots appear and make things with them, but not for building it's for sure
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> has anyone done both at the same time? @Learath2
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry it's like 2am I can stop tagging u
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone did it, sounds like a clusterfuck üòÑ
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Ain't sleeping quite yet
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm very into the unix philosophy, do one thing, do it well
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wanna be able to access UI for my friends in the same server
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and cross-join mode/map
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A supermod sounds like the complete opposite of that
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> one server binary
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> oh yeah, the ingame GUI
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :Pepega:
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye but it has practical stuff too
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe then it's a network thing
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> if only we could get even a proper gif support
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :kekw:
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and some protocol for map/mode/player discovery ?
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a separate chat server so you can chat with friends cross-server would be enough imo
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I know this was planned when accounts get added but ye
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least the cross chat for friends
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I think there should be more federation like master
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you could federate with a chat server
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but u have to register a name like IRC
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> isk
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk*
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2am is too late for specifics üòÑ
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> otherwise mentions are a headache
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want accounts, I want cross-server whispers, don't know anything else
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I think map discovery would be cool with accounts
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like /join louis just goes to the account louis' server
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but ofc UI as well
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we have it already but just for accounta
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we have it already but just for accounts
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Accounts :feelscryman:
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> it's like drama war all over again
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> next patch we remove all ui
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only console
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> <a:whooo:631548554267328514>
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> imgui only for ui
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog console client
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i finally fixed window resize and scroll im ready \:D
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wtf motd hacks?
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does bash have some sort of wildcard to get the last file by name in a directory? I always need that
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I bet zsh has fancy stuff like that
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do you always need that?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `list=(*.png); echo ${list[-1]}`
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> via irc?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking more along the lines of xmpp
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wat u guys talkin about
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you don't see what a reply is to
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are talking about "accounts, cross-server whispers"
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ty deen
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> where are here two calls to prepared statement and two times binding the strings? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8ecb3646ac146726df9881a43ae7eddcee31c64f/src/game/server/score.cpp#L789

11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> with seemingly the same aBuf sql query
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> what is good/cheap vds hosting that accepts paypal?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> most of them?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fok cheap
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hetzner for example
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> servercompass.com/?r=CHILLER go stonks with code CHILLER !
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> axaxaxax
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or Linode
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i just used one that dont have paypal but now i need to use it and i ddint used any other hostings
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> k thx
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> online.net also takes paypal, I've used them before, their customer service people are a bit mean though
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> haha
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> servercompass has very good service
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> digitalocean also accepts paypal
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I pay nearly all ddnet servers via paypal
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rich deen
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> kimisufi also used to take paypal, haven't used it in a year or two tho
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> secured.gg
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> is 15.6 released? wondered about making a minor server change for the new extended entity
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> need to rerelease it, waiting for a review by trml or heinrich on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4300
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, yes (trml is me), but I think heinrich knows these things better
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jap
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jup
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jop
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow @qshar what is kog 2.0? i just noticed the qshar.com website did get a big update o.O
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> are u also upgrading the ddnet base ? i think u used a similar version like i did
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ddnet 9 masterrace
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> what happend to 15.6 ?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> got taken back
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was too good update to be free
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ddnet will cost 5$ starting from 15.6
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Power Mini> Why? üò≠
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i trol omg
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it had some buggos i think and got taken back temporarly
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 are you available to review https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4300/files ?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> nice i only update every 10 updates anyway
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devil.> did it still the same proplem
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hmm i got some UB or shit setting a character variable how can i trace back the root cause? I tried gdb watch but that dient work due to local scope so i tried watch -location but then it did not break when the variable changed
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2

14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> agree milk is the best part of coffee
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Local scope?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea idk
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its a ccharacter member var
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe try asan, ubsan and my last patch moving characters onto heap
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wats ur last patch wdym by that
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> asan ubsan give me random things idk what it trys to tell me
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #4270
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4270
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i got that in already
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im on lastest ddnet
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i feel like asan and ubsan cause something that the actual bug triggered but not the actual bug
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u know what i mean?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> stuff like `runtime error: -nan is outside the range of representable values of type 'int'`
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not sure what to do with this
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or this https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/317
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> =\>0x0c187fff85a0\: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao faf af afafafaf
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but can i watch a character member variable with gdb?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok nvm i have 2iq
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does /practice reset draggers?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually, seems like it reset also doors
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> hey, is it possible to make it so dummy_reset also resets the hammerfly bind? currently if you have leftclick held down on dummy, or hammerfly bind enabled and you reset dummy it doesnt actually reset that
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds sane
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but im sure some madlad dummy player is used to this bug
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> isnt dummy drag hammerfly using that?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually, it's /r that triggers reset
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> access\_level has no defaults right?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so a mod rcon without config has access to no commands?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yeah but for me its hard to get used to it when my hammerfly bind is on the right side of the keyboard cuz i never need to use it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> deepfly is so much better
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> hf bind is unnecesarry
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> if u have deepfly
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i am trying to switch from hammer to deep fly and i find my self using hammerfly a lot im not rly used to deep yet
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but deepfly is essentially using hammerfly so the stuck inputs affect deeply
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and im pretty sure that plays a essential role in dummy dragging while hammerflying with dummy
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> could it be possible to control the field of view in the editor with ` W, A, S, D ` ?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> got told to summon you @Learath2 for that one
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i made some console editor once
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> eh not console i mean keyboard driven
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think i used arrow keys
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u could also place tiles and shit without mouse xd
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not sure if wasd are a good choice
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> are they even free?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> arrows are now used tho thats why WASD
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> and i think those are free
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i see
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> if not its some useless stuff anyway =P
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> and  WASD would be better anyway than arrow keys
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> they seem pretty used to me
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> for what ?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> d is used in destructive brush
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ctrl+d
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> s to save
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a to append
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> but all ctrl+
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> didnt want that to be shift or ctrl anyway
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah the way i did it back in the days was arrow keys is slow navigation and ctrl+ arrow keys is faster
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> two speeds do make sense otherwise its either annoyingly slow to travel or a bit jumpy on close distance
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Sorah\: and what are the directions?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> are u moving in the world or are u moving the world?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if u press a do all tiles move left or right?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if you are ingame and you want the map to move left you walk right \:D
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> moving in the world ofc :D
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ofc xd
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye it feels more obvious
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> couldn't the speed be based on the zoom level ?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it is
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but still
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> im fine with one if its based on zoom ye  dont mind a second one  with shift+   if thats unused
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> :heartw:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> did you know you can still have aimbot without dummy?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> i even want it for ddnet
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Boti.\: watch out wat u say or heinrich the banhammer will fok u for discuissing chit in public chat axaxaax
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> not promoting cheats
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> didnt mention anything
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> i just said its possible
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> i want to report it as a bug
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> would be perfect as a map setting too :)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Would be weird to have random maps that you can't connect dummy on, most would think the map's bugged. Connecting dummy doesn't work at all times as it is.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> For PVP modes it'd probably be fine
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> :(
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Would be weird to have random maps that you can't connect dummy on, most would think the client's bugged. Connecting dummy doesn't work at all times as it is.
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> what about just not same team as main ? :boo:
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Would be weird to have random maps that you can't connect dummy on, most would think the client's bugged. Connecting dummy doesn't work at all times as it is; or is severely delayed when connecting.
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but yea using dummy can also be an advantage on ddnet
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> could say the same about deepfly and that got fixed too
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> dummy's extremely OP, yea. That's widely agreed on
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> also there should be a valid reason why it would be forced  so i guess 1 in 100 maps can justify that if even that
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Just seems like something that's a bit late to add
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> meh i rage quitted my map from 2015 because of dummys
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> talked with deen about it too and he didnt like it either so uhm ye
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I somewhat think it'd be nice to force dummy users into a team, to prevent toxic behavior such as "don't touch my dummy!" or completely ignoring other tees.
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If you want to play entirely alone, you should just join a team
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But that creates some issues as well, such as team 0 skips becoming unrealistic to beat.
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Again, an idea that's too late to really implement
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> yes
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> and thanks for reminding me.. i got it switched
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> i wanted to force it too to play it with a dummy and only with a dummy >.<
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> i wanted to force it  to play it with a dummy and only with a dummy >.<
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> i wanted to force it to play it with a dummy and only with a dummy >.<
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Dummy maps already exist, what would be the difference?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> that you can only be with a dummy in a team and not another human
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> What's the point? Having your dummy is always superior, no?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> almost yes
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> `float EyeSeparation = (0.075f - 0.010f * absolute(Direction.x)) * BaseSize;`
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Whats "BaseSize" and whats the exact position or variables / values i can use and understand?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> 
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Also what is the values for the feet position that you gather from the skin.png to transform it into a real tee?

19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> always do permalinks when linking to gitlab/github press 'y' on any page to get it: https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/bb9460c802d7ac1796c0400193b6b7dead2b801c/src/bin/check_ddnet.rs#L100
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (@Patiga otherwise the links will go bad when you push a change)
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @nuborn you're trml? üòÆ
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2\: just to make sure you are more annoyed, can you look on fokkonauts server why macos client is crashing?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I tested if its opengl related, but the emulator uses 1.x, so it's probs some macos weirdness, bcs asan cant find it
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe it still is some out of memory error, fokkonauts map is really huge
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Brokecdx- compiled my notes on how to render a tee. tried to make it straight-forward, gl :)
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/906617147051081768/tee_notes.txt
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @heinrich5991 damn yeah I always forget :/
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> well, yes üòõ
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> tyty
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @nuborn is it on purpose that your name on this discord isn't trml? or should I just rename you to avoid this confusion? ^^
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (my name is also not the same on github and discord :D)
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ryozuki too
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lots of confusion üòÑ
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can right click on people
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and add note

20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <admin abuse: a case study> :poggers:
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> sure, you can rename me, didn't really think about the name when I made an account here (or on github)
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ‚ù§Ô∏è
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> nice üòÑ

20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> hmm, could also change my ingame name to trml, or my github name to nuborn üòõ
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also you being on matrix makes it rly dificult to ping u

20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (@Ryozuki)
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://youtu.be/0dq1BpvjWEE?t=18
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be epic to see how ddnet movement looks with this feet animations xd
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD, looks like rayman
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Bloody hell
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> Hey, does cl_nameplates_strong not scale with cl_nameplates_size on purpose?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Discord Mod
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thanks
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm too late
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm I'm still losing like 500fps between 15.5 and 15.6 :/
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2\: if you have a profiler on macos you could combine both
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> checking what uses so much CPU and what causes the crash xd
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen downloads points to 15.6.1 download but homepage shows download for the yanked 15.6
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Yo, do you guys have a vw format converter which works as Teeworlds Audio?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I can't seem to make it work
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wdym
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Oh, I kinda forgot we have frequencies to work with.
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you need 16bits per sample
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ffmpeg can do it
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> the ingame files... you know audios as wv
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/906663848256348170/unknown.png
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What does he need
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt get it
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Those use the frequencies inside the client and I just noticed it now
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :monkaT:
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he wants custom audio files
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I have a different format or what?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> U
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I forgot that in order to actualy hear the sound, ya need to change the audio file to an ajusted frequency
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> according to the client
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/906664286984757288/unknown.png
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Idk what a sound frequency is but shouldn‚Äôt the formatter handle that?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So many sound options lmao @ryo
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> It should be the **sample rate** :pepedead:
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do you got a wv file but it‚Äôs wrong sample rate?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What ever I‚Äôm not getting it
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> you just got it
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> As jupjapjapstor said ffmpeg is your friend always
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Well however I try it, exact frequencies, lower bitrate, nothing works
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=5773
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well this worked for me. Had to convert WAV onto WV
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :pepedead: :gungungun:
