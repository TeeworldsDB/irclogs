00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> hello
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> i wanna create my map for me and my friends
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> how can i do it?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ctrl-shift-e for editor
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> edit it, run your map on https://trashmap.ddnet.tw/ to test with your friends
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> how to place dirt blocks?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0ljtNtiijU
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HeroIAm> thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Nick Joy ur deen-approved
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see what u meab
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see what u mean
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well my thought is that if you change the map in the editor, you will override player changes
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well I try the simpliest solution first.
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you just wouldn't
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe if ur editing when no one is playing that's fine
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> yup, multiplayer messes things up.
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could also combine the new map file in editor with the player changes
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but then u have to decide: who gets priority?
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably the map editor
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well since you are in the editor (and probably singleplayer), you wouldn't move an inch
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> while the game's running
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you have to restructure how map saving works too
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which is NOT an easy task i imagine
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you have to inject player changes before the normal ddnet editor write step
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well tee position isn't the issue
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's if they place tiles in game
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well, not the saving part, it would just simply overwrite it. But then the server needs to adapt on that change and somehow present entities which shouldn't be "spawnable" or something
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> ooooooor,
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea, I think if u save map in editor anyway, map reloads as normal
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only hot reload stuff (which isn't actually reloading btw) is just player updates
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> could use quads to present changes and use Qshar's KoG-Move plugin
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess i should just call it map mutability
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "hot reload" is not accurate in this context
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I started coding "hot realoads" once but never finished, not too easy
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> kog-move quads are updated each time and literally act like a tile
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> combining it with simple overwriting and proper reloads, it could work fine.
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes this was my idea
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> it's like adding interactive animations.
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> kinda
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds command blocks when?
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> we have tunes for that :kek:
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean you could make the client understand mid-session entity change too
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no reason u can't
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye lol
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean arbitrary server command tune would be
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wowow
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but heavily abusable
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only good for custom mode
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and shouldn't be player accessible
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> well building up a game using tunes is not ideal, rather just finding out certain features to make a fun mode.
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> (similar to mc command blocks haha)
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i still want a server that understands many modes
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and can switch between them
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> multiplexed modes + maps
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> you can like, make bots appear and make things with them, but not for building it's for sure
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> has anyone done both at the same time? @Learath2
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry it's like 2am I can stop tagging u
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone did it, sounds like a clusterfuck üòÑ
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Ain't sleeping quite yet
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm very into the unix philosophy, do one thing, do it well
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wanna be able to access UI for my friends in the same server
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and cross-join mode/map
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A supermod sounds like the complete opposite of that
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> one server binary
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> oh yeah, the ingame GUI
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :Pepega:
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye but it has practical stuff too
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe then it's a network thing
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> if only we could get even a proper gif support
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :kekw:
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and some protocol for map/mode/player discovery ?
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a separate chat server so you can chat with friends cross-server would be enough imo
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I know this was planned when accounts get added but ye
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least the cross chat for friends
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I think there should be more federation like master
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you could federate with a chat server
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but u have to register a name like IRC
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> isk
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk*
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2am is too late for specifics üòÑ
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> otherwise mentions are a headache
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want accounts, I want cross-server whispers, don't know anything else
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I think map discovery would be cool with accounts
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like /join louis just goes to the account louis' server
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but ofc UI as well
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we have it already but just for accounta
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we have it already but just for accounts
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Accounts :feelscryman:
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> it's like drama war all over again
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> next patch we remove all ui
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only console
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> <a:whooo:631548554267328514>
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> imgui only for ui
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog console client
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i finally fixed window resize and scroll im ready \:D
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wtf motd hacks?
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does bash have some sort of wildcard to get the last file by name in a directory? I always need that
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I bet zsh has fancy stuff like that
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do you always need that?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `list=(*.png); echo ${list[-1]}`
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> via irc?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking more along the lines of xmpp
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wat u guys talkin about
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you don't see what a reply is to
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are talking about "accounts, cross-server whispers"
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ty deen
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> where are here two calls to prepared statement and two times binding the strings? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8ecb3646ac146726df9881a43ae7eddcee31c64f/src/game/server/score.cpp#L789

11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> haha
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> servercompass has very good service
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> digitalocean also accepts paypal
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I pay nearly all ddnet servers via paypal
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rich deen
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> kimisufi also used to take paypal, haven't used it in a year or two tho
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> secured.gg
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> is 15.6 released? wondered about making a minor server change for the new extended entity
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> need to rerelease it, waiting for a review by trml or heinrich on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4300
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, yes (trml is me), but I think heinrich knows these things better
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jap
