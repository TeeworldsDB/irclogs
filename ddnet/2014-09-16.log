00:05 < laxa> deen: give me the specifics about the rank announcer
00:28 < laxa> !fr-en calculatrice
00:28 < Nimda> Translation: calculator
01:21 < laxa> deen: if you want the bot to announces new ranks for ddnet, I'll you to change the website so I don't need to make 300 pages load to check if the rank done is good enough
01:21 < laxa> maybe like this : 00:59: Toxic by ShæÐowflæme (62:34) #25
01:22 < laxa> or : 00:59: Toxic by ShæÐowflæme (62:34) rank 12
01:22 < laxa> or : 00:59: ShæÐowflæme made rank 12 on Toxic (62:34)
01:23 < laxa> or maybe I can do without, but I need to check 2 pages to check the rank :)
01:25 <@deen> sorry laxa, no time now. was just an idea, we can talk about it in a few days
01:25 < laxa> maybe I'll code it tomorrow night, no idea
01:25 < laxa> or tomorrow at work if they don't give me work
01:33 < laxa> Good
01:33 < laxa> I made Honky_Tonk_Man say he is a ego bastard for making Honkstar 3 a really faily map :p
01:34 < laxa> I am pretty sure he won't be able to finish his own map.
01:34 < laxa> I am betting 5 euros that he won't finish it in 1 week :p
01:34 < laxa> Well, it's already too late, I am off, bye <3
01:35 < laxa> deen: I gave youtube logs to Ama, he made the channel quite better ! Hope you like the new display.
02:12 <@deen> thanks

16:13 < Savander> YOlo
16:13 < laxa_work> I guess that's a compliment
16:25 < Savander> Uuuu
16:25 < Savander> uhuhuuu uuuu 
17:55 < EastBite> lel just rocketfly2 isn't possible solo?
18:29 < laxa> huh ?
18:29 < laxa> It is possible solo EastBite
18:34 < EastBite> I don't understand the part where the tees switch
18:36 < laxa_work> EastBite: which server you are on ?
18:37 < EastBite> wait
18:38 < EastBite> laxa_work: find me
18:54 < laxa> deen: are you there ? I have a quick question about a bug
18:54 < laxa> so here is what I do :
18:55 < laxa> - connect to my server - log into rcon - change rcon - do rcon right 3 times
18:55 < laxa> then I am banned
19:03 <@deen> laxa: that's because of the rcon spoofing protection. find a nice fix for it please
19:03 < laxa> hum xD
20:38 < Tobii> deen: maybe logout everyone from rcon when the pw changed
20:41 < laxa> yeah, I am learning git, I just got 10/10 on first exercices :p
20:42 <@deen> Tobii: yes, but the client also needs to know about this happenin
20:44 < Tobii> just send a NETMSG_RCON_AUTH_STATUS with authed 0 should work
20:44 < laxa> Tobii: wanna bet ?
20:44 < laxa> I bet 10 euros that deen will ask you to do it yourself :p
20:45 < Tobii> ^^
20:45 <@deen> yeah, would be nice. I'm busy
20:45 < Tobii> ok, i'll try
21:43 < laxa> EastBite: please, give me API, GET syntax :)
21:43 < laxa> I wanna code !
21:44 < EastBite> well, do a GET request like this:
21:44 < EastBite> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/server/ip/port/
21:44 < laxa> I thought you had an API to find informations about player ?
21:45 < EastBite> yes, also
21:45 < laxa> I am more interested by that :p
21:45 < EastBite> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/get/nameless%20tee/matchall
21:45 < EastBite> the parameters work like this: /get/<name>/<clan>
21:45 < EastBite> matchall stands for everything
21:46 < laxa> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/ddracepro.net/8303 not working
21:46 < EastBite> ip only
21:46 < laxa> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/195.154.72.184/8303
21:46 < laxa> not working either :p
21:47 < EastBite> ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/server/195.154.72.184/8303
21:47 < EastBite> /get/ <- for player requestsm /server/ for servers
21:47 < Savander> what hte fuck
21:47 < Savander> is it?
21:48 < EastBite> laxa: to parse the response http://php.net/manual/de/function.json-decode.php should work
21:48 < laxa> thanks
21:48 < laxa> wtf
21:48 < laxa> your server API do give domain, but that doesn't work in reverse
21:49 < laxa> also gametype is truncated
21:49 < EastBite> yes, I'm only checking for srv.ip == ip right now
21:49 < EastBite> ya, because it's too long
21:49 < EastBite> TestDDraceNetwor
21:49 < laxa> ok
21:50 < laxa> anyway, I wanna code player status only for now
21:51 < EastBite> a /get/ response looks like this: { players: [], servers: []}
21:51 < EastBite> [] = array
21:51 < laxa> EastBite: omg, now when I search on php.net, I get german...
21:52 < EastBite> each player has the srvId attribute which points to servers[srcId]
21:52 < EastBite> geer! :D
21:52 <@deen> laxa: fix by calling this: http://php.net/manual/zh/function.json-decode.php
21:52 < laxa> xD
21:52 < EastBite> :)
21:53 < Savander> http://php.net/manual/pl/install.general.php
21:53 < Savander> http://php.net/manual/pl/function.json-decode.php
21:53 < Savander> xd
21:59 < o_be_one> Savander, u was on novice ger ddnet :D
21:59 < Savander> when?:)
21:59 < o_be_one> your afk tees has blocked many players lol xD
21:59 < o_be_one> it was like 30 min ago
22:03 < EastBite> Savander: blocker!
22:03 < Savander> lol
22:03 < Savander> rly?
22:03 < Savander> no way
22:03 < Savander> im not playing 30 minutes ago
22:03 < Savander> so it wasn't me
22:04 < EastBite> hm timeout protections keeps for 16 min :D
22:04 < EastBite> maybe you didnt notice
22:04 < Savander> hmm
22:04 < Savander> i just close ddnet
22:04 < Savander> but on windows
22:04 < Savander> is weird
22:04 < Savander> i always have
22:04 < Savander> "Program not responding"
22:04 < Savander> when i closing ddnet by console
22:04 < EastBite> xd
22:04 < Savander> :P
22:05 < Savander> So ye, maybe it was timeout protection
22:05 < Savander> or not
22:11 < laxa> EastBite: what function converts spaces into %20 for URL ?
22:11 < laxa> urlencode doesn't work like that :(
22:12 < EastBite> curl doesn't accept spaces?
22:12 < laxa> I don't use CURL
22:12 < laxa> I use a libHTTP from noother
22:12 < EastBite> well I have no idea :D
22:17 < laxa> ok
22:17 < laxa> it's rawurlencode()
22:20 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/Pki805cy
