12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> daily reminder that nimda is broken and it doesnt give voice on irc
13:09 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: you can talk without voice now
14:32 < Ryozuki> test
14:32 < Ryozuki> thanks
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Can anyone explain to a noob how to compile client?
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes, you can start by installing a GNU/Linux distro ðŸ˜Ž
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you can try reading the instructions on gh
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Windows 10 integrated bash console in it
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ðŸ¤” would this be helpful
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Evgesha https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please report problems
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Already have VS and python installed
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> so just need to instacll CMake and compile I guess
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with that manual, you don't need to manually install python/cmake, you can install it via the vs installer
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know if manually installing cmake works, manually installing python probablyâ„¢ does

18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Something is not installed

18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Curl for example
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> try installing curl
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Evgesha how did you download ddnet?
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> simply downloaded ddnet-master
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try downloading it with msvs, like in the tutorial
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> downloading ddnet-master misses some things, for example curl
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, download the git repository in the git shell like described here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/#cloning
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git clone --recursive
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> yes, just installed git console and clones libraries
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> didnt really understood what i've done
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but it seems that I succesfully builded
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> yes, just installed git console and cloned libraries
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> why not
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @heinrich5991  https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> just step 25

19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> as it was after I tried to just clone and open project in VS
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> where the fuck this "DDNet.exe" should come from?
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and why it works for you
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> idk
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ~~
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like I should try with russian windows, there were some problems in localizations
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Evgesha is that russian?
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> y
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> there can't be localization problem
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seemed to work fine on english windows, but I heard about errors in german windows
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> so whats wrong about it
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's printed in the console at the bottom?
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602199471035514890/unknown.png
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> what it should print lol
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> nothing
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> `Opening Repositories:`
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ...
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you installed cmake support in microsoft visual studio?
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> not sure
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> everying is from ur guide
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you followed it?
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> y
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> including the stuff in the installer?
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ofc
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> lets check for cmake btw
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the combo box with "Git" down there
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there a selection for "CMake"?
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> hmmm
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> wait a little
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> may be it did not install some packages I've makred
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> may be it did not install some packages I've marked
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> including CMAKE lol
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> why
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> why VS
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I hope that's the problem
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's the vs way, it doesn't need to ever work properly with dozens of people going out of their way to defend a 20gb IDE in 2019
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ok, that didnt help
20:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @heinrich5991
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the log window with the combobox with "â€¦ git"
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you select something with cmake there?
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> no
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> K, done it with CMAKE as I tried before
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Your tutorial sucks btw :3
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> lookin' on comments > its not working for like 95% of people
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay :/
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although I guess you're more likely to comment if it doesn't work
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 do you have any solution for my problem? I updated Visual Studio 2017 after lile 2 years or so, and now I cannot choose anothsr building config, so there is only x64-release
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like*
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut could you try deleting your cmakebuilds (or similar) folder so vs2017 regenerates it?
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, let me have a breakfast first
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (just woke up, lol)
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lol
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're in UTC+2, right?
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, indeed
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I have holidays and my day-night schedule is fucked :D
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> interesting interview o.O
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki much wow blender related
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they talk about machine learning tho xd
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a  lil
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZIVisG_no4
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @heinrich5991 I mean you need solution to this problem that occurres to 95% users trting your guide on step 25
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try to update it when I get hands on a windows computer again
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Evgesha as he said people it doesn't work for are more likely to post, it's most prolly not 95% ðŸ™‚
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's relatively easy to get it working with a sane compiler like mingw in a sane environment like cygwin or msys2
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news, I messed around with opengl a bit today, so cumbersome to work with in the core profile
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 200~ lines to get a triangle on the screen ðŸ˜›
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have heard the new cool shit is vulkan ðŸ˜›
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkan also needs quite some lines of code to setup
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> true, perhaps even mroe
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even more, but I decided to polish up my core profile opengl before diving into vulkan
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very different from the fixed pipeline rendering of the old opengl :/
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I am trying to apply your reserved slots thing to my mod, but it says maximum is not defined. That cant be because I always applied every serevrside patch from ddnet master to my mod
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How do I get it to work?
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> output of `grep maximum src/base/math.h` please
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh?
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in order to solve your problem, I'd like to have the output of the above command
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it gives no output
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in ddnet there's a funciton called `maximum` in `src/base/math.h`
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the problem
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Alright, thanks
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> introduced by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/93d14a1ecabcd2662915b1b2549a971b885b16e5
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thank you heinrich
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to fix that but I couldn't figure out how to stop windows.h from adding in the stupid min max macros of their own
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 My mod does not have the color changes applied, since that only affects the client. Can I use the old min and max instead of applying the new which says maximum and minimum?
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can also just define the new maximum and minimum functions in addition to the old ones
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does that make any sense?
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a difference?
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why sould I do it then
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just in case you want to keep the code as close to ddnet as possible
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ehm what
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did it with max now, but if i ctrl+click it it leads me to minwindef.h
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will do it with maximum instead
