00:05 < laxa> I hate myself now
00:05 < laxa> Can't even give you the errors I get from compilation
00:05 < laxa> cause it's in french
00:05 <@deen> don't need any includes
00:06 <@deen> and don't have any requirements for building i think
00:06 < laxa> Then why
00:06 < laxa> if (!m_pClient->m_Snap.m_SpecInfo.m_Active)
00:06 < laxa> is making 3 lines of errors ?
00:06 <@deen> I don
00:06 <@deen> 't know
00:07 < laxa> ok I got this
00:07 < laxa> I'll try to translate
00:07 < laxa> m_pClient : identifier not declared
00:08 < laxa> the left part of '->m_Snap' is type unknown
00:08 <@deen> then you're probably in a static function
00:08 < laxa> left part of '.m_SpecInfo' must have a class/struct/union
00:09 < laxa> void CClient::SendInput()
00:09 <@deen> if i have to look this all up for you i could write it myself =/
00:09 < laxa> not static
00:09 <@deen> Eh, SendInput is way wrong
00:09 <@deen> i saidcontrols.cpp
00:09 <@deen> if you do it in client it will definitely be wrong
00:10 < laxa> hum...
00:10 < laxa> Well, I give up for now then.
00:10 < laxa> the only m_Fire++ I found was in client.cpp
00:13 < laxa> I was amazed, a .tar.gz of /src is 700 KB for 100 000 lines of code
00:13 < laxa> so wtf...
00:13 <@deen> ?
00:14 <@deen> well, m_Active was wrong anyway^^
00:14 < laxa> that still doesn't explain why compiler cried.
00:14 < laxa> I used same line from other files
00:14 <@deen> because you were in the wrong file
00:14 <@deen> yes, but you're already inside the client
00:14 <@deen> what should m_pClient mean?...
00:14 < laxa> I have no clue xD
00:48 < laxa> Ok well, that was fun deen, but I'll sleep.
00:48 < laxa> Tomorrow I have a busy day, I'll spend the day in a salon for student to try make them go to my school :p.
01:03 <@deen> good night laxa

21:41 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen are u in there
21:41 <@deen> hi
21:41 < GoJEGrEEN> whats up
21:41 <@deen> Persian DDNet 0 players =/
21:41 < GoJEGrEEN> deen: i have problem from client
21:42 < GoJEGrEEN> hmm i know pro server cause that
21:42 <@deen> yes, maybe we can work together, Persian Pro + DDNet
21:42 < GoJEGrEEN> deen:  i cant use more than 1 command in consol
21:43 < GoJEGrEEN> for example when i use status
21:43 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: I know
21:43 <@deen> I expected you to come a few days ago^^
21:43 < GoJEGrEEN> i can use status anymore or other commands
21:43 <@deen> because you renamed DDraceNetwork mod to Persian Pro
21:43 < GoJEGrEEN> cant*
21:43 < GoJEGrEEN> yes
21:43 < GoJEGrEEN> and when i removed
21:44 < GoJEGrEEN> str_find_nocase(Info.m_aGameType, "ddracenetw")) this line
21:44 <@deen> if you put the name back to DDraceNetwork it works again :P
21:44 < GoJEGrEEN> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/b2f8f272db4eba89415f2ac72550109c5e984c02
21:44 < GoJEGrEEN> from this commit
21:44 < GoJEGrEEN> i know but why other servers
21:44 < GoJEGrEEN> work ok ?
21:44 <@deen> Because they don't have spoofing protection
21:45 <@deen> only ddnet has it
21:45 <@deen> and you took spoofing protection in the server but changed name
21:45 < GoJEGrEEN> aha
21:45 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/2cff296c25807bf4024a99291ef2715a304ff33a
21:46 <@deen> You can remove spoofing protection, but that's a bad idea
21:46 < GoJEGrEEN> hmm ok tnx
21:46 <@deen> I know someone in Iran uses spoofing to enter rcon commands
21:46 < GoJEGrEEN> can i remove if(RconAuthed() && str_find_nocase(Info.m_aGameType, "ddracenetw")) this line ?
21:46 <@deen> Or you can fuse with DDNet to become Persian Pro DDNet
21:46 <@deen> in ddnet-client?
21:46 < GoJEGrEEN> yes
21:46 <@deen> you should not do that, it will break all other servers
21:46 < GoJEGrEEN> hmm
21:47 < GoJEGrEEN> why people change gametype :/
21:47 < GoJEGrEEN> i dont understand
21:47 < GoJEGrEEN> :\
21:47 <@deen> because they want their own
21:47 <@deen> so it looks cool
21:47 <@deen> you can make it like this:
21:47 < GoJEGrEEN> i think its stolen idea
21:48 <@deen> if(RconAuthed() && (str_find_nocase(Info.m_aGameType, "ddracenetw") || str_find_nocase(Info.m_aGameType, "ProDDRace")
21:48 <@deen> )
21:48 < GoJEGrEEN> ye i know
21:48 <@deen> You're in contact with evil saeid, right?
21:48 < GoJEGrEEN> ye sometimes
21:49 <@deen> Would he be interested to make Persian Pro DDNet?
21:49 < GoJEGrEEN> do you have evil saeed yahoo id ?
21:49 <@deen> because the current Persian DDNet servers have no players
21:49 <@deen> and I think it would be nice if people in Iran could play with official ranks
21:49 < GoJEGrEEN> yes maybe but his vps is windows not linux
21:49 <@deen> yes, he said he wants to switch to Linux for me
21:50 < GoJEGrEEN> yes it would be nice
21:50 <@deen> but that was after bor already bought his VPS for me...
21:50 <@deen> so I couldn't say yes
21:50 <@deen> On Persian Pro I have 100-170, on DDNet persian 300-400
21:50 <@deen> ping
21:50 < GoJEGrEEN> do u want evil yahoo id ?
21:50 <@deen> no, i don't have yahoo
21:50 <@deen> He can come here if he is still interested
21:51 <@deen> he was here before, but i wasn't
21:51 < GoJEGrEEN> k i will tell him 
21:51 <@deen> Thanks
21:51 <@deen> I know someone else wants to run another Persian DDRace server
21:52 <@deen> http://teeworlds.ir/
21:52 <@deen> These people I think
21:52 < GoJEGrEEN> oh oh jiks ?
21:52 < GoJEGrEEN> i hate him
21:52 < GoJEGrEEN> :@
21:52 <@deen> Haha, I don't know him
21:52 <@deen> he was in the channel here a few times
21:52 < GoJEGrEEN> his so selfish
21:53 <@deen> It's better to have 1 good DDRace server in Iran than 2 who are fighting
21:53 <@deen> And I heard saeid and king wanted to fight^^
21:54 < GoJEGrEEN> yes :))) i dont know why
21:55 <@deen> I could set everything up on Linux so it works just like now + official ranks
21:57 < GoJEGrEEN> deen: i know i will tell evil 
21:57 <@deen> ok, thank you GoJEGrEEN 
21:57 < GoJEGrEEN> deen: tnx for time
21:57 < GoJEGrEEN> see u tommaro night
21:57 <@deen> good night GoJEGrEEN 
21:57 < GoJEGrEEN> bb goodluck
