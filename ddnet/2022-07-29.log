00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> trollencie
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> as a person whos currently addicted to factorio i agree
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also, i'm kind of curious as to what the future of the game will be. what features are in progress that people *know* will be in?
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <œÉ‚Ñì√≠‚ô°> is it possible to increase the number of characters in a message? Because sometimes you click send, but the message is not sent and you have to erase it gradually
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client and server should ideally have the same limit
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I believe the spam detection might get into your way there
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just tried it and without spam protection (no messages sent by me before I can send the full length message client allows
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but then on the next few attempts spam protection comes in if I don't wait long enough between messages
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> Client crashes on newest client when you do something in editor
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> is it shift-select?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> no
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> actually it works now again
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> and i think it was yea
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> What about making a web client inside ddnet client and verify there with recaptcha?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Before joining server, it pops out
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Better than going on external browser
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Tf not needed
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> And only ddnet verified servers can send ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not robot‚Äù pop out
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Hm okay, but ddnet client needs something refreshing. This is started being boring. üòå
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> At first point it‚Äôs sad that this verification is even needed
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Ddnet client needs new UI support sent by servers
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Custom text boxes on UI, etc‚Ä¶
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lets make a super fast client slow and bloated by adding web
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Web ui like windows 11
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Nah Ryozuki, u don‚Äôt get the point like 90% of the time. But whatever
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> libcef rendering a transparent bg page on top of the screen for all the ui. 16G ram usage gang
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is actually interesting. I do have a prototype that allows rendering information boxes from the server, but I found it way too rigid to do anything with
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES3_SusAlt:
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not useful for much more than help boxes for things like tutorials
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Which verification are u talkin about tho
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> What about other mods?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1002591121853132850/1734cd06a6a74f4ccaa8b05c1b9be369.png
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Look, even login yo could be cool
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Look, even login ui could be cool
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean everyone can just send a `NETMSG_INFO` but it‚Äôs just not very useful. You can position the box, you can size the box and it can only have text
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Anti ddos, it‚Äôs sad that people still doing it. Killing game
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Me still waiting that someone finally say yes for moving tiles as it can be something new for racing
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm already working on these, just havent had time to touch them in a while
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Yes I know, that's why I'm trying to work on that dynamic way to whitelist someone when he's in for more than 5min
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> That could also semi-fix the issue deen had with those people having different IPs
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> People who were already ingame will be whitelisted already by their real IP
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had some very annoying issues with moving hookthru tiles and rq‚Äôd it
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Lol I guess so yes, looks hard
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why don‚Äôt you utilize a secondary daemon to keep track of play duration and use the reporting socket we have?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> reporting socket?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> The problem is that ddnet client is open source, it could be possible to prevent ddosing by verifying played then run launcher and send few info to server to whitelist it
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> The problem is that ddnet client is open source, it could be possible to prevent ddosing by verifying player then run launcher and send few info to server to whitelist it
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don‚Äôt remember how we named it in the code, but the server reports joins and leaves to a configurable unix socket
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no clue, but my goal is to be able to manipulate maps using a Rest API
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so you could PUT a specific API path to add an IP into the whitelist
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We tried, a lot of people have mismatching udp and tcp ips due to cgnats/vpns. So whitelists aren‚Äôt exactly easy to do
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Cgnat is so gay
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and having to https request an API to whitelist someone after being ingame for 5mins is easy I think
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would offload that to an external daemon so there is no extra code in the server to maintain
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already report joins and leaves to a unix socket, you can hook your daemon there and it‚Äôd be a plug and play solution for any ddnet based server since ddnet 10 iirc
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I could do smth based on that socket yea
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Ye, but maybe launcher handshake  with server, but hidden and encrypted. But still it‚Äôs boring to making external software to play game ‚òπÔ∏è
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thing is you still have to do another way towhitelist when under attack, like a website or that client-side verification.
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Even if people who has mismatching udp/tcp IPs during attacks, that's better than whitelisting everytime through https
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thing is you still have to do another way to whitelist when under attack, like a website or that client-side verification.
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Even if people who has mismatching udp/tcp IPs during attacks, that's better than whitelisting everytime through https
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don‚Äôt need a launcher, the client is completely capable of doing a handshake. The problem is that the ip people do the handshake on won‚Äôt match the ip they join the server with
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but attacks are generally not permanent, so not that bad
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Make ddnet private source, and done job ü§ì
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs open source
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> But how aren‚Äôt other games affected by massive ddos then?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'll take a look at your socket, but will still learn to make that Rest API (as I will need it for a school project + XDP)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> other games are affected too
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, in our case the issue isn‚Äôt whitelisting. We can figure that out just fine. The problem is no matter how good we are at filtering, our cpus and connections are just not fat enough
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Step 1) Invest tens of thousands of $ per month into ddos protection. Step 2) Profit
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Sure, but it‚Äôs harder cuz idiots don‚Äôt have way to make shit scripts to emulate client and spam servers
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'd say easier
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> x
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> xD
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> as an old idiot I can confirm that
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Sure when open sourced
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 since when do we help bot client devs
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> not even
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, which bot did he make?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KRX
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Ubisoft's games, EA's etc..
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they're not
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> And you managed to kill their servers?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> when I was doing tests & shit yes, for a few sec, but I switched to the good side
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Even told it to potato from my team who works at Ubisoft lol
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Which one? Cloudflare?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> cloudflare is way too expensive
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ability to generate traffic is not the issue. You can generate legitimate looking traffic by just reverse engineering. The key to their success is their massive infrastructure. You can easily take down one server with ddos. It won‚Äôt affect the thousands of running games for other people
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think it's called cloudflare magic smth?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> magic transit
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 talking about the github issue about threads
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, there is also Akamai and a couple others. The key is to get huge filtered pipes and thousands of servers
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Old, new https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah spectrum yes
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you gimme the issue #?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #5671
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5671
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LOL. It takes a true degenerate to ask for help while trying to ruin a game
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol hypixel is behind spectrum?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Ofc
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Been so long time
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Hypixel is big business, it‚Äôs worth
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That guy offered someone an old and buggy af version of my mod for 50‚Ç¨ :kekw:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> who's krixx lol
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> KRX dev
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tf*
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tf
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he asked me for antibot code
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and he wanted it from me in exchange to take down my mod from his github
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :kekw:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i could do it for free :lol:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if he wants I can share @noby 's antibot with empty functions
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :sue:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, so I see, last time you told me you dont have my mod. Pathetic liar, and now I see that the guy who had my mod was indeed getting help from you
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> As he said himself
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> I can with full functions ü•∏
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> But noby‚Äô style of writing code is shit üòÇ
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> But I love him
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly I could make the antibot public and people still wouldn‚Äôt understand anything
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> nobyC lmao
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> even me I saw 1 line I didn't even try
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Noby is just too far ahead of our mortal brains
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> However, we got the point. ReiTW get cloudflare proxy and ur good üòÇ
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Or make one big tw entry proxy for other tw servers
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Invest in protecting main proxy
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> =profit
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I was just kidding, lol, take it easy. As i've told you a thousand times before, i would never do anything with your mod (i don't have it anymore tbh)
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I could host one proxy node if this will even exist & be used, but I doubt people trusts me today sadly
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have this as a long term plan. But instead of a main proxy, a hierarchy of proxies that we can shift load between
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Something like BungeeCord for minecraft
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice lie
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @m!ki yes when I asked about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5662
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I was thinking also about giving bungeecord as an example
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I'm talking to a wall
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :mdr:
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ü™û
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:danceclown:773516781158662144>
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #4791 is the first step for proper proxying
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4791
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Nice point, but allow only verified servers do this
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> Cuz obviously people gonna try abuse it
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5662#issuecomment-1198134610
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> does bungeecord actually redirect to another ip or is it just like proxies?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thing about proxying is it has to be simple enough to stay easy to setup a server without it too
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> No, ur still on entry proxy
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> It‚Äôs not just redirecting
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ok
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's not a feature implemented client side
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (I think so)
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> If proxy that u connected to is dead, then ur out
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> However, bungeecord is so cool shit, best thing made in mc
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's all about faking, on teeworlds you can just fake a change map & switch someone to another server instance
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ye no hypixel without bungeecord xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 btw I was always wondering why having always 2 commands like `super` and `unsuper` ? why not a single one that can toggle?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only greyfox or 3da probably know the reason
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ÂÖ¨Â¢ì> Last updates I am getting absolutely weird graphical bugs happening on my Linux DDNet. I assume it has started from 16.1. When I alt-tab (using all graphical APIs) I get glitches that make my tees looking more like worms and stuff
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Screenshot? Can you try older versions from https://ddnet.tw/downloads to say which version the issue started with?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> what are the current gores maps in DDnet?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ozz here is a list https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Gores
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ÂÖ¨Â¢ì> That happens after alt-tabbing and the resolution itself in game changes also. But the whole game is stretched. The resolution on my screenshot is 1706x907 while before it was 2560x1440

22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know why the chat commands no longer show up in the console?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There was a relatively large change using std::vector which could be at fault for many of those problems
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was a more or less deliberate change
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should they appear there?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, maybe we should log timeouts atleast, we used them to recover the tees of people that got nuked
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then log them explicitly, I guess
