17:19 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
18:35 < laxadedi> Guys
18:35 < laxadedi> Any idea how to cast a member of a struct in C ?
18:35 < laxadedi> I got this :
18:36 < laxadedi>      highscore = (t_highscore)elem->val;   
18:36 < laxadedi> highscore is a struct, val is a void *
18:36 < heinrich5991> what is t_highscore?
18:37 < heinrich5991> otherwise, this looks good, it casts the elem->val from (void *) to a (t_highscore)
18:37 < heinrich5991> oh
18:37 < heinrich5991> do you want to cast from (void *) to (t_highscore *)?
18:37 < laxadedi> yes
18:38 <@EastByte> highscore = *((t_highscore*)elem->val)
18:38 < laxadedi> grrrr
18:38 < laxadedi> let me try this xD
18:39 < laxadedi> this is wrong, but you helped me greatly to solve it :)
18:39 <@EastByte> show me
18:39 < laxadedi> highscore is already a pointer
18:39 <@EastByte> well then
18:39 < laxadedi> highscore = ((t_highscore*)elem->val);
18:39 < laxadedi> that is properly working :)
18:40 < laxadedi> Thanks a lot
18:40 <@EastByte> learning some C ? :D
18:40 < laxadedi> I am doing a space invader for school in C
18:40 < laxadedi> using SDL 2
18:40 <@EastByte> aawwwww
18:40 < laxadedi> :p
18:40 < laxadedi> but yeah, I know C language a bit
18:40 <@EastByte> I never had a chance to use C in school
18:40 <@EastByte> well, once
18:41 < laxadedi> You are doing teeworlds dev
18:41 < laxadedi> so you are doing C :)
18:41 <@EastByte> it's the fanciest system lang
18:42 < laxadedi> I don't understand that
18:42 <@EastByte> properly 2 years of my life is wasted in C coding
18:42 < laxadedi> !en-fr fancy
18:42 < Nimda> Translation: fantaisie
18:42 < laxadedi> why fanciest oO ?
18:43 <@EastByte> because it's one layer above macro assembler and just fancy to code in :D
18:44 < laxadedi> I am not sure, but you are saying you dislike C oO ?
18:45 < laxadedi> heinrich5991: ty btw :)
18:45 <@EastByte> laxadedi: dafuq
18:45 < heinrich5991> laxadedi: I tried ^^
18:46 <@EastByte> laxadedi: what does fantaisie mean?
18:46 < laxadedi> ok, guess I am not translating fancy correctly
18:47 < laxadedi> and the fact that you said "wasted 2 years doing C"
18:47 < laxadedi> fantaisie is saying something is negative in the context you gave me
18:48 <@EastByte> ah
18:49  * fstd twitches
18:49 < laxadedi> you are using vim too EastByte ?
18:51 <@EastByte> fstd is here, I better stop talking about things in general
18:51 < laxadedi> xD
18:51 < fstd> whatever that's supposed to mean
18:55 < fstd> i could /ignore you so you don't need to worry about whether or not i'm here
18:55 < fstd> not sure if i've ever seen you say anything useful, so it wouldn't be a big loss for me
19:03 <@EastByte> Properly not yea, I just like sarcasm
19:08 <@EastByte> deen: did you turn of tournament mode again?
19:12 < savander> guys
19:12 < savander> i have something special
19:12 < savander> hmm.

19:12 < savander> :P
19:21 < heinrich5991> +1
19:23 < savander> ^^<>
19:25 <@EastByte> why does that workaround look completely unnecessary? :)
19:29 < laxa> Teeworlds is C++ for object but 100% C inside right ?
19:30 <@EastByte> yes
19:31 < laxa> Ok ty :)
19:32 <@deen> EastByte: i don't even know what I did last^^
19:32 <@EastByte> hehe
19:48 <@EastByte> oh youtube strikes again
19:48 <@EastByte> 27.7% of 5.83MiB at 19.37KiB/s ETA 03:42
19:50 < heinrich5991> you obviously don't use a wanted client :)
19:51 <@EastByte> yea still, it's the same in html5
20:52 < laxa> Anyone good at MySQL ?
20:57 < Spyker> Hey all!
