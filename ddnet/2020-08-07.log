23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> pls make a usefull info channel so that not every week people ask for this kind of stuff XD
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we had it
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> people still asked
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> can you make it possible to move through the layers list in editor with arrow keys (up/down)?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> I also have 2 suggestions, i want to further suggest adding switching with arrow keys and/or tab between width and heigth of the layer sizes (when editing through right click).
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> Also i would love to have a function to make all layers (or all layers in a specific group) the same size.
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Last things works for game group
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> You mean all game layers are edited at once? Or is there a way to edit all layers in the game group?
