12:34 < Spyker> deen, me and TheZyZa are creating map with new parts no copyed and all very original, the problem is he is russian and not ger, so on my server he ping like 100 and it is hard test a brutal with strange parts with his ping... can you give to us nuclear server?
12:35 < Spyker> map is like 5% but very nice, with epic design... we really want  to make something special, if you give to us nuclear server probably the map can be used for a tournament, but it will take like 1-2 month before end
12:38 < Spyker> deen

13:28 <@deen> Spyker: i will not allow any more tournament maps with you as mapper, sorry
13:28 <@deen> you can try a teecloud server for testing
14:24 < Spyker> why deen?
14:25 <@deen> Spyker: because you always make trouble
14:26 < Spyker> i will not, i just map and thezyza will do the rest, post for tournament and others stuff
14:27 <@deen> Spyker: you come to me every day with new requests, it's really annoying
14:27 < Spyker> i know sry man.... but if you watch what we did from now in the map is something epic :D
14:27 < Spyker> really... it ll be one of best map in ddnet we think
14:28 <@deen> that's ok, but no tournament
14:29 < Spyker> ok what?
14:29 <@deen> ok that it's a good map
14:30 < Spyker> deen, the map will take long time i think, so, can you give to us a server pls? if you want you can see map
15:36 < Learath2> deen: now that we have a new CLIENT_VERSIONNR is it possible for you to set up some kind of tracking so we see how many people updated ?
16:55 <@deen> Learath2: not sure, how would that work?
18:05 < Learath2> deen src/game/client/gameclient.cpp:L1265 seems the version is sent 
18:06 < Learath2> so on connect you could just output the client version to logs and we can parse through them
18:09 < Learath2> or pipe it out so we dont have to bother parsing them
18:09 <@deen> yes, but then if someone connects 20 times?
18:09 <@deen> he counts 20 times
18:10 < Learath2> hmm well we do have quite a big userbase so we probably could get away with nickname+versionnr
18:10 <@deen> i don't like the idea of changing the source code just to get diagnostics out
18:10 <@deen> hmm
18:11 < Learath2> well minimal change would be just changing the connected line already outputted to include the version
18:12 <@deen> yep
18:12 <@deen> that's more reasonable
18:13 <@deen> wait, we do have an output like that
18:13 <@deen> 0 using Custom Client 707
18:15 < Learath2> well i'd write the script that could parse the logs but im no good with scripts :D
18:15 <@deen> let me do that, that's fun =)
18:15 <@deen> I'll check the stats for today, alright?
18:15 <@deen> because update was out yesterday evening
18:16 < Learath2> sure i just wanted to see how many people we got stuck on the broken autoupdate
18:16 <@deen> many many many
18:16 <@deen> people ask me every day why their updater doesn't work
18:16 <@deen> that's proof that no one reads the news =(
18:16 < Learath2> that should also give us a coarse number about how many people use Winxp
18:16 <@deen> no
18:16 <@deen> updater failed on every OS
18:16 <@deen> not jut winxp
18:16 < Learath2> oh yep
18:17 <@deen> anyway, got the stats ;)
18:17 < Learath2> so we will just get a statistic about how many people dont read the news
18:17 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/clientversion.txt
18:18 < Learath2> did you count each nick once ?
18:18 <@deen> nope
18:18 <@deen> that's a bit difficult because the nick is on another line
18:18 < Learath2> oh probably impossible 
18:18 < Learath2> the lines are not guaranteed to be one after another
18:18 <@deen> not impossible, but really ugly and I don't care that much
18:18 <@deen> this is just very rough numbers
18:19 <@deen> I like the guys with 2.23
18:19 < Learath2> well which crazy maggot would join and leave more then 20 times
18:19 <@deen> haha
18:19 <@deen> ah, and 1 is the regular ddrace client, 2 is veeeeery old ddnet client
18:19 < Learath2> what is 223 ?
18:19 <@deen> it's fun to see that people still use these old clients
18:20 <@deen> ddnet client 2.23
18:20 < Learath2> oh
18:20 <@deen> must have been out 1.5 years ago^^
18:20 < Learath2> well we got lots of people stuck on 705 and 706
18:20 <@deen> some are just lazy with updating
18:20 <@deen> since the autoupdater isn't annoying them about updating anymore
18:20 <@deen> just a little red notification at the bottom of the screen
18:20 < Learath2> hmm well maybe should have left it annoying :D
18:21 <@deen> nah, i prefer it like this
18:21 < Learath2> me too its prettier :)
18:21 <@deen> some people just don't want to update or don't care
18:21 <@deen> that's ok i guess
18:21 < Learath2> well we could put a targeted broadcast for a day for people on 705 706 
18:22 <@deen> any big features they're missing out on?
18:22 <@deen> otherwise they'll just say we shouldn't annoy them^
18:23 < Learath2> well we can do that when we do introduce a big feature
18:25 < Learath2> so 705 is the version where i tried to fix the autoupdater and it didnt work 
18:25 < Learath2> but only didnt work for xp
18:25 < Learath2> so we can assume 705 people are lazy
18:44 < o_be_one> sup
18:46 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds.com isn't
19:48 <@deen> hi o_be_one
