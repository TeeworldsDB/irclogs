11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> since new update when i try to change the name or the colour of a layer and need arrow left or right for it i get into Images/Sounds, not a big bug - but i guess it shouldn't be like that :tee_thinking:

11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> since new update when i try to change the name or the colour of a layer, right click on it and need arrow left or right for it i get into Images/Sounds, not a big bug - but i guess it shouldn't be like that :tee_thinking:
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/742683186118524968/1.png
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Silex what does arrow right/left do there?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> if you try to change a name like 'Freeze222' and you only want to delete 'Freeze' you need to arrow left 3 times since you don't delete the 222 😄 just a example .. so basically you need to delete all of the name now, if you don't want to get teleported into images/sounds
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> but maybe it's just for me a bug since i don't do it in a other way since ever 😄
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, forgot about line editing
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess it only matters for left/right arrow, not up/down
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Silex> up/down changes to the next layer/group but i don't know why someone would need up/down when changing name/colour so .. yes
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sapling> i updated ddnet in the client and it said something like : errors check the logs 
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sapling> and now my ddnet litterally disappear :
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sapling> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/742711416280318052/unknown.png
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Sapling I guess you didn't have the logs open?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably there was a problem with filesystem permissions and the DDNet.exe couldn't be written. I suggest just downloading it from scratch
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sapling> u guess right
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: the wordlist.txt is a bit annoying. People keep asking me what's happening when they save and get 3 random words back. And I also forgot to include it in the update, thus DDNet-Server wouldn't start anymore 😄 Maybe we should think about reverting to the old behaviour of not allowing empty `/save` and get rid of it? Any other opinions?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why doesnt /save force u to type an argument like most other comands
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it used to, that was the old behaviour
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is there a reason it was chaned
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> changed**
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for convenience
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what save code would be used if someone doesnt type anything
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can just bind /save and always get a successful save
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a 3 word combination from data/wordlist.txt
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is this how peopel used it :o
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i had this too when i updated yesterday
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how would they know which save is theirs
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby you get a message that tells you and it's saved in ddnet-saves.txt
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats wrong with that system? seems fine
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen when i updated it said update failed, check logs, but when i restarted the game in was the latest version, very weird
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> logs were empty
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i found correct ones
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut sounds like some files failed to update
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the logs are in the console window, if you don't have logfile set, they're not written
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> never had that before
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, ok
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, or it might have happened because we added a new dll for the first time in a while
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, confirmed this, the sqlite3.dll addition causes it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so the update succeeded, but we accidentally think it failed, will add a fix
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, nice
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> so the server update failed not the client update? Or does the client also ship with sh sqlite?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nothing failed, all worked
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client updates server+client, including the sqlite3.dll
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chiller
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it tried to move the old sqlite3.dll away but that didn't work (since there was no file to begin with), thus the apparent failure
14:11 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> @deen I am in favor of getting the previous `/save` behavior back when entering an existing save code, but I find the wordlist still useful when the mysql database is temporarily not reachable to avoid conflicts with existing saves.
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, ok
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> does one know how to show the dissected packetinfo in tshark?
15:02 <+Learath2> you'd first need a dissector
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> i have one :) but idk how to change thsrk output to look less like tcpdump and more like wireshark
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk how to do that
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> simply opening it in wireshark is not an option?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> based on the tshark man page -d? But I also never used it
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i want to compare two dumps i couldnt figure out how to do that using the GUI so thats why i wanted to use tshark also i think in general cli can be more convienent
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> @deen this seems to be to pick a disstector not to display it. My dissector is chosen correctly but its not displaying enough data.
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> @here can i do mirror dummy copy?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> not with DDNet but some client has it.
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Would be a usefull feature tho
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> @ᶰ°Konͧsti we have aimassist but no mirror copy?BRUH
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> add to list
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Would be usefull on the map beachmap, theres is a part impossible with dummy cuz reverse same time movement
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> Hello Guys!
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Obiwan> Cаn you explain me: What difference between cl_refresh_rate and gfx_refresh_rate?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> two threads running, one for logics/inputs , one for graphics. you can limit them separately
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> why limit?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> smoother performance than trying to make as many frames as possible
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lower power consumption, less heat, less fan noise, longer life for pc components
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> and its not cool to play like that.

20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Sane for me
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> can u access ddnet.tw
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Same for me
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Y
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> +
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> same for me
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you send a screenshot of the console?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/742814337730871456/screenshot_2020-08-11_20-38-24.png
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, no update failure there though
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what the heck
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it solved itself? is it the newest update?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, latest version
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> okay cool. guess waiting is an option
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/742815205519523881/unknown.png
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> no failure either
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> after restart client
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/742816544379240509/unknown.png
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah right. i restarted mine too after i got that weird crash bug. forgot
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is the big ip ban going to lead to many new players being unable to play?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Should we just get the ddnet-server.sqlite files? I don't see any yet
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, i didn't build with sqlite yet 😄
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry, the update failure was expected, fixed already but old versions will show the failure, but everything still works
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NANAMAR  @Im 'corneum ^
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> > sorry, the update failure was expected, fixed already but old versions will show the failure, but everything still works
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> @deen np its was ok after restart
