10:03 < Savander> Wwow
10:04 < Savander> Webchat was updated ;o
10:04 < Savander> nice :P 
10:14 < EastBite> did they remove the slapping?
10:15  * blubb_ slaps EastBite around a bit with a large fishbot
10:15 < EastBite> nope
10:15 < EastBite> crap
10:30 < Savander> they change or add logo
10:30 < Savander> and a little change in text field at the bottom
10:31 < Savander> don't know what else ;p.

10:37 < EastBite> oh wow
11:48 < Savander> Wow
11:48 < Savander> i know
11:48 < Savander> xD
13:53 <@deen> Oh, nice
13:54 <@deen> I haven't heard of any problems with timeout protection and other new stuff since we restarted the servers
14:17 < EastBite> not bad
14:18 < EastBite> deen: is the spoof protection enabled?
15:04 <@deen> EastBite: nope^^
15:04 <@deen> The spoofing guys said they won't attack DDNet because they like it
15:07 < EastBite> "the spoofing guys" xd
15:07 < EastBite> you don't even know how many they are
15:09 <@deen> I've only heard of one group so far
15:09 <@deen> from 4 different sources
15:11 < EastBite> still not the right way to solve a problem :P
15:12 < EastBite> recently I've been invited into a skype group with a bunch of teeworlds "programmers"
15:13 <@deen> of course it's not the right solution, but every right solution would destroy vanilla compatibility
15:13 < EastBite> I'll check the mapchange anti spoof thingie
15:13 < EastBite> I know it can work :D
15:14 <@deen> well, we have it in ddnet server
15:14 <@deen> and it should work
15:14 <@deen> i'm just afraid it will create more problems than it solves
15:14 <@deen> people with high ping no being able to connect for example
15:14 < EastBite> why would that happen?
15:15 <@deen> packets don't go through always or there may just be a bug hidden
15:16 < EastBite> maybe
15:17 <@deen> even normal TW downloads hang for me quite often with high ping
15:18 < EastBite> ya, same here
21:46 < The_Super_Pro> hi
23:12 <@deen> hi bye
23:17 <@deen> Had a crash on 3 servers today. So much for no trouble
23:18 <@deen> oh, and I'm trying to install Visual C++ on my VM
23:19 <@deen> but first have to run windows update
