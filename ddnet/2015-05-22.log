17:25 <@deen> savander: your max-fps-patch is weird
17:26 <@deen> i tried to fix it but didn't succeed
17:26 <@deen> it causes really weird lags
18:09 < savander> i know deen 
18:10 < savander> because sleep time is bad calculated.
18:10 < savander> that's why i called it experimental
18:12 < savander> thread_sleep and condition ofc
18:12 < savander> maybe it should be in float or smth..

19:35 <@deen> no, i fixed the sleep time calculation and it was still bad

20:51 < savander> so i don't know
20:58 <@deen> me neither, just wanted to say^^
20:58 <@deen> would have to check how other SDL2/opengl games do it properly

21:24 < eeeee> have heard thread_sleep works really bad in windows
21:26 < eeeee> sometimes the system timer has 15ms resolution so thread_sleep(1) might actually sleep for 15ms
21:27 < savander> oh
21:27 < savander> http://www.gamedev.net/topic/510019-how-to-calculate-frames-per-second/#entry4324295
21:37 < eeeee> you should try doing a loop which checks the time and does thread_sleep(0) or _mm_pause_() if it's still too early for next frame
22:02 <@deen> eeeee: any chance to get the dynamic skin loading?
22:02 <@deen> I think that's what he's asking for: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1490&p=14791#p14791
22:03 < Learath2> hmm it feels like he wants skins rewarded for finishing a map
22:04 <@deen> oh ok
22:19 < eeeee> not even such a bad idea, if we had accounts
22:42 < Learath2> we should get accounts
22:49 <@deen> someone implement them please
23:34 < Learath2> give me the scope of the system and what it has to do and ill implement it
