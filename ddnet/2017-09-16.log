08:44 <@heinrich5991> client/server are already different

11:16 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4619588 Learath2: Update cmake before building
11:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> does any1 know why my serverside dummys i implemented in ddnet9.0.2 don't work in the new ddnet? They timeout instantly on connection.
11:21 <@deen> @ChillerDragon github repository?
11:36 <@deen> how do i tell cmake to link darwinssl when compiling on macosx?
11:38 <@deen> basically just need to add "-framework security" to the client linking
11:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v55QX
11:39 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 75d3eea def: Try linking against security framework on macosx
11:41 <@deen> on osx "make package" doesn't build a dmg file
11:50 <@deen> and I can't use scripts/make_release.py anymore because the files are in different locations

12:06 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 03faa51 def: Don't divide by 0
13:59 <@heinrich5991> deen: I think your commit breaks stuff
13:59 <@heinrich5991> did the division by zero cause problems?
13:59 <@heinrich5991> because atanf(inf) is well-defined
14:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #868: Revert "Don't divide by 0" (master...pr_ddnet_revert_div0) https://git.io/v55Au
14:26 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: msvc doesn't seem to want to allow that potential division by zero :D
14:29 <@deen> Learath2: please remove the irc bridge
14:29 <+Learath2> sure
14:29 <@deen> it does only work in one direction, so people didn't get my answers
14:29 <@deen> a badly functioning bridge is much worse than no bridge
14:30 <@deen> because I can't always check whether each message went to both chats
14:30 <+Learath2> deen: gone, might write my own later
14:33 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: /WX is the cause, no idea how to suppress that for one line
14:41 <+Learath2> guess by not using /WX
14:41 <+quinerr> hi, i'm curious about tools like config_retrieve/dilate/etc. what's the purpose of them and which package would you like to put them in (client side, server side or separate package)?
15:00 <+Learath2> quinerr: they are mapping tools
15:01 <+Learath2> client or a seperate map-tools package would work
15:01 <+Learath2> deen: ^^ want them seperate or not?
16:53 <@deen> dunno, just consistent with other packages?
16:54 <@deen> how is it done for teeworlds?
17:58 <@heinrich5991> deen: fixed it for windows
