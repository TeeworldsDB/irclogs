00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Forgot to respond, sorry and yes it's alright. Otherwise I can switch to Linux
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie Senpai do you have a linux installation? if so, I guess this would be the fastest option
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> After all I'm just left with a laptop and some computer specs laying around (still waiting for the rest to be delivered). I can do a seperate install on my laptop with Linux so yes!
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still want to fix that, but it doesn't look I'll get my hands on a windows installation soon
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's alright, take your time. Maybe at some day :music:

09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> cmake/checksummed_extra.txt is it generated or just edited?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> generated
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, wait, edited
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <123123123123> Will it be possible to create accounts via discord in ddnet
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <123123123123> ok
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> nobody knows he is friends with vali, he is more known for being a troll
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Everyone knows since there is a proof which suddenly appears
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 👍
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> what proof?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nothing you need to see, I think
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> they know each other yes, but you wont know that unless you stalk either one of them 24/7
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Everyone knows you are friends with vali aswell, so I think this is pointless
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> yes because i have never hidden it
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> You don't need to stalk someone 24/7 to find out facts. Also it's nice too see that another guy from the group is protecting it's member
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just what I thought
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> and besides that, i had exec as clantag for years
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> it doesnt need to be itube, it could have been anybody, and besides that they dont even know each other for long and have been in a server simultaneously maybe at most 2x
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I don't think that "anybody" would write about a really relevant topic to vali directly. Even weird that you're now protecting him (move this conv into #off-topic or pm, regardless everything you'll say is easy to block off) :thonk:
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Whats ur real username ? 👀
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> →#off-topic
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> it fails to import `wmem_alloc` because it was moved from libwireshark to libwsutil in 3.6
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, thanks!
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you find that out?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> just ran wireshark in x64dbg with exception breakpoints
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks 🙂 the "just" is something I wouldn't even have thought of
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this was already a great help. if you have some more time, what is an exception breakpoint? does it refer to C++ exceptions? or SEH? and you saw the error message/symbol name in the breakpoint?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> Not really that familiar with exception handling on windows, but I think this is SEH. When this is set to break on first chance, it breaks before the exception is passed to the application.
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1021790624044830810/unknown.png
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> When it breaks you get `First chance exception on 00007FFF7832FCAD (C0000139, STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND)!` and r12 points to `wmem_alloc`
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to the string `wmem_alloc`?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> yeah
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice, thanks for the explanation 🙂 I might be able to reproduce it next time
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <praise01> Thank me later https://t.me/+kaz97seJgx9jNTNh

20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> LMFAO
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when the designer learns coding
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> seems like if you dont win while cheating the ai opponent will just do 1 move and then not give you a turn ever xd
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> sometimes*
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it was confused

21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sometimes i hate latex...
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't center a tikzpicture in a makebox because it internally uses a matrix which seems to redefine some control character
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i have to externalize it and then add an overlay in a second tikzpicture, but i have to guess the coordinate...

21:54 <+Konsti> connecting to localhost really works inconstistent since 16.2 or something
21:54 <+Konsti> sometimes it workes only at the second try, sometimes i have to restart client and now it doesnt work at all
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you try release candidate?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we fixed a bug there
22:00 <+Konsti> ok that works
22:00 <+Konsti> thx
22:01 <+Konsti> but pretty annoying that my settings get overwritten if i use release candidate and are not careful at closing clients in right order
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which settings do you mean?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as anyone had some time to read my first general introduction chapter ?

22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> As of now, not really. Sorry, time is missing atm
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you have a deadline?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe i read here and then a bit in the bed else^^
22:57 <+Konsti> idk sometimes when i use a different client version it will overwrite my settings like automatic demos or some binds etc
22:58 <+Konsti> which shouldnt happen since settings are stored in .teeworlds not client
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wtf bypass
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Chairn I'll give it a read, would you be interested in any language related feedback? My knowledge of your field isn't in-depth enough to offer any academic critique of it 😅
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> due to our config system, configs that change defaults sometimes delete settings, and they're not saved if they're not options in this client version
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Config upgrades/downgrades really need some thought and maybe a more systematic approach
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have so many things I want to take a look at, so little time to look at them 😦
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Configs, CStorage, the new gRPC based management system

23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this week 🙂
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it's general introduction, so you can although i hope some smeiconductor industry fact (like cost of scaling nodes) and check that i haven't dogshit too hard on cpus and dram memories 😄
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it's general introduction, so you can also i hope learn some smeiconductor industry fact (like cost of scaling nodes) and check that i haven't dogshit too hard on cpus and dram memories 😄
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ok can't guarantee but try to. I think i never read more than 5 sites book in my life. So nice new experience
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 5 sites book? what's a site book?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I dunno one dina5 i guess
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Pages
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah, well font is large, so it's small pages 😛
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tell me if im pedagogic enough as well 😉
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like not too technical as it should be readable by non technical people (imo)
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or with just the base electronic knowledge and computer science base
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > As power density increased, it soon started to be impossible to rise frequency without damaging the circuit hence a frequency saturation from 2005 as shown in Figure 1.4
