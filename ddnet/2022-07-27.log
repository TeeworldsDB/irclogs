00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @heinrich5991 would this color work?

00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üí© ray?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or wood ray üòõ
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Heinrich told me `the default color of the shotgun rays should match its brownish weapon color.`
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poop ray
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Initally it used to be more orange
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this color to be exact
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001619259232890921/unknown.png
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M é…π „Ç∑> bouncing wood beam
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cant tell the difference other than the "orange" one is more bright too me xd
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> colorblind xd
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they both look orange or brownisch to me
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Voxel how about matching the hue to shotgun's brown but adjust saturation and lightness so that it doesn't look terrible?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> or alternatively try using this lighter orangish color from sg
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001621490984304710/unknown.png
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Voxel that's good, I guess üôÇ
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or better, listen to Ravie ^^
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, I'll try Ravie's suggestion a bit later
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'm not actually opposed to the brown either
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it should be something more lively, brown laser just feels wrong
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> good coloe
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie maybe it even looks lively when it's animated ^^
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Voxel can you tell me the hex code for the two browns?
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M é…π „Ç∑> Make laser shader for this rays
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> sure one second
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Darker: 
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> `IN: #8D673E, OUT: #301D0D`
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Lighter:
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> `IN: #C37F42, OUT: #301A09`
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie ingame, they look different when animated
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying them out on fng
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i just took the colors from the two images :justatest: \
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i just took the colors from the two images :justatest:
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @ReiTW IIRC you guys have a teleporter which connects people to a different server, is that correct?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it should also nicely match the normal laser color though, so something much more saturated
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @murpi not made by me but "yes"
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but imagine it just as a homemade internal proxy
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you fake the change map
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but you're still connected to the same port
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> brown/orange is fine
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie try it ingame üôÇ
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_laser_inner_color $8D673E; cl_laser_outline_color $301D0D`
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_laser_inner_color $C37F42; cl_laser_outline_color $301A09`
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> What if actual real tiles existed in ddnet to switch to another server
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not a fan, it looks really dull compared to normal laser
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Could be cool but I doubt it is useful for DDRace
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have tried it ingame?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> here I used the HSLuv color space to match the hue to shotgun's brown but keep the brightness and saturation of normal laser
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001627981774590162/unknown.png
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that also looks similar to the shotgun üôÇ
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you paste the rgb hex values?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> quite a nice match
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001628279851204648/unknown.png
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's c38100 for fill and 20190b for outline
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now that I've seen the other, this one looks a bit bright üòÑ
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_laser_inner_color $c38100; cl_laser_outline_color $20190b`
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> darker color better imo
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `bind x "toggle cl_laser_inner_color 11206590 $c38100; toggle cl_laser_outline_color 11176232 $20190b"` to compare
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you switch back and forth, the "intensity" is very similar
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also this method can be used to make any other hue of laser and it will match nicely
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @fokkonaut what's your git email address?
04:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nvm, found it üôÇ
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well, i think there's nothing much to do with the whole laser color thing, until the server is updated to be able to send the right info
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> still need clang-format but i guess deen or heinrich will add it
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does anyone here use vscode to debug? How did you setup vscode for building and debugging ddnet?

15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion 
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ppl without less of 1k points make them can't make dummy
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1 noob is more of enough:nouis:
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what if they have no one to play with
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then people will just fake players with > 1 k points
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> nah they not this mush smart
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and even then its kind of your fault for playing on novice maps expecting to get far
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> bro this hurt me:(
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i have no friends
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hence: the dummy was born

16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :trollonaut:
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> annoyed by nobs -> force them to play with you instead of their dummy
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> just make the ddnet solo campaign a requirement to join online servers hrhrhrhr
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I thought of an idea to keep speedrun's legitness a little more:
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> We could use a `/speedrun` option which would force the current team (from 1 to 63 ofc) to play in 2p (or X players according to the map)
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> And there would be a command to display the top speedruns made like this
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What does this prevent/fix?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> reinstating you as author of a commit
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Voxel said that already :D
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> noobs can't play with dummy  alone
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> usually they join with you and you need carry them and their dummy

21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I don't think that was a typo "acked" means acknowledged
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> exactly
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> What? So why did you pr? xd
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that wasnt me, im saying the typo fix is incorrect
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Oh lmao
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I thought it was you cause you posted the meme
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Sry
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> nah im just poking at the guy LOL
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if i saw a typo id rather fix it in my actual pr or mention it here
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Where do these people come from, are they just farming pull requests for some reason.
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Oh wait actually they did update a ddneg package
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Oh wait actually they did update a ddnet package
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hi, does anybody have a tool to transform this 0.7 map file into a 0.6 map file?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001947123962609816/dm3.map
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think there's only tool to convert 0.6 into 0.7
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Simply make all images that are not included in the 0.6 client embedded
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like, grass_main, generic_unhookable
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> those have changed between 0.6 and 0.7
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Yes, this works well if you wanto to gconvert a 0.6 map to a 0.7 map, but 0.7 maps seem to be buggy in 0.6.
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Yes, this works well if you wanto to convert a 0.6 map to a 0.7 map, but 0.7 maps seem to be buggy in 0.6.
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah true, they have some kind of changes in the map format
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Yes, this works well if you want to convert a 0.6 map to a 0.7 map, but 0.7 maps seem to be buggy in 0.6.
