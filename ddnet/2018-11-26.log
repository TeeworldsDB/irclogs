00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hookthrough has some weird behaviours
00:13 <@heinrich5991> this is "by design"
00:13 <@heinrich5991> use the new hookthrough tiles
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> hm what function is the website using to encode special chars in the url?
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> f.e. meter'. -> meter-39--46-
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> nvm I'm dumb
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The irc doesn't forget ðŸ˜›
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> well at least I noticed it fast enough
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/516631365458853901/ONUz8XL.png
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> or does someone has a better idea for the project name?
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> or does someone have a better idea for the project name?
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> looks interesting
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> how will it work @DaRealFreak ?
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you just poll?
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> "wanktracker"
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> yeah just polling the ddnet website(player page like every 10 minutes or so) and keeping a local sqlite database. adding a few options to say that I want to get notified if I drop below rank x and on what services (so far I got telegram, discord and cli, windows balloon notification)
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> so nothing special just wanted to keep track what ranks I wanted to get back
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> i mean there isn't really anything else I can do except polling is there?
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah not really
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really should have kept GER2, can't find the same pricing now ðŸ˜¦
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 black friday was interresting using some hosts
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah it was black firday, I should wait some time till the dust settles down
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> for example you have less than 26min to buy an OVH server or soyoustart ðŸ˜„
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> and the price will be for ever
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> vps are so cheap nowadays
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> dedi > vps
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i remember back when i started i had to rent a dedi
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> :v)
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> GER2 was a dedicated server
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> with actual server hardware even ðŸ˜„
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> even dedi nowadays can cost like 4â‚¬/month something like that
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah hosting got pretty cheap over the last couple years
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well depends which host
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> kimisufi sells cheap dedicated servers all the time
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and now black friday comes by :toptri:
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeah kimsufi is for really small projects
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but it's still actual hardware
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> that's actually impressive like years ago my first dedi costed me like 20â‚¬/month
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> my 1st one was 101.98
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> ouch
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> then I discovered that OVH was selling exactly the same but at lower price
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> xD
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> soyoustart ðŸ˜—
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got my first one for 22 at hetzner
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> online.net is also pretty great but they have setup fees for their small servers
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> i've never tested blazing fast
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but as I heard they are rly good
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> today i only have a few vps and only one of them have "real" static resources allocation to get real performance, even then all the other vps are clearly never impacted by performance issues from dynamic resources allocation
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I have any vps left
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> if i ever bought a dedicated server i'd only use it as hypervisor i think
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 before me and my friend we were using an old reseller, Treudler but it's dead now
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> VPS Game from OVH, they were really powerful ðŸ˜„
17:02 <@deen> :q
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ezy> :d
17:28 <+Learath2> :b
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> :p
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> @deen and @jao  why in the switch have undeep but no unfreeze ?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> ( it would help me safe time if you fail . ( I dont want use drag laser ) )
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/516688801683472404/unknown.png
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> use the unfreeze bullet thingy?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao>

20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Uhm im trying to install debian on my laptop from a usb stick but it only shows the usbstick in the partitioning menu and not any of my harddrives ._.
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does anyone know what could cause the issue
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> bunch of different possibilities, i'm not used to the debian installer i'm in love with archlinux ^^ but it can come from the type of hardware, bios/uefi settings things like that, do you see it on liveusb ? have you tried different distros ? If you run "fdisk -l" from a tty ( might be accessible using Alt+F1/F2/F3/F4... ) do you see it ?...
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I don't really know debian i use it sometimes on vps but i don't like the fact that software is always "outdated", sometimes you need to add depots and so on it can quiclky become a mess when you need up to date sofwares.. If your hardware is really recent that might also be it
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i wouldn't advise using "stable" on recent hardware or if you need  up to date soft/libraries
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @â™ªâ™« oh thanks for the answer i rage quitted already. It went so well on my razer stealth but the razer pro seems to be trickier i thought they work the same. I used the same usb stick with a cdrom install on it. Yea i noticed the outdated thing. I am still not sure which distro is good for me
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i'd recommend archlinux but in the end it comes down to your preference, the advantages of arch for me are : roaling release ( there is no like archlinux3.4 then archlinux3.5 the packages are continuously updated to the latest version. And when you install it you only get a tty, you then need to install like X/Wayland, your desktop env or wm and things like that, means that there <message clipped>
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> still needs to be confortable with console basics, the understanding of how it extactly works will come by trying new things and so on
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes but i am a big noob and i didn't see a good looking window manager and stuff like that yet online
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I have a basic understanding of commandline yep but still i tend to get stuck very fast
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I love tilling wms like awesome/i3/sway, otherwise stuff like openbox are really fast/customisable, i hate desktop environment like gnome/kde and so on ^^
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you could try something like manjaro
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> it's arch-based and there are different version with different wms
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I mean the console in itself is fairly simple, what you mainly need is basic knowledge on how things work, for me that came by trying new things, installnig that thing and testing different configuation, spending hours trying to fix a stupid issue and things like that
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @ChillerDragon https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> windows manager might not be beautiful when you install them, but often they can become nice with tweaks/configuration
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why it has porn on its name?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :tee_thinking:
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> It's a joke, instead of looking at beautiful naked womens you're looking at beautiful linux DE/WMs ^^
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Still @ChillerDragon a good way to get used/try all those things is virtualbox, with the additions on the vm side it's great and you can save/duplicate the os to try new things and start again if you mess up. Only drawback is that if your lazy and you get an issue where your os doesn't boot anymore you will just create another one instead of learning by fixing the issue
21:00 <@heinrich5991> Cellegen: it's relatively simple: if it has porn in the name, it's probably not porn (on reddit)
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I really hate virtual machines @â™ªâ™« i can imagine they could be super usefull. But i simply dislike the design of virtual box and using stuff that doesn't good longer than 10 minutes is almost impossible for me. And it is also annoying because i failed multiple times installing arch in a vm because something went wrong and i am pretty sure it was the vms fault. Also the resout <message clipped>
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Did you installed the additions on the vm side ? i know resolution is buggy untill you do that, once you does that you have seamless copy/paste between vm & host, you can resize the window and so on
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> No i didnt install any additions ._.
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> that's why xD
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> https://i.imgur.com/FN3tDTD.png
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> like that i can have windows on left screen and an arch vm on right screen
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> left path is for Mordor
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> two screens?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yup
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i can watch youtube and have ddnet open at the same time ðŸ˜„
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> When you install arch on a "default" vbox setting you also need to install grub since i think it's a bios, otherwise you install it but it'll never boot
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds confusing and complicated to me :p
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i put the name display size to 0 and spectate, all names are shifted to the right a bit
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> it would have sounded confusing to me too back then you just need practice, having issues and fixing them, it'll come eventually ðŸ˜‰
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @â™ªâ™« well not rly
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> the difference is about the support of EFI & BIOS
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> EFI was supposed to replace BIOS, but it's still used
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Yeah i'm pretty sure the default setting on virtualbox is to have a bios so you need grub otherwise the system doesn't boot
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> and well when you'll try to install CentOS (as example) on a BIOS based partition when winshit 10 is using EFI
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> you won't see it because it isn't rly "compatible" but there is some ways to show it
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but for virtualbox it's auto
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> you do not need to configure anything, when it asks you to install the grub you do "yes" & you directly select the virtual hard disk
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> nope archlinux doesn't ask you to install grub you have to do it yourself, there's no installer
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> you do your installation and while you're inside the chroot you need to install grub manually like "grub-install --foo --bar /dev/sda" "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/....."
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> the installation process might be confusing if you're used to have an installer but it's really simple i mean that's just a bunch of commands to do basic stuff
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeah well arch is different xD
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> most of others distros does it automatically
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it works the same, they are executing some commands in the background
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> !s
