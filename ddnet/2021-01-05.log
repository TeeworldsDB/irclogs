01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I have the feeling that the ddnet_properties is of limited usefulness because it doesn't have heuristics for "end of race" rooms where you get all weapons and all powerups
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> leading to wrong classifications
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, right
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> true xd
09:26 <+ChillerDragon> hire pink rat as dev and hell write heureistics to always include weapons in the "end of race" room because there is a skip hehe
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think the most accurate classification would come from teehistorian files
11:12 <@deen> heh, good idea
11:13 <@deen> we could also use teehistorian to calculate how far in a map you are :D
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would but we'd first need tools to parse them üòõ
11:13 <@deen> and even where particularly faily parts are
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really think we should have added "RACE_START" and "RACE_END" into the teehistorian format, it's sooo expensive to get this information
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to load the map and find the start/end tiles and keep track of position
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well Zwelf wrote a nice parser :)
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and my map parsing tool could provide the start/finish positions, i think it could be reasonable fast
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the naive approach probably wont catch all edge cases with the startline
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but it would probably be sufficient to categorize maps
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not that easy, it would catch most things but to be certain you need to reimplement most of the collision check
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet there is atleast one map that flings you thru the startline at unbelievable velocity
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> so smart @Patiga
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should give it a run before the archive grows too large
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1T is already hard to handle even with just simple filtering
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i guess we could reduce it a little if we say we only take teehistorian files of maps where we have less than 100 finishes or smth
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 cant we just add it back and manually "insert" it to old teehistorian files or just dont?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could but modifying our source of truth sounds like a bad idea
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> data analysis on teehistorian files sounds fun
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> running the anti bot checks on teehistorian data would be cool
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thx
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :think_bot:
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :nobythinking:
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a tool that already finds many botters in teehistorian files. `zstdcat thfile | teehistorian_audit -p - | egrep ‚Äú(Syltoox|J$ON|cc)‚Äù`
12:58 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:58 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
12:59 <+ChillerDragon> also grep -E 
12:59 <+ChillerDragon> egrep is deprecated
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like it will ever be removed, too many scripts depend on it existing and most computer people are too averse to breaking anything
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> SC2196: egrep is non-standard and deprecated. Use grep -E instead.
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That‚Äôs why we have compilers made in 2020 that still supports C89
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> LOL
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> any hacks to debug a ci that is most likley stuck on stdin or something but its unreproducible local
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> i tried ``export EDITOR=touch yes | cmd``
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> It would be cool to see the % of my ranks. Like when you're top5 it says you're within 1% of all ranks.
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Same with points but only names with 1000+points get "ranked"
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> just do quiqq maffs
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> top5 -1 or mapinfo shows total
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Where do I find the order of tees for strong/weak hook?
13:54 <+ChillerDragon> ok i solved it using ``bash -x`` for verbose output and realized it hang on ``head -1`` :)
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (in client)
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> grep for `StrongWeakID`, I think
13:56 <+ChillerDragon> btw do u guys actually use grep to search src code?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use rg
13:56 <+ChillerDragon> yea well i guess its the same
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> i just feel like ctrl+shift+f in a ide is so much faster
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I use `git grep` all the time, yes
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> to search history 
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no ide, no vim plugins, so yeah
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> u code in vanilla vim mainly?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `time rg StrongWeakID src`
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> takes 50ms
13:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh no not that time
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably because your disk is slow, 50 ms sounds like a lot
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> the time to type rq and go to source code etc
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> rg xd not rq
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm on the terminal anyway, also my typing is not that slow üòõ
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `git grep` takes 35 ms on my system
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea ok u madlads are all vim mains 
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> do u use vanilla vim at work too deen?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> are u the only one? xd
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> lul
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> didnt expect SAP to be so nerdy
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have emacs users too, so not all vim üòÑ
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> i worked a bit in salesforce enviroments and ppl used web UI to code xd
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Something like Visual Studio Code you mean? That's also popular here
14:01 <+ChillerDragon> no
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> well we were more on the user side so it was like using the salesforce provided web frontend (actual browser needed) to code and compile in their cloud
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> saving a file can take up to 1 minute
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> but its probably the difference of being a user vs producer of these systems
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with 25% of developers using vim, you're bound to stumble upon some of them at your job, no?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. probably depends on the job
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we're as far away from the user side as you can be, so pure C++ for us, no real frontend
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> yea
14:06 <+ChillerDragon> i probably go full vim soon if i cant fix my system
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> vim, teeworlds, ssh and tmux are the last 4 programs i use e that dont crash regularly
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> i cant even open a shell without pressing ctrl+c to stop it hanging on launch xd
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you might want to reinstall your packages or even the OS
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it sounds like you broke something
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> yes i totally broke something
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vscode being electron based works perfectly on browsers btw. I can see this kind of ‚Äúcloud‚Äù programming becoming veeery popular soon
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> yea soon laptops ship without drives :/
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich u know some nice fix my arch cmd?
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> i would love to not reinstall all as long as i can boot
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> but reinstalling all packages does that help?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk what you usually do
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> wdym
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> to fix or to break?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to break
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh me neither im innocent
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you randomly symlink libraries, for example?
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> no
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> wait how do i know if i do that xd
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like some online guide tells you to do `ln -s /usr/lib/libcurl.so.3 /usr/lib/libcurl.so.4` and it works, so you do it
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> ah no
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> i just install some aur crap
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your shell hangs when you launch it until you hit ^C then it works?
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> yes
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> then i have to reboot
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a broken .bashrc?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it would be good to list all files not belonging to packages in /etc /usr
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> then it hgangs on reboot until i unplug cable xd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> removing unnecessary aur packages
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and reinstalling all packages
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> i did not put something there i think
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> other than like some scrpts 
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe all the cores are stuck? The default kernel is really not good at scheduling for desktop machines
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> ``pacman -Qqn | pacman -S -
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> ` 
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> omg i messed up the quotes
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> that boi?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there some task you run before this happens that could be hogging the cpu?
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> its just that clang rebot pacman firefox vscode etc regularly crash freeze etc so it feels more general
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you see where they crash?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which library?
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> interesting idea
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Enable coredumps if they actually crash you can check those
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> couldnt see any information on firefox
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe dmesg could have an insight
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> nah dmesg looks chill
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> tthats the only thing ik
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> and journalctl
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609852421.png
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> xd
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait nvm
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> nobody saw this
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> arg
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't do that
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> pst
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that a command where you read all the options?
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> found it online
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> xd
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Reinstalling_all_packages
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, okay, looks okayish, but I'd read all the options (like I just did) before executing random commands, especially ones that claim to reinstall everything üòÑ
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.039s
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 39 ms?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/796004936642592798/unknown.png
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the output is rly different
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rg colors and stuff
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u can disable things
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these simple colors shouldn't take performance
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> line counting will take some
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure how negligible
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is git grep a symlink to something?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, implemented in git
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> git bloat xd
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> man git-grep
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> when arguments have man pages xd
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Line counting should be pretty negligible
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vanilla vim on a codebase with millions of code
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess its the only way
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any tool would slow things
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Grep already goes thru the lines, keeping a count of \n s should be raather cheap
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rg doesn't go through lines
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only does that once a match is found, otherwise it'd need to look at every byte
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/#mechanics
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh? Can you search for a substring without scanning all the bytes?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> boyer-moore is the name
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/796006058974773278/unknown.png
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if your pattern doesn't contain an x, but you read an x, you can skip the whole pattern length
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (is the rough idea)
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git grep is faster for me
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe git grep searches in the git datafiles?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh maybe
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is one ugly algorithm, jeez
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> so git grep only searches current files right?
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> not the history?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> `git log -Sfoo` is nice
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> ye
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> i use that all the time
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/796006776566186026/unknown.png
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> grep is slower
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> everytime i miss a thing in tw code cuz someone renamed refactored or removed it ``git -log -S'foo'`` saves the day
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git grep may do some stuff with the git info
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> without - yee
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do the numbers mean
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hook and hooked?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen instead of a number it would maybe be better to show some small icon near the tee indicating u have strong over it
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But numbers are sexy
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one user unfriendly solution, but we might aswell just add it to have something
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> numbers are fine for debug mode
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the cl_ option i think will just confuse ppl
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nah numbers are nice, gives us a chance to nerd out about weak/strong if someone asks :D
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a icon would do the same
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if enabled only when u have strong over someone
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will also know who has strong over u
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> due to how it works
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its much simpler
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would like a stroke command that highlights the tees you have strong over when held
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u mean others vs others maybe yea numbers
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that seems a fine option
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just underline the nameplate
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if we have that capability
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on our text renderer
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And we can always have numbers for people who want to know more
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> I rly like how dj is visualized in the feet
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> inst there some space left on the tee?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  Maybe the hook could change shape depending on whether it is strong or weak?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a cool way
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> requires u to hook tho
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> yes
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> then its too late or uknow already 
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to voice your opinion on the issue in a way that is not forgotten tomorrow, I encourage you to go the github PR or issue
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just randomly hooking people until you find someone you have strong over sounds meh
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already said both of these in the github issue
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> its not that we have any quality option yet
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah we can add this unconditionally for debug
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki git grep is faster because it uses multiple worker threads
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rg uses threads too
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki but when I'm in a team of 10 tees and I want to know if tee X has strong on tee Y, and I can't just ask people to hook each other because they might be busy in a part
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> i never was in this situation tbh
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its usually just u and ur partner
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on t0 ppl will just do the part
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> regardless
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time rg -j12 StrongWeakID src/
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this gives me 11ms
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think rg doesnt use threads by default cause it shows results in a arbitrary order
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it does use threads by default
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does anybody have experience with embedded rust?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really, I'm still interested in your question üôÇ
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fast google
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Maybe you've seen https://timakro.de/blog/quadcopter-programming-part-2/
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm curious to try out rust on this chip, there is support and a lot of great resources but I'm worried about binary size
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u use #![no_std]
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have 64kb flash
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And I've seen people complain about the small flash who you used C
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And I've seen people complain about the small flash who just used C
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the link i sent has info
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro I see. from my uninformed opinion, I'd say that it's harder to optimize for binary size in rust than in C
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but note that it's uninformed ^^
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I've seen some articles where people compared the C size vs what they could achieve with Rust with all the optimization options you have but they usually ended up with 3 times the size
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And I don't want to invest into this now and later end up in a situation where I just can't get my code to run ^^
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Btw I still have absolutely no idea how big 64kb is, I'm just worrying
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.japaric.io/
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this blog is nice
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 64k is quite a lot, though I don‚Äôt know how wasteful rust is in that sense so maybe there isn‚Äôt much left after the overhead
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It feels like in C you have to do nothing and just get a small binary in free. For Rust there are a ton of things you can tweak, a lot documented here https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But my real issue is that I don't have a feeling for how much 64kb is and how likely it is I run out of sapce
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It feels like in C you have to do nothing and just get a small binary for free. For Rust there are a ton of things you can tweak, a lot documented here https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust

14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But my real issue is that I don't have a feeling for how much 64kb is and how likely it is I run out of space
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dynamically linked libc on my system is 2.1MB, so either it needs to ship a smaller std library or you need to code without most of libc
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you need to use freestanding C, non-std rust is comparable. you lose many of rust's niceties though, like its collections e.g.
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are verymicro libcs maybe rust has something similar?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't know, but I don't think there's anything besides using just libcore (or also liballoc) instead of all of std
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you want to do that anyway, because the microcontroller probably doesn't give you a filesystem? see? I'm not experienced. sorry ^^
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro you probably have an idea of what you need, maybe just produce a small test binary to see how much overhead you have
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Him I haven't really used anything from libc so far
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially check around panics and string formatting
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess str utilities could be useful in my C code
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that adds a lot
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. use panic=abort if you don't need panics (reduces size), not sure what to do about the string formatting machinery
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So usually in non embedded libc is linked dynamically?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have no idea how it works, never looked into this
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> In embedded there obviously is no dynamic linking
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So I suppose if i included something from the stdlib it could either be statically linked or recompiled
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> By stdlib I mean libc
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With lto and static linking you should(tm) be only getting what you used from libc
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Right
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "only getting what the compiler can't prove you don't use"
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think it's rather accurate, normally
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linker*
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With llvm and libc I don‚Äôt think you have much to worry about. Llvm has been getting so good at internalizing functions
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> There are some benchmarks online
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro I say give it a go, even if you have to ditch the idea of using anything from rusts std you can always just link to musl and use c functions for things you need. It‚Äôd be a nice experience
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> It does indeed seem like 3x the size
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Even after trimming standard libraries
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Even after trimming default libraries
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unless you don‚Äôt want to/have the time to mess around with it. Then C and C++ are just much better choices for this stuff. Tried and true
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Actually I'm not sure if this 3x number I came up with makes sense. I haven't really thought about std libs. Maybe it's more like an additive overhead
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently there is cargo bloat to check what takes space
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/google/bloaty bloaty mcbloatface, some day‚Ñ¢ I'm gonna use it on ddnet üòÑ
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don‚Äôt üòÑ
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently panic and formatting machinery really take quite a lot of space in rust binaries and the former apparently uses the latter making it rather hard to optimize without losing a lot of debugging
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have no idea how debugging would work
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interesting, I thought it would mostly be the stdlib bloat
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Until now I have been using gdb "remotely" using openocd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't even know what the technology is called
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> On-chip debugging I guess
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Do you use gdb with rust?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I never gave rust much of a chance after it‚Äôs syntax and stubborn compiler left a bad taste in my mouth. But the few times I did have to use a debugger on libtw2 it was honestly a very lackluster experience. Though not too much worse than other modern languages
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly the further you stray from C the worse the debugging experience, even modern C++ is almost awful to look at in gdb
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have not used a debugger with rust very much; but I also experienced fewer stuff I'd usually go to a debugger for
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mostly use a debugger with C when it segfaults or I want to debug an algorithm and the formatting in C is not so good, I can't just print out all intermediary state
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mostly use a debugger with C when it segfaults or I want to debug an algorithm and the formatting in C is not so good, I can't just print out all intermediate state
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the latter use case could be helped if I knew gdb better
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Most likely they overwrite putchar to get panic msgs and debugs off the chip. I've seen this trick used with C and printf
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Intermediate state of what? Hooks help a lot if you are debugging and want to do sth every step
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @Learath2 'stubborn' compared to C? Well, Rust for sure has nice debug messages and it does rigourous checks
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, I don't know that stuff too well yet, so I don't even know off the top of my head how to print something every time a breakpoint is hit
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Only complaint I hear around is the compile time
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you know that right now, tell me so maybe I'll have it internalized next time
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro apparently you can‚Äôt really get the panic msgs at all as crafting them involves the fmt stuff. So you either get all or none. Or atleast this rather comprehensive blog post couldn‚Äôt find how to ;P
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hmm might be
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I thought maybe you could get them if you can afford keeping the string format stuff in your binary size
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you just define a command called hook-stop
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, without stopping, I mean
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's also useful
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like a watchpoint maybe?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. ```
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> define hook-stop
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> print i
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> end```
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> print i; continue would work if you want to print a variable each time a watchpoint is hit
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or just continue as hitting the watchpoint should already print it now that I think about it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lldb is a little better in some of these things btw, if you want to give that a try sometime
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The checks are too strict for my liking, programming in rust feels more like looking for ways to appease the compiler than actually programming
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is great for safety. Awful for people with already low motivation, I‚Äôd rather spend my time coding than digging in documentation looking for how to get a reference to s mutable slice of a vec
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Reminds me of Haskell: If it compiles, it's probably correct, no need to test.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to read docs for anything u dont know
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u basically stated that dont know rust and need to check the docs
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> simple as that
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That combined with the syntax being unreadable for me, means I spend more time reading docs than doing anything
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is the syntax unbearable
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs an opinion you goof
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me it looks like c syntax with uneeded stuff removed
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like () in ifs
15:37 <+ChillerDragon> c is hard to read
15:37 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ur opinion is just "its unbearable" but u dont even provide examples
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u leave no room for others to say anything
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That‚Äôs also an opinion and as such there is no point arguing with it
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm not looking for an argument?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok i see
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u want to talk alone in a public chat
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> ruby is the only readable language :troll:
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609857313.png
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. the return type being at the end makes it harder for me to immediately understand signatures
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use return implicitly at any place too
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I gave my opinion, you gave yours. Not everything has to be a discussion
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> i rage quitted hello world in rust 3 times xd
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wrong about a discussion so long we dont insult
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> discussions are exhausting
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u dont want to discuss now
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets end it here
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> Ryo won learath gave up
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust gang is too strong for me to argue against, I can‚Äôt do a 5v1
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> gg
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> im on ur side Learath
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> if u join shell gang
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And as with any other discussion we have here you‚Äôll just call me a bigot at the end and stop replying so I look like an obsessed nutjob
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> lol
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2014/01/06/11466131/NutJob_Icon_FINAL.png
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> never heard this term xd had to look it up
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just find interesting
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that learath is rly nitpicky
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about lot of things
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im curious
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i ask
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> ur a bully
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> > offensive slang A derogatory term for someone who is insane or psychotic.
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can tell you what bothers me, but you obviously won‚Äôt agree with them. You say you are curious but when I tell you my opinion you say I just want to talk alone
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> again what learnt
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i rly admire u for using cool words
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u just took that out ofcontext
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don‚Äôt see how it needs more context
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > well ur opinion is just "its unbearable" but u dont even provide examples
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > u leave no room for others to say anything
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the context

15:45 <+ChillerDragon> ?xd
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> reads like english so nice
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of random ppl
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point of an opinion isn‚Äôt always to let someone change your mind. I just wasn‚Äôt interested in getting conversion therapy or being scolded for wrongthink there.
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> boi learath chill u give me dark vibes
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1984 vibes
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> be happy :)
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wrongthink

15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also give your opinion and if you don‚Äôt want it discussed I won‚Äôt
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> meta discussion xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> im gay and I dont want to discuss it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> im vegan
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we wont dicuss it then
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great, don‚Äôt discuss it in #off-topic
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> systemd is good and i dont want to discuss it
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> toxic
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> i use emacs
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use neovim on bleeding edge commit
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> i use windows
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> also i think all code should use spaces as tabs
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> get roasted
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spaces as tabs
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird way to put it
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> for indentation then
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller do u use vim?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u use plugins
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> How do I get a reasonable sized open source project to merge something only I need?
15:49 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon which ones
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc
15:49 <+Ryozuki> or do u have a vimr
15:49 <+Ryozuki> ah good
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro disguise it as something general
15:49 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon here is mine https://gist.github.com/edg-l/624737e31d6e85b2385689298fcccebe
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the lifetime stuff is what makes rust very hard to read for me. It feels like information that doesn‚Äôt belong in the signature
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> How do I disable those annoying discord "embeds"
15:50 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon did u achieve that thing i used days ago
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> so many plugins 
15:50 <+Ryozuki> you asked*
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea somewhat
15:50 <+Ryozuki> about showing something in the bar
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very hard, 8 months and I still couldn‚Äôt get sdl to merge the bug that breaks both ddnet and teeworlds on macos
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> i ditched the bar and made it a hotkey
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> having it recompute in the bar hang vim 
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> so yeee
15:50 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 sdl is not a reasonably sized
15:50 <+Ryozuki> imho its a p big project
15:51 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: i did this https://github.com/ChillerDragon/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc#L71-L81
15:51 <+Ryozuki> if u mean ur average github project with 1k forks
15:51 <+Ryozuki> maybe 1 month
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got a massive patch into a project with just 36 forks üòõ
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> why are you guys talking in the bot
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> why are you guys talking using the bot
15:52 <+Ryozuki> we on irc

15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> cool
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> can I get in
15:52 <+Ryozuki> yes
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> help step bro im stuck in a bot
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah I imagine SDL is much harder than https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/4834 üòÑ
15:52 <+Ryozuki> quakenet
15:52 <+Ryozuki> irc
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> we should all vote for learaths pr

15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> thank you linux user
15:53 <+Ryozuki> i use arch btw
15:54 < Technoo_> oh shit
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> @Ryozuki same thing
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> right
15:54 <+Ryozuki> welcome to the dark side
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I listen to video game podcasts mostly and https://strongsongspodcast.com
15:54 <+Technoo_> hello
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609858278.png
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nice!
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what we‚Äôll do about sdl tbh
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> i rly need that feature! omg
15:54 <+Ryozuki> my fav podcast https://darknetdiaries.com/
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I wanted to check how tf it works for ChillerDragon
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> haxxerdragon
15:55  * Technoo_ slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> im here
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> tmux it in
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> how do ppl do that
15:55 <+Ryozuki> ill thumps up it too
15:55 <+Ryozuki> i dont use tmux
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> timakro fan gang
15:55 <+Ryozuki> i let i3 handle my terms
15:55 <+ChillerDragon> tmux best collab tool
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon do what?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Anyone else using antennapod? xD
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish I was good with tmux, I'd be like 50 times more productive
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> have a tmux party together to look at macos
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> tmux so gooood
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro maybe you can patch antennapod for yourself?
15:56 <+Ryozuki> i will learn tmux if i ever do some remote work on some server
15:56 <+Ryozuki> until then im fine
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> for remote work tmux nesting :3
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: have a moment to try un-debug? üòÑ
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 I would not be able to live with the knowledge that I don't get updates
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> yes Learath2 
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro set up email notifications for updates? üòÑ
15:57 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon did u update ur arch today
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 Uglyy!
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: ok can you do a otool -L on teeworlds, find the SDL it links to and gimme
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I can figure out the offsets we need
15:58 <+Ryozuki> anyone else plays screeps.com ?
15:58 <+Ryozuki> just started yesterday
15:58 <+Ryozuki> "MMO sandbox game for programmers"
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is this another one of those hackmud like obsessions of yours?
15:58 <+Ryozuki> xd
15:58 <+Ryozuki> hackmud is different
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sure
15:59 <+Ryozuki> sadly in 2.0 they ruined it
15:59 <+Ryozuki> i had a client farm
15:59 <+Ryozuki> outside the game
15:59 <+Ryozuki> but 2.0 killed out of game scripting
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2: https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/irclogs/blob/8e488b53834f792ddc95105895e5eb78f34f148d/teeworlds/2020-12-20.log#L213-L216

15:59 <+Ryozuki> basically u automate the game outside the game
15:59 <+Ryozuki> by giving it inputs
15:59 <+Ryozuki> and reading the logs
15:59 <+Ryozuki> but 2.0 made it way harder
15:59 <+Ryozuki> sadly
15:59 <+Ryozuki> good game btw
16:00 <+Ryozuki> https://www.hackmud.com/
16:00 <+Ryozuki> its dead now tho
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it‚Äôs just the bundled sdl in teeworlds
16:01 <+Ryozuki> screeps uses js, but it also supports wasm
16:01 <+Ryozuki> which means i can use rusty
16:01 <+Ryozuki> rust*
16:01 <+Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/cargo-screeps
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Have you seen tabfs on hackernews?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://omar.website/tabfs/
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> lul nice
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> tho never had the need for it xd
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> also i use lynx and not firefox :troll:
16:04 <+Ryozuki> i dont have that many tabs open
16:04 <+Ryozuki> i rly get like ocd and gotta clean my firefox
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I once wanted to simply get the urls in my tabs as a textfile and couldn't find an addon with that functionality which didn't look shady
16:05 <+Ryozuki> a good new vid from 3blue1brown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol i found this on steam before
16:06 <+Ryozuki> @louis found something cool for u https://handel-pl.github.io/
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> c best
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry with the 50 things I need to do to get this thing to even compile I'm so slow
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and I can't get teeworlds to link to the bundled framework lol
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet I can't get to link to my own sdl and teeworlds I can't get to link to the bundled libs
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> did you copy some fishy lib symlinks from the interwebs? :troll:
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait teeworlds doesn't have any bundled sdl at all
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon where is your cmake even finding this sdl to link to?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not even on steam?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> brew doesn't provide a framework, it only provides a dylib

16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually this one works better
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> virus
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS build experience is really awful
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis nice
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon still here?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great I took too long and lost my debugging subject because cmake wouldn't link to the sdk I want, nor would it link to the bundled sdl
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: When you are back around, find me what SDL you are linking to, you can check CMakeCache for that
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> how exactly do i check cache?
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> grep SDL build/ ?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can just grep for SDL2_INCLUDEDIR
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/3A
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, can you put `/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework`¬†somewhere for me?
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/SDL2.framework/
18:31 <+Learath2> lol didn't even zip it madlad
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> xd
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> zip costs extra
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> wanna zip?
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> now u can browse idividual files :) my mac hangs so no zip i guess
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> Learath2: https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/SDL2.framework.zip
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Ok, now I have the offsets we need
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well actually you need to set a bp at main and then do `image list` as dyld doesn't load the libs as soon as the target is created
19:06 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u there
19:06 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://zillyhuhn.com/Lasergurkenland/
19:06 <+Ryozuki> u should say which mc version is used
19:07 <+Ryozuki> rip nobody is playing there
19:08 <+Ryozuki> no wonder, u spawn at the bottom nearl lava an rock and u dont have a pickaxe
19:08 <+Ryozuki> rip anarchy
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea good idea
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> pr
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: https://github.com/zillyhuhn/Lasergurkenland
19:13 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u should provide a way to escape spawn in ur server
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> idk it changes i probably wont update version
19:13 <+Ryozuki> otherwise it will stay with 0 players forever
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> should i write latest?
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> escaping spawn is easy nub Ryozuki 
19:13 <+Ryozuki> lol
19:13 <+Ryozuki> no
19:13 <+Ryozuki> try joining
19:14 <+Ryozuki> its all lava
19:14 <+Ryozuki> and rock
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> so?
19:14 <+Ryozuki> u dont have any way to get out
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> dont jump in lava
19:14 <+Ryozuki> nobo
19:14 <+Ryozuki> who will spend 5 hours mining rock with hand
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> or use flyhack
19:14 <+Ryozuki> this is why there is spawn protection
19:14 <+Ryozuki> even in vanilla
19:14 <+Ryozuki> u disabled it on purpose
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think ur supposed to use hax on anarchy
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait ur right i spawned in lava
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anarchy has no application anywhere
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> thats odd
19:15 <+Ryozuki> see
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> also there is 7 players not 0
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder why i even died last time i played i was alive
19:15 <+Ryozuki> maybe cuz i posted it in this discord
19:15 <+Ryozuki> and lurkers joined
19:15 <+Ryozuki> thank me
19:16 <+Ryozuki> for the #ad
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> there is some buggo
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> i have like 1k spawn radius
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> u should not spawn in lava makes no sense to me
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/796079732751204413/unknown.png
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what version is it

19:24 <+ChillerDragon> fk u :/
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> did nobody did that already accedentaly?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try ctrl-alt-f7 maybe
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but elinks was a honest suggestion
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I used that on the terminal when installing arch linux
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> nah does nothing
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then reboot I guess
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> oof my font is soooo big :/ every word is a line break
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> rip my session
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> guess i timeouted in tw already anyways
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> aaaa xd
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> what a fail

19:30 <+ChillerDragon> im back :) ye Ryozuki its vanilla minecraft what do u expect ofc it lags
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> java has 20gb assigned and runs on a Intel i7-6700HQ (8) @ 3.500GHz
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: send help im bad trapped in this lava filled obsidian thingy :/ https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609871379.png
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wurst nobo
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> wurst is fine
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u allow all clients
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> no i dont
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> i dont do shit there
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> its unmoderated :p so nobody forbids them either
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> smh
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> guess i wont be able to play there anymore anyways :/
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> did anyone ever try ``torsocks DDNet`` it fails to bind like a lot and freezes and its overall a nasty expirience
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> i want to use tor to bypass my ddnet bans pls help
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tor is tcp only
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> oh
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teeworlds/ddnet use udp
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> ah
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> ye
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> hm
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> exit nodes would probably be detected as vpn too
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> too bad
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> evading bans is not okay btw
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> oof
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerbot.exe
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> wait isnt dns udp?
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> so tor does not support dns?
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> well i guess there is probably some dns over tcp thingy then
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a sense, tor has some specific extensions for udp
19:39 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon did u know tor is funded by the nsa?
19:39 <+Ryozuki> xd
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> yes
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> :D
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you tell tor to connect to a domain name, your exit node will resolve that domain name
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> go Ryozuki build a udp alternative licensed under GPL
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> ah i see
19:40 <+Ryozuki> AGPL-3*
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> ok stallman
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can also just use dns over TCP, TLS, or HTTPS
19:40 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon if its on a server, use AGPL
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> yea thought so
19:40 <+Ryozuki> u can tor -> vpn -> internet
19:40 <+Ryozuki> i think that works
19:40 <+Ryozuki> for udp
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> or i can vpn -> internet
19:41 <+Ryozuki> https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Transporting_UDP_Tunnels_over_Tor
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> my ping has to be still good enough so i can be effective at blocking on ddnet servers
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since this is discussing ban evasion, please stop
19:41 <+Ryozuki> no one is discussing ban evasion
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise I'll have to kick/ban/mute you
19:41 <+Ryozuki> u just assumed it
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> i actually said it
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> :D
19:41 <+Ryozuki> did u?
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> ye
19:41 <+Ryozuki> i didnt read that lol
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, see above, ChillerDragon explicitly said it
19:42 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon lets talk about it in #hentai 
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:42 <+Ryozuki> our precious channel
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats the true reason chillerdragon doesnt use discord anymore
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> got banned

19:47 <+ChillerDragon> but yea maybe
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> maye they slow and parsed their discordhistorian files after the fact and banned some ppl that uses custom clients
