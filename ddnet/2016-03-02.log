22:17 < Simbaclaws> hi everyone
22:17 < Simbaclaws> I couldn't find any information anywhere on installing the ddnet client, does anybody in here know how to?
22:17 < Simbaclaws> I downloaded the tar.gz for linux x86 but I don't know what to do with the files
22:17 < Simbaclaws> I have teeworlds installed
22:18 <@deen> Simbaclaws: the idea is to extract it and run the DDNet file
22:18 < Simbaclaws> hmm ok sec I'll extract it and see if I can find it
22:19 < Simbaclaws> in which folder is the DDNet file located?
22:19 <@deen> in the extracted folder directly
22:19 < Simbaclaws> ca-ddnet.pem?
22:19 <@deen> no, the name should just be "DDNet"
22:20 < Simbaclaws> odd, I don't have it :/
22:20 <@deen> ah, not in the data directory, one higher
22:20 < Simbaclaws> ah ok
22:22 < Simbaclaws> got it thanks
22:22 < Simbaclaws> I'll make a launcher out of it
22:22 <@deen> you're welcome
