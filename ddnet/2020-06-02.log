15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Hi All, is there any reason why smart pointers aren't being used KillCharacter method in player.cpp
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Hi All, is there any reason why smart pointers aren't being used for KillCharacter method in player.cpp
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> smart pointers aren't really used in general in Teeworlds code
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in `KillCharacter`, where would you use a smart pointer? the function is pretty short
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess he'd have a unique_ptr owning the character, which is actually not really correct. With ddnet7 I tried moving towards better ownership semantics, but it's hard to decide who owns an entity
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Usually the only owner of an entity is the world, however the character is owned by the player too, so maybe shared ownership semantics would be better, but that's extra overhead for every other entity that doesn't need shared ownership
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Overall the way teeworlds is designed isn't really great for this kind of thinking, entities kinda own themselves at this point but they are tied to the lifetime of the world. It's like someone wanted entities to be independent but then decided it'd be too much work in the middle of coding it ðŸ˜„
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Thanks for the long detailed explanation ðŸ™‚ I'm still learning so was just wondering. Makes sense thanks @Learath2
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does Zwelf hang around the discord? It'd be nice to chat about this rather then the slow back and forth github provides
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> he used to be on IRC in 2015
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> when is ddnet adding the gay pride flag
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> this discussion was already done
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> when?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> its gay pride month
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> should be added
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 he's not using discord AFAIK
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Note: Regex searches on large repositories is a bad idea
