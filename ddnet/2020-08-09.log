01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk how to pr multiple files lol but i think that should work
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> put them part of the same branch
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://ddnet.tw/tournaments/7event1/ teams that finished twice are listed with their latter time
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i know
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hard to fix
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <suicidalLenahx3> How is the Teeworlds Source-Code actually structured?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <suicidalLenahx3> Can someone explain which parts of code to find in which package? What's in `base` or what's the difference between `engine` and `game` and everything xd
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <suicidalLenahx3> Some kind of description would be nice : D
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @suicidalLenahx3 base contains code used everywhere, but specifically lowlevel stuff to make crossplatform easier, system.c is like a little libc, cuz in old times stuff blah blah, engine is the game engine, it has most of what u need to make a game: rendering, sound, config, input, networking, in the game u got the higher level client and server
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @suicidalLenahx3 most of the time u will only change stuff in src/game
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you want to add a config option it is in variables.h, gamecore.cpp for physics, game/server/entities/character.cpp for the character spawned when a player is alive, essentially a tee
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> game/server/player.cpp represents a player, and its present when you are dead or alive
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (the character gets deleted when ur ded)
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the client is madeup of components, i think its fairly easy to get around it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you want to add a chat command its in ddracechat,h
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you want to add a chat command its in ddracechat.h
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should look at how another command is made
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just copy it
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh and Snap means Snapshot, its the info sent to the client, most entities have it (i say it cuz i spent months not knowing what "Snap" meant and i facepalmed
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaツ> when you join a server while new map gets loaded sometimes the previous map tiles are still loaded but for the others it's the new map
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf, @Learath2, @heinrich5991 : Anyone up to review some of my changes so I can release 14.3?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't manage to fix the sqlite build on windows unfortunately
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> When fix weak/strong swap by save and load :feelsbadman:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, maybe there is a circular include somewhere, that could explain the weirdness
18:27 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Finally found the issue preventing #2465 from compiling with MSVC (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2465/commits/81e5bb924c169d2a9e3916b9e232e391fc027ab9).
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: nice, but I still don't understand why including windows.h causes compilation failure
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> windows.h especially without LEAN_AND_MEAN defines a lot of symbols that can conflict
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe that's it?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was included with `WIN32_MEAN_AND_LEAN`
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yea, polluted some symbols
