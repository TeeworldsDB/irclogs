02:51 < bridge> <kdaniel> in d√ºsseldorf is every year a event called "Japan-Tag" with crazy food and more  (https://www.japantag-duesseldorf-nrw.de/)
02:53 < bridge> <kdaniel> living close to dusseldorf
03:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi
03:16 < bridge> <kdaniel> is block server open source too?
03:16 < bridge> <kdaniel> i just wanna know how @chillerdragon  do the left-side broadcast
03:17 < bridge> <nouaa> Just add spaces
04:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP is what you're looking for i guess?
04:26 < bridge> <kdaniel> i looked into it but didn't found the part where he broadcasted it in a 1on1
07:55 < bridge> <Ewan> goood morning
08:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What IDE do you use? And which broadcast exactly are you looking for? If you just want to know how to left align that was just adding spaces on the right if I remember correctly.
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I might be getting something wrong here but I feel a bit abused lately contributing to ddnet. It seems like touching code gives reviewers the power to request complete rewrites of the surrounding code that has nothing to do with it the actual pr. Makes the process very slow and not fun.
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I fix a bug A and get as feedback ‚Äûyea but it would be nice if we also had feature B. And you better implement that if you want a merge‚Äú
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like robsti requesting I add entire command system in my pr to censor chat. Or Heinrich requesting to be his code monkey for refactoring entire net code generation when I‚Äôm just applying a patch that was already applied in another file.
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This has to stop. Or you need to convince me that this is a good process.
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991: @robyt3 ^
08:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought ddnet policy was ‚Äûdo what you want but do it your self‚Äú not ‚Äûyou can do what you want if you also do something for me‚Äú
09:26 < bridge> <learath2> You keep wanting to add features that none of us want. We atleast want them done properly
09:27 < bridge> <learath2> The only way to properly censor chat was to have a command system. We aren't going to commit a hack because you don't feel like it. You are free to do that in your own fork
09:36 < ChillerDragon> i see
09:36 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7762
09:36 < ChillerDragon> what about this
09:39 < bridge> <learath2> Breakfast first, code review after. But I suspect you are right about that one after skimming over it on phone
09:39 < ChillerDragon> phone coder axaxax
09:39 < ChillerDragon> wat u breakfastin
09:40 < ChillerDragon> lerato are u in d√ºsseldorf now or not?
09:40 < ChillerDragon> a u alr replied
09:41 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 wat u doin in d√ºsseldorf?
09:41 < bridge> <learath2> There is a certain concert I'll be attending
09:41 < ChillerDragon> wowo
09:41 < ChillerDragon> man of culture
09:41 < ChillerDragon> travelin the world
09:41 < ChillerDragon> do u have snow?
09:42 < ChillerDragon> i got some pog snow today at my secret current location
09:42 < bridge> <learath2> Not yet sadgely
09:42 < ChillerDragon> ._.
09:42 < bridge> <learath2> I love snow too so global warming is double bad for me
09:42 < ChillerDragon> yea they shouldve done global colding
09:43 < bridge> <learath2> Lets all do a day of global cooling. We all run our fridges with their doors open
09:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: ask yourself if your pr makes the code clearly better than before
09:45 < ChillerDragon> it does
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if so you're right, no need to rewrite all shit code xd
09:45 < ChillerDragon> before snap items that seemed to be validated were not
09:45 < ChillerDragon> now they are
09:46 < ChillerDragon> its a fakin patch that was applied on 0.6 protocol without any backlash
09:46 < ChillerDragon> and adding the same shits to 0.7 gives me big headache from mr 5991
09:46 < ChillerDragon> he is sending me on side quests
09:47 < ChillerDragon> im literally fighting dragons here and hydras
09:47 < ChillerDragon> and this npc5991 wants to send me on some goblin side quest
09:47 < ChillerDragon> i reject!
09:47 < ChillerDragon> i may have missused the world "literally" here xd
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but your pr is useful for ddnet 0.6?
09:48 < ChillerDragon> no
09:48 < ChillerDragon> well
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
09:48 < ChillerDragon> i removed tabs
09:48 < ChillerDragon> xd
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it useful for ddnet 0.7 SERVER side translation layer?
09:49 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704530944.png
09:49 < ChillerDragon> 0.6 improvements be like
09:49 < ChillerDragon> jopsti honestly idk
09:49 < ChillerDragon> i need it for client
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see
09:49 < ChillerDragon> nonono
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that's why it's not clearly improving stuff
09:49 < ChillerDragon> im not ziehing on that shoe
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's ok
09:50 < ChillerDragon> it is a clear bug
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that shoe fits
09:50 < ChillerDragon> with a patch
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like the golden cinderella one
09:50 < ChillerDragon> that was forgotten to be applied to all files
09:50 < ChillerDragon> a97wdh89awdh8awd
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome to the fairy tail of ddnet development
09:50 < ChillerDragon> indeed
09:50 < ChillerDragon> has become a roleplay channel
09:52 < ChillerDragon> deen is full yolo merger. No questions asked merges every shits 1s after he got the pr opend notifications
09:52 < ChillerDragon> ok time to wait until heinrich wakes -.-
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wish rust would have some kind of trait that allows you to just write the "real"  definition of a generic parameter
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. MyStruct {a:i32} -> <F>
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but now for the macro it's always called F.. and for error msgs it sucks to write F xDD
09:53 < ChillerDragon> F
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>   --> src/main.rs:19:5
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>    |
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 19 |     #[hiarc_macro::hiarc_safer_rc_refcell]
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the evaluated program panicked at 'hierarchical value indicates, that "F" is a higher level component (hierarchically) so it cannot be passed as parameter to a function in this component', src/main.rs:19:5
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>    |
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:54 < ChillerDragon> common rust L with a program panick over here
09:54 < ChillerDragon> panic*
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well this is a compile time safe Rc<RefCell> üòè
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the panic here is good
09:54 < ChillerDragon> coping rust dev saying panic is good
09:55 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
09:55 < ChillerDragon> ok enuff trol
09:55 < ChillerDragon> bye ping me on github
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> k, cya on github
09:58 < bridge> <reitw> lmao I discovered the worst troll website, superlogout
09:58 < bridge> <reitw> u send that to someone, he gets logged out from alot of known pages like google etc..
09:58 < bridge> <reitw> a way to annoy people
09:59 < ChillerDragon> im still logged in
10:00 < bridge> <reitw> u didn't try
10:00 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704531607.png
10:00 < ChillerDragon> i clicked OK a bunch of times
10:00 < ChillerDragon> until it finished
10:00 < bridge> <reitw> someone checked how the website does, it justs calls each /logout page on background
10:00 < bridge> <reitw> lmao it should be logged out on ur web browser then
10:00 < ChillerDragon> clearly bugged
10:00 < ChillerDragon> the scam is a scam
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clever as chiller is, he opened it in ingocnito tab
10:00 < bridge> <reitw> idk I did that to a friend, he told me fuck off & laughed lmao
10:01 < bridge> <reitw> true, he's smart
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet firefox is buggy, that's why
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
10:01 < ChillerDragon> no i went full main browser
10:01 < ChillerDragon> savage
10:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi everyone, how can i make a character send an emotion ?
10:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/emoticons.png
10:01 < bridge> <reitw> in code or ingame
10:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> code üôÇ
10:02 < ChillerDragon> ``void CGameContext::SendEmoticon(int ClientID, int Emoticon, int TargetClientID) const``
10:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can change his eyes but can't send an emotion
10:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10:02 < ChillerDragon> ``GameServer()->SendEmoticon(GetCID(), EMOTICON_GHOST, -1);``
10:02 < ChillerDragon> why am i back on irc?
10:02 < ChillerDragon> omg
10:03 < ChillerDragon> @reitw i guess csrf tokes is a thing
10:03 < ChillerDragon> you cant simply call logout from another site
10:03 < bridge> <reitw> no clue but it works for some people
10:03 < ChillerDragon> seems like bad websites where this works on
10:04 < bridge> <reitw> afterall it calls the website for u, like in a mini browser
10:04 < ChillerDragon> yes
10:04 < ChillerDragon> but it can not read the html
10:04 < bridge> <reitw> https://www.quora.com/How-do-websites-like-Super-Logout-work
10:04 < ChillerDragon> because browser blocks with cors
10:05 < ChillerDragon> you need the html for the csrf token
10:05 < bridge> <reitw> `TL;DR: it's not exploiting any security vulnerabilities; it's telling your browser to go fetch each URL in a carefully-crafted list and load it in a tiny page element hidden slightly outside of the upper left corner of the window.`
10:05 < ChillerDragon> if that would work they could also do ``fetch("paypal.com/send/moni/reitw/420")`
10:05 < ChillerDragon> but it blocks the request without token
10:05 < ChillerDragon> and the token can only be fetched from the html
10:06 < bridge> <reitw> yes but afaik you don't need any token, as you have cookies stored
10:06 < ChillerDragon> and the html can not be fetched from another site because same origin policy shits
10:06 < ChillerDragon> cookies wont help without token
10:06 < bridge> <reitw> the /logout page will just remove those cookies ig
10:06 < ChillerDragon> every form has a new unique token
10:06 < ChillerDragon> oh yea that might work
10:06 < ChillerDragon> i see
10:06 < ChillerDragon> but seems like github and gmail also have a protection against that
10:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> # Morning
10:06 < bridge> <reitw> prob yea
10:06 < bridge> <reitw> hey
10:12 < ChillerDragon> one thing i miss in C++ from rust is the ``{:?}`` dbg formatter to print struct fields
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so what you actually missing is derive macros
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a.k.a. proc macros
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i agree
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> proc macros are OG
10:40 < bridge> <matodor> # M   O   R   N   I   N   G
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> you‚Äôre fired

12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 @mpft hi i need audio advice again
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> wzgzgzzzgz
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> so the fioo i have has 2 outputs right, the main one and the line out on back
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but software wise the fioo is recognized as 1 device
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it will copy
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know a dac that has 2 outputs recognized differently
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> no u need 2 dacs for that
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz that‚Äôs what a dac does
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly? damn
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> converts 1 stream of digital audio into analog
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> wanted to try learning mixing and i have my speakers and headphones
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> but both share input
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> life is not daijoubu
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> use software
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use software for mixing
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> mixxx
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has a master and headphones output
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i can only listen to 1 at most
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want master to speakers and headphone to headphone but i guess i need another dac
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe just plug my speakers to the pc board lol
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> effective use of ur expensive hardware
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean i would still use my dac for my headphones
12:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> which need the dac/amp
12:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> the speakers got a amp internally anyway

13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've the feeling gpt 3.5 is getting worse and worse xd
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the faster it gets
13:21 < bridge> <devinci24> it's not only a feeling.  imo Gpt3 (end 2022) was better than current gpt3.5
15:34 < ChillerDragon> omagawd i have circulating dopendencies
15:35 < ChillerDragon> heinrich started moving some enums to base/types.h and i am wondering if we could collect all enums in some enum file or maybe in multiple files
15:35 < ChillerDragon> opinions?
15:36 < ChillerDragon> i am currently interested in this boi https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c5d6389132310360160d0d3bff17b0a0158f347d/src/engine/client.h#L26
15:36 < ChillerDragon> some idiot put that widely used enum into client.h and now every mf has to import that bloated file
