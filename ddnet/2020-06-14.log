10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen very odd that a part of the code I never touched broke, it seems stuck in a utf8 byte next loop
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did this even work before is beyond me
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ea7f3f0a624247006fbfbd8638435e2e3c32324c fixed that endless loop, I just need to rebase
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that's not the only issue, `MaxWidth` of `DoLabelScaled`Â ends up as the `Length`Â parameter of `TextEx`Â which puts the `pEnd` and `pBatchEnd` waay outside the string
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the only reason this doesn't leak heap is because `Text()` handles `MaxWidth` correctly but `TextWidth()` doesn't
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut do you know what changed between 0.7 and 0.6 about colors?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> undoing the usual clamping leads to an overly bright tee in 0.7
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In 0.6 we clamped L to be between 0.5 and 1.0 so tees are never too dark
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I send the clamped color to 0.7 the tees look dark
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I unclamp it before sending tees look too bright
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you cant get the color perfect
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i believe
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, if its a custom color you cant
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 has white skins, which can be colored
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so also the default skins are white, and in a json file it gets its values
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> lmao found a cheater on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11293206/xdotool-ignores-target-window
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where is onion?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen does the player-cache thing break when we rename players?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> see https://ddnet.tw/players/Porphi/ for example
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://ddnet.tw/players/murpi/ is his new name
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao oh yeah, I forgot about renames
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I need to keep track of all names that I updated and delete all others, will think of a good solution
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen are you familiar with template magic?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a bit, why?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 merge pls
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I'm looking for a way to mark the net message structs in the protocol7 namespace so native netmessages don't get translated
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking of inheriting from an empty base class and using `std::is_base_of` but wondering if you knew a better solution
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao hm what is this for? doesn't access level already cover this?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so people dont annoy us on test server by teleporting us away
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah you want to allow some levels to just teleport themselves?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As soon as CI passes
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ty
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why capitalized? i copied it from few functions below where it isnt capitalized either
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> Console()->Print(IConsole::OUTPUT_LEVEL_STANDARD, "votemute", "vote mute array is full");
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh just reflex
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now it's inconsistent ðŸ˜¦
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ˜…
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @jao thx this is really helpfull
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti says it's helpful, big red flag
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what did you break @jao ?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> nah its biggest annoying to have to super through complete maps if they dont have tele
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you hear github is renaming the `master` branch to `main` because apparently it's offensive
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the world is fucked
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everything is offensive
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups i said fucked
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hope i didnt offend anyone
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of this they should make a dark theme
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they make a website forr developers
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) points out that "Master-slave is an oppressive metaphor that will and should never become fully detached from history" as well as "In addition to being inappropriate and arcane, the master-slave metaphor is both technically and historically inaccurate." There's lots of more accurate options depending on context and it costs me nothing to change my vocabulary, especially if it is one less little spe
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to kill myself
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find main offensive
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#master-slave
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github and IETF has done it tbh, personally every time I saw master, I thought of slavery. With this move they have finally destroyed racism
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Racism is no more
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can live in peace now
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 remember when the linux code of conduct controversy
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sjw with an agenda
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the same
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stackoverflow did something like this too
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u had to use pronouns for special ppl
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u would get banned
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if u didnt do it on prupose
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://itsfoss.com/linux-code-of-conduct/
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¢
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and the best part is, if you complain about this, you are a racist
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just update all your scripts and your muscle memory, duh
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets add a CoC on ddnet
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you must use pronouns for konsti
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bruh how tf does master relate to slavery
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> especially when it's used in the context of coding lmfao
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's literally as in "master record", i.e. the original copy
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6KFfYdNPh8
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> offensive music
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I'm definitely reformatting my disks with GPT
21:39 <+ChillerDragon> yea ofc everything else would be condsiderd racism @Learath2 :D
21:40 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its because im not a native but i could never even come up with things like "master branch" being offensive wtf
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> society is such a meme
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm going to submit a proposal to the C++ standards committee soon. I think it's extremely offensive that we talk about "ownership" semantics. Who are we to own objects really.
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't get me started on the `exec` syscall and the `kill` command
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, I don't really care what the branch is named... I just find it disappointing that we keep finding ourselves in this situation every year
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has the biggest ownership scheme, they are big offenders
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like why is this even a discussion? It's obvious what is meant by "master" in this context
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Remember a couple years ago when they broke thousands of gems renaming "FactoryGirl" to "FactoryBot"?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gems
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ruby
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never used it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like who really sat in front of their computer and thought, gee this library is extremely offensive
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Probably the same people because of who there had to be added labels like "Warning! HOT" on coffee cups
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @Ryozuki thats how github solves racism
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/721830857278488657/3t40o0-1.jpg
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why didnâ€™t u tell me about ur @DDNet pr ðŸ˜…
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I did, didn't I?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk i think i saw it for the first time now :tee_thinking:
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was pretty bummed out when I learned you can't embed multiple things in one message
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I just tried forgot in all that sadness
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .s/tried//
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> embed multiple things?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i think u can send up to 10 embeds
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in 1 msg
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to do embeds for each of the issues, but one message can have one embed from a bot
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> from a hook you can do multiple
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well that would be spam lol
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imagine whole screen with embeds xd
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> iâ€™ll merge it tomorrow or so but iâ€™ll clean it up a bit
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It definitely needs cleanup, I'm not very good with writing clean python
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can use some tricks to make it cleaner ðŸ˜…
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i guess inheritance sounds fine for that. alternatively some constexpr bit with "if constexpr" in the translation
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao fixed
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice ty
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I used https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2256/commits/6db9ce2b7f851e5bdf2c2e134f6aaca9941127a0#diff-cdd5bae6f9e976c607a2966f78596bd4R118-R132
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have another one that I couldn't figure out though, I want to override a template function for types that satisfy this "trait" do you know how I could pull that off?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It works with two enable_ifs with one that has the same condition negated but that's just ugly
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> I wanted to change the url that client gets servers and news from it and I uploaded the json but it looks like it doesn't works. I got that the client adds ?name=<S.TH> to the url and I got that when it adds that to ddnet info url it's data changes. How can I fix the problem? It doesn't get news from my link and I have warns:
