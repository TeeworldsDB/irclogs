00:05 <@deen> o_be_one: also you missed lots of DoS attacks today
00:05 <@deen> all targetted at the Block#2 server
01:23 < o_be_one> oh really ? i talked with captain teemo
01:23 < o_be_one> seems to dont be him, he doesnt know how they are able to make the server laggy
01:24 < o_be_one> one of my admins on my own servers reported to me that vali is back
01:24 < o_be_one> and that we got ddos after vali and captaine teemo was connected, but cause they are friends, if teemo doesnt know how, vali down know how too i think
03:08 < eeeee> if ddos risk level is high we may try hosting tournament on ec2 (in ger), can easily get 10gbit link for a few hours
03:10 < eeeee> however if attacks would be >10gbit it'd be kinda useless so not sure if worth the trouble
07:03 < bigman> hi all
07:05 < bigman> I have compiled ddnet but can not join any serrver
09:50 <@deen> Ah, Vanilla TW still only shows vanilla gametypes by default, so being on Steam would probably not benefit ddnet
10:35 < Savander> hi
10:42 <@deen> hi
11:11 <@EastByte> deen: there are 200 vanilla servers and 700 modded ones, I guess new players will quickly realize how to reach mods
11:12 <@EastByte> and play them instead
11:13 <@EastByte> not to mention how many servers ddnet has
11:15 <@deen> i wouldn't be sure
11:16 <@deen> it's not trivial to figure out the standard gametype filter
11:18 <@EastByte> well I always unchecked all filters, not matter in what game
11:19 <@deen> i think vanilla has been growing a bit recently anyway
11:24 < Savander> it'll be good
11:24 < Savander> teeworlds needs vanilla server everywhere now :/, usa etc.
11:25 <@EastByte> not a problem I guess
11:25 < Savander> usa -> 4 servers vanilla
11:25 < Savander> not that much
11:26 <@EastByte> I mean you could easily increase the number by 100
11:30 < Savander> it could be hard
11:30 <@deen> ddnet could run more vanilla servers
11:30 <@deen> I'm just not doing it because they rarely get any players
11:31 <@deen> but if players come, no problem
11:31 < Savander> ye, i know
11:31 < Savander> i can run some servers too
11:31 < Savander> on aws
11:32 < Savander> vanilla not really expensive
11:33 < Savander> in usa, ofc
11:36 <@EastByte> so I just got my reports for the final exams
11:36 < Savander> but i think, teeworlds will release this game in 0.7 version
11:36 <@EastByte> I passed Abitur with an average of 2.6 :)
11:37 <@EastByte> Savander: not sure about that
11:37 < Savander> mid-school?
11:37 <@EastByte> deen: is it mid-school?
11:38 < Savander> in Poland
11:38 <@EastByte> !deen abitur
11:38 < Savander> Podstawówka, Gimnazujm Liceum/Technikum, Studia
11:38 < Savander> ^^
11:38 < Savander> Gimnazjum*
11:38 <@EastByte> dict.cc tells me it's high-school
11:38 < Savander> oh ye, high-school, sorry
11:38 < Savander> simillar to me.
11:39 < Savander> we have two types of high-school :P
11:39 < Savander> 3-years school, and 4-years school.
11:45 <@EastByte> we also have to types I guess
11:46 <@EastByte> nvm now I can code without bad conscience
11:48 < Savander> :))
11:49 < Savander> end of school /end of year?
11:56 <@deen> EastByte: great, congratulations =)
12:00 <@EastByte> ty :)
14:18 < Nimda> Hoo! by TyxpekCZ just released on Novice at 2015-06-18 14:14
15:40 < o_be_one> hello :)
16:03 < o_be_one> oO
16:03 < o_be_one> DDNet stats page : 26 years, 80 days and 0 hours spent on all ranks
16:03 < Savander> o.O?
16:35 <@EastByte> mail from ovh: "Guten Tag, unsere Roboter haben soeben DNSSEC fÃ¼r die Zone von ...ovh aktiviert."
16:36 < o_be_one> xÃ 
16:36 < o_be_one> x)
17:30 <@deen> o_be_one: nice stat, right?
17:30 <@deen> Any thoughts about this redesign? http://tee-projects.xaa.pl/ddnet/
17:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vLzUY
17:47 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 49c0bed def: Go back to forbiding cl_startinfo
18:03 < o_be_one> deen, ahah yes thats awesome x)
18:03 < o_be_one> deen thats really pro, i hope to see it soon with ddnet infos
18:04 < o_be_one> but it miss something more "gaming", more fun, i think
18:04 < o_be_one> its a little too "pro"
18:05 < o_be_one> maybe in title, where is ddnet, add the tw logo with the tee with weapons
18:14 < Savander> DDNet stats instead of forum stats?  Like, best player (points), total time of finished maps, count of maps, count of servers... Best in month/week/anytime
18:19 < Savander> deen, 
18:20 < Savander> somewhere, ddnet logo? (smaller than on ddnet)
18:45 <@deen> yes
18:45 < Savander> yes, somewhere is, or yes instead of?
18:45 < Savander> xd
18:45 <@deen> both
18:45 < Savander> ohm.
18:46 < Savander> okay :)) 
18:46 < Savander> logo i did myself (svg to png, and resize, less size of file)
19:45 < Savander> guys, question to you !
19:45 < Savander> You prefer dark or bright website?
19:45 < Savander> http://tee-projects.xaa.pl/ddnet/
19:45 < Savander> example of bright
20:08 < Nimda> MonkeyStyle by Gridwyn just released on Brutal at 2015-06-18 20:00
21:09 <@deen> i prefer bright
21:09 < Savander> now is too dark?
21:10 <@deen> nah, looks fine
21:10 <@deen> text should be black on white
21:10 <@deen> or black on some very bright color
21:11 < Savander> yea
21:11 < Savander> we ened to change some styles
21:11 < Savander> and this web
21:11 < Savander> is full responsive
21:17 <@deen> current website is also responsive, but ok :P
21:18 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/players/Savander/
21:18 < Savander> not alll xD
21:18 < Savander> but ye, i know
21:26 <@deen> EastByte: got a fun bug report
21:27 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/maps/?map=GlassBox+2
21:28 <@deen> apparently if you zoom in far enough and then zoom out again, the map is rotated 180Â°
21:29 <@deen> but i can't reproduce
21:29 < eeeee> i think that webgl viewer also uses some js library for listening to mouse wheel which tries to do "smart" things like acceleration
21:30 < eeeee> that combined with mac os scroll acceleration makes it nearly unusable as it's too easy to scroll out so far it just disappears completely
21:33 <@deen> eeeee: talking about layers upon layers of web technologies: any thoughts about webassembly?
22:12 <@deen> I think I'm going to write up a set of rules for the forum and ddnet
22:13 <@deen> I really have enough of getting insulted and seeing others being insulted after helping ddnet
22:14 < Savander_> you're right!
22:14 < Savander_> and it's time to do this
22:14 < Savander_> ;>
22:14 <@deen> I guess my main motivation will be http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html
22:14 <@deen> the rust community always seems nice, have to learn from them
22:14 < Savander_> http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
22:15 < Savander_> or 
22:15 < Savander_> http://www.albion.com/bookNetiquette/0963702513p32.html
22:16 < Savander_> combine it . heh ^ : )
22:16 <@deen> the netiquette sounds like a set of self-enforced rules
22:16 <@deen> not something to be moderated, but i may be wrong
22:16 < Savander_> no?
22:16 < Savander_> Rule 7: Help keep flame wars under control
22:16 < Savander_> it can be like
22:17 < Savander_> "Don't make flame wars"
22:18 < Savander_> you don't need to rewrite it, just put link at bottom of rules
22:18 < Savander_> :p
22:18 <@deen> nah, I'll write my own
22:18 < Savander_> In poland, a lot forum have it as link
22:18 < Savander_> + rules ofc
22:26 < bigman> Hi
22:26 < Savander_> hi
22:26 < bigman> im working on making it possible to writing rtl in teeworlds
22:27 < bigman> currently i have resolved the problem with of that characters becomes inserted ltr
22:27 < bigman> but now they not become connected together
22:28 < bigman> anyone has any idea ?
22:28 < bigman> for example Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù… becomes Ø³ Ù„ Ø§ Ù…
22:34 <@deen> no idea =/
22:40 < ochristi> deen seen fake zero ping server?
22:40 <@deen> ochristi: not before, let me see how they do it again...
22:41 < ochristi> 5.somthing ip
22:41 <@deen> same for some mk_X servers for me
22:41 <@deen> but only sometimes
22:42 <@deen> and others have ping 999, something weird going on
22:43 <@deen> not sure if this is actually an advantage or some mistake
22:48 <@deen> hm, so i guess that these servers actually just respond veeery slowly
22:48 <@deen> so sometimes it takes more than a second for them to respond
22:49 <@deen> and by then a second info request has been sent to them
22:49 <@deen> so the client interprets the response as a response to the 2nd request
22:49 <@deen> not sure if this can be fixed
23:39 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1637
23:39 <@deen> Any comments?
23:39 <@deen> It's mostly a less strict version of Rust's Code of Conduct
23:42 < Savander_> you should stick this topic
23:42 < Savander_> to top
23:45 < Savander_> http://forum.ddnet.tw/memberlist.php?mode=team
23:45 < Savander_> maybe, better this for forum?
23:45 <@deen> yes?
23:46 <@deen> ok
23:46 < Savander_> ;)
23:50 < Savander_> you should close this topic
23:50 <@deen> no
23:50 < Savander_> why?
23:50 <@deen> maybe someone has improvements or comments
23:51 < Savander_> it's shouldnt be in main topic, people can just telling you "its stupid, omg, stupid rules"
23:51 < Savander_> its not place for it, in my opinion
23:56 <@deen> well, they started already^^
23:56 < Savander_> 'v
23:57 < Savander_> as i said
23:57 < Savander_> it's bad place
23:57 < Savander_> for discussion
23:58 <@deen> so just a separate threat for discussion?
23:58 <@deen> thread*
23:58 < Savander_> yes
23:58 <@deen> meh, can just split it if it gets annoying
23:58 < Savander_> as you wan t:D
