01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki lol its funny to read that old tw page
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > I can't use C/C++ or any compiled language because the mod-makers won't care for other platforms except the one that they are working on. I have considered some alternatives like Python, Java, homebrew and I fell in love with Lua. All game play code will be written under Lua. I have done some work basic tests and I think that it will serve us well.
09:32 <@Learath2> lua is a cool guy
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> For anyone interested - GitHub finally made the mobile app for both iOS and Android
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://github.com/mobile
10:25 <@deen> why not just a mobile website? Personally I don't see the point of most apps since I don't want to get notifications
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then it indeed doesn't make much of a sense in your case
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea i also hardly have any apps but ima check that out ðŸ™‚
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think the UX is nice and better than a website could be
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its funny to see all open pullrequest ðŸ˜„ found some 2 year old pending fng pr there @onbgy
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does someone has some dates on ddmax? from when until when was ddmax age?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can write quite nice PWAs nowadays, even with notification support
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They still never quite feel like a native application though ðŸ˜¦
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea i saw such things but only proof of concepts i never stumbd upon them in the real world
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ebay has a PWA
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pinterest has a PWA, spotifys web version can operate as one
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, what did I promise to debug? Might aswell make use of the quarantine ðŸ˜›
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> What quarantine? I am just working. Things changed here, but i don't feel like i live different then normally.
15:40 <@Learath2> well I used to go out, now there is no reason to go out
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b might be good to state your country
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here in spain you cant go out without a valid reason or u get a fine, 1500â‚¬ i heard
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it was 150â‚¬ xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in berlin everything except essential shops are closed
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. that sounds wrong
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people are still going to work. but public-facing stuff like cinemas, bars, swimming pools, etc. are all closed
15:44 <@Learath2> in some regions of italy you need to send an email/sms with valid reasoning to your local police hq and they give you a number and a time you can go out
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> going to work is a valid reason, and going to buy food or walking the dog too i think
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but some people went out with a fake plushy dog he got detained xddd
15:46 <@Learath2> the mediteranian mindset
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wtf
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clearly the police are just trying to oppress me
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (see also: the usa)
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the boomers in my neighbourhood are already screaming "IM BOOOOREEED" and the other "ME TOOO" lmao
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> their usual routine is to drink beer in the bar below 24/7
15:49 <@Learath2> "It's my DAMN right to be wherever the fuck I want whenever the fuck I want. My great great grandfather fought in the civil war to give us these rights, the founding fathers blessed us with the divine document, THE US CONSTITUTION and it grants me these rights."
15:51 <@Learath2> Hopefully it doesn't all blow up in their faces when their healthcare system buckles under the load of a pandemic
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki is that a video?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 no its me
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> setting up a arch linux vm on qemu
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't you already create partition?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't you already create partitions?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i forgot boot partition xd
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im rusty xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> internet not so fast
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if its a qemu thing
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gonna take 10min or so
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 design problem #123
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what if the client wants to spectate a client that is gone
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gone?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> disconnected, dead, whatever
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. client sends to the server: I want to see client 42 and a rect of 1000x800 around that
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client 42 is gone. what does the server do?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think that's how we should be sending the fov, just send two coordinates that define the rect, let the client figure out the coordinates?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for spectating tees, the server should update the fov, no?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it should be bound to the tee's position
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm actually that'd be a very costly netmsg traffic-wise
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you'll be late by a round-trip in case of teleporters etc.
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u r talking about showall?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it should be around a tee's position, if a client is "gone" just chose the next one?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw showall is often used to record demos later
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its handy to have all tees
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki talking about that issue, yes
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 holland. We there are indeed closer bars swimingpools etc, but that doesn't affect me. The only thing i cant do is party in the weekend and go to kickboxing during the week. 70% of the people here are working at home, but with my job that is almost impossible so we just go to work like it is a normal day
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b I bet the city is much emptier
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> barcelona is empty
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol there was a market in the hague yesterday:kek:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Reason: we need also food
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I dont understand that the goverment didnt do anything because we arent allowed to be with 100 people or more
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 is it normal that music bot lags?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 maybe too many ppl
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> probably is bearing a higher load then usual
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but mixing is done by discord, not the music bots I guess
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> more children at home = more people on discord listening to musicbot
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> how to make clan switcher (1* no clan 2* clan)
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/689872113154523257/Adnotacja_2020-03-18_172201.png
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> true
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> clicking spacebar as clan is not working
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `""` works as an empty string
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> ok thanks
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> defuq is happening xd

19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm @deen do you have sample values to test for sv_dnsbl_key and sv_dnsbl_host?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BumBumeq> Hey guys, do you have any bot examples on server side in teeworlds (github)? Something like on Zombie mod? I have subject on my studies connected with AI and machine learning and I'd like to know if I'm able to spawn some dummies on server side and control them somehow. I'm not familiar with ddnet/teeworlds code so it's really hard for me to understand all those connections between engine and server/client sources. I've tried to make some 
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @BumBumeq https://github.com/timakro/teeworlds-tmlp
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BumBumeq> Yeee, I have seen that on youtube, but he is using only one tee to learn. I'd like to generate like 50 fake players and choose one the best from generation(?). But thank you!  ðŸ˜‡ I will take a look ^^ His dummy is trying to kill opponent and my dummies will try to finish some easy ddnet maps. If I will be able to create those dummies xD
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BumBumeq> Ohh, I thought that his dummy is on client side but it looks like it's on server. Well that's exactly what I needed! Thank you so much @ChillerDragon
22:33 <+El_BobLex> hi is fstd there?
22:33 <+fstd> yes
22:36 <+El_BobLex> oh hello, i was wondering if you still make teeworlds mods. It was you and eeeee who made DDWar right? Do you have any plans on updating it to support tw 0.7? I know the mod is really old at this point but I had so many great times playing on the old DDWar server
22:37 <+fstd> yeah those were fun times
22:37 <+El_BobLex> fr dude
22:37 <+fstd> it's unlikely to be updated though :/
22:38 <+El_BobLex> Sad times man. I really miss it. I was trying to add /pause commands to the already existing code but i literally have 0 iq when it comes to that stuff kek
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is /pause in 0.7
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7 El_BobLex
22:39 <+fstd> wouldn't that be super abusable anyway?  as a means to save yourself in a bad situation
22:40 <+El_BobLex> I wouldn't think so. it's not like /spec. 
22:41 <+El_BobLex> Yeah i know that Chiller but I'm talking about DDWar not DDNet. Also i cannot code or know how to take already existing features from one mod into another.
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you said you want /pause?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What feature is missing?
22:42 <+El_BobLex> In DDWar /pause doesn't exist (0.6)
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so what makes ddwar differenet from ddrace?
22:43 <+El_BobLex> But not to worry, it's cool to see fstd still around
22:43 <+fstd> :)
22:43 <+El_BobLex> DDWar was a very popular blocking mod back in 2011-2013
22:43 <+fstd> does anybody know what's the FNG situation in 0.7?
22:43 <+fstd> not sure if i should update openfng or not
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is a fng2 0.7 on github
22:44 <+El_BobLex> what do u mean by situation?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like 3 fng mods on github for 0.7
22:44 <+fstd> whether there's a decent fng in 0.7
22:44 <+fstd> okay ty chiller
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think one decent
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my keks if im not mistaken
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> by
22:45 <+El_BobLex> 0.7 has 60 players playing the same DDRace map everyday kek
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> better play on my server :p
22:45 <+fstd> does the majority still play 0.6?  or is 0.6 now what 0.5 was in 0.6 times? :)
22:45 <+El_BobLex> majority still 0.6
22:45 <+fstd> i see
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fstd: i ported ddnet to 0.7 already (if you didnt know yet) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, I am working on my own client, unconnected to ddnet, which has some features already. Can be found here:
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://fokkonaut.github.io/F-Client
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think without me 0.7 wouldnt have as many players as it has right now, and i doubt anyone else would have ported ddnet yet :D
22:48 <+El_BobLex> Your client is nice, i use it when i go on 0.7 from time to time
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks!
22:48 <+El_BobLex> you doing gods work :)
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDWar is where the 64p patch originated from iirc
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just want to give something to those who play on 0.7 (and of course for myself, because I ported my mod to 0.7 too)
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah what's with the 40 players on MultimapLess every day
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I cant understand how Multimap is always the top1 map when there is a new version of Teeworlds xD
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> All those noobs, trying this and failing because it's too hard xD
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh haha maybe one day they'll all finish and move to just2easy or something
22:51 <+El_BobLex> Yeah, the majority of 0.7 players are new
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I feel bad for @ChillerDragon, he put work into his ZillyWoods client but since I started making my client, basically everyone moved to that. You can see that when you join a server, there is a small Z, F or G (or no symbol) next to the country flag of each player
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it's for F-Client, Gamer Client and ZillyWoods
22:54 <+El_BobLex> hey fokkonaut do you have a working server.exe for your ddnet port on 0.7. I cant compile stuff coz bam never works for me and visual studio makes me want to rip my hair out
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can compile using Cmake
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but yes, I do have
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/actions/runs/57698503
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can click on "Actions" in the DDNet7 repository, select the latest commit in master and download the binaries
22:55 <+El_BobLex> oh yeah, i forgot about cmake
22:55 <+El_BobLex> thanks man
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you're welcome
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bam is removed from ddnet7 btw
23:00 <+El_BobLex> Ok
23:23 <+El_BobLex> I left a thank you note to eeeee on his github back in August, but it applies to you too fstd :) https://github.com/eeeee/teeworlds/issues/36
23:36 <+fstd> :) yw
