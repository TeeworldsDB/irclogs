00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Alexander_ ill take a look tomorrow, see why you cant get the right colours
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Thank you
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> mute does not work
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/569289001463447562/unknown.png
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You nobo why did you even refactor mute its so bad and not working now
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just did a small refactor first that didnt break and wasnt bad imo but it wasnt accepted this way
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was told to refactor using functions
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which is better
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> goto stuff is not tw style and also goto is somehow weird
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont think the code is more readbale than before
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the old mute was good?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the goto was good :p
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Are you guys telling me the mute is Client side
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we are talking about the server side mute, not the client side muting
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> k
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Okay like
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> this is it
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I don't know how
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and why
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but firefox supports this
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://assembler.hugetee.com/
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> After MANY many hours
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I have finished this
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Well the first version of it
04:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://dark-the.me/is-the-only-theme/ByoK0Mmi8hUN.png
04:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Colors won't work correctly on complex skins (aoe4let, rastatee, tank, etc.)
04:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and also i found out that there isn't enough space for tank skin because of the border but you can still see it
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also @ChillerDragon
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i'm pretty sure custom colors work only for white skins
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just remembered we are doomed and we cant rfemove faketunes due to backwards compat
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even told you to observe what converting to hex means instead of relying on string operations
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you told me you understood
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then you went ahead and used string operations, i'm disappointed
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Alexander the problem with 2 and 0 is that it's quite possible that the H is just too small, your code most definitely rounds it out
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's quite possible color_from_rgb itself rounds the wrong direction
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at the very least out HslToRgb operates on normalized color vectors and RgbToHsl returns non normalized onez
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and they don't agree ðŸ˜›
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol python slow :p
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/569463903365496851/unknown.png
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yes @Learath2 but I can't just use that in javascript
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Alexander_ ofc you can, I coded it up 50 seconds ago
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon idk if its a joke or not but u know its in nanoseconds right
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.000647 ms
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> the bytes thing?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> give me the cod
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> give me the code
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr @Ryozuki
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it not too long ^ was half joke and half random ranting on python xd
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Kappa
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its 600 o.O big number
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i used 300 million as a maximum delay to count as doublekill
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon python isnâ€™t for efficiency
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am efficiency
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Alexander ```js
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> function twToHSL(tw) {
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   let H = (tw & 0xFF) / 255;
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   let S = ((tw >> 8) & 0xFF) / 255;
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   let L = 0.5 + (((tw >> 16) & 0xFF) / 255) * 0.5;
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>   return [H, S, L];
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> }```
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry irc
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does a client with `VERSION_DDRACE` support 64p?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> f4
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> it would affect some runs which used this bug to skip first part for example GetSpeed2
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> usr ur github acc u rat
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can u read konsti
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> Defaults are still the same
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> oh you mean as map settings :GWragMonkaS:
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tadzio> FIX THE LAGS
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tadzio> @jao
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://youtu.be/hbqVNlwfjxo?t=836 xd so bad could be made by me
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> deepfly doesnt work when i try it with dummy on main tee. it only works with main tee on dummy no matter who has strong
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yep
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is weird, if i play with dummy and i want to get out of Freeze into hf i also use deepfly bind, but it only works with one tee, idk why, maybe a bug
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that should be fixed*
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye that also how i noticed it
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fix it fokko
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And sometimes its the Opposite, it only works with dummy on main
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> on LAN server it always works in both ways
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> think its because the dummy/main can have different pings, but the client assumes it has the same ping as the one you're currently playing with
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i think its related to Which tee the server assume to have the better ping or something, like if you kill with main when dummy copy is enabled dummy often dies first and get strong Whats really annoying for doing noobfilters with dummy copy
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> loool nuborn
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn can you fix that some time? You are good with this kind of stuff xd
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> not sure, many things with dummy are a little buggy xd but think it can be improved
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> yes and fix dummy copy kill at the same time
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Improve em all ðŸ˜„
