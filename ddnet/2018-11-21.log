03:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ok but still the fact, that mods like ddrace came out through open source based teeworlds. so what i want to point out is... trying to update 0.7 as mod supported compare to older version doesnt seem right, since with open source, you can do anything with it.
03:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so sure, maybe nobody in the ddnet community would change to 0.7, but if there are some good features about it, then we should take into this mod. isnt that logical?
03:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and think, if somehow 0.7 would support mods, i would rather change my vlient into the basic one, since it got almost everything it needs.
03:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> What's the point about porting 0.7 ? Programs evolves, forks exists, features are sometimes ported sometimes not, that's how today you end up with like 15 differents *nix flavors, a bunch of Quake3 mods that became their own thing like urt for example..
03:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that is not how Oy would see
03:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he would see by looking back for the real products
03:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like it was only Ctf Dm etc
03:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he doesnt want it to change
03:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> there are mods for that
03:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> But yeah if that's how he wants to maintain that project he is free to do so
03:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the project (0.7) what Oy is working on, wont be based on mods. maybe it will change
03:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he is working on the different gui design, skin system, editor improments, and idk new browser?
03:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> And what's the issue about that ?
03:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> doesnt support mod connections as you saw
03:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which is a little dissapointmenr
03:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with the fact that Oy is against the mods
03:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> How is that an issue ? As i said you guys are free to try and convince him, but if it's the way he wants to go with he's free to do so
03:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he can do that of couse and we can make ourselfs that 0.7 version we want, but about profit and support ability, its just different
03:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like our supports for Oy is kinda meaningless
03:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and we cant understand his angery of mod supporting
03:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which it makes us
03:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> helpless
03:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> hm, i guess i just don't see it that way, you have a ton of different softwares that started as fork and diverge more and more until compatibility is loss, that's never really an issue
03:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its personal issue, not technical
06:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> @ChillerDragon I agree with you, continue to promote this point of view :ninja:
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im happy oy is making tw shittier, so we dont have to deal with 0.7
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wenn magnus das wÃ¼sste :saddo:
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum den juckt doch garnix
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> There you go @skua  ^
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> finally
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> also got rid of the bubble sorts ðŸ˜„
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not sure if my modern c++ stuff should go in, but I was too lazy to write it old style
