10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are using rust poggers
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which makes sense since rust has wasm as a first class citizen
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Another benefit of using Rust is having access to an ecosystem of high-quality libraries. For instance, we built an application that overlays debugger information on an application scene render using egui, a Rust GUI library. Integrating egui with our Wasm renderer took a couple of hours of work and offers us an easy way to gain insights into the engine‚Äôs internals.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> egui is like the imgui of c++ but in rust its also awesome <https://emilk.github.io/egui/>

11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats cute
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, its the most compact storage technology actually. Some tapes can store up to 500TB in the same space than a classic HDD
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + the offline thing makes it great for archiving, backup and protection against malware, especially ransomware that encrypts your data
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> microsd cards are 15mm x 11mm x 1mm; 3.5" hdd slots are 101mm x 26mm, if I assume a length of 150mm (can only find height and width), then I can put about 2300 microsd cards into a hdd slot, which translates into 2300 TB at 1 TB per microsd card
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not practical though üòõ
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + the cost would be way more expensive
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and SD cards have retention time of only few tens of years, while magnetic tape are closer to 100 of years irc
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and SD cards have retention time of only few tens of years, while magnetic tape are closer to 100 of years iirc
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably depends a lot on the tape used, and the extreme tapes probably haven't even existed long enough to say anything about the lifespan
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you don't need to wait 10 years to know, you just test it in degraded conditions for a few days (usually 85¬∞C) and count the numbers of bit flip
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Then, of course, is just an estimation
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I've measured 3.5''HD size: 100 mm x 145 mm x 24 mm
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Good estimation
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> could it be possible to turn switches on / off with rcon ?  just like switch_open is a thing for map settings already
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> Hi, I was wondering if it has ever been considered to add a configuration option for the antiping feature that would allow for disabling prediction for non-frozen tees, basically eliminating the whole jittering issue. This seems kind of obvious from a gores players perspective, so sorry if this has already been discussed.
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> Okay, I just came across https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3549, apperently I spelled antiping wrong in my search üôÑ
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> that issue is for when you are frozen
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> Could be... At any rate I would love to hear some opinions about it üôÇ
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> going from frozen to unfrozen or unfrozen to frozen would look really weird i think
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> without looking at any code, isnt that the same issue as stopping local prediction when the local character is frozen?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> this issue seems kind of related, but a different idea (and also trickier to do) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1712
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah they would both be weird
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> Interesting, thank you.
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> One more thing, I vaguely remember hearing about ddnet not wanting to add any new console commands / variables... Would that be related if say I wanted to implement a feature like this?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> was that regarding my message or trml's?
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it was to yours, but trml's would also be weird
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> Oh, I thought turning off prediction while frozen was already implemented... Maybe I am mixing something up here.
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i think right now, prediction only gets turned off for ppl in solo or when you are spectating
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> a nice thing about only doing it for frozen tees is that you would at least have a visual cue of when prediction is disabled/enabled, which you wouldn't necessarily have with the other one
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> not sure about the console commands
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the visual cue would be slightly off though because of prediction
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I thought as in ninja skin/no ninja. unless it's also extended to non-frozen non-moving tees
