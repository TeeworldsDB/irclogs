11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen sorri for the late response. Sure classical ddnet servers are also a nice traget but i think the block server is too much of an target compared to the value it gives. It is not connected to the point system no team members care about it. As far as i know there are now new map releases or any ddnet specifiy block maps. The server is just there because ddnet can. But compared to some random se <message clipped>
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon shut them down already, don't care much
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok cool c:
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> what happends
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/441575856150675456/unknown.png
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon note that deen said that there weren't fewer attacks after the block servers were shut down
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 note that the long text was a response to exactly that statement xd
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it doesn't seem to be a target
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rest is OK I guess
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like really no target at all?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i cant believe that even i get ddosed sometimes with my block servers and its not even a mainstream map
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I updated ddnet.tw to 2 GB RAM instead, so /players/ is now running locally on DDNet.tw again
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :O
15:23 <@deen> because running it on CAN was a bit stupid with 1200 ms latency, now back to a more normal 60-140 ms
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 how do I set up a darn `nk_user_font` structure
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have some kind of minimal example
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I only ever used it with someones wrapper for it in unreal engine but they do have examples in their source tree iirc
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with examples of the render backend even
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, and an example in the readme that doesn't work ._.
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's documented in nuklear.h if you didn't see that yet
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but try to figure out how to get a simple font from there ^^
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, never really had to do that part myself
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear/blob/master/example/file_browser.c
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, the makefile in the directory worked 🙂
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear/blob/master/nuklear.h#L3749 is pretty descriptive actually
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon so now GER still keeps getting attacked, next shut down GER since that's obviously the main target?
17:20 <+Learath2> :D
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> yes, ddnet was ddosed many times so playesr would go to exec servers in case you didn't know
