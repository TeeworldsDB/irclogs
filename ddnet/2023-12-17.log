00:05 < bridge> <Ewan> jupstar sell me your gpu
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, when AMD gives me new Gen
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The 7000 series was too few of an upgrade sadly
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> when they giving u the 7900 xt
00:09 < bridge> <gerdoe> any guidestyle?
00:09 < ChillerDragon> @gerdoe instead of vectoring aliases in a command just register multiple commands for every alias
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> @gerdoe i just dont know what you mean
00:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it even trivially copied?
00:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it pod rn?
00:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it ever trivially copied?
00:11 < bridge> <gerdoe> bloat
00:11 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah its just couple of char arrays
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well you gotta be careful with mem copy of we still use the unsafe variant of it
00:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else i guess it's rather constant data, right?
00:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well you gotta be careful with mem copy if we still use the unsafe variant of it
00:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> then its not that obvious to implement pod ccommands with aliases in them hm
00:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> how much aliases do commands have usually?
00:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> is like 3-5 enough
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it's a one time setup thing u can defs go with vec
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also the char arrays should also be strings
00:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why waste memory if ccommands never change
00:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 where are you, memory fanboy
00:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Stop wasting my bytes
00:16 < bridge> <gerdoe> ill bite the byte
00:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah no
00:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> it gets set 1 time
00:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see
00:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also string views of the chars are string literals
00:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok night xd
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> wut
00:23 < bridge> <learath2> I'm in Milan. I'll allow the waste of bytes
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> lerato why they didn't mod me
00:24 < bridge> <learath2> I veto'd it
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> so real
00:24 < bridge> <learath2> You don't enjoy C enough
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> fucked up...
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway a little bit more insight than 'there was more competition' would be helpful so i can know what's up if i decide to apply next time
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> the message was copy pasted anyway so it's like anyone who didn't get it was given the same message
00:28 < bridge> <louis> probably you're just a little newer to the community and haven't interacted with many people compared to other candidates if id guess
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i  guess
00:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i think there was only 1 other usa applicant
00:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://tenor.com/view/speed-wheelchair-me-running-late-gif-14178485
00:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> im coming to Milan to show you new CComand
00:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd
00:31 < bridge> <learath2> If you put a vector in it I'll do a crime
00:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> kill me already
00:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> anyway question is still open
00:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> any other way to implement multi command name
00:32 < bridge> <learath2> If we needed one more US mod you'd probably be it
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> Yesh
00:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> suggest then :D
00:34 < bridge> <learath2> Just mimic whatever we have rn. Register twice nice simple, it even wastes memory Jupstra would love it
00:35 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd okey
00:35 < bridge> <gerdoe> i wanna ddnetware not bloatware
00:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> c&p ftw
00:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> the ddnet way™ you mean
00:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ofc
00:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet codebase doesnt like innovation
00:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> registering twice is likely less expensive than introducing a vector for all commands
00:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> but you setting the same 256 bytes
00:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> like twice or more
00:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> its not that much tbh but iwhy vector will consume more than this
00:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because the vector is already 24 bytes, and will likely get added for each command. plus its contents
00:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> so lets do the little math: 2 times standard ccommand object = 512 bytes, 1 time vector ccomand object = 24+(lets bring the maximum of command name)32+224=280 bytes
00:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> i can be wrong btw im just curious about how to do better multi-alias
00:56 < bridge> <learath2> Are they really this big?
00:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah wait vector ccommand will consume 312 at maximum if we have to store 2 aliases
00:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, I was talking about the whole picture
00:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> 256 bytes 1 pod ccommand
00:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we have very few aliases
00:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but a vector in the command struct
00:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> applies to all commands, not just those that have aliases
00:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah good point
00:57 < bridge> <learath2> That is more than I expect ngl
00:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> btw any reason why chat commands should be stored as pod structs in vector
00:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> and not like some constant thing
00:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> wait
00:59 < bridge> <gerdoe> i was looking at client ccomand all the time
00:59 < bridge> <gerdoe> holy crap
00:59 < bridge> <gerdoe> 3 am hits different
01:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah there's no reason to add vector in it
01:01 < bridge> <gerdoe> its just 3 const char*
01:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> #4100 was a mistake xddd
01:08 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4100
01:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is a pod
01:12 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/146452/what-are-pod-types-in-c
01:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> plain old data
01:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> a
01:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thank
01:14 < bridge> <learath2> Afaik it’s a term that has been deprecated in the standard
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not much of an explanation
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller afaik pod structs are classes or structs which can only be comprised of c-compatible types (primitives and other POD structs) so they can be treated as a contiguous chunk of data and not something more conceptual like classes in cpp
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> so a POD struct won’t be decorated with things like automatic ctors and dtors
01:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah no nesting hm
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought it’s just about not having behavior/methods
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah said they can contain other pod structs
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Red your message wrong
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> pod is a myth anyway
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> you shouldn’t need to have your struct be represented in this way unless you’re working with c code which needs to be able to understand your structure
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> the representation in memory is just an added bonus to that
01:36 < bridge> <learath2> You want StandardLayoutType nowadays
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i got my dog back from the groomer
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> she is a very sweet girl
01:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> thats why i bringed SO answer but whatever
02:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> nice this multialias workaround has no sense since name is first argument and we can't use variadic without messing up whole file to only get some fancy brackets
02:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> also brackets are disallowed in c macro
02:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> not the brackets itself tho
02:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> like preprocesser thinks that `MACRO({"first", "second"})`  has two arguments isntead of one
02:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> im giving up on this
02:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> 2 hours of lurking xd
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn’t see it
04:44 < bridge> <Ewan> quotes around and escape the pair item quotes
04:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it will get you somewhere with stringify
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why xd
10:36 < ChillerDragon> jopsti where do u live
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning vietnam
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khZq6JKVnlk
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: in almania
10:48 < bridge> <learath2> Protip: `MACRO(({"first", "second"}))` 😛
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to write yet another proc macro
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it will be my 10th proc macro.
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am getting better in this
10:52 < ChillerDragon> jopsti which city
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> jopsti which street
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> which house
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all i will say is, that it is "Münsterland"
10:53 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702806809.png
10:53 < ChillerDragon> lerato!
10:53 < ChillerDragon> im close to rq
10:54 < ChillerDragon> next to bielefeld lmao
10:55 < ChillerDragon> lerato whats your guess how many times or days we have been in the same city at the same time
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> teero or smth is from bielefeld
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this nobo
10:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
10:56 < ChillerDragon> imagine nobody beliving you where you come from
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you want some interesting history
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the most famous one
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also one of the most beautiful places around here
11:04 < ChillerDragon> o
11:04 < ChillerDragon> im onto somsin
11:05 < ChillerDragon> lerato u knew the full solution all along didnt u -,-
11:05 < ChillerDragon> why am i coding this then
11:07 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702807653.png
11:07 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702807666.png
11:08 < ChillerDragon> im sure heinrich loves the simplicity xd
11:09 < ChillerDragon> im still not sure i like all the added ({})
11:17 < bridge> <Fussel> why do you use a macro?
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> @chillerdragon ```cpp
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> #include <iostream>
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> using namespace std;
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> 
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> template<typename H, typename ... T> constexpr auto last_of(H const& h, T const&... t)
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> {
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel>     if constexpr (sizeof...(t)) return last_of(t...); else return h;
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> }
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> 
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> template<typename H, typename ... T> constexpr void A(H const& h, T const&... t)
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> {
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel>     cout << h << " " << last_of(t...) << endl;
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel>     if constexpr (sizeof...(t) > 1) A(t...);
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> }
11:27 < bridge> <Fussel> 
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel> int main(int, char**)
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel> {
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel>     A("r","rescue", "command for ChillerDragon");
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel>     A("top","top5", "mess with selfesteem");
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel>     A("earrape", "fng only");
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel> }
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel> ```
11:28 < bridge> <Fussel> could be eased if the helptext comes first in the parameter list
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> macros can be redefined as something else
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i just realized my approach is fucked
11:33 < bridge> <Fussel> Do. Not. Use. Macros. Where. You. Can. Avoid. Them.
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Can we avoid them?
11:34 < bridge> <Fussel> not always ^^
11:34 < bridge> <Fussel> but it's rare
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean in our case
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not in general
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imo the macros bring something really nice for us here
11:34 < bridge> <Fussel> I posted a solution
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about the client side then?
11:35 < bridge> <Fussel> I've to confess I don't have a clue what you mean 😦
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client also includes the file
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but tbh we are not really using the power of macros yet
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i would like to do that
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to also generate the function definitions of the callbacks
11:36 < bridge> <Fussel> macros are very difficult to debug
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4af28fd2d87e8e1c5629874b2a0ee16d0860a18b/src/game/client/components/chat.cpp#L34
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here we want the macro to mean something else than on the server side
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tbh i am also pro removing that
11:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> Check lua source code :troll:
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Fussel did anyone ever have to debug them?
11:37 < bridge> <robyt3> You don't really need macros and templates here, just always use `{"cmd"}` also if there is only one command and only work with an initializer list
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 you also wanna remove all macros!?
11:38 < bridge> <Fussel> he wanted to get rid of the `{}`, it was his choice 😄
11:39 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702809540.png
11:39 < ChillerDragon> sos
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> sose
11:39 < ChillerDragon> seems like the initializer list goes out of scope and then all breaks
11:39 < bridge> <Fussel> <ChillerDragon> here we want the macro to mean something else than on the server side ← and this is a good example for where things easily go wrong but are difficult to debug
11:40 < ChillerDragon> @Fussel i do not remember debugging being an issue there ever
11:40 < ChillerDragon> also do you recommend to change the whole current implementation of 10yr old macro code just because it could be difficult to debug? xd
11:40 < bridge> <Fussel> as long as a macro works as intended, you don't need to do ^^
11:41 < bridge> <Fussel> no, but it's unnecessary to _proceed_ with this
11:41 < ChillerDragon> @robyt3 i am not sure i understood what you mean
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I imagine it would looks like this, untested:
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> #define CHAT_COMMAND(names, params, flags, callback, userdata, help) \
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> for(const char *pName : names) \
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3>     m_pConsole->Register(name, params, flags, callback, userdata, help);
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> 
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> CHAT_COMMAND({"map"}, "?r[map]", CFGFLAG_CHAT | CFGFLAG_SERVER | CFGFLAG_NONTEEHISTORIC, ConMap, this, "Vote a map by name")
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I imagine it would look like this, untested:
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> #define CHAT_COMMAND(names, params, flags, callback, userdata, help) \
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> for(const char *pName : names) \
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3>     m_pConsole->Register(pName, params, flags, callback, userdata, help);
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> 
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> CHAT_COMMAND({"map"}, "?r[map]", CFGFLAG_CHAT | CFGFLAG_SERVER | CFGFLAG_NONTEEHISTORIC, ConMap, this, "Vote a map by name")
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> wont work
11:44 < ChillerDragon> i guess
11:44 < ChillerDragon> because you didnt put (
11:45 < ChillerDragon> ``CHAT_COMMAND({"map", "bar"}, "?r[map]", CFGFLAG_CHAT | CFGFLAG_SERVER | CFGFLAG_NONTEEHISTORIC, ConMap, this, "Vote a map by name")``
11:45 < ChillerDragon> here the , between map and bar ist a seperator for the macro args
11:45 < ChillerDragon> so you need partenthesis around
11:46 < ChillerDragon> which then breaks the : loop
11:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Makes sense
11:47 < ChillerDragon> and then the () are included 
11:48 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702810081.png
11:48 < ChillerDragon> without it works fine
11:48 < ChillerDragon> with it doesnt
11:48 < ChillerDragon> so i decided to call std::initilaizer_list manually and let it use the parenthesis
11:48 < ChillerDragon> problem is that variable i defined now goes out of scope and leaves a dangling pointer
11:49 < ChillerDragon> in my test env i had warnings off and all worked fine but in ddnet code -Wdangling broke :c
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> Once maybe
11:49 < ChillerDragon> yea sounds realistic
11:49 < ChillerDragon> chiler reply guessing pro
11:50 < ChillerDragon> i srsly developed another sense
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> Now that is nasty, + it still requires the extra parens too because macros don't care about braces
11:51 < ChillerDragon> so how to fix
11:51 < ChillerDragon> im out of ideas
11:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Remove the macro entirely and pass an initializer list directly to an overloaded function :pepeH:
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> Just mess around with it until you get bored. I'll give it a lookover if you don't find the solution
11:52 < ChillerDragon> omg robsit
11:53 < ChillerDragon> but then it breaks my epic macro plan
11:53 < ChillerDragon> of deleting half of gamecontext.h
11:53 < bridge> <learath2> If you want to get rid of macros you can also use polymorphism to achieve the difference in behaviour
11:53 < ChillerDragon> i do not
11:54 < ChillerDragon> want
11:54 < ChillerDragon> to
11:54 < ChillerDragon> get
11:54 < ChillerDragon> rid
11:54 < ChillerDragon> of
11:54 < ChillerDragon> the
11:54 < ChillerDragon> macros
11:54 < bridge> <learath2> I love the macro too. So elegant
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> get rid of the macros
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> use rust
11:54 < ChillerDragon> auh9wdh8oawd
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use proc macros
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Chat commands shouldn't really be registered for all mods as macros on the server side, if you want to support modding.
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> This seems like a useless macro to me:
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> #define CHAT_COMMAND(name, params, flags, callback, userdata, help) m_pConsole->Register(name, params, flags, callback, userdata, help);
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> those are cleaner
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually in rust
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> This code should be in the individual mod gamecontrollers
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> we could have made a macro with a custom DSL for declaring commands
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> we could also do the localization with macros
11:55 < ChillerDragon> @robyt3 it can be in gamecontrollers already
11:56 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/blob/17974abe3fe1922c7d4ad8655b77ea4619774fd2/src/game/server/gamemodes/base_instagib.cpp#L17-L19
11:56 < ChillerDragon> userdata and callback can be something other than cgamecontext
11:56 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAICT the only reason for the chat command macros to exist is because they are hard-coded for the client as well (#7665), which I agree should probably not be the case anymore (in some time when most mods had time to update to using chat command messages)
11:56 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7665
11:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Now just unexpand the macro and the inclusion and it looks good, I don't see a reason for this indirection
11:57 < ChillerDragon> and the next reason will be to generate this with macros https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4af28fd2d87e8e1c5629874b2a0ee16d0860a18b/src/game/server/gamecontext.h#L369-L482
11:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Now just expand the macro and the inclusion and it looks good, I don't see a reason for this indirection
11:57 < ChillerDragon> wat does that mean robsti
11:58 < ChillerDragon> which indirection
11:58 < bridge> <robyt3> It means removing the macro and the file
11:58 < ChillerDragon> o
11:58 < bridge> <robyt3> And putting the actual C++ directly into the file
11:58 < ChillerDragon> hm
11:58 < ChillerDragon> bbut
11:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Because it only makes it more complicated to go to other files again
11:58 < ChillerDragon> imagine having to define functions in a header file
11:58 < ChillerDragon> so annoying
11:58 < ChillerDragon> when it can be macro generaterd
11:58 < bridge> <robyt3> That's why command callbacks should be `std::functions` so you can pass lambda expressions when registering the command
11:59 < ChillerDragon> oh 
11:59 < bridge> <robyt3> This additional indirection of command handler functions is even more annoying
12:00 < ChillerDragon> ok you totally knocked me out now xd
12:00 < ChillerDragon> yea sounds good but i suddenly lost motivation
12:00 < bridge> <Fussel> Can multiple joins/leaves happen between 2 consecutive snapshots?
12:00 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: It's a huge change and I don't want you or me to do it right now, but that's the end result I would like to see
12:01 < ChillerDragon> yea but then
12:01 < ChillerDragon> what am i doing here
12:01 < ChillerDragon> :D
12:01 < ChillerDragon> i just close the pr and call it a day
12:01 < ChillerDragon> sad that i didnt get to generate headers
12:01 < bridge> <robyt3> In general I'd prefer less usage of the preprocessor instead of more
12:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Hard-coded server console commands should also be removed from the client eventually
12:02 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:02 < ChillerDragon> eventually

12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why am i so old 😭
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u so old
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno when the fuck the time passed so fast
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear yesterday i was like 20
12:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i should make yt vids but lazy
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> horse races or what are they about
12:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> i did it all, couldnt compile either
12:59 < bridge> <gerdoe> brought protocol structure for some reason
13:03 < bridge> <learath2> Don't if you don't want to become jail
13:05 < bridge> <gerdoe> tried one more time - still doesn't work xd
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller are you still interested in the console command registration thing? If not I'll make template blackmagic
13:05 < bridge> <teero777> hello jail I'm Teero
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> There is no way the preprocessor is allowed to split that into two, are you sure you aren't testing it wrong?
13:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> tested, preprocesser thinks that `{"map", /* <- this one */ "nomap"}` has two arguments isntead of one
13:09 < bridge> <gerdoe> templates > macros
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> Skill issue
13:09 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd
13:13 < bridge> <gerdoe> i have forgotten why did i close #6517
13:13 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6517
13:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> seems to be messed up tho
13:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah
13:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> real skill issue then
14:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have up and are totally out. Feel free to do whatever c:
14:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Gave
14:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fuxk phones
14:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> nah its unreal for me to make it work
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie im improving my flutter
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> dart is like modern java
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185941224495001670/image.png?ex=659170d5&is=657efbd5&hm=3d7928886d41a85f9fb8bd792c0236b0fdaf7e086810a9ee583573c96b57603b&
14:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make an AI Chat bot
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> that can be cool
14:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so i can dump chillers chat history in there and have a mini chillerdragon in my pocket
14:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O gimme gimme
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie do u know any public apis?
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> or run my own model
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> sounds expensive
14:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> RWKV can probably run on phones
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.rwkv.com/
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> this?
14:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> uh oh
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk how to use this
14:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk either lol
14:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i tried compiling rwkv.cpp and it ran fine on cpu only.
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe something simpler as a first complex flutter app
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> It’s probably just a couple python calls
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually ill use my own todo app as a list to buy groceries
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always wanted an add free one
14:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so its probably okay to run a 1.4b models on phones with cpu only
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Everything AI is made for the lowest common denominator. The new pRoGrAMmeRs
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer smth dart natvie
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> native
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to see how dart can interface  with python
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://dart.dev/
14:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> jtx Board is foss i think?
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw the hot reload is insane
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i literally run the app on all time
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> modern tooling is smth else
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> Hot reload is such a pleasure to have
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> also using the app on my phone is even seamless
14:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean, rwkv.cpp is native :owo:
14:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rwkv ai00 server also has a vulkan implementation
14:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its pretty cool to not rely on cuda or python
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> also the refactor abilities are p good

15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> get better internet
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> :4Head:
15:17 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> literally every game ever accounts for poor internet except ddnet
15:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wtf is this emote
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> 4head
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> from twitch
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> with a tradeoff
15:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i thought it was stepfunn
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> the tradeoff is to give more control to client
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> which allows hacks
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is completly server authoritive
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well it requires precise movements
15:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> kog+bad internet+loud music
15:32 < bridge> <teero777> music not loud xddd
15:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> kog players cant live without their loud music
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> downloading gta6
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> k
15:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> do you really want to replay trailer forever

15:57 < bridge> <coke1465> pretty new
15:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ik but i heard old versions / events were better than this one
15:58 < bridge> <coke1465> yes bcs nowdays nobody care

16:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> womp womp
16:03 < bridge> <coke1465> no p2w, only own skillz
16:03 < bridge> <coke1465> idk its the best game 😄
16:03 < bridge> <coke1465> but kids these days want to be the best after 3 hours
16:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> skillz and The Internet Speed of Jesus Christ
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and good mouse
16:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but i can imagine how easy ddnet is when you guys release the same gameplay 7 times
16:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> in a month
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat?
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and 3080

18:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sounds weird

19:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> like are there logs or smt?
19:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there should be
19:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i installed chrome :owo:
19:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to remember password for discord :pepeW:
19:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 😬
19:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ez 5th try, holy hel
19:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ez5thtry,holyh31 nice pwd
19:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nothing on chrome
19:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> always knew firefox sucks
19:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im chrome andy now
19:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi
19:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> where is server log file ?
19:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> wow , here is not much going on without me 🙂
19:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the quitting. please wait is so annoying on windows "idk about linux tho" it take sometimes a minute to quit the game
19:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah why does it do that
19:48 < bridge> <robyt3> The client needs to wait for all background jobs to complete before it can quit or it may crash when quitting
19:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> do you suggest i don't alt+f4 my way out ?
19:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is it the same on linux ?
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably doesn't cause problems right now, but I wouldn't recommend it. You could also Alt+Tab out already.
19:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be, it's the serverlist refresh jobs taking the longest
20:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I can confirm the "bug" is on linux too
21:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> it can't force jobs to end?
21:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't work very well with the current curl interface we are using, would be improved by #5842

21:47 < bridge> <-StormAh~> about render text
21:47 < bridge> <-StormAh~> can i make somehow to rainbow only the text i need
21:48 < bridge> <-StormAh~> cause it looks like
21:48 < bridge> <-StormAh~> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1186047184379056238/image.png?ex=6591d384&is=657f5e84&hm=84ac079980decf69a0ba6041e343a36229cca50984abf4fa9922a55d93671f25&
21:48 < bridge> <-StormAh~> eww
21:48 < bridge> <-StormAh~> can i make somehow to rainbow only the text i want to be rainbowed
21:48 < bridge> <robyt3> The text color is a global variable, you need to reset to the default text color after doing your colored text
21:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :pepeW: just client.cpp things
21:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1186046396567146556/image.png?ex=6591d2c8&is=657f5dc8&hm=5f0520be02d09bb4c52249c0187c31ddb84984d2527957bdcdcd7f906a23ddbb&
21:53 < bridge> <-StormAh~> works, thanks
21:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i remember running into that problem when redoing the editor ui
22:13 < bridge> <-StormAh~> 1 more question
22:14 < bridge> <-StormAh~> how  can i put multiple names in `strcmp`?
22:14 < bridge> <-StormAh~> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1186053783529201704/image.png?ex=6591d9a9&is=657f64a9&hm=897b7a20391edb205463e9d30ec46b9510c82560c191cc3b39ef70599e16c461&
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you want it to do? Check if the name matches either or matches both?
22:15 < bridge> <-StormAh~> put multiple names like -StormAx || melom etc
22:15 < bridge> <-StormAh~> so i dont have to make 100500 new lines
22:15 < bridge> <-StormAh~> so i don`t have to make 100500 new lines
22:15 < bridge> <-StormAh~> so i don't have to make 100500 new lines
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Move the logical or outside the function call: `str_comp(..., ...) == 0 || str_comp(..., ...) == 0`
22:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> im getting special notice in your client ? :monkaStop:
22:17 < bridge> <-StormAh~> ofc ;D
22:18 < bridge> <-StormAh~> ugmmm
22:18 < bridge> <-StormAh~> like this?
22:18 < bridge> <-StormAh~> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1186054865185685514/image.png?ex=6591daab&is=657f65ab&hm=b758f26ee9b7078d1f12410e1a3cdb2bacf08fe2f0f6143e3c6b5c4c1bc408a9&
22:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> thats one way to do it, yes
22:18 < bridge> <-StormAh~> ok cool
22:19 < bridge> <-StormAh~> :D
22:19 < bridge> <-StormAh~> thanks
22:23 < bridge> <devinci24> Out of curiosity, are those jobs network oriented? I did not seem to encounter that screen when having a pretty good internet
22:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, it's the jobs to determine the best master server. If you have a good connection to all master servers then it should be done quickly
22:35 < bridge> <robyt3> If you don't quit right after refreshing the server list (or after starting the client) then it should also quit pretty fast
22:41 < bridge> <devinci24> Oh that's very good to know. I'll keep in mind to not refresh before leaving, something that I do quite a lot xD.
22:41 < bridge> <devinci24> Thanks!
23:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can we cache that result across reboots?
23:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Possibly, but I'm almost done reworking #7376. Now that jobs can be cancelled, the client quits almost immediately.
23:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7376
23:14 < bridge> <furo321> You can create `ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg` in the same directory as `settings_ddnet.cfg` and put a url there. `https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json` for example and it should be cached.
23:17 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think that prevents the requests to determine the best master though
23:19 < bridge> <furo321> It seems to, the game quits pretty much instantly now.
23:21 < bridge> <robyt3> At least for quitting after initial start it doesn't seem to make a difference, i.e. with command line `ddnet quit`
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> It does for me?
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> ```
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> With ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> DDNet quit  0.81s user 0.64s system 88% cpu 1.641 total
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> 
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> Without
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> DDNet quit  0.92s user 0.68s system 31% cpu 5.011 total
23:24 < bridge> <furo321> ```
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe it simply doesn't try other master servers
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Jobs should simply get a bool "canceable" and skip execution if true and in destructor
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why does it matter that the http request is not finished?
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or can one not cancel curl requests?
23:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, but we are not doing that at the correct time right now, we are only cancelling jobs in destructors when it's too late. I'll probably update 7376 tomorrow, adding `IJob::Cancel`.
23:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So our problem is that we don't handle any curl error is curl was stopped and what ever blocking call returned an error? Or is that simply not possible?
23:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So our problem is that we don't handle any curl error if curl was stopped and what ever blocking call returned an error? Or is that simply not possible?
23:32 < bridge> <robyt3> The code is already there to properly abort the curl calls, but we only abort the HTTP requests when they are already done effectively
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is there no global instance or something for curl, that we have to stop?
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or can stop*
23:34 < bridge> <robyt3> That's probably what curl-multi is for, it will make quitting even faster I assume
23:34 < bridge> <robyt3> We neglect to call `curl_global_cleanup`
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh OK. Didn't know curl is such low level api
23:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Curl has a progressfunction callback that can tell curl to abort, but we don't tell curl to abort soon enough at the moment
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I find it really overkill how hard it is to use, considering we do like 2 http requests lmao
23:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> theoretically we could just quit the process while the http requests are still running
23:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but we don't have the signaling that the http requests are unimportant
23:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and since we introduced important jobs, such as editor saving, we have to wait for some jobs, at least
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well abort sounds like something a async code could support. So i guess that would be one good way.
23:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're using the sync interface of curl
23:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> curl-multi would be the async interface
23:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're using the sync interface of curl (in a thread)
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but apparently we can handle aborts already
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As far as i understood rbyte
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Here
23:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure that actually works if no bytes are currently being received on the http stream
23:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, that's the issue with the current progress callback, it is only called when bytes are received
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe we could use a simpler http lib
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There doesn't seem very high interest by any Dev to maintain good code
23:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when "just quitting" works, what's the problem with libcurl?
23:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> curl is the de facto standard library for doing http(s) requests, don't htink we should switch to something else
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But apparently we cannot just abort requests
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And we de facto don't have curl multi
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can easily abort requests
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (at the time where we want it)
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by just not waiting for the curl threads to complete
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok then apparently we can now
23:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems to work well enough with what I have right now, but curl-multi would be evem better
23:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems to work well enough with what I have right now, but curl-multi would be even better
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You mean a quick exit?
23:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
23:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just no thread_join on the thread doing the http request
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That sounds like a hack to me. Leave it to the OS. Im lazy
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In theory it could wait for it
23:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the OS is much better at cleanup anyway
23:46 < bridge> <robyt3> How would you model "important" jobs? `bool IsImportant()` with default `false` or `bool IsCancellable()` with default `true`?
23:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `bool ShouldWaitBeforeQuitting()`? maybe even defaulting to `true` to opt out of it?
23:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Slightly annoying because the process will linger around for a moment
23:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's same thinking as global variables.
23:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not modular, it's not reusable. I dislike it
23:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which process will linger around?
23:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's also faster ^^
23:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Or does the process die immediately if only curl threads remain?
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can live with slower exit, if that means cleaner code
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The Vulkan spec even forbids it
23:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it will exit immediately
23:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since leaving main e.g. calls `exit_group` on Linux
23:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which kills all other threads as well
23:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does the vulkan spec forbid?
