00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I've implemented the double serverinfo protocol now, which listens on two ports and sends out two server infos if needed, in order to make every single player findable in DDNet and 0.7
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now a second questions comes to my mind: Am I allowed to broadcast another server, that will also lead to my main server but it will automatically join a minigame and will also be broadcasted as this? Like this, also players who would never join a block server would join a cool minigame like survival :)
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (reply)
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. make sure not to show players more than once
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> alright
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is the http master somehow more picky than the LAN browser?
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont see the server in http when numclients != array length of players or so for example
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and if i try to fill it up with empty names, its gonna use them instead of the information i wanted
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/67091b4727a9730df496c2c5bfaf2aed90c30489/serverbrowse/src/protocol.rs#L329
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it checks that num_clients is equal to the number of clients
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but this sounds like you show a greater total number of players in the serverbrowser than you have
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if I add the number of players in each of your server, that should not exceed the number of players on that server
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes because the client only goes up to 64 and i show /128
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before i just sent all players and gave a shit about which player now got sent or is being used in the client
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now i only send specific 64 and on the 2nd server specific x
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and that doesnt work, because i still wanna show /128
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and if i just fill it up, so 64 + x = clientcount, then those x empty slots are being used by the client, no matter if i attach them at the end. why doesnt it use the first 64 entries?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does it sort them anywhere
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it sorts them
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where and how?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> three lines below the link I sent above
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> three lines below in the link I sent above
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> self.info.token?
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we talk about different links?
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I talk about serverbrowser/src/protocol.rs line 332, three lines below the line 329 I sent above
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess?
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah below omg
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and what does this sorting do?
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> alphabetically?
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, by codepoint
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gg xd
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then i can revert eveything
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or i fill it up with zzzzzzzzz and hope nobody is gonna take that name
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah well, special letters
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or do you have any other ideas
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can not tell the client which client information to use with this
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one of the other ideas was to add 128 player support to the ddnet serverbrowser
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea but i have no idea how and which parts of your code has to be changed
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just ddnet client-side code that needs change
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that would imply we need a m_aClients array of size 128
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aka MAX_CLIENTS = 128
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, or dynamically allocated
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and u htink i can do that
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could change the `m_aClients` array to a length different from `MAX_CLIENTS`
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> smart move
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well nice i think i can revert all of my double serverinfo code then xd
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> except if i leave it for 0.7 only
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> meeeeeeh
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 get the camera
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut you accidentally changed the ddnet-libs submodule
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> uh fuck this
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can u patch it out
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please do it yourself
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok then u have to wait til tomorrow
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but rest is fine?
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rest is fine
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen that was quick! xD
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Is there any ddnet app for Android? Would like to spectate some players
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Without using pc
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.2.apk but it's not a great experience
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Ty. Is spectating possible with it? I remember I once had a client but I think I couldn't spectate
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ./pause <name>
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> optionally you can go to the SDL settings and bind a button to a key and then go to ingame settings and set that key to +spectate
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Okay I will try that out. Thanks
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Ok so /pause and then you can choose between players in the scoreboard. Kind of xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> @fokkonaut how can I quit a server? xD
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk how to open pause menu
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i used this many years ago to farm in iF city
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> I think it's not possible lmao
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think u have to bind pause menu or so, maybe the back key on ur phone?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Oh
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> That's actually it
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Nice
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> But uhm. How can I bind things to a key. I mean I can only use the keyboard when I am in the chat
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> And then
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Well
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> I chat xD
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/927203663380906024/Screenshot_20220102-151559_DDraceNetwork_Client.jpg
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> What a pleasant experience ahahah
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> why p
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Idk lol. It happened after I tabbed out and in again
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> But it's normal now again
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 would it be possible to add a variable timescore to the serverinfo request? 0.7 did the same and its perfect because we dont rely on any gamemode names the
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> n
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> how long does it take for the master server to refresh the list for changing server to sv_register 0
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> w
16:23 <+Learath2> w
16:23 <+Learath2> Shouldn't take more than 10s
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> w
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> It worked after 5 seconds for all of our servers
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <botipont> w
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> boti
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> meg
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> the wide of the texture las_keto is not divideable by 8 or the height by 4, it could occur visual bugs
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/927255359704399932/unknown.png
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> whats that
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maffs
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> drunk mapper added stretched mapres

19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> @Shyzo the server list works for u?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> where is the ddnet phone app src code?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> pppppppppppppppppppp
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> @nouaa github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Oh Fuck ok, i thought it has its own repo
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was the normal source code, but we removed the code a long time ago
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I think Jupeyy recently added something back for Android SDL2 support, but no one built a new executable with it
