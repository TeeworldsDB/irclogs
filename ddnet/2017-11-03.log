22:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #937: Fix `3 / 2` using integer division (master...pr_ddnet_one_point_five) https://git.io/vFcrV
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> is it a valid reaons to ban someone because he's using a name always given to someone?
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> just askin there is a discussion on the server im right now
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and im just curious
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> for example if you'd call yourself laboon
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No idea, for me no
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you cant check if someone is someone
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if he's not a admin/mod
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes that makes sense
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so for me there's no reason to ban
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but if someone is faking, and he knows that. Then that guy is asshole ðŸ˜›
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> haha ðŸ˜„
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have a faker
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "iG' Savander"
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he's from my country, i don't know why. since 6 months
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and he's playing with my old nickname, and sometimes insults others
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oh wth
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but idk i think fakers are part of the game lol
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, especially this one
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> they have been here for the last 10 yrs and will be there for the next hahaha
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> exactly
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know that, my "faker"
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is a young guy
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like 12y.o.
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but still
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he should know, that it's bad
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i think he will cringe in a few yrs if he thinks about that haha
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yea, probably
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> check /rules, it clearly says no impersonation
23:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/880 Do i still need to make changes?
