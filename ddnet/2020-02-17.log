13:12 < Im_corneum> could it be that the entities text size resets with every update?
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what kind of updates?
13:22 <+Im_corneum> client updates
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm shouldnt do other config values reset for you on update?
14:24 <+Im_corneum> at least no other that i noticed. but i swear i have reste the size a lot of times
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> Hi
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> Could anyone tell me why it says unsupported client?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Cubic chef what client are you using?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually this is for client versions which are commonly used bot clients
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> I use ddnet client
14:40 <+Im_corneum> @Cillerdragon can you make me a client that informs me if a certain player is online? 
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Cubic chef then you use one version of ddnet which shares the same client version as a bot client. Just update your client
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there was this stalking website
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i forgot the name
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah lmao it literally was teestalker
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Piepow/TeeStalker
15:37 <+Im_corneum> well im too dumb to install this
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sec ima try to host an instance 4u ‚ù§Ô∏è
15:38 <+Im_corneum> #liebe
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> @n000b I cant find any other client for android
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/TeeStalker/
15:41 <+Im_corneum> thanks man ^^ wil that be up forever?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if it does not make any problems i am not planning to take it down soon
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/678974607939862578/unknown.png
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does not look to good to me tho
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> too
15:44 <+Im_corneum> does it mean it cant look at 10 of 350 servers?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it has `minimun threshold for loaded servers` set to 800
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Cubic chef android isnt maintained anymore. Don't know the details but it doesn't work anymore:pepeH:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.6 only has 400 servers?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bois you should finally update üòÑ
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im finding 378
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> xd
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip 0.6
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> how many does 0.7 have?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well im sure i can configure it somehow
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 240 üòÑ
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/678976107529371648/unknown.png
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gg
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Cubic chef try https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.3.apk
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen is ddnet also hosting teestalker btw?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe i do not have to do that then
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> @deen it gives error while trying to open
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> And I already have 9.3.1
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> Why should I use 9.3
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 9.3.1 is apparently a common bot client, much more common than the android client
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok Im_corneum i added lower thresholds so it might now work
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe also https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.2.apk
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon not that i know
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k because u made an issue there
15:58 <+Im_corneum> so far it stays on loading. is that agood sign?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who developed the anroid client? Is it hard to setup an enviroment to try to port it to sdl2?
15:58 <+Im_corneum> ah ye now it confirms none are online
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/678978662875529234/unknown.png
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> It gave error again
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/678979127872585751/unknown.png
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems to be functional
16:01 <+Im_corneum> how does it notify me
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk the tool but it asked my browser to allow notifcations and now it has a loading thingy there
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk try stalking ur self and connecting to tw
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon i ported it to ddnet
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i got a notification that namless tee joined
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not so hard, see build instructions
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but sdl2 has native android support, not sure how much that differs
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye if its easy i might give it a try. Im iOS user and mobile hater but its kinda sad that the latest android version is banned on all ddnet servers isnt it?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, i asked admins if we can unban it
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats a solution as well
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what idioit even added bans based on versions lmao?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> Wait it worked
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> I entered
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cubic chef> it only works in persian servers
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ChillerDragon If you will make Android client great again, You will become my hero :heartw:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should just build an android one with a version bump
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôd do it if I knew how we did android builds
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i like that idea better
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @ChillerDragon version number bans are unfortunately very effective at getting rid of a majority of the bot client users
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @onby 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > what idioit even added bans based on versions lmao?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> was a joke ^ 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It was me adding the feature and as much as i dislike bans and false postives it seems to work and i kinda understand it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1443
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ohh lmao
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why only up to 1024min
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also this pr was worth it to get this commit message into ddnet
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/679002116903403521/unknown.png

20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> @ChillerDragon im the teestalker author and i should warn u that that the code is hot garbage and there's a chance ur server will explode if more than like 10 clients connect
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr @Oblikumquat
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pls add caching then
