15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why do you insult me
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> your meant to be admin
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so? stop being an edge case and I'll treat you like I treat everyone else
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i havent done anything to insult you
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You waste my time and everyone elses time
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> asking when is test servers coming back?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> He has the right to insult you
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we all have
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i dont agree
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz sp someonei is like tw devil
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> if i called him an asshat i would be kicked
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you did lot of bullshit
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now u get it back
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad yeah you would
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> your all acting immature
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still remember when you filled the wiki with "deen is gay" in every single pager
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wasting my time also
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still remember when you filled the wiki with "deen is gay" in every single page
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ddnet has a wiki?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> had
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dumbass
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't kick anyone for insulting me because I have skin thicker then paper...
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would kick sp for being sp
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you‚Äôre not being a good example if you insult others?! very unprofessional
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @jao talking to me?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> im not an admin or a moderator i have no example to set
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no you‚Äôre no staff :thonkery:
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm perfectly fine with people insulting malicious people so I have no problem with the example I'm setting
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :f3:
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> insulting is always bad
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whether you think the person deserves it or not
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and if you set those standards, people will just make up their own definitions of "malicious people" and can insult anyone
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i am far from being a malicious person
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao imagine someone killed ur fathers
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i do not insult anyone or want to
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure people would be fine with u insulting the killer
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you think people would be fine with the government or judges insulting the killer? no they are expected to act professionally
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc it as a normal thing that people get mad at others, but if you are in the position of an admin or whatever, you can at least try to hold back your emotions..
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc it is a normal thing that people get mad at others, but if you are in the position of an admin or whatever, you can at least try to hold back your emotions..
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We aren't running a government here
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a judge were sick they wouldn't call him out of his bed to rule on something
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I have to get out of my cozy bed because you are creating a disturbance don't expect me to treat you with respect
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> stop arguing politics the rules are #1 Always be respectful - No rude, offensive, racist, or hateful comments. admins should also follow them
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so next time I can just do whatever I want and say this is "no government"
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you don't follow #1 don't expect me to follow #1 when attending to matters regarding you
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> this is stupid logic
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you want others to follow your rules, you should firstly follow them yourself
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i do follow rule #1
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and obviously enforce them
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> if didnt jao would kick me
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not ignore them once someone missbehaves
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao you are arguing that I can call a judge a cunt and he won't curse at me... frankly that isn't the reality, those perfect government officials don't exist except in utopias
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sp didnt start insulting you
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He wasted my time, time after time, He asked for something to be fixed which I happily fixed just to break it
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> being admin = wasting your time?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well.. then you're in the wrong position
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Go take your bike to a bike shop and after they fix it break it in half with an axe, the response you get won't be much different
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes it will ur paying the bike shop
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don't think the bike shop would insult you xD
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you live in a utopia
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They would use words far less pleasant then asshat for wasting their work
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's not waste
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you pay them
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> If they don't have some special connection to the bike, I doubt they care what happens to it
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some people actually do take pride in their work
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's disrespectful
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bottomline don't expect me to be perfect, perfect people don't exist
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I would believe not insulting others is an easy thing to do
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one expects you to be perfect :thonkery:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sorry I keep forgetting that even evil people deserve respect
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad you are an amazing individual, keep doing what you are doing, we all appreciate you wasting our time and I especially enjoy it when I'm sick
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok then let's change rule #1 to "Always be respectful, unless you think someone is evil" üëç
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> thanks
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> will do
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is no thinking required, intentionally breaking something implicitly makes you evil
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides that change isn't necessary as it's common sense but I keep forgetting people don't exercise common sense when arguing against others as it weakens their own position
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there are other things that may make you an evil person
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure, but that one is a given
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and then I can argue that it's my own definition of evil
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you have to accept it
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so I can insult anyone
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Hello i just want to remember you guys should use :troll:
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Learath2 cats intentionally break stuff all the time are they evil?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They don't know any better, and they don't do it intentionally
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you bring animals into the play one could argue that they aren't even conscious thus they have no "intents"
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao there are things that objectively makes you a bad person in most peoples minds
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Go steal from a charity fund and see how many people think you are a good person
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye whatever
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @Learath2 could u please stop flame and behave like a ddnet admin? :O
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> can you turn back on tune_zone on test servers?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you just don't realize that any hate is bad as it people will think you encourage it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you just don't realize that any hate is bad as people will think you encourage it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i was testing exploits to make ddnet code better
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> "Oh responsible guy use insults, where d the problem using insults against others?" :GWchadThonkery:
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> From now on I'm only using a 5-10 word vocab on here, that should please you all
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad no
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I do not think so
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and I find it  hypocritical to do something you don't want others to do
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said I'm completely fine with others insulting objectively malicious people
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> while i was on ddnet test servers i discovered that certain tunes cause the server to stop responding @Dev
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad I'm sure that's what happened
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Already looking to fix it
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thx for the report
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üëç
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> glad i could help improve ddnet
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thank you for your "collaboration"
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd like it if you would refrain from further contributions
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @Learath2 lmfao all the bugs SP fnd help ddnet, if he wouldnt abuse it you would never fix it lol
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we kicked mod(s) for similar behaviour so idc if you personally are okay with it
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti he can report them without causing any disturbance
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> As i said
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> u lazy guys wouldnt care
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> xd
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a not evil person that finds bugs wouldnt exploit them but rather share them secretly with a trusted developer
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i didnt cause any disturbance
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> none was using the servers
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what? Fix it yourself
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm done
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> rq
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk about ddnet but what konsti says is true for my server
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why are we even arguing with sp someone
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ban him
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and done
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> no u
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby u didnt met the real sp somoene
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby u didnt met the real sp someone
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from what i see
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> XD
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> ofc he did
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who did i meet then :o
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> This tool "map_version" - does anyone know what is it for, how to use (the CLI, I mean), what does it do and what does it return ?  It is available in DDNet sources (src/tools/map_version.ccp) and developed by Magnus Auvinen, probably inherited from Teeworlds...
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> noby is just not dumb to deal with SP like a retard
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its the client version that was used to make the map
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just the map version
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i think map version is 04
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @RafaelFF iirc it returned the data version of the map
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I saw its sources, but I'm unable to read it  (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/tools/map_version.cpp)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> http://tml.sushitee.de/mapformat.html
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think ddnet map format is diferent
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or has additions
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We didn't touch the map format iirc
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have the tune zone data in the compressed data region
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/doc
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the map cfg also
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thank you all for ruining my day, now I feel like splitting my laptop in half

16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> rip larejn üò¶
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we also should praise vali
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I wonder why SP is way more clever than all the people with colored names here :GWchadThonkery:
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jesus Christ where is he anyways?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> he plays nostale 24/7
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i saw larejn playing 4 days ago
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> under another name
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti hive mind, SP is merely an idea, it's the combination of a thousand trolls spending their entire time trying to make our lives a little worse
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not fakenews
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> AerToX is his new name
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he speaks kurwalanguage
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jesus Christ what is a nostale?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @Learath2 and because u complain he know it works and he wont stop
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> a game
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> now you are also racist
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti don't feed the trolls and all but that doesn't work either
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao me? every single polish friend i know laughs at that
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Why does it work for noby
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> jao, u makes fun of poland aswell wtf
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and every troll you insult laughs at it too
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g Soreu
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> jao, u make fun of poland aswell wtf
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Jesus Christ never
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didn't u want to stop being moderator @jao ?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ya
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :danAmazing:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the best way i found for dealing with sp is adding a triggerbot detector and letting people esc->players->mute to solve any other problem
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don't want to support a mod team with learath as admin üò¶
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no point banning or getting angry
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath2 does very good at administrating actually
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich doesnt administer at all, he just codes
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :GWfroggertFakeNews:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he is a admin anyway
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is this dumb emoji here
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :danAmazing: :troll:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I told u he doesn't like me, no idea why
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even think I said no to anything he asked üòõ
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what emoji
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh konsti god nitro discord
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pays to troll
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he doesn't tho
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just global emojis
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the fake news emoji
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki could you fix the tune_zone thing?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is the bug?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ you are pretty good with C++ right?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh, i wouldnt say so
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know the things i need
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could you take a look at `gamecore.cpp:L19` is that really just hoping the compiler aligns everything properly or is there something in the standard that guarantees it?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the preprocessor will just replace it
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> an array to some const string pointers, that are generated in compile time
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's not line 19
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> L19 casts `(CTuningParams *)` to a `(CTuneParam *)`
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh read 9 xd
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah strange
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was pretty sure classes in C++ had some runtime stuff at the beginning that wouldn't allow something like this
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gimmi a second im not so well with the server code
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gimmi a second im not so well with the server code(ddnet code)
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> should work indeed
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> because there is no vtable or something created
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since only the ctuneparam class matters it's always 4 bytes
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean like warnings
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that these classes aren't compatible?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah, I didn't think we used such hacks
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only way this wouldn't be a hack is if it were guaranteed by the standard but I doubt it
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think empty classes are made for this
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's ok
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still hacky tho
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it also assumes m_Value will be the first member of CTuneParam and then sets it to a float?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could you take a look when you are around? I don't think I understand how that works at all...
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the operator is overloaded
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats fine
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yeah true
18:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1119: Add reasonable bounds to tune settings (master...dd_pr_tunebound) https://git.io/vpmu6
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 you should ask @Im 'corneum for the tune zone values
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is a map magician
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from what i remember
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vasten maps also used tune zones
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> upndown etc
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just wrote these as filler will need to determine the actual values
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @Ryozuki
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lmfao
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i dont pay for online shit
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> except ddnet ranks :troll:
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Its just discord server with global emotes :O Im in about 30
