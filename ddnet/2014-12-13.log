00:01 <@deen> yeah, from what I can gather it's indeed internap that does the filtering
00:01 <@deen> and it seems pretty interesting how they do it
00:01 <@deen> each type of attack is only reported once, then it never seems to bother us anymore
00:03 <@deen> Savander: what are you planning to use the server for?
00:03 < Savander> now
00:03 < Savander> for teesting
00:04 < Savander> later
00:04 < Savander> for teeworlds.com.pl
00:04 < Savander> tournaments, etc
00:04 < Savander> and few vanilla seervers
00:07 < Savander>  but i thing it's too bad
00:07 < Savander> for smth like that...
00:07 < Savander> ;/
00:08 < nuborn> hi, have you thought about adding prediction for hook strength?
00:09 <@deen> nuborn: hook strength?
00:09 <@deen> ah
00:09 <@deen> strong or weak
00:09 < nuborn> yes
00:10 <@deen> hm, it depends on the order of kills
00:10 < nuborn> the order of respawns I think
00:10 <@deen> the client is notified of kills
00:10 <@deen> oh, that's even worse then
00:10 <@deen> yeah, respawns
00:10 <@deen> So how would you get that information to the client?
00:10 < nuborn> actually, I was going to suggest creating new netobjs with info about this, and sending it
00:11 <@deen> Well, there is no more space for new netobjs :P
00:11 < nuborn> relly? I tested it!
00:11 <@deen> Someone needs to make a hack to allow more
00:11 <@deen> maybe it wasn't netobjs, but netmsgs
00:11 <@deen> (or whatever they're called)
00:11 <@deen> so when do you want to send it and what exactly?
00:12 < nuborn> oh, I meant netobjs. I tried creating a new one, and it worked.
00:12 <@deen> (still need someone to allow us more netmsgs, for stuff like server_capabilities)
00:12 < nuborn> the same time the character info is sent, since the info belongs to the character
00:12 <@deen> Yeah, netmessages are all filled up
00:13 <@deen> character info? what's the name of that netobject exactly?
00:15 < nuborn> CNetObj_CharacterCore
00:15 < nuborn> is the normal one
00:15 <@deen> That's sent a lot, isn't it?
00:15 <@deen> You really want to send another one, just as often?
00:15 < nuborn> the server only sends delta snapshots, I believe
00:16 < nuborn> then there is CNetObj_ClientInfo
00:18 < nuborn> I think it depends on how often they are updated
00:19 <@deen> Not sure how SnapshotDeltas work
00:19 <@deen> So you really want a netobject just for this 1 bit?
00:19 <@deen> Can't you add it to the CharacterCore?
00:20 <@deen> (and send a compatibility version to older clients)
00:20 < nuborn> yes, that is possible
00:20 <@deen> I think that would be cleaner, since that's where it belongs
00:21 < nuborn> in a way, yes
00:21 < nuborn> so, that would work then?
00:22 <@deen> You would need to add an Int between 0 and MAX_CLIENTS-1
00:22 <@deen> NetIntAny("m_HookStrength", 0, 'MAX_CLIENTS-1'),
00:22 <@deen> right?
00:23 < nuborn> yes, if creating a new netobj?
00:23 <@deen> also if we want it in the CharacterCore
00:24 < Learath2> deen will finish up and push autoupdate tomorrow
00:24 <@deen> Learath2: awesome!
00:24 < Learath2> was busy during the week 3many exams
00:26 < nuborn> deen: in network.py I think you can only add whole 32 bit ints at a time. so one of these would have to be reused. for example: NetIntRange("m_Direction", -1, 1),
00:26 <@deen> huh?
00:26 <@deen> Why can't you just add from 0 to 63?
00:27 < nuborn> adding a new value?
00:27 <@deen> yes
00:27 < nuborn> because expanding the netobj would make in incompatible with other servers, I think
00:28 < nuborn> it*
00:28 <@deen> adapt the parsing of it?
00:28 <@deen> I think I did that somewhere
00:29 < nuborn> oh! Im not sure how that would work
00:29 <@deen> I did it for Sv_TeamsState
00:29 <@deen> the netmessage
00:29 <@deen> so it works with 16 player and 64 player servers
00:29 < nuborn> ok
00:29 <@deen> but I just removed everything in datasrc.py^^
00:30 <@deen> gameclient.cpp:751
00:31 <@deen> but hm, it's so much hacking to get it for this 1 value
00:32 <@deen> Also, I'd prefer to get rid of strong/weak^^
00:33 <@deen> but players didn't like that
00:33 <@deen> And, ehm, we sometimes have something between strong and weak...: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/2
00:33 < nuborn> yes, I think that was a suggestion for 0.7 too
00:33 <@deen> there was code for it by BeaR
00:34 <@deen> I tried to adapt it to DDNet and we actually had the servers running with it for a day
00:34 < nuborn> yes, I saw it at github
00:34 <@deen> but people wanted to murder me
00:34 < nuborn> hehe
00:35 < laxa> can't remove strong/weak
00:35 < laxa> hum
00:35 < laxa> maybe you can
00:35 < laxa> if HF is still working
00:35 < nuborn> about that issue, I think I once saw something like it, but Im not sure if it was the prediction that was off
00:36 < nuborn> deen: how about a netobj that gets sent at respawn?
00:36 <@deen> nuborn: even for players you don't see?
00:36 < nuborn> yes, since then you could just remember that value
00:36 <@deen> that sounds like it would create a lot of traffic on maps with hard noobfilters
00:37 <@deen> btw, i think a new teamstate is also sent when someone kills and that may create a lot of traffic
00:37 <@deen> hm, most people don't even use prediction =/
00:37 <@deen> i mean, antiping
00:38 < nuborn> hmm, I guess not
00:39 < nuborn> so maybe it would be a lot of work for not much
00:40 <@deen> hm, actually that always annoyed me when playing with antiping
00:40 <@deen> I'm just worried that people would have more network problems when we increase the traffic
00:42 <@deen> please try to implement it though
00:46 < nuborn> but Im not sure what would be the best way to implement it. in theory this info could be sent very rarely, but Im not sure where would be the right place to place it. unless the parsing way is used
00:47 <@deen> Hm =/
00:47 <@deen> no idea
00:55 < Savander> good night
01:54 <@deen> That would be really great timing if GER works without lags now, with EUR and GER2 going down in a few days
02:44 <@deen> when we get Learath2's autoupdater, we'll have libcurl in the client. Then we could add a simple HTTP map downloader for DDNet maps. (I don't want to pay for more traffic in Chile)
02:44 <@deen> My idea would be to start the regular map download process and at the same time ping http://maps.ddnet.tw for the map + checksum and try downloading that in parallel
02:46 <@deen> and stop the ingame one if the HTTP one gets fast enough
03:00 < eeeee> if Learath2 manages to support a timeout we could just try http first and then fall back to ingame if that fails instead of doing that in parallel
03:00 < eeeee> i imagine you would want to minimize the gameserver traffic to reduce the costs and lags
03:06 < eeeee> we can also separate out the mapres and async load them, would load any map almost instantly :>
03:20 <@deen> and then we could add BPG support and send BPG mapres instead of PNG
04:10 <@deen> EastByte: I've stopped the EUR servers since they're empty. Don't know at what time exactly EUR will stop, don't want anyone to get a surprise disconnect
05:25 < eeeee> i wonder what's the BPG reference decoder performance is vs. libpng decoder
05:26 < eeeee> maybe i could use it in js demo as well
05:27 < eeeee> but it has better be lossless at least in alpha channel. artifacts in alpha channel would likely be super annoying
08:51 <@EastByte> deen: okay
22:46 <@deen> Yay, no lags on GER!
23:01 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
23:03 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
23:15 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
23:16 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
