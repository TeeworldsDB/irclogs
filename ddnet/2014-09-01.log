00:00 <@deen> 100% different
00:00 < _KinG_> laxa:  u can make teamspeak more beautifull by making cspacers for topics like [cspacer] Tee Worlds and inside it make subchannels
00:00 < Savander> laxa, i want join! xD
00:00 <@deen> _KinG_: are you sure it's "team speake" and not "teamspeak"?
00:01 < laxa> _KinG: I don't care :p
00:01 < Savander> im angry :(
00:01 < laxa> deen: so, it's not possible to have my records from my old server imported to ddnet oO ?
00:01 < _KinG_> teamspeak is right but with the sentence "e"means something else persian is too wierd :S
00:01 <@deen> laxa: nope!
00:01 < laxa> Wtffff !
00:01 <@deen> laxa: i had a script to convert them
00:01 <@deen> i guess i threw it away^^
00:02 < laxa> roflmao
00:02 <@deen> after converting ddnet
00:02 <@deen> ok
00:02 <@deen> _KinG_: every 4 minutes then
00:02 < _KinG_> okay
00:02 < laxa> I don't need anyway, it's for my test server only
00:02 <@deen> laxa: noone uses mysql anyway
00:02 <@deen> ddnet-mysql
00:02 <@deen> so i didn't bother with conversions
00:02 < laxa> ddnet doesn't use mysql ?
00:03 <@deen> noone except official servers
00:03 < _KinG_> deen:  what should we to for people to downlaod ddnet client and make them to play in ddnet servers instead of normal useless ones?
00:03 <@deen> _KinG_: i don't know
00:04 < _KinG_> any ideas from anyone? ^^
00:04 < laxa> deen: there is mysql release of ddnet ?
00:04 <@deen> ?
00:05 < __KinG> how can i ping a linux vps on windows? xD
00:05 < Savander> ping ?
00:05 < Savander> it's doesn't matter
00:05 < Savander> ?
00:06 < KinG1_> i hate this
00:07 < Savander> what?:D
00:07 < KinG1_> i do it ping <IP> -t for windows it ping port 8303 (remote desktop port)
00:07 < KinG1_> what should i do for pinging linux?
00:07 < laxa> deen: I don't get why no one use mysql or why it is useless. What kind of SQL server ddnet uses then ?
00:07 <@deen> mysql
00:08 < laxa> ping -t IP
00:08 < laxa> works on every host
00:08 < laxa> try that : ping -t ddracepro.net
00:08 < Savander> it's really doesn't matter
00:08 < Savander> if its linux or windows
00:08 < Savander> it's Ip, :P
00:08 < KinG1_> then why i can't ping :|
00:09 < KinG1_> okay it pings seriously i did it and no pings were recieved :|
00:09 < laxa> some servers don't respond to ping
00:09 < Savander> what the hell??
00:09 < KinG1_> i mean it pings ,
00:09 < Savander> Bandwidth Usage:  15857MB / 2097152MB (1%)
00:09 < Savander> impossible
00:09 < Savander> when!?xD
00:09 < laxa> deen: since you use linux from a long time, I have a question, why sometimes after upgrade, server say : restart needed, does it matter really ?
00:09 < KinG1_> what is this usage for?
00:10 <@deen> laxa: sounds like a ubuntu message
00:10 <@deen> i've never used ubuntu
00:10 < laxa> Yes it is.
00:10 < Savander> hahahha
00:10 < Savander> xD
00:10 < KinG1_> Savander:  your vps? ^^
00:10 < Savander> ye
00:10 < Savander> it's impossible
00:10 < KinG1_> linux?
00:10 < Savander> yes
00:10 < Savander> 16gb bandwidth usage?
00:10 < Savander> when....
00:11 < KinG1_> 10gbit or 1gbit?
00:11 < Savander> 1gbit
00:11 < KinG1_> nearly impossiable but i've seen something like this on redstation vpses
00:11 < Savander> but it was ddos
00:11 < Savander> it's possible i guess
00:11 < Savander> xD
00:11 < Savander> if it was ddos*
00:12 < KinG1_> u ddosed or they ddosed?
00:12 < Savander> idk, maybe someone ddos me
00:12 < Savander> servers still no works
00:12 < Savander> so..
00:12 <@deen> KinG1_: your question...
00:12 < KinG1_> i meant that if you ddosed someone or some one ddosed you :D
00:12 <@deen> btw, we had over 400 players on ddnet today!
00:12 < Savander> deen: 
00:13 < Savander> its because
00:13 < Savander> ddforce are dead
00:13 < Savander> yes.
00:13 < Savander> xD
00:13 < KinG1_> Savander:  why the hell u run ddforce?
00:13 < Savander> why NOT!?
00:13 < Savander> xD
00:13 < KinG1_> don't know
00:13 < Savander> so
00:13 < Savander> its your answer
00:13 < KinG1_> tquestion is why :|
00:13 < Savander> idk to.
00:13 < Savander> too
00:13 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/403.png
00:14 < laxa> deen: I didn't clearly understood, ddnet uses mysql or other db ?
00:14 < Savander> how you did
00:14 < Savander> ??
00:14 < Savander> this screenshot
00:14 <@deen> laxa: mariadb, but that' basically mysql
00:14 <@deen> Savander: awesome screenshot for firefox
00:14 < Savander> wut?
00:14 <@deen> we had 403 players before, but that was during tournament
00:14 < KinG1_> deen: what was the password for solo kobra?
00:14 <@deen> KinG1_: no password
00:15 < KinG1_> i tried to join but there was a password
00:15 < Savander> maybe its
00:15 < Savander> test server?
00:15 <@deen> KinG1_: it was a buggy version, i waited until everyone finished, and reloaded
00:15 < KinG1_> oh
00:15 < KinG1_> so it's a solo map huh?
00:15 <@deen> yes
00:16 < KinG1_> and deen  block server is down ^^
00:16 <@deen> no
00:16 <@deen> i see it
00:16 < Savander> me too
00:18 < KinG1_> i see it too but 3 hours ago it wasn't there
00:18 < KinG1_> i refreshed 10 times!
00:19 < Savander> 3 hours ago
00:19 < Savander> xD
00:20 < Savander> have to go
00:20 < Savander> bye :)
00:20 < Savander> tomorrow school
00:20 < Savander> hehe
00:20 <@deen> bye
00:20 < Savander> ;-;
00:43 < laxa> deen: any news about steam ?
00:44 <@deen> I'm not working on steam
00:46 < laxa> beh...
00:46 < laxa> deen: where is the repo of hookrace ?
00:46 <@deen> there is none
00:46 <@deen> and i'm busy with other stuff again
00:46 < laxa> Boah.
00:47 < laxa> Well, GL & HF man !
00:47 < laxa> I am going to bed, see you tomorrow.
00:47 <@deen> good night
01:38 < KinG1_> deen:  are u there?
01:39 < KinG1_> deen: ?
01:39 < KinG1_> deen:  pl me when u are back
01:39 < KinG1_> pm*
01:44 <@deen> hi
01:44 <@deen> KinG1_: ???
01:45 < KinG1_> deen:  can u run a xxlddr server with new persian block server name?
01:46 < KinG1_> i know it sounds silly but if it's possible i can sell it with a good price to some one
01:48 < KinG1_> deen: can u?
01:52 < KinG1_> deen: ?
01:54 <@deen> sorry, back
01:55 < KinG1_> np
01:55 <@deen> do you have a config for the server?
01:55 < KinG1_> i don't know how to run a server on linux so can u? :)
01:55 < KinG1_> yes
01:55 < KinG1_> but not the maps
01:57 <@deen> it's a bit weird to run a server for someone else, which has nothing to do with ddnet
01:57 < KinG1_> deen actually i got the version for windows can i give u the autoexec.cfg ?
01:57 <@deen> but i guess you need to money, so it's ok
01:57 < KinG1_> i know
01:57 <@deen> yes, i need the config and you can search for the maps too
01:58 < KinG1_> okay let me search for them
01:58 < KinG1_> the lvote lines are just like windows?
01:58 <@deen> config should work
01:58 <@deen> independent of OS
01:59 < KinG1_> ok i'm gonan downlaod server for linux and add votes+config and give it to you just i need some time internet is killing me ^^
01:59 < KinG1_> gonna*
02:00 <@deen> no need to download server for linux
02:00 <@deen> i prefer to compile it directly
02:00 < KinG1_> but the kid wants to have access for xxl super invis and commands liek this ^^
02:00 <@deen> yes
02:00 <@deen> i compile xxlddrace
02:01 < KinG1_> oh ok
02:02 < KinG1_> add_vote "test" Change_map "test" the vote lines shoul be like this?
02:02 <@deen> change_map, but yes
02:03 < KinG1_> should* omggg what's wrong with me
02:03 < KinG1_> ok

02:46 < KinG1_> bb
08:30 < Savander> vor 5 Std. - IP Subnets on kvm16 getting a DDoS. All VMs on kvm16 are null routed until the DDoS is over.
08:31 < Savander> nice
09:20 < laxa_work> Hello everyone !
10:15 < SavanderVPS> hi
10:56 < EastByte> good morning
11:04 < Savander> good morning
11:04 < Savander> again..
11:04 < Savander> what's going on
11:04 < Savander>  Update 1 (01.09.2014 - 10:30):  Attacks is already active, as long as the attack is active the access cannot be recovered.  
11:04 < Savander> Meh
11:04 < Savander> :X
11:20 < laxa_work> Savander: xD.
11:20 < laxa_work> EastByte: good morning.
11:21 < Savander> im sad :(
11:22 < EastByte> what attacks?
11:28 < laxa_work> Someone feels like ddforce has too many players !
11:28 < laxa_work> we spotted you deen !
11:39 < Savander> no
11:39 < Savander> KVM instace
11:39 < Savander> instance
15:12 < laxa_work> Who is this ochristi ? Never talks !
15:12 < ochristi> "blah blah", fine?
15:12 < ochristi> ;)
15:14 < laxa_work> Yeah !
15:14 < laxa_work> But who are you ? A teeworlds player ? A dev ? The brother of deen ?
15:15 < EastByte> a ddoser? ;)
15:15 < laxa_work> his wife ?
15:23 < Savander> It's my father
15:23 < Savander> :(
15:26 < laxa_work> Savander: lol seriously ?
15:26 < Savander> yes
15:26 < EastByte> hello Savander's father :D
15:27 < Savander> He checks, what i doing
15:27 < Savander> :c
15:36 < laxa_work> Lol nice, how old is he xD ?
15:40 < Savander> 19
15:44 <@deen> ochristi is an old ddmax guy
15:44 < ochristi> am I?
15:44 <@deen> when Tsin said ddnet client includes a virus he recompiled it himself to check if he also gets the same virus messages
15:44 <@deen> not?
15:44 <@deen> maybe i misremember
15:45 < ochristi> true
15:45 < Savander> deen: 
15:45 < Savander> about floating stars
15:46 < Savander> look at github
15:46 <@deen> ok
15:46 <@deen> so?
15:47 < Savander> This may be related to the Map Editor
15:47 <@deen> no
15:47 <@deen> it also happens on map reloads
15:54 < laxa_work> deen: need tools to make TAS for teeworlds !
15:55 <@deen> cheater
15:55 <@deen> then you can beat every map perfectly
15:55 <@deen> just run a local server with 10% speed, with a modified client
15:55 <@deen> and record the user inputs and replay on real server
15:57 < laxa_work> TAS is for video, not cheating, but that could be fun.
15:58 < laxa_work> How come you know TAS if you never played any other game than tw btw ?
15:59 < EastByte> TAS how das that work?
15:59 < EastByte> it that like recording input and simulating on a real server?
16:02 < laxa_work> TAS = Tool Assisted Speedrun
16:02 < laxa_work> I don't know how it works. But the aim is to make near perfect runs
16:03 < EastByte> I once tried to record all the input clientside and replay
16:03 < EastByte> didn't work out at all since it can only work if the ping doesn't change
16:14 <@deen> in modern TAS you can edit every frame
16:14 <@deen> change inputs, go back to last frame
16:14 <@deen> and they do 100% perfect runs like that
16:14 < EastByte> well, that sounds effective
16:14 <@deen> laxa_work: i played other games, but it's long ago
16:15 <@deen> and usually TAS works with emulators
16:16 <@deen> http://youtu.be/OSTFfAki2JI
16:17 < EastByte> well on network games it's a lot of harder
16:19 <@deen> yes,but in teeworlds you can send the time you want an action to be executed
16:19 <@deen> at least for most, but not all
16:19 <@deen> so weapons wouldn't work
16:19 < EastByte> hm forgot that
16:21 < EastByte> deen: I've ported the tw datafile format to nim
16:21 < EastByte> and I just finished a small mapres exporting tool <3
16:21 <@deen> nice!
16:21 < EastByte> it even compiles on windows
16:21 <@deen> nice!
16:22 <@deen> also they're currently breaking nim(rod) everywhere
16:22 < EastByte> I'm trying to follow their discussions
16:23 <@deen> I'm not looking forward to rename my hundreds of nimrod examples in rosettacode
16:23 < EastByte> :/
16:24 <@deen> I'll probably write a nim script to do that^^
16:25 < EastByte> I have not enough code to complain about that ^^
16:43 < laxa_work> deen: I think saavik is mad at you.
16:48 <@deen> I see
17:16 < laxa_work> Bye from work everyone <3 !
17:17 < Savander> bye
17:31 < Matodorec> Bug: when download map use "dummy_connect" = client crash
17:33 <@deen> oh
17:34 <@deen> i see, thanks Matodorec 
17:36 <@deen> ok, fixed in next release
17:48 < Matodorec> np
18:21 < laxa> deen: bot is dead ?
18:23 < laxa> Well, no release announced by the bot, so it's dead :p
18:56 <@deen> laxa: it didn't work, i changed some settings
18:56 < laxa> Hum ok
18:56 < laxa> On the way back, I had an idea deen
18:57 < laxa> but it's not that fixed in my head
18:57 < laxa> you could make a "hall of fame" on the website
18:57 < laxa> publish video of #1 rank of maps, after they have been released for 1 month or something
18:58 < laxa> I am sure artkis or someone else could make the videos
18:58 < laxa> that could bring more competition on the maps
19:00 < laxa> deen: please don't tell me it's a bad idea xD.
19:03 <@deen> noone sends me any videos
19:03 <@deen> so nothing to put on ddnet.tw
19:04 <@deen> well, except the one Aoe sent me, but the sing some vulgar stuff there all the time
19:05 < laxa> you don't understand what I mean I think.
19:05 < laxa> You create a Hall of Fame on the website
19:05 < laxa> And you say this : After 1 month (1 week or whatever time)
19:05 <@deen> Can't just someone make a DDNet youtube channel?
19:05 < laxa> we take rank #1 and make a video
19:05 <@deen> and upload videos there?
19:06 < laxa> but players needs to send us the demo ofc
19:06 < laxa> better make something official
19:06 < laxa> and at the same time have a ddnet channel
19:06 <@deen> well, then start collecting demos and do that
19:07 <@deen> i agree, that would be cool
19:07 <@deen> But i'm busy in the next weeks, so I'll probably not do much
19:09 < laxa> just needs a hall of fame with sections like ranking
19:09 < laxa> and embed youtube video
19:10 < laxa> and need to make official
19:10 < laxa> so we have first videos in X time
19:10 < laxa> X being the time we decide to take #1
19:54 <@deen> demo recording with both settings on already works..
20:00 < _KinG> hi all hi deen 
20:00 <@deen> hi
20:53 < laxa> deen: not always.
21:49 < laxa> deen: question !
21:49 < laxa> On settings -> DDNet -> ghost / show ghost / save ghost
21:49 < laxa> What is ghost for oO ?
21:50 <@deen> you see him while speedrunning
21:50 <@deen> so you can compare how well you're doing
21:50 <@deen> or if you forgot how to do a part^^
21:50 < laxa> isn't it the same as show ghost ?
21:50 <@deen> ghost is both
21:50 < laxa> Well then it's useless to have "ghost" ?
21:51 < laxa> Or I am missing something
21:51 <@deen> I don't know, I'll just check the source code
21:53 <@deen> seems like Ghost is more permanent
21:53 <@deen> and Show ghost more temporary
21:54 <@deen> you can toggle show ghost during a race and your ghost reappears
21:54 <@deen> but ghost probably not
21:54 <@deen> I thought you're a programmer, read the code yourself, laxa
21:55 < laxa> It would be easy if there was a VS project file included
21:55 < laxa> But browsing through without knowing any structure of data and where to look is quite hard.
21:56 <@deen> I don't know any structure either
21:56 <@deen> I just did grep -r "Show ghost" src and went from there
21:56 < laxa> hum
21:56 < laxa> I have windows
21:56 < laxa> no grep
21:57 < laxa> sorry bro :D
21:57 < laxa> FML, I could do it on my dedi :p
21:58 <@deen> ovh's ddos protection seems bad
21:58 <@deen> i've read a lot of complaints about it not working at all =/
21:58 < EastByte> you can't prevent ddos :D
21:59 <@deen> protection, not prevention
21:59 <@deen> EastByte: so, nothing we can do to get tournametns back?
21:59 < EastByte> well a ddos protection is there to prevent denial of service?
22:00 <@deen> "ddos attack protection"
22:00 < EastByte> ah okay
22:00 <@deen> it protects from the attack, thereby preventing the dos :P
22:00 <@deen> well, there are some ddos protections that look serious, but they cost ~ 4000 € / month
22:01 < EastByte> I guess there really is no way to bring back tournaments
22:01 < EastByte> atleast not for teeworlds
22:02 <@deen> but how do other cheap server hosters do it?
22:02 <@deen> i really don't get it, i can't find cheap servers with ddos protection in germany
22:02 < EastByte> and I still think that ddos protection is just a useless label
22:03 <@deen> why?
22:04 < EastByte> we were talking about ddosa some time ago and I still believe the cost for analysing and dropping an attack is simply too big
22:05 < EastByte> protecting webpages might be easy though
22:05 < EastByte> since the delay doesn't matter
22:09 < shorefire> deen: You there?
22:10 <@deen> sometimes
22:10 < shorefire> lol
22:10 < shorefire> I need test server pw
22:12 <@deen> pm
22:12 < shorefire> thanks
22:12 < laxa> http://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/ddos-arbor#pricing
22:12 < laxa> 70 euros / month
22:12 <@deen> laxa: too high ping
22:12 < laxa> they garanty no ddos
22:12 <@deen> religious websites get ddos?!
22:13 < laxa> Just saying, you say 4000/month
22:13 < EastByte> sure
22:13 < laxa> I say 70/month
22:13 <@deen> in germany
22:13 <@deen> in france i found plenty cheap ddos protection
22:14 < laxa> I thought your hoster said he'll give you ddos protection ?
22:14 <@deen> yes
22:14 <@deen> he bought an anti-ddos appliance
22:14 <@deen> and is testing it
22:14 <@deen> and he said we can use it once the tests are done
22:15 <@deen> but that was over 2 weeks ago
22:16 <@deen> ahaha, another comment about ovh's ddos protection: "they had a lot of false positives and users were mass disconnected from my servers"
22:17 < laxa> sounds funny xD.
22:18 < EastByte> hm I would love to troll the attackers
22:19 <@deen> EastByte: how so?
22:19 <@deen> EastByte: they're pretty easy to discover I think
22:19 <@deen> the ~ Entity ~ clan and xploited clan are most of the ddosers
22:20 <@deen> oh, and Avo bought a VPS @ OVH in Strasbourg and it had terrible lags sometimes
22:20 < EastByte> hmm
22:21 < EastByte> it's a vps *cough* :D
22:21 <@deen> as is the current GER server
22:21 < laxa> wtf really ?
22:22 <@deen> but i have the feeling we are the only vps on this server^^
22:22 < EastByte> ^
22:22 <@deen> we had 1 core initially
22:22 <@deen> and i said it lags a bit and he gave me 6 cores
22:22 < EastByte> if you are using the only vps, sure there is stability xd
22:22 <@deen> and you can't buy any vps anymore
22:23 <@deen> and my vps id is 5 :P
22:23 < EastByte> xd
22:23 < EastByte> deen: have you thought about nonpublic tournaments?
22:23 <@deen> EastByte: how?
22:23 < EastByte> like people have to apply and on start they are getting the server ip
22:24 <@deen> i guarantee you someone will give the ip to a ddoser
22:24 < EastByte> yes maybe
22:24 < EastByte> but it's a start
22:24 <@deen> and i loved to have these full servers =/
22:24 <@deen> and not some secret stuff in some corner with 16 people who registered
22:24 <@deen> EastByte: better tell me how to troll them
22:25 < EastByte> I'm only thinking about server distributen^^
22:25 < laxa> AZODIJAZOIDJAZUIODJAZIUD
22:25 < EastByte> but that's not possible without ddnet client
22:25 < laxa> Finally finished all 3 stars map !!! <3
22:25 <@deen> congratulations laxa
22:26 < EastByte> a good thing is, that every ddnet client user has a unique id (timeout protection)
22:26 < laxa> Ha so happy, ty deen <3
22:26 < EastByte> so games might interrupt and forward on another server
22:26 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, but after a ddos the server is dead for 2 hours
22:27 < EastByte> yes multiple servers are needed
22:27 <@deen> they would ddos them all
22:27 < EastByte> not that fast
22:27 <@deen> sure that fast
22:27 <@deen> they followed the livestream during 1 tournament
22:27 < EastByte> depends how they do it
22:28 <@deen> took them about 5 minutes until they ddosed the server that got streamed currently
22:28 < EastByte> hm
22:28 <@deen> people indeed saved
22:28 <@deen> and changed server
22:28 <@deen> but it's stupid =/
22:29 < laxa> deen: I am really trying hard to find an idea, but the only one I have doesn't interest you :x.
22:33 < laxa> deen: can I ask you something ?
22:33 <@deen> ?
22:33 < laxa> I am noob at zone DNS config, I am curious how about you make those *.ddnet.tw
22:33 < laxa> Can you show me your config page ?
22:35 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/dns.png
22:40 < laxa> what is TXT ?
22:40 <@deen> some weird mail stuff
22:41 < laxa> Ah !
22:41 < laxa> http://ts.ddnet.tw works
22:42 < laxa> www.ts.ddnet.net doesn't !
22:43 < laxa> deen: I may have a strong server available at online in Paris for tournaments, to try out their ddos protection, wanna try ? xD
22:43 <@deen> ping?
22:43 < laxa> same as me I guess
22:43 < laxa> It's not mine and he is down atm.
22:43 < laxa> But it's the server of a really good friend
22:44 < laxa> But this fuck tard doesn't answer.
22:44 < laxa> http://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-classic
22:44 < laxa> it should be this server, though I am not sure.
22:45 <@deen> i could just buy that
22:45 <@deen> but ping is too high
22:45 < laxa> He pays 30 euros/month to host project and use github, I am wondering why...
22:45 < laxa> deen: just for tournament, to try out protection
22:45 < laxa> so you don't need to pay anything
22:46 < laxa> and if it's for tournament only, you don't need 2 days to set-up everything.
22:46 < laxa> I say, it's worth a try.
22:48 < EastByte> deen: can't you just ask the providers whether they allow to drop ntp/dns stuff to your server on an early node?
22:49 <@deen> EastByte: that was my initial suggestion to the provider
22:49 <@deen> but it's not just ntp/dns attacks anymore anyway
22:49 < EastByte> but maybe other attacks aren't that cheap
22:50 <@deen> yeah
22:50 <@deen> but the provider said he can't
22:50 <@deen> and i guess that's understandable because for that the node would have to look into the packets
22:50 <@deen> to find out the port
22:50 < shorefire> deen: Maps all done and tested, gB Ante is just posting on the forum ^^
22:52 < EastByte> deen: src/dst ports are only 8 bytes further from layer 3 into 4 :D
22:53 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, but i don't think it's that easy to do
22:53 < EastByte> a hardware firewall would do that
22:53 <@deen> yes
22:53 <@deen> but hardware firewalls can't handle that much traffic
22:54 < EastByte> they have to
22:55 <@deen> huh?
22:56 <@deen> The firewalls datafabrik has have 1.5 gbit/s max: https://datafabrik.de/diefabrik/managed-firewall
22:56 < EastByte> oh okay
22:56 <@deen> so the server right now can withstand more ddos than the firewall could^^
22:56 < EastByte> but a ddos protection can't work without such fast firewalls
22:56 < EastByte> xd
22:57 <@deen> there are anti-ddos-appliances with 1 tbit/s
23:00 < laxa> deen: so, what about my idea ?
23:01 <@deen> laxa: i don't know =/
23:01 <@deen> maybe
23:02 < laxa> it's worth a try man !
23:02 < laxa> Want some Jenniffer lawrence nude pics ?
23:03 < laxa> Don't know if you know, but a hacker hacked the apple cloud and revealed some private pictures xD
23:03 < EastByte> it's more then that :P
23:03 < EastByte> than*
23:04 < laxa> 3M5 views on this : http://imgur.com/gallery/KWOV2
23:10 < laxa> deen: I'll try to contact my friend asap, and then I'll ask him for access.
23:10 < laxa> Don't think he is going to give me root access though.
23:11 <@deen> laxa: I'd rather buy my own server i guess
23:12 < laxa> Pay 30 euros/month for tournaments only oO ?
23:12 <@deen> i really don't want to run tournament on some stranger's server
23:12 < shorefire> deen: any chance of my map releasing tonight?
23:13 < laxa> Too much releases recently. There are already maps ready for release.
23:13 < laxa> At least ShotFF !
23:13 < shorefire> So?
23:13 <@deen> so testers are protesting and stop testing =/
23:13 < shorefire> It's not like too many maps is a problem
23:14 < laxa> Well it is.
23:14 < shorefire> How?
23:14 < laxa> Cause some players want competition on maps.
23:14 < shorefire> So?
23:14 < laxa> If you release too much maps, there is less competition.
23:14 <@deen> and we will have times without map releases for a few days, which is also boring
23:14 < shorefire> That's a bit of a dumb thing to say
23:15 < shorefire> (laxa)
23:15 <@deen> we released 7 maps in the last 48 hours
23:15 < shorefire> Not a problem
23:15 < shorefire> Everyone has different tastes
23:15 < laxa> shorefire: Anyway, it is far from being my decision.
23:16 < laxa> Well, I would release ShotFF right now at least :p
23:16 <@deen> shorefire: see how testers react when i release too many maps: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?p=2986#p2986
23:16 < shorefire> That's lady saavik
23:16 < shorefire> she complains about everything
23:16 < laxa> lady saavik's reaction deen, I don't think it's same for all testers.
23:16 <@deen> ^^
23:16 < shorefire> I tested with her like an hour ago
23:16 < shorefire> She said it was all fine
23:16 < shorefire> then me and Ante did a test
23:17 < laxa> Release ShotFF !
23:17 <@deen> i have other stuff to do, guys
23:17 < laxa> Would be funny to see all mappers come here and ask for release !
23:17 <@deen> release tomorrow if noone finds any bugs
23:17 < shorefire> Alright
23:17 < shorefire> and for other servers, are the maps compatable with the other ddrace?
23:17 < shorefire> (the greyfox version?)
23:17 < laxa> Well
23:18 <@deen> shorefire: depends on the tiles you used
23:18 < laxa> If you didn't use any special entitie
23:18 < laxa> that ddnet made
23:18 < laxa> it is compatible
23:18 <@deen> if you only use ddrace tiles then it works
23:18 < shorefire> Just freeze, start, all the basics
23:18 <@deen> sure, works
23:18 < shorefire> ok
23:18 <@deen> saavik even maps vanilla maps with ddnet editor
23:18 <@deen> dm1_saavik is pretty nice
23:19 < laxa> deen: my friend is back, should I ask him ?
23:19 <@deen> laxa: nah
23:19 <@deen> i don't even have a map for tournaments
23:19 <@deen> and i don't think anyone would want their map to play guinea pig
23:20 < EastByte> wow dm1_saavik is weird
23:21 < laxa> Well anyway, you could try on my server, I think it would be able to host 128 players.
23:21 < laxa> deen: congrats, now you have shorefire who is mad at you xD.
23:32 <@deen> he's always mad that we don't have moderators
23:32 <@deen> i think someone should tell him that we have mods by now
23:32 < laxa> xD
23:57 < Savander> good night
23:57 < Savander> :)
23:57 <@deen> good night Savander
