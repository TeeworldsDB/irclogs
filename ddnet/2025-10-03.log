00:30 < bridge_> <Teero> hello
00:37 < bridge_> <blazulite> bye
00:48 < bridge_> <thrava> finally
00:48 < bridge_> <thrava> I succeeded
00:49 < bridge_> <thrava> {T} Entropy \> Buffer[V] $ .\DDrace\Novice
00:49 < bridge_> <thrava> Address: ddnet://103.236.55.197:8305
00:49 < bridge_> <thrava> My IGN: Weightlessness
00:51 < bridge_> <thrava> But I can't register the server, I guess is the GFW stuff
02:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> did death tiles always look like this when zoomed out
02:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423460567758409841/image.png?ex=68e06475&is=68df12f5&hm=c02edca5eaf991e5d0716ef9d0d4c7dd4c11459b70ce2a545f3ee1fd3d46962f&
02:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and lag so much
02:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> in a weird compressed pattern? yes.
02:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> how? Doesn't the player script checks what blocks did it hit in a server tick?
02:59 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> The death tiles shouldn't have any kind of functionality which would tank the performance, unless the kill tiles themselves are being checked one by one, every server tick
03:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> idk where kill tile methods are found, so I cannot confirm this xd
03:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> [cat_uwu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1230626195649990696.webp?size=48&name=cat_uwu)
03:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> integrated graphics dislike shaders
03:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> old integrated graphics dislike shaders
03:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> shaders are expensive on old integrated graphics, i just dont remember it both lagging as much and looking like that specifically
03:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> hmm, so it's a shader problem
03:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> > shaders are expensive on old integrated graphics
03:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> you mean igpus are slow
03:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> <programs> are expensive on old <program runners>
03:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> mmmmno
03:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> xd
03:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yes and no
03:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i get 120fps easily without the shader part in view
03:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's all shaders
03:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> really?
03:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> shader is gpu program
03:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I think all entities use a shader instance for rendering
03:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> non trivial shaders*
03:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> instead of a compacted, SIMD version of it
03:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think it just depends on the specific operation ngl
03:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but i do not know how the edge is different from the normal tiles
03:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i woulda just done it with a single shader with clamp, but that doesnt explain the performance difference
03:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Have you ever looked at the Hook / Unhook entities and say "huh, it's kind of curving outside a bit"
03:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i get 120fps easily without the ~~shader~~ edge kill tile part in view
03:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Then you look at the edges and say:
03:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh, if you put two of these together, 1 edge block becomes two visibly
03:04 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Creating a sort of outwards curve illusion
03:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> So perhaps in some way, this repeating pattern is due to this kind of illusion
03:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> So perhaps in some way, this repeating pattern is due to this kind of illusion, otherwise the kill tiles would have the same exact color since the size is the exact same
03:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> iirc it used to happen that i got scaled up vesions of the kill tile texture
03:47 < bridge_> <Teero> why is the hook texture out of bounds??
03:47 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423486599781679104/image.png?ex=68e07cb4&is=68df2b34&hm=7ad1a82c88043ad01c1a92a7c3e1c8ccf19e4e58bf6e2086450ee601e6f84d1b&
03:47 < bridge_> <Teero> there are transparent pixels on the 33rd pixel
03:48 < bridge_> <Teero> im getting these beautiful artifacts
03:48 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423486770774933594/image.png?ex=68e07cdd&is=68df2b5d&hm=7cbf09d612e0fe3c6ca0be0e3485414097fa401ee0df69080e85293635798200&
03:49 < bridge_> <Teero> same thing with the first gun fire texture
03:49 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423487077697327165/image.png?ex=68e07d26&is=68df2ba6&hm=ebc3e81ae8239b57c8aeacc77b76f6ad7f01468e6555f45555bb26876d9d9cc6&
03:50 < bridge_> <Teero> same thing with second first gun fire texture being a little bit into the first
03:50 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423487077697327165/image.png?ex=68e07d26&is=68df2ba6&hm=ebc3e81ae8239b57c8aeacc77b76f6ad7f01468e6555f45555bb26876d9d9cc6&
03:56 < bridge_> <Teero> same thing with second second gun fire texture being a little bit into the first

03:58 < bridge_> <Teero> it's on master.
03:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> I hope u find a pfp bro üôè
03:59 < bridge_> <Teero> dw it's temporary
04:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> why don't you look at the ddnet sprite code
04:00 < bridge_> <Teero> wdym? is it off by one on purpose or what
04:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> could be rounding or smth but I feel like it's all a pretty concrete grid
04:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> depends on the size of the gameskin
04:01 < bridge_> <Teero> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/game.png
04:01 < bridge_> <Teero> 
04:01 < bridge_> <Teero> there are literally 2 pixels from the hook outside of the hooks defined sprite boundaries. idk what you mean.
04:02 < bridge_> <Teero> maybe ddnet rendering is broken and accidentally fixes this, dunno.
04:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> I definitely don't know off the top of my head
04:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> you know 10x more about the game than I do
04:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> I just mean looking at the code would get u there faster
04:03 < bridge_> <Teero> wdym? what is there to look at the code
04:03 < bridge_> <Teero> the texture is wrong xd
04:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> if it's the same one ddnet code uses without artifacts evidently not
04:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> there are 2 pieces to that puzzle and oneof them isn't changing
04:03 < bridge_> <Teero> i have 500 tees stacked there to see the artifact
04:03 < bridge_> <Teero> normally i dont see it either
04:04 < bridge_> <Teero> also usually the artifacts position hidden behind the skin so it could only be seen if 500 tees hammer at the same time
04:04 < bridge_> <Teero> so there is some overlap
04:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is a screenshot of your client right?
04:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> I legitimately don't know about details I'm just hoping you see my point
04:07 < bridge_> <Teero> i can't check if ddnet has the same artifacts but it should have. in usual gameplay that position is always hidden behind the tee. its basically impossible to test xdd
04:07 < bridge_> <Teero> maybe renderdoc can help
04:09 < bridge_> <Teero> yes renderdoc helped. this is DDNet. and as you can see the artifact is there
04:09 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423492029165604965/image.png?ex=68e081c2&is=68df3042&hm=0ab1f1c4e7d057e214246f80ca8e6fd7ed90e5ac1772e962cfb0f1f887debcfd&
04:09 < bridge_> <Teero> @soulyvevo fix pls!!
04:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I won't look back what I wrote 5-6 yrs ago, that's when I still worked on the old Teeskins database
04:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And before weapons shields existed
04:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> no no
04:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you didn't make an issue on GitHub
04:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> you did not report the issue
04:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> you just talked about it
04:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> to whoever happened to be listening
04:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Hence why I got ignored
04:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> you need to go to the official forum for official matters right
04:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Don't explain
04:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> It was just ignored
04:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I mentioned like a dozen of issues in this discord server which eventually got forgotten, ignored, then brought up by another person years later
04:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I don't have faith in any of you for this reason xd
04:16 < bridge_> <Teero> then make a github issue üò≠
04:16 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> No, do your jobs and listen to feedback
04:16 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> You guys write in this room everyday, be up to speed on what other people actually report in HERE.
04:17 < bridge_> <pioooooo> yeah it has been wrong all the time
04:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Hmm? who are you?
04:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> random ass kid, got it
04:17 < bridge_> <Teero> ??? xd
04:18 < bridge_> <pioooooo> ?who are you?
04:18 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Cellegen
04:18 < bridge_> <pioooooo> random ass kid, got it
04:18 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm 24, ain't a kid I tell you that
04:18 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> being part of this community for over a decade
04:18 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> underdog of this shitty community
04:19 < bridge_> <pioooooo> lol imagine being 24 and stil being random ass kid
04:19 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> So, why do you say I have been wrong all this time?
04:19 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Like, a decade worth of my time being wrong?
04:19 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I wanna hear now
04:19 < bridge_> <pioooooo> who is saying anything about you
04:19 < bridge_> <pioooooo> what triggers you
04:19 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> ?
04:20 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> like, what was wrong?
04:20 < bridge_> <pioooooo> it -> the texture
04:20 < bridge_> <pioooooo> you're like super sensitive
04:20 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh, I thought about what I said
04:20 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Cuz that message came immediately after XD
04:21 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh well, my bad I guess
04:21 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yeah I was super sensitive cuz I thought what you wrote meant for what I wrote
04:22 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
04:22 < bridge_> <pioooooo> okay misunderstanding we all have these
04:22 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> sry
04:23 < bridge_> <pioooooo> for the texure part I just don't use the default ones so didn't bother make an issue
04:24 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I wanna double check if Nexus or Nagi did migrate those edits I've made to Teedata
04:26 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://teedata.net/template/gameskin_clear
04:26 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Eh, the template has the fixed gameskin
04:26 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> but the gameskin wasn't uploaded at all xdd
04:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> what the actual fuck are you talking about
04:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> job
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> you forget it's a 100% volunteer run operation by people efficient enough to have free time to spare for this
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> meaning
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> they're not spending their time scraping this discord for your loosely worded cries for help
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> Make An Issue
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's why it exists
04:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's like complaining to the cops that you've had a constant niusance by saying "well i've been yelling really loud this whole time"
04:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> you still have to fucking call them and make the report dude
04:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's just common sense
04:36 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> For example, that issue is not covering every issue that has with the Gameskin
04:36 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'll post the rest of the issues there soon
04:36 < bridge_> <Teero> Make an issue
04:37 < bridge_> <Teero> bro
04:37 < bridge_> <Teero> I don't know all the issues with the gameskin
04:37 < bridge_> <Teero> But at least now 1 is reported
04:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue
04:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> Good luck
04:39 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I did
04:39 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/11029
04:39 < bridge_> <Teero> nice :)
04:39 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> 3*
04:40 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> and those existed for years
04:40 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> well, now someone has to do it cuz I don't fucking care about it that much
04:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> someone with 10 minutes of their off-time can analyze that asset and see the problems already
04:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And just a nudge for you all, this ain't the only asset with errors.
04:42 < bridge_> <Teero> hmm the tip of the hook might be harder to fix
04:43 < bridge_> <Teero> well not really hard but it would be a code fix
04:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> then I would have to update my template
04:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> >:c
04:44 < bridge_> <pioooooo> i would just move it left a bit
04:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that's what I did on the template
04:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423501018049675295/image.png?ex=68e08a22&is=68df38a2&hm=cf32c92f934ca6efec734ceec026b86a661620148753d8a7b0c2628f36045e9a&
04:45 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> just pushed it a little more to the left xd
04:45 < bridge_> <Teero> ah ok that works ig xd
04:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> btw no one likes that response
04:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> nobody likes telling you to make an issue for the millionth time
04:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I think you guys do
04:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> cuz you all keep doing in
04:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> ragebait in #developer gg
04:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> cuz you all keep doing it
04:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> no, it's the truth
04:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> they need to study ur brain
04:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> we found the first mind reader
04:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Is this all you can do? Complain?
04:59 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> But ofc when I complain, things are getting ignored, should I do the same?
04:59 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Eventually issues I already found years before will get found by a random person so :/
05:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Imagine a developer only complaining
05:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i even wished u good luck ü´∞
05:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i even wished u good luck üòî
07:09 < bridge_> <melon> you should calm down. Seriously.
07:10 < bridge_> <melon> people were muted for less
07:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Being muted for being offensive, reasonable
07:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> also morning
07:16 < bridge_> <jxsl13> greeting unrelaxed developers
07:16 < bridge_> <jxsl13> s*
07:16 < bridge_> <jxsl13> it's too early to have a pulse of 120
07:23 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> as if that's not a normal occurance for me to do when I'm here üòÑ
07:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> gm
07:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> however im usa
07:33 < bridge_> <melon> morning usa I'm melon :topkekMate:
07:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk if u were around for dadbot but
07:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> that spoiled me on that joke for all of eternity
07:36 < bridge_> <melon> :nouis:
07:37 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> lol i forgot thats a thing because i fixed it for myself
07:50 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> @teero777 posted fixed asset. took me 15 minutes.
07:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> next time I want payments :kek:
07:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> nobody here is getting paid
07:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you still not understand that
07:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I do the most quality in my fixes
07:56 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I think its worth it
07:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I can see why you get ignored every time
07:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I speak only the truth
07:57 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> me too

07:59 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Did you forget that he's been playing the game for 20 years though?
08:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm a player, an artist, an ex tournament hoster, an ex database manager and a literal library worth of knowledge about the entire teeworlds network, not a ddnet developer
08:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> nor a contributor
08:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm not proud of fixing that issue, which I think, only I would've been able to catch... since I already knew them

08:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm 5 years behind Aoe
08:02 < bridge_> <melon> hi! I'm a player, a dev, a tester, a moderator, a YouTube creator, a wiki contributor.:bub:
08:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Melon
08:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I did engage with multiple communities, to be serious
08:03 < bridge_> <melon> I'm a blockworlds Dev and moderator
08:03 < bridge_> <melon> Also chiller fng moderator
08:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Alr
08:04 < bridge_> <melon> Don't see me bragging about that daily, do you?
08:04 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> You brought it up
08:04 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> That I don't engage with the community
08:04 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Well, not anymore
08:04 < bridge_> <melon> .
08:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> i was being part of it
08:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that doesn't mean I contributed to it
08:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I rarely did any maps, I rarely did any development work
08:05 < bridge_> <melon> Guess we have split definitions of being part of a community when you care so little about it, but complain so much then
08:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I did play on DDNet servers tho, engaged with known players, played on tournaments, being a meme in some cases and had so much fun
08:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I engaged in the community as a player
08:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Not as a developer
08:06 < bridge_> <melon> Time for coffee
08:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I literally complain as a player, not as a dev
08:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I am not a developer of this community
08:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And I never will
08:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Yet you see me actually helping some of your sorry asses
08:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Sorry for my language, but this is actually shit
08:10 < bridge_> <filoqcus> melon = üçà
08:10 < bridge_> <melon> Because you did something no one asked you to do? Want head pats?
08:10 < bridge_> <melon> 
08:10 < bridge_> <melon> I have coffee to cool me off, I recommend you do the same. silly Billy it is
08:11 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> No, it's because I did the job
08:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> Actually completely out to lunch
08:12 < bridge_> <melon> Did someone ask you to
08:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> When doctors shine light in your eyes do your pupils dilate
08:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> or are you too cool
08:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh, you didn't ask for the issues to be... yk, fixed?
08:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> why have them then?
08:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> and why have them be open sourced if you don't want it?
08:13 < bridge_> <melon> I'm questioning where your expectations for praise come from
08:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> praise?
08:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> what you on
08:13 < bridge_> <melon> All I'm reading out of your messages:
08:13 < bridge_> <melon> 
08:13 < bridge_> <melon> "Praise me for I have fixed an issue"
08:13 < bridge_> <melon> nothing more
08:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I only said to pay me if you want any feature to be fixed asap
08:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> like, assets for example, I'm great at it
08:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> looking at 25k images? nothing to me (after what I did on Teedata)

08:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> You're stinking up dev channel
08:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> Humbly requesting as a fellow user you move any further banter to #off-topic @cellegenrih
08:14 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Hmm
08:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> We're still talking about Github issues
08:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And my topic is to pay me
08:15 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> btw I'm not joking
08:16 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I could fix the game, but for a prize and if I would say the prize, deen would be eeeeh more dissapointed than usual.
08:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And no, it's not about me* programming for you all
08:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> you can forget it
08:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> Who is going to pay you dude
08:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> It's something else about well, what deen and others hate the most
08:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> And it's related to other communities
08:17 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that's all the hints you get
08:18 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> anyone who believes in a product. If people pay for cheat clients, then they would certainly pay for qol services
08:18 < bridge_> <melon> enough ragebait inhalation today
08:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> holy shit, what an awful start of the day :pepeW:
08:18 < bridge_> <melon> :kek:  mornin milkeey, how's your language going?
08:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> üòå
08:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I made an instruction selector thingy in pyson
08:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> which will generate rust code
08:26 < bridge_> <melon> absolutely no idea what it does but it looks complicated
08:26 < bridge_> <melon> xd
08:27 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1423008413968760842 here's my best effort explanation
08:28 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it will basically map my made up instructions to real amd64 instructions
08:30 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's a worse version of TableGen tool made up LLVM
08:30 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's a worse version of TableGen tool made by LLVM
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> developers... this is all your fault
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423558556548071504/image.png?ex=68e0bfb8&is=68df6e38&hm=11d2a06fa408b38c401a6dd092c5de2853e0325c3c3ededbeacb408ccc62ae5e&
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> this could have been fixed by paying cellegen with personal funds
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't believe your negligence
08:41 < bridge_> <melon> did rust-analyzer improve somehow? only 10gigs of ram on ddnet-rs, i recall it being almost 20 xd
08:41 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423560654341673072/image.png?ex=68e0c1ac&is=68df702c&hm=d16c87b8cd6de1c23d4cbe95b8e72dddf071092894de1f2a013f622c142d9bd9&
08:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
09:03 < bridge_> <melon> juppey i dont want to make another pr, but i forgot rust-analyzer in the toolchain extensions :angy:
09:03 < bridge_> <melon> i hate 1loc pr's
09:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just make another, who cares
09:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Melllon
09:07 < bridge_> <melon> ok go merge
09:08 < bridge_> <melon> :xd:
09:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What exactly are extensions? For ide or smth?
09:09 < bridge_> <melon> rust-analyzer in that case is simply the binary executable for the IDE yes
09:09 < bridge_> <melon> rust-analyzer in that case is simply the binary executable for the IDE/editor with LSP support yes
09:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So vscode would not work without this?
09:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The ext
09:10 < bridge_> <melon> nope, the extension itself provides the executable
09:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Btw the formatting is cursed
09:11 < bridge_> <melon> nope, the flake* extension itself provides the executable
09:11 < bridge_> <melon> nope, the flake* extension itself provides the executable, just nix things
09:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Could we also add these
09:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs-misc/blob/a36422eb7ef2cc37c6fedd08f7ce9dbac79779f3/vscode/ddnet.code-workspace#L22
09:13 < bridge_> <melon> lemme check
09:15 < bridge_> <melon> vscode-lldb would require me to actually add lldb to the buildInputs
09:15 < bridge_> <melon> 
09:15 < bridge_> <melon> thats another Gb xd
09:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/blob/a2fe2678313b790546143f5163a626df1119b8bf/.github/workflows/format.yml#L26
09:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And these
09:17 < bridge_> <melon> oh yeah i can add that
09:17 < bridge_> <melon> done
09:20 < bridge_> <kebscs> Or the mapper could put a solo tile ü•Ä
09:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> you're telling me
09:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1423571168396574791/image.png?ex=68e0cb77&is=68df79f7&hm=d02250b8ad393ac56f15eae47513b30c814f66ba95133ffe06c72b53f09134de&
09:24 < bridge_> <melon> xd looks painful
09:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @cellegenrih: we all do this for fun. Everyone only works on the issues they want to solve. Sometimes one wants to solve the issue of closing all GitHub issues to clean it up. But yes 800 GitHub issues are currently being ignored.
09:58 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Keep it good vibes only please. Putting your self in this victim role about not being heard and complaining about things and demanding payment is not putting you in a good light.
09:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And if you really want stuff to be done. Don‚Äôt ask others to do it. Do it your self. That‚Äôs how things work here.
09:59 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And no you are not being paid for it.
10:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> You are paid for it by acknowledgment of the community in form of complaints
10:05 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> chiller did a maintainer thing
10:06 < bridge_> <aegisub> :mariolook:
10:06 < bridge_> <aegisub> nice backlog
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat look wat i found `-rw-r--r-- 1 tcpdump tcpdump 4.1K Sep 28 14:46 07_snap_single.pcap`
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `-rw-rw-r-- 1 chiller chiller 18K Sep 28 14:46 snap.txt`
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ojea
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `./DDNet "connect tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1;dbg_snap 1" > snap.txt` from ma history
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_Y=1041`
10:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ._.
10:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok lemme try to reproduce
10:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** should be the exact same sound on the same map i hope
10:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat if i do it not what value do you expect to see?
10:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** is the problem possibly `connect tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1;dbg_snap 1` instead of `dbg_snap 1;connect tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1` no way right?
10:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea never mind there is no sound at all now XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXD
10:41 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> xdd
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait the snap i dumped earlier was also missing ddnet registration <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait maybe it was not ddnet but tw server
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/dce8c0e6718a92f5afd0b61bb65db9fbc69527b1/tests/packets7/another_snap_single_test.py#L12
10:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** omg yes i document shit so well
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok second try!
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how excited are you catto?
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** waiting for this all week
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i have good news and bad news
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its not 1040
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its not 1070
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> whew
10:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_Y=1052`
10:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> lmao
10:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> try again, will it be a different value again? XD
10:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** probabky
10:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** lez do it
10:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yup `m_Y=1046`
10:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_Y=1042`
10:44 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> noice
10:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_Y=1044`
10:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the `m_X=1776` x stays tho xd
10:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** are we onto something?
10:44 < bridge_> <melon> :Pepegun:
10:45 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what is sound id 39 solly?
10:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> get the output from one of those tests and put it in https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet/commit/540cc51848bbc3f1c86cb680a2a78c4d1bb10194
10:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and see if it matches
10:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** put in where
10:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** match what
10:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i sent the link, there's `aDelta`
10:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> check the debug snap output
10:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if i ran that code on my machine it will be the same as on yours no?
10:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont get the plan
10:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think i need to send the very same full packet to the client but sounds annoying to do because of state needed
10:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i used snap delta from your test case and printed it using the code from the link, it shows m_Y to be 1170
10:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> so it's different than the value printed in your snap debug output
10:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i wanted you to check if the debug outputs match now
10:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i am still not following xd
10:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** match your debug output to what?
10:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i have so many outputs d
10:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> you get such wall of text when you run your client https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/dce8c0e6718a92f5afd0b61bb65db9fbc69527b1/tests/packets7/another_snap_single_test.py#L16-75, right?
10:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
10:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** of the very first snap because of exit(1)
10:52 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yes
10:52 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but now i always get different y so it can not consistently match your y?
10:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> you simply replace snap delta value in code
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** a
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** questions is where i get the new raw data from?
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can tcpdump be trusted?
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or do i need to print in the client?
10:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe the first snap sent over the network is not the first being parsed by the client and thats the entire issue here
10:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> then print the raw data in client and check if it's the same as tcpdump's
10:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oge
10:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do i need to connect to a server to get urs to print?
10:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yea
10:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait why? isnt it fixed data
10:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i suppose i can move your code to OnInit right?
10:58 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I dunno it will work the same but you can try xd
