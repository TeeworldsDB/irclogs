00:02 < NooBxGockeL> Heya! deen you here and open for another suggestion ?
00:03 <@deen> hi
00:03 <@deen> NooBxGockeL: I'm also on the server where you are and am actually watching you
00:03 <@deen> how you swing left and right without reason
00:04 < NooBxGockeL> :D nice! ye im thinking and talking in ts :D
00:04 <@deen> so?
00:07 < NooBxGockeL> well heres my suggestion, lately i have found myself often connecting to the ddnet server only looking if i have allready finished the map. It would be really nice to see in the serverbrowser if the current map on the ddnet server i have allready finished [/badenglish]
00:07 <@deen> not going to happen =/
00:08 <@deen> Best we have is this: http://ddnet.tw/players/NooBxGockeL/
00:09 < NooBxGockeL> ye i know this but a little star at the end of mapname to indicate its finished would be nice, i know it probably be a lot of work and server strain but it'd be nice :X
00:11 < NooBxGockeL> hmpf just out of interest, is it even possible to do such thing ? or would the server strain be too heavy or something :S
00:12 <@deen> it may be quite a lot, yeah
00:12 <@deen> could be cached and all, but still
00:12 <@deen> much higher than what we have now
00:12 <@deen> may be easier if the client remembered if you finished a map
00:13 < NooBxGockeL> hmmm yeah could be like every start, parse the link you sent and save localy
00:13 <@deen> but then it breaks if you use another client or another server
00:13 <@deen> so i don'T really like it
00:13 < NooBxGockeL> yeah would be another of those ddnet exclusives
00:13 <@deen> that website is meant for humans to read, not machines, it may change at any moment
00:16 < NooBxGockeL> hmmm is there a central ddnet server ?
00:17 < NooBxGockeL> or like an opportunity for a php webservice thingy
00:19 <@deen> i guess you could call the website server central
00:20 <@deen> and that server is already overloaded all the time :P
00:24 < NooBxGockeL> :/
00:24 < eeeee> shouldn't be too hard to make some json endpoint for that "unfinished maps" website feature. client coding would take more effort just because it's annoying in general
00:25 < eeeee> oh that reminds me
00:26 < eeeee> Learath2: can haz json serverinfos?
00:26 < eeeee> or are you still busy with autoupdate?
00:27 < Learath2> eeeee: didnt i give that to you 
00:27 < Learath2> and you said you would test 
00:27 < eeeee> lol. i totally forgot
00:28 < eeeee> guess it was around that time when i got pissed at oy and his secrecy and dumped all tw work for a while
00:37 < Learath2> eeeee: no guarantees it'll work tho :D
00:38 < eeeee> can you give me the link again? can't find it in logs :/
00:39 < Learath2> eeeee: https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/tree/pr_HTTPSrvListTest
00:39 < Learath2> if doesntwork i can fix it up tomorrow 
00:39 < Learath2> must get some sleep now 
00:40 < eeeee> yeah i'm not gonna work on it right now anyway, but i planned to work on js client this weekend
11:58 < laxadedi> deen: I got ddnet t-shirt :)
