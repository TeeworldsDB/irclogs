02:17 < laxa> Pretty happy about what is happening
02:17 < laxa> thanks deen :)
02:18 < laxa> Good luck for the new administration team !

09:38 <@EastByte> "Now you can attach PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text files to your comments on Issues and Pull Requests."
09:38 <@EastByte> wondering how this is done
09:45 < laxadedi> maybe drag & drop ^^
09:46 <@EastByte> nah, rather wondering how github will display the document
09:47 < laxadedi> Pretty sure there is some opensource things to do that I guess
10:03 <@EastByte> well I would certainly ignore people who are using doc files instead of markdown :P
10:07 < laxadedi> They are probably trying to get big corporation to use github

13:54 < o_be_two> hello :)
13:54 < o_be_two> learn that vali is hosting v3royal named "illuminati" -_- .. I'm working on my dedi, i must host this server it's a real security problem
13:55 < o_be_two> (just to let you know, yesterday he forced me to go in spec just cause i got all weapons and played with team to block all ......, many players get DDoS, btw, and the server is on internap network)
13:55 < o_be_two> (i use a new nick that no one know on this map, so he doesnt know that it was me

21:25 < laxa> Anyone here ?
21:25 < laxa> Could someone explain to me this output ? http://pastebin.com/qjRC6mHh
21:26 < laxa> why the struct is 8 bytes long instead of 6 ?
21:26 < fstd> laxa: because struct padding
21:26 < laxa> that's what I thought
21:26 < laxa> but if I do a struct with char test[7]
21:26 < laxa> only
21:26 < laxa> it does a 7 bytes struct
21:27 < laxa> cause optimized at compile time ?
21:27 < fstd> no, just lack of a reason to insert padding
21:27 < laxa> Hummmm
21:27 < fstd> in struct {int, short}'s size would probably be 6, right?
21:28 < fstd> (then again, maybe not)
21:28 < laxa> yes
21:28 < fstd> then it inserts the padding so that the int is 32-bit aligned
21:29 < laxa> That was what I thought, but I wanted to be sure
21:29 < laxa> Thanks a lot :)
21:29 < fstd> no problem
23:30 <@heinrich5991> fstd: if {int,short} is 6, does that mean that {int,short}[2] is 12 or 16 bytes?
23:31 < Learath2> is GER getting ddosed or smth ?
23:31 < fstd> heinrich5991: yes.  that's what made me say "(then again, maybe not)" because it sure would be weird
23:32 < fstd> then again, misaligned accesses aren't forbidden on x86
23:32 < fstd> oh and, yes, 12 bytes
23:32 < fstd> arrays must be contiguous
23:32 <@heinrich5991> is it required that sizeof(type[2]) = sizeof(type) * 2? 
23:32 <@heinrich5991> I mean theoretically the pointer arithmetic could take alignment into account
23:33 < fstd> that follows from the requirement to be contiguous, yes
23:33 <@heinrich5991> and still be "contiguous" for some definition of "contiguous"
23:33 < fstd> elements-adjacent-with-no-gaps-imposed-by-the-array-itself
23:34 <@heinrich5991> mhmh
23:34 <@heinrich5991> k
23:39 < fstd> heinrich5991: that said, i don't seem to be able to find a system where struct {int, short}'s size would actually be 6.  does yours do this?
23:40 <@heinrich5991> no
23:46 < fstd> so they probably thought of the arrays :)
23:48 < Ac1dBeef> fstd: > that said, i don't seem to be able to find a system where struct {int, short}'s size would actually be 6.
23:48 < Ac1dBeef> 16 bit systems would have such size of struct
23:49 < fstd> yes, good point, but not the point here :)
23:49 < fstd> and no, i'd expect the size to be 4 there
23:49 < fstd> at least when sizeof (int) == 2 (which is required provided that we're using 8-bit bytes) and sizeof (short) == 1 or 2
23:50 <@deen> Learath2: "nternap is having packet loss in Frankfurt right now that appears to be due to an attack. We are contacting them to ask for more information on what's going on and what can be done."
23:51 <@deen> Learath2: but there also were 4 ddos attacks against us earlier today
23:57 < Learath2> well the kids are having fun :P
