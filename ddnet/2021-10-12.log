08:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was so close to buying a fairphone 4
08:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I noticed they also got rid of the headphone jack
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if u have air pods u dont need it
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a collection of headphones ranging from meh to great, 30 to 250€. I don't want to spend more money on headphones
08:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just sad to see even the fringest of companies making a niche product for people that are concerned about things like ethical production would kill the headphone jack and release their own wireless headphones
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened to sustainability? Why are we deprecating millions of headphones? Is it really ethical to create a problem and sell the solution?
09:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> can‘t you use a usbc to headphone jack adapter?
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have to carry around one of those adapters that have both charging and headphones
10:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Is there any reason why new hookthru isn't a block of its own, and instead something you put on top of other blocks
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> To keep prediction for vanilla clients
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> has anyone tried pipewire https://pipewire.org/
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it work well
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> yes

20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie was your company the one that released a switch game before?
