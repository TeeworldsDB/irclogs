13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jhonnie Randler> I recently let my brother play this amazing game. But when I got home my account had been banned until February 21st. My brother said he didn't know why this happened. Until I found out he had installed a hacked version of Ddrace. I'm sorry for what happened, but please release my account again. I really like this game, and I didn't want to be without playing it for so long. I promise this will never happen again
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spam
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen can u check if u like the tooltip
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4267
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> adding a tooltip rn is as easy as this
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/942767411214553128/unknown.png
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as long as the text is just one line it will work
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it should appear with a delay
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that complicates things a lot
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> instant is annoying tho, they will appear everywhere if you're just moving mouse
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well then the tooltip will be delayed more
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not in the mood to code that xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is it that much work tho? just save  tick when mouse stopped on it and compare
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> Pls no delay :c
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm well assuming only 1 tooltip is shown at a time maybe iits then as simple as u say
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't see a reason why they would overlap
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Ravie how much delay do u find good
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1 second?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i can make it a config
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if heinrich will like it tho
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 1s sounds about right

17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++20 poggers
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to use concepts
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can maybe get to C++17 now? üòõ
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it hilarious ubuntu 18
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> released in 2021
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt support c++20
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just want to check what works, if we can skip to c++20 immediately
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what debian uses ur builds?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I will have to upgrade that
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure yet how to deal with that
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's Debian 6 üòÑ
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its fine if u go from 6 to 7 and so on
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> theorically they test upgrades a lot
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> On Linux you always lose support for players by building with a higher glibc/stdlibc++ version
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't we statically link those btw?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets use https://musl.libc.org/
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, we don't statically link glibc
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no one does that
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could we? üòÑ
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think so
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57476533/why-is-statically-linking-glibc-discouraged
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always said it,  gaming people should always try to have the latest updates
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and usually linux ppl are tech savvy enough to do that
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not like the problem is grandpas who are stuck in windows xp
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what i seen is ppl statically link to musl
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since its way more lightweight
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think zig uses musl
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Note: Generally, for Linux targets, we prefer the musl libc builds over the glibc builds here, because musl builds end up producing a static binary, which is more portable across Linux distributions.
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> musl ddnet when?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap>
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > D:\a\ddnet\ddnet\src\engine\shared\demo.cpp(376,31): warning C5055: operator '*': deprecated between enumerations and floating-point types
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> there are also some lambda warnings bcs c++02
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> deprecated implicit this capture
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 would u introduce concepts to ddnet?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know any example which would be useful?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > According to ISO C++ core guideline T.20, "The ability to specify meaningful semantics is a defining characteristic of a true concept, as opposed to a syntactic constraint."
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good quote xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> there are also some lambda warnings bcs c++20
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, bolting on these new features never really looks good
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as we say in France, "ouais, c'est pas faux"
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Uhm:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and what does that mean
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "yes, that's not wrong"
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it means you didn't understand shit
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but with this catchphrase, you can sound like you agree
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i get it xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> concept and stuff are way above my intellect üòÑ
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i would be ok with concepts
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they map to rust trait bounds
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i already use them a lot
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, fixed already
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn wanna see some complicated type stuff

17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks fun!
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is what happens when u try to turn rust into haskell
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why don't people make more comprehensive language with same programming concepts/stuff
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone should make a list of stuff that would benefit from tooltip texts
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since i know most stuff idk what ppl dont know
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'd say most of them
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will need to update lot of translations
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupstar: Huge map is not fitting into video ram with opengl 2/3, but works with opengl 1. I guess that's expected?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> With OpenGL 1 I can see the client using 836 MB, which is kind of in line with the server using 459 MB. But with OpenGL 3 it's 2212 MB, which seems excessive
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 2.2gb sounds alot, but you also use an integrated GPU right?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (regular RAM I guess, but measured on macOS with the iGPU)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> what map is it?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I'm not sure if video ram somehow gets added or now
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not*
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a secret large map, not released yet
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1500*4000 dimension
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> mh too bad with vulkan it shows exactly what uses how much
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> textures, buffers üòÑ
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> on VRAM
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, are you Jupstar or someone else?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> I am not keks xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think he is jupstar
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think he is jupstar
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you think about VSync @Not Keks
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, was already hoping we have someone else with graphics knowledge üòÑ
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks do u like vsync on?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> vsync is good, if you want to die in race
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> definitely jupstar
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> tru detectives here xd
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, so what can we do? Should we just split up the map? Should we investigate why opengl 3 is taking 3 times as much memory as opengl 1?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm an expert in identifying people in this discord from their opinions
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> hard to say how much comes from your video driver just allocating alot of RAM
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it render on chunks or all the map?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it creates the buffer for everything
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it should have around 2x the RAM + the buffers that live on VRAM
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> so i guess its fine xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> steam says only 1.26% has less than 1GB VRAM
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Keeping the map open for a few minutes reduces memory by 600 MB, that's also weird
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> maybe thats the Metal layer
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> thats why i'd use vulkan
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it says exactly how much VRAM it actually uses
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or its is macos keeping the vectors alive for faster reusing
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And directly after join memory consumption also goes down by a lot, maybe some temporary buffers we keep around?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can also try on Linux
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i think i purposly created them on stack, so they never leak
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> well anyway the one is VRAM the other RAM
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> The ram will shortly spike, while it uploads to the GPU
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but as it finished it should go down as you said
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, just 1082 MB on Linux
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can we maybe upload layer by layer and clean up immediately afterwards?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> is there a RAM problem?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> steam says "Less than 4 GB 0.30%"
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, with 4 GB and the rest of your system using 3 GB it will be tough
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vram or ram?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> thats RAM
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4gb ram nowadays seems rare
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but a OS wont use 3gb if the system only has 4GB i guess
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if ur on windows it wouldnt be rare

19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> xd
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> well arctic frost is around as big
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> and nobody except the 32bit ppl that could default to 1.x has complained yet xd
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have 32gb and its there to be used
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> we just sell RAM and VRAM in cloud, good marketing
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was looking at steam discussions and found this
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/942855830896775238/unknown.png
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> holy moly xd
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> he didn't say YOU SHOULD DIE, maybe he meant himself
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but its funny how everybody was mad at it until you explain it helps against ddos
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> then they instantly turned around xD
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't know who you talking about üòÑ
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> Vulkan best
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> @Chairn does your laptop's Intel GPU gets detected now too?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> didnt it have vulkan 1.0?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how can i know?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i think i googled
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but sometimes it's just for linux mesa drivers
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but the graphic page lists them( last time we tested it was still looking for 1.1, so maybe it changed )
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but the graphics settings page lists them( last time we tested it was still looking for 1.1, so maybe it changed )
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is weird
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> my graphic card is listed in but the driver version doesn't match
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> is your driver older?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> CTS Version: 1.2.0.1
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Driver Version: 436.39
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> CPU: x86
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> OS: Windows 7 64
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> GPU: NVIDIA Kepler family
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but nvidia's driver for my card stops at 425.sth
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ohh nVIDIA u mean
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> thats weird
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ah no
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 425.31
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i think its bcs gtx series
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> they probs use same architecture
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum no: NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> so it specifically mentions that?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products#submission_414
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but they are all in the same group
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> maybe they were just too lazy to hand select xD
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or windows 10 has a newer driver inbuild
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't find my intel graphics in through
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> that's not too uncommon
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't find my intel graphics in th/ough
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't find my intel graphics in though
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> and then they might have forgotten to split to win7
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but you can better use gpuinfo.org
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> GeForce GT 740M    458.6.0.0
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or they cheating xd
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think this is mine: https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=5921
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> maybe you can use the not mobile version üòÑ
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> although it says win10, i use win7, but it's the only matching driver version
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/942859497716723742/unknown.png
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i see a lot
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nvidia's website says latest driver for my card is 425.31
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so how the hell?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> maybe the non mobile driver somehow
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it would refuse to install itself
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or some laptop specific driver
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> not from nvidia
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it doesn't "help" against ddos
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it helps if you wanted to make a whitelist for example
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it helps you to safly browse the internet tab
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Some people were using it to set up a honeypot server on the list. Each time someone was refreshing, sending info request to each registered servers, the honeypot was here to collect the IP and use it as the source IP of a forged packet
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> flooding the target with "legit" players IPs
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https master is the best solution tho, and happy that it is working well
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but we still have the protection against that type of attacks, in case people still use old clients
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but we still have the protection against that type of attacks, in case people still use old clients (Bombay)
