11:53 < dfdfdfdf> >>it's in the cloud, you have no garanty of cpu power
11:53 < dfdfdfdf> Didnt understand this argument. All other current servers are kvm based too, so u cant be sure about cpu overselling.
11:55 <@EastByte> what prevents a provider to oversell kvm based vms?
11:56 < dfdfdfdf> mm...its what i said, no difference
11:56 < dfdfdfdf> that's why i didnt understand laxa's argument
11:57 <@EastByte> okay, I understand
11:59 <@EastByte> well, nfoservers for example claims to provide "One full, dedicated HT CPU core (Nehalem or better)" in their vps plan
12:00 <@EastByte> and from gametown-projects (GER2) we know that noone else is using it :p
12:02 < dfdfdfdf> yes, all claim, but who knows)
12:04 < dfdfdfdf> to have friend inside organization is only one way to be sure)
12:05 <@EastByte> well nfoservers has no other choice than providing stable cpus, their vps are meant to be used for gameservers
12:05 <@deen> yeah, KVM performance fluctuates a lot, even at the same hoster
12:05 <@deen> but for most servers it's totally fine

12:06 < dfdfdfdf> also some information can give vmstat to show stolen time from VM
12:06 <@deen> stolen time is also shown in htop
12:10 < dfdfdfdf> y, can be shown by any *top progrman that can parse /proc/stat

16:01 < o_be_two> hello :)
17:20 < Ac1dBeef> >it's in the cloud, you have no garanty of cpu power
17:20 < Ac1dBeef> there are some hosters, that provide "cloud" way to work with bare servers.
17:21 < Ac1dBeef> e.g. https://www.scaleway.com/, also i've seen x86 servers too.
17:40 < o_be_two> Ac1dBeef: ovh has this too
