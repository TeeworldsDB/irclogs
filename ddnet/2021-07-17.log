00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> was correct btw, thanks ^^
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you also happen to know the size of the hook pieces? I'm once again looking at the render code in `game/client/components/players.cpp` but fail to see the size
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you tried same as the body? üòÑ
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> w: 24/64 of body
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> h: 16/64 of body
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am so extremely annoyed that there are no condvars in tokio and that they think notify does the same thing
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot I've cleaned this up a bit, hopefully I can finish up the map testing part tomorrow
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks @Learath2
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can u guys stop fucking up th eeditor and just roll it back a couple of versions?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you be constructive and tell what is bothering you
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the quad cutting now does not care which corners you have selected which only makes it harder (i heard this was intentional)
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i want to put values into layer colours for example and i try to navigate with arrowkeys (because the cursor is at the wrong place anyway) it also navigates the editor into mapres selection. and finally since today when i try to paint tiles while holding shift it lags the editor and if my selection is too big it can crash the editor.
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but its not like devs ever listened to me before
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I literally fix editor bugs on the spot for people who report them if possible. I don't get where you gather this idea that we dont care about these
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I noticed that when you want to modify a tune in the editor by using the right and left arrows it changes from the main screen to images then to sounds
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Learath2  so nobody ever told you about the wrong cursor placement or the quad cutting?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Se how quickly your arrow issue was fixed? :P
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember one issue about quad scaling that I couldn't fix. But dont remember any about quad cutting
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i spoke with coke about it and he told me that this was intentional.   if you select 2 corners of a quad then it should only cut it in that direction. but its not the case anymore
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> You could use U and V positions
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It's more accurate
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you say cutting what do you use for it?
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thanks. i didnt notice these before
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> :P
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The u and v position should update correctly if you select the correct corners and change only the coordinate that they share from u and v
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i used to freehand it with shift and mouse
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> btw i just edited the u and v value and the cursor is also at the wrng place
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah shift and mouse. Okay. I'll takr a look at whats wrong with it
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Used to do that too but then it stretches the images ü§¢
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show a screenshot, idk what you mean when you say cursor
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> seems to happen at all those things where you can enter a value like that
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/865911081939501056/cursor2.PNG
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i figured out why its at the wrong place. it remembers where your cursor was before. so if i delete a value. go anywhere else in the editor and try to change another its going to be infront of the number
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> which is annoying when u do the color ones
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay. I'll take a look after breakfast. If you'll allow me that leasure :P
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its alright. i was just pissed
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im 'rage
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> driller dragon
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> edit boxes share impl with the menu now
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i guess it happens in menu too
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> any fix for panning with middle click and releasing it over certain UI and it triggers it (like adding a new group)
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> always annoyed me
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> how can i download the ddrace mod for a gamesrv ?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> and pack it in the fdp server?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Installing rootkit
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/866029028217716775/unknown.png
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which game do you need to play?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rootkit
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valorant?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess valorant
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes valorant, friends want to play
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could also find new friends üòõ
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Too hard, just to avoid xi jinping from watching me play games
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> the length you have to go to have less cheaters
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The actual perfect solution to cheaters is requesting they use actual government issued IDs and I stand behind that üòÑ
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would make it a bit more expensive
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd think you could buy government IDs for playing though
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you want face verification during the match or so
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that also not very illegal?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I trust the government to punish those who would commit identity theft
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with consent of the people providing the ID to the game company
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I don't follow, don't you mean people can just buy government ids and using them to register?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean you can sell your government ID'ed account to other people
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, well govt ids are fairly scarce is my point, you can sell your account but they still have a single shot
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i vaguely remember some headline that cheating became illegal in some country ^^
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> korea requires id numbers when registering to games, I guess if anyone did that it'd be them

21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are germans alright
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't worry, the conservative party already said that they have the best climate policies
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard that netherlands have the problem too
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would be scared shitless there
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont they live under sea level
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> where's the video from?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are parts of the netherlands below sea level

21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i live in a coastal city :monkaS:
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i never seen a flood here
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> will have to take the boat to the grocery store though heh
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üòÄ
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> sounds exciting, but on the other hand also scared. In near future everyone will use boats instead of cars?

21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Climate change: Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> my parents were always worried about water entering through the sewage in the basement of their flat

21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> they installed a special valve to prevent that
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> imagine this happens to you instaed
