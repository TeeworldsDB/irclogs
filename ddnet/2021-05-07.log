01:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah that works
06:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vscode scared the shit out of me, thought I had ghost content in a new file.

07:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hmm
07:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i got asked about why is this button available in game.
07:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840094797028392980/unknown.png
08:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant u access editor ingame?
08:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can but people say they click it and got confused
08:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and some of them don't know how english menu works since editor is not translated lol
08:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah thats problem indeed
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and i get it is technically not a tab
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i guess*
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe show it only when there is a unsaved map
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that doesn't make sense, you test it after you saved it hmm
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nvm
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we could also translate a signle string in the editor that says map editor or smth
08:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so they know atleast what it is
08:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or add hover text to the menu buttons
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or just let them keep asking me lol
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there is a x button in the editor so at least they aren't stuck
09:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh boy
09:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> was trying to add an popup, then i don't want to just copy paste more popup code. so I went on and made a generic popup. then I found out the text align doesn't work, now I want my text layout, but porting that is too much work.
09:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
09:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what kind of text alignment doesnt work
09:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> center multiline, right multiline, and we don't have bottom align
09:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did it center all text per line, like in a text editor?
09:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it did what teeworlds used to do, it takes the width of the bottom line and centered base on that
09:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think in ddnet u can take the line with the most width
09:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not implemented in ui, but for chat
09:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but it is not automatic and available everywhere
09:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that doesnt sound hard to me
09:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think chat just used more cursors.
09:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i like per-line tbh
09:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can also just analysze the text and render all lines individually
09:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the performance doesnt matter too much i guess
09:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only if ALOOT of text is shown it should be optimized
09:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Does CTextContainer just save the quads and do upload when you needed it?
10:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly it changes bahavior with xmonad:
10:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "Previously when I had the window open on another virtual desktop on another screen (but not focussed) it would still show me an x11 notify telling me on which desktop it is. With this change I only get the notification when the desktop is not on any visible screen."
10:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the text in vanilla save all text quads, looks like CTextContainer does basically the same thing plus vertbuffer?
10:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
10:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as said it wont matter as much
10:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the server browser for example is streamed but still uses buffers, so basically like a cache
10:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it might be code QoL down the line. that one has auto text ellipses and correct word wrapping, and the text layout code is like multiple times faster than TextEx.
10:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I've even prepared the layout code for RTL rendering even tho we don't have the shaping yet.
10:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah sounds cool
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> luckily tw doesnt render alot of texts, mostly single words, so might only matter for like text or smth
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chat*
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> basically i just need to replace TextEx. probably doesn't need to touch fonts or anything.
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean do what you want
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if it works its fine xd
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> any improvement is good
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and if i'm not dead
10:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and probably would fix motd tbh
10:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah tryharding coding is hard xd
10:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is motd broken?
10:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i abuse it alot in fng2 xd
10:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to show stats
10:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> motd doesn't wrap i guess it is the only problem
10:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and of course broadcast has center alignment issue
10:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or do you prefer a motd that overflows?
10:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840138276140089344/screenshot_2021-05-07_10-08-37.png
10:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the last character xxD
10:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems like it got cut some day
10:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's probably just a utf8 truncation
10:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840138608844865536/unknown.png
10:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> should this be fixed tho
10:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
10:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah looks bad
10:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but motd window can also be a bit wider btw
10:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, word wrapping will make modders rush to us and ask why do we take their text space lol.
10:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> happened to vanilla already. but i guess we can resize motd window
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah already forogt xd
12:09 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> "modders" aka only @fokkonaut :D
12:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> we should switch to fixed width fonts everywhere
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://streamable.com/k4rmfl
13:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> is it just a huge map containing all of those or you are haxor and made maps load that fast
13:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's a map that has all maps
15:23 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lol
15:23 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> does this have any use case?
15:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚
15:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS
16:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> finally a sane os
17:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chillerdragon: a server with multiple games at the same time using ddnet teams and each team can choose their map and game type.
17:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~It's part of my attempt to put more players into one server to legally manipulate players count~~
17:41 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ah nice
17:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> best hack for playercount is to increase timeout protection :D and make it activate on disconnect
17:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> HolyC > C
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> programming for android studio sometimes is a hassle, the tutorials from google explain things half assed always so u gotta relly on tutorials from decades
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its not something you can known from programming experience since its all obscure apis from google/android
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly triggers me
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the worse of the worse is the mix of kotlin java
18:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
18:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
18:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you are the best
18:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜³
19:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes i had a kotlin project in college and i hated it
19:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nothing transfers over like you said
19:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> holyc > android developmen t
19:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> holyc > android development
22:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i wonder if an auto-refresh option for the browser would be a good feature\
22:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i know it redraws all of the items in the list but maybe it could quickly change the view after the results are mostly complete
