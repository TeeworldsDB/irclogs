01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> on a 1920x1080 screen
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> with amd virtual super resolution
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yo, i have a problem: i have serverside dummies, which i want to control. but when i set m_Input.m_WhateverInput it just wont work, in the old mod based on 9.0.2 it worked, now i based on 11.9, is there a change? or does anyone have an idea what could cause that?
08:28 <+Guest59> hello?
08:28 <+Guest59> is this DDnets IRC?
08:29 <+GG_Kid> oh i see
08:32 <+GG_Kid> I came to ask what happened to CAN servers, i have my theories but i wanted a reason, not my own conjecture.
08:33 <+GG_Kid> I'm +Guest59 in an other webchat Tab BTW.
10:10 <@deen> GG_Kid: They had no players, so o_be_one stopped hosting them

17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> When i try to watch a demo from map 'aled' this happens, whats the issue?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/561940229921964032/screenshot_2019-03-31_16-23-57.png
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U have different versions of the map in ur folder
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Try deleting the map and download it again from the server
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Now this error doesn't happen but my client freezes when i press play and nothing happens afterwards
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha dfq is going on on stackoverflow?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Dafuq haha genius
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Oh maybe april fool
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> is it april fools for you guys already
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> no but somewhere is
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx- that's not supposed to happen. can you send me the demo? As a workaround you can get the correct map version from https://maps.ddnet.tw/
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> will try
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh its 1 april already ¡n some places
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen the demo recorder doesn't really try hard enough to save the correct map in the demo
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IIRC
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Any idea why the hook bugs out?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/562003478264938499/screenshot_2019-03-31_21-56-07.png
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it does that when its getting too long
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> y
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 oh, that sounds pretty bad, it should know exactly what map is running right now, shouldn't it?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen yes, it should. but it doesn't use that information IIRC. only matching by name or so
