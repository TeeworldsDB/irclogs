00:15 < lan> mmm win32, is it... bad that there is a win64 version?
00:16 <@heinrich5991> just take the win32, it's fine :)
00:21 <@deen> no need for win64
00:23 < Muttballs> version 7 is live i see
00:38 < Learath2> deen: we could maybe get a buildbot going which should make stuff easier for you
00:38 < Learath2> we had one for ddrace
00:38 <@deen> sounds complicated
00:39 < Learath2> dont know what it involved while setting up thats a question for greyfox but it was quite easy to release
00:39 < Learath2> Click the big release button and done
00:39 <@deen> when we don't add curl, releasing ddnet is easy as well
00:39 <@deen> i just boot up my 4 vms and run "./build.sh" or "build.bat" on windows
00:40 <@deen> and that's it
00:40 < Learath2> huh why is curl any different to release ?
00:40 <@deen> because it didn't work :P
00:40 <@deen> had to get libcurl compiled first, fix lua scripts and so on
00:41 < Learath2> I'll get the autoupdate done soon might even do it tomorrow
00:41 <@deen> nice
00:42 < Learath2> it just needs a manual update button and some prettification
00:54 < Learath2> btw deen http://ddnet.tw/status/ shows teamspeak is empty which its not 
00:55 < laxa> Learath2: it just shows the DDRaceNetwork chan
00:55 < Learath2> oic

10:37 < Muttley> deen, is ddnet server 7 compatible with the normal tw client ?
11:28 <@deen> Muttley: sure
11:28 <@deen> or did i break something again?
11:30 < Muttley> no just checking
11:30 < Muttley> i know Teetime made a tw7.0 version of infection and i couldnt connect with the 6.3 client
11:31 < Teetime> i didn't made, you just compiled teeworlds 0.7
11:39 < Muttley> oh ;-)
11:40 < Muttley> Teetime, then i thought you made it ;-) but i just dont get git
11:45 <@deen> oh vyeah
11:45 <@deen> it's not "tw 0.7"^^
11:46 <@deen> and i always do that by mistake as well, compiling the 0.7 version instead of the mod, because mod authors forget to set the default git branch :P

12:30 <@deen> hi BeaR_ 
12:30 < BeaR_> hey deen (:
12:32 <@deen> I'm writing a tutorial about how to start with Nim
12:32 <@deen> tutorial/guide
12:32 < BeaR_> nice
12:32 <@deen> not sure if my choice of a brainfuck interpreter as a "hello world" is good
12:33 < BeaR_> might not be that useful :D
12:33 <@deen> what else to write?
12:33 < BeaR_> but a parser or interpreter sounds nice
12:33 < BeaR_> just for another language
12:33 <@deen> it's about the simplest interpreter you can get
12:34 < BeaR_> sure but who wants to interpret [>+<-] ^^
12:35 <@deen> hm =/
12:35 <@deen> i don't know, quite a lot of people write a brainfuck interpreter^^
12:36 <@deen> i want sth simple that you can do on the command line
12:37 < BeaR_> hmm
12:39 < BeaR_> a simple calculator maybe?
12:39 <@deen> thought about that too, but that sounds so boring
12:39 < BeaR_> ^^
12:40 <@deen> i guess I'll stay with the brainfuck (except if someone gives me a really nice other idea)
12:40 <@deen> I'm also concerned with the name, haha
12:40 <@deen> my article contains the word "fuck" a few hundred times
12:40 <@deen> should just call it "brainf"
12:48 < BeaR_> well, don't know any other language which would fit a getting started tutorial /:
12:48 <@deen> yeah
12:48 < BeaR_> how long is the code? <100 lines?
12:48 <@deen> ~30 lines
12:48 < BeaR_> oh :D
12:48 <@deen> i should make it a bit longer and easier to understan^^
12:49 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/nim-unsorted/blob/master/brainfuck.nim
12:50 <@deen> maybe it's just interesting for me, but basically brainfuck is a turing machine
12:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: why does the stack consist of chars?
12:53 <@heinrich5991> is it char as in C, i.e. int8_t?
12:53 <@deen> yes
12:53 <@deen> mainly so that you can easily print it out
13:11 <@deen> first i wanted to write a small game, but i don't really like sdl2 and sfml and don't want people to have to install them
13:11 <@deen> that's more work than installing nim itself
13:13 < BeaR_> nim doesn't come with some sort of package system?
13:14 <@deen> sure it does
13:14 <@deen> https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble
13:14 <@deen> http://nim-lang.org/lib.html#nimble
13:14 < Learath2> deen: some kind of roguelike 
13:14 < Learath2> ?
13:14 <@deen> Learath2: nah, too complicated^^
13:15 < BeaR_> why is installing sdl2 or sfml difficult then ?:
13:15 <@deen> sdl2 is also so complicated to write in, too much boilerplate
13:15 < BeaR_> Learath2: teeworlds :p
13:16 <@deen> sfml is problematic because you need csfml as well and it hasn't been updated to the most recent sfml version yet...
13:16 < BeaR_> ah ok
13:16 <@deen> and the sfml wrapper for nim has problems, have to report them
13:16 <@deen> ^^
13:16 < BeaR_> own engine, don't know these problems :p
13:17 < BeaR_> (well I spent pretty much time on window handling ^^)
13:18 <@deen> own engine?
13:18 < BeaR_> game engine, basically rendering only atm
13:18 <@deen> cool
13:54 < Learath2> deen: is contributing in nim itself possible ?
13:54 <@heinrich5991> to nim itself, yes
14:17 <@deen> Learath2: not sure i understand the question
14:30 <@deen> ahaha
14:31 <@deen> I wrote a mail to an Iranian hoster 3 months ago, just got the response^^
16:21 < o_be_one> XXLTomate, !
16:21 < o_be_one> hi all
16:22 <@deen> hi
17:17 <@deen> brainfuck was a great choice :D
17:17 <@deen> now I'm writing an interpreter as well a a compiler in the guide
17:40 < CookieMichal> Hello deen
17:40 < CookieMichal> I have a problem
17:40 < CookieMichal> Someone fakes me on ddnet servers
17:40 < CookieMichal> After many tries, he still won't change name
17:41 < CookieMichal> Can you do something? (Like ban for week or something? :))
17:41 < CookieMichal> heinrich5991: maybe u can do something? :<
17:42 < CookieMichal> anyone?
17:42 < CookieMichal> ;-;
17:48 < CookieMichal> He left.
17:52 < o_be_one> CookieMichal, what server it was ? GER ?
17:52 < CookieMichal> GER, Currently brutal, port 8338
17:52 < o_be_one> oh ok i think i cant log in on these
17:52 < CookieMichal> :/
17:53 < o_be_one> ah yes i have rcon access
17:53 < o_be_one> you can tell me too next time you meet a problem like this
17:53 < o_be_one> i have just no hand on blocker map
17:53 < o_be_one> but we dont do ban for that, we can talk with him
17:54 < o_be_one> ddnet is a "friendly" mind, we try to make all people happy in a fair environment, it's hard but we trust in this
17:54 < CookieMichal> mhm
17:55 < CookieMichal> I will remember :)
17:55 < CookieMichal> Thanks :)
17:57 < o_be_one> np

18:01 < BeaR_> good girl, nimda \o
18:02 < CookieMichal> =D
18:02 < CookieMichal> !de-en I like cake.
18:02 < Nimda> Translation: I like cake.
18:02 < CookieMichal> !en-de I like cake.
18:02 < Nimda> Translation: Ich mag Kuchen.
18:24 < BeaR_> proc `host=`*(s: var Socket, value: int) {.inline.}
18:24 < BeaR_> well that's interesting! ^^
18:49 < EastBite> BeaR_: studying nim?
18:50 < BeaR_> quickly looked over the two tutorials ^^
18:50 < BeaR_> pretty short in comparison to the amount of features tbh /:
18:51 <@deen> indeed, the tutorial needs to be extended
18:52 <@deen> but everyone is busy writing their own tutorials :P
18:52 < BeaR_> :p
18:52 < BeaR_> well I finall understood the template log example you posted on your blog ^^
18:52 < BeaR_> finally*
18:52 <@heinrich5991> link to blog?
18:53 < BeaR_> hookrace.net
18:53 < BeaR_> (deen removed it iirc)
18:54 <@deen> yes, caused too much confusion and is not that interesting
19:02 <@heinrich5991> In Nim I don't have to remember, because there is no difference.
19:02 <@heinrich5991> I like it when there's One way to do it™
20:30 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/public/videos/ctf5day.webm
20:30 <@EastByte> east is back :3
20:30 <@EastByte> that's the well known ubu jump I think
20:32 <@deen> nice
20:42 <@EastByte> deen: I pulled/fetched the official teeworlds repository on a vps but there aren't all tags in there
20:42 <@EastByte> do you know what's the problem?
20:42 <@EastByte> 0.6.3 is missing for example
20:42 <@deen> no idea
20:43 <@EastByte> hm
20:43 <@EastByte> then I'll clone it again
20:46 <@EastByte> nice to have all servers connected in a vpn
20:46 <@EastByte> stuff like econ is safe to use :)
20:49 < eeeee> you can also always econ over ssh - always safe
20:50 <@EastByte> yup, ssh is powerfull
20:58 < o_be_one> !de-fr  SDL.h: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
20:58 < Nimda> Translation:  SDL.h: fichier ou répertoire introuvable
20:59 < o_be_one> heinrich5991, seen that you talk about this problem on github
21:00 < o_be_one> its 1.2 ok
21:00 < o_be_one> 1.2 dev would work no ?
21:00 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:00 <@heinrich5991> I think you need the old stuff in-tree
21:00 <@heinrich5991> I think Learath2 had a way to fix it
21:00 < o_be_one> ty
21:00 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: please feel summoned
22:29 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
22:32 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
23:17 < Learath2> heinrich5991: summoned what are we fixing
23:17 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one has problems with SDL
23:17 <@heinrich5991> you had some magic git command to fix IIRC
23:17 < Learath2> compiling 0.7 ?
23:19 < Learath2> o_be_one: for 0.7 ?
23:21 < Learath2> if thats the case "git checkout upstream/0.6 -- ./other" should do it
