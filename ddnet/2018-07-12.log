00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
00:29 <@heinrich5991> good night ^^
00:29 <@heinrich5991> I'm going to sleep
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> night heinrich
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good n8 bro
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> important dev info
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess ima tell u every day when i go to sleep in #dev now :p
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> no idea to where report this info so I leave it here: link to forum missed on ddnet.tw website
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing new
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen made that
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :GWvertiPeepoChrist:
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :GWseremePeepoThink:
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :GWworried: :Swordd:
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good night
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> gn
08:43 <@deen> anyone who can disable the discord bridge? don't really need the discord spam in here
08:44 <@deen> heinrich5991, Learath2 ^
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I disabled write-access to this channel for everyone without the dev role
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should help keep spam down while allowing people without IRC to interact with developers
10:58 <@deen> When servers get DDoSed and players can't join GER and RUS, they think it might be the fault of their client and finally update it :D (133 client updates yesterday compared to 50 two days ago)
12:52 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1201: Require DNSBL check on /modhelp (master...dd_pr_dnsblhelp) https://git.io/fNLCc
12:55 <+Learath2> deen: I think it's the rate-limiting of TKEN msg's we do but we also do the same ratelimiting on vanilla join packets (10000001), don't really get how it works
13:54 <@heinrich5991> test
14:00 < ***> Buffer Playback...
14:00 <+bridge> [13:59:00] [ddnet] <qshar> accounts :feelsamazingman:
14:00 <@heinrich5991> [13:59:45] you mean against /modhelp spam?
14:00 < ***> Playback Complete.
14:00 <@deen> Free server upgrade on ddnet.tw :)
14:00 <@heinrich5991> cool
14:00 <@heinrich5991> why?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I don't see the /modhelp spam, as I'm not a moderator. But I can imagine what is going on there. I mean if you are planning to develop accounts system - feel free to contact me, I can share about out result, issues that we solved etc.
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @qshar how you prevent other people claiming names they dont own
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /modhelp is currently turned off ^^
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I don't see the /modhelp spam, as I'm not a moderator. But I can imagine what is going on there. I mean if you are planning to develop accounts system - feel free to contact me, I can share about our result, issues that we solved etc.
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I'd say we succeeded to solve this question quite well. I don't want to describe the process in open channel, because I don't want anyone to try to avoid the system. But I can explain in pm for ddnet admins if they plan to do accounts as well
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my technical point of view there is no way to prevent it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "To verify this player please ask qshar on Discord or Forum"
14:10 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/fNLRK
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how many people play kog? do they all use accounts?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this seem unreliably for me at ddnet player base
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah the lower the player count the easier it is to verify ppl tbh
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> even tho i guess only a few names would get "trolled"  thus needing manual verification
14:36 <+Learath2> The way we were first thinking about accounts was steam-like accounts where points belong to accounts and names are unrelated. I'm pretty sure that's the only way to have points on accounts but it also implies that we need a new points system and people would need new records. Not really convenient.
15:09 <@deen> heinrich5991: they have a "July 4 sale" on nfoservers, so we get GER cheaper and can upgrade ddnet.tw at the same price I was paying already
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen only one time period or forever?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how much more power?
15:16 <@deen> forever
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> awesome
15:16 <@deen> two cpu threads instead of one
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sick
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can new useres get this sale?
15:17 <@deen> yes
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but the website looks weird .-.
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this a good/serious server hoster?
15:18 <@deen> no, it's a gaming thingy
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what doesn ddnet run on nfo? the website and some ger servers?
15:19 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/_includes/funding.html#L7-L15
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nice
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet = website i guess
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AV8XK/05bf10f5f1.png
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 10% double the cpu power? lul
15:24 <@deen> because previously we had the option for twice ram already even with single core
15:25 <@deen> which used to be cheaper than also getting 2 cores, but now not anymore
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> deen, this is interesting for us as well. Is this a kind of code that everyone can use or only for you?
15:40 <@deen> what?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @qshar nfo looks still pretty expesive bro
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> compared to servercompass
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and there u can get the chillersale as well c:
15:40 <@deen> the funding stuff? sure, that's just me writing js for the first time
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @ChillerDragon we use NFO for a very long time, our scripts are linked to their firewall.
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thoight u talk about sale code x
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thoight u talk about sale code xd
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Ye, I thought it is a sale code that everyone can use. Is it?
15:42 <@deen> yeah
15:42 <@deen> you can even change an existing server to be cheaper
15:42 <@deen> no need to upgrade
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nice. Where can I get this code?
15:43 <@deen> no code, just order: https://www.nfoservers.com/
15:43 <@deen> > 10% off base prices for 2+ core packages, for both new and existing customers. Head on over to our VDS order page now to check out the savings!
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Ah, yes I see it. Tnx
18:45 <+AmuCookie> Hey someone remember the mod name : it's another zombie mod where a random player was infected. And survivors had to race throught the map with door to block them until some time. They had to team up with super weapon to push zombie back until the door open and the main goal was to reach the end of the map.
18:45 <@deen> zesc?
18:46 <@deen> I really liked it
18:46 <+AmuCookie> Yes me too ^^
18:47 <@deen> This one I guess: https://github.com/BotoX/teeworlds/tree/zesc
18:47 <+AmuCookie> ty
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zombie escape is from counter strike
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it is actually a good idea because then people will have no excuse for using this cheat client
