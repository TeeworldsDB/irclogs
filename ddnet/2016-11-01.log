09:48 <+mrQ> Hi @all. Can you tell me what sv_connlimit and sv_connlimit_time are used for? I mean I know what they are doing, but are they useful in fighting vs spoofing, network stressing etc.
09:53 < EastByte> sv_connlimit 'Number of connections an IP is allowed to do in a timespan'
09:53 < EastByte> sv_connlimit_time 'Time in which IP's connections are counted'
09:54 < EastByte> spoofed ips generally cannot connect so it only applies to legitimate ip addresses
09:56 < EastByte> ah and sv_connlimit_time is specified seconds
09:57 < EastByte> so, basically it only prevents someone from reconnecting too fast, not sure whether that falls under 'network stressing'
10:03 <+mrQ> ok, I got it, tnx!
16:46 <+qshar> hey! I'm trying to syncronize the Envelopes with the server time. I thought that "CMapItemEnvelope.m_Synchronized" does it, but looks like I'm wrong. Am I?
16:48 <+qshar> Is there an option not to reset time for Envelopes when you cross the start tile?
17:17 <+qshar> ok, I'll write about it on forum
