11:23 < bridge> <teero777> nice naming

14:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> is the ai bubble finally popping?
14:15 < bridge> <teero777> Hope so
15:16 < bridge> <_qey> Is the player connection message block (3 messages) always sequential? Meaning, the first two ALWAYS ClientID + IP then chat message ALWAYS related to the previous message?
15:17 < bridge> <_qey> Can it ever somehow be two ClientID + IP messages in a row, and then two player join (with names) messages?

15:20 < bridge> <Assa> bad bot
15:20 < bridge> <DDNet> :(
15:20 < bridge> <_qey> Iâ€™m relying on storing the latest ClientID connected and assuming the next player name belongs to this ClientID.
15:27 < bridge> <avolicious> The clientId is not unique
15:27 < bridge> <avolicious> The clientId is not unique, to get the latest ID, there is a nextID value
15:28 < bridge> <_qey> I know itâ€™s reusable. I created an external monitoring tool based on log entries.
15:28 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh oke
15:28 < bridge> <avolicious> based on econ?
15:29 < bridge> <avolicious> or based on log parsing?
15:29 < bridge> <_qey> Parsing the log file.
15:29 < bridge> <avolicious> Maybe you can take a look into econ
15:30 < bridge> <_qey> I did. Donâ€™t like it.
15:31 < bridge> <_qey> Log parsing + FIFO input.
15:33 < bridge> <_qey> That wasnâ€™t the question to begin with. The question is whether there could possibly be two logs laying on one another due to some kind of race condition, or is it synchronous?
15:45 < bridge> <avolicious> synchronous
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> which pr did fix flicker of tees when spectating?
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> i remember it beting a thing and randomly stopped happening
16:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the spec_cam flag
16:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think
16:11 < bridge> <kebscs> Nice
16:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis: i thought it broke something again and you are asking why
16:13 < bridge> <kebscs> Just curious how it worked because i miseed it being added
16:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it was just viewpos being updated to the top left corner because server dosen't know input type. now that server knows, it can just.. not do that.
16:13 < bridge> <kebscs> But it's a nice qol
17:07 < bridge> <ar1gin> is there anything being done about these? they are more and more frequent

20:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> gotta tell the ddnet staff
20:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @_qey there is an open issue for that https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7876
20:27 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and no it is not ALWAYS that exact sequence @_qey but the order should be the same. It just can happen that there is another line between
20:29 < bridge> <_qey> Unless thereâ€™s another line in between that says player name, Iâ€™m okay with it.
20:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> as far as i know there can be any line between
20:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but not 100% sure
20:30 < bridge> <_qey> If it goes in the same order, then itâ€™s okay. I mean, as far as I observed logs, I havenâ€™t seen it once.
20:30 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its rare
20:30 < bridge> <_qey> Well, rare things happen, even bits are flipping, nothing you can do about it.
20:31 < bridge> <_qey> If one person is banned instead of another because of this rare error, itâ€™s still okay.
20:32 < bridge> <_qey> My monitoring tool is now proven to be effective against spammers and those like to insult family members.
20:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> cring who bans insulting family members of staff
20:33 < bridge> <_qey> I donâ€™t ban. I mute. Now staff, everyone.
20:33 < bridge> <_qey> I donâ€™t ban. I mute. Not staff, everyone.
20:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> Ok thats better!
20:34 < bridge> <_qey> However, regular people are still getting banned for sharing their username. Again, thereâ€™s no way to differentiate. Maybe implement some kind of threshold, like if the person spams as soon as they join, then ban. If the person is playing for 5 minutes, then no ban.
20:34 < bridge> <_qey> But Iâ€™m too lazy.
20:35 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> I quickly grepped some of my logs and found 54522 occurences of ``2025-03-18 14:23:21 I server: player has entered the game. ClientId=2 addr=<{2.2.2.2:222}> sixup=0``
20:35 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not being followed by ``2025-03-18 14:23:21 I chat: *** '22222' entered and joined the game``
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> many of those were from another thread the sql worker thread
20:36 < bridge> <_qey> Was it eventually followed by that line?
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes that should be guranteed
20:36 < bridge> <teero777> If anyone needs this ever
20:36 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/Teero888/ddnet_ghostloader_c99
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> eh wait
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no not guranteed xd
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it might never be printed in some edge case when a player drops during connection iirc
20:36 < bridge> <_qey> Iâ€™m reading line by line, I donâ€™t care about other lines that do not say another playerâ€™s name.
20:36 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but its not printed in a different order
20:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ok then you should be good!
20:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats how i have been parsing it as well for years!
20:37 < bridge> <_qey> Drop = leave? In case of a leave ID is released.
20:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes
20:37 < bridge> <_qey> In my tool.
20:37 < bridge> <_qey> So there should be no confusion.
20:38 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a way to become less lazy?
20:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> cool stuff @teero777 even if only sus use cases come to my mind
20:39 < bridge> <_qey> I have so many great ideas, yet Iâ€™m too lazy to implement them. And as somebody told me here, nobody is going to implement it for me.
20:39 < bridge> <teero777> im making a ghost to demo thing xd
20:39 < bridge> <teero777> so you can all your ghosts in one demo
20:39 < bridge> <teero777> to render ghosts
20:39 < bridge> <teero777> its gonna be hard tho xd
20:40 < bridge> <teero777> i might have to use some illegal techniques to get this to work xd
20:41 < bridge> <_qey> As the saying goes, if it ainâ€™t broke, donâ€™t fix it. So illegal techniques are okay. Half of my code consists of workarounds.
20:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That doesn't sound very maintainable...
20:41 < bridge> <_qey> Thatâ€™s why my code is closed-source.
20:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :kek:
20:43 < bridge> <_qey> I have likeâ€¦ 2 or 3 public repositories. Those are maintainable, but theyâ€™re boring because they donâ€™t contain any workarounds.

20:44 < bridge> <_qey> Heckermen
20:44 < bridge> <_qey> I have a 3-letter username on GitHub. Something to brag about.
20:45 < bridge> <teero777> no i mean like code that is close to ddnet cheat client code xdd
20:45 < bridge> <teero777> like for example the ghost file only consists of 25tps snaps aka the position of the tee and some params. i would need to simulate the game to figure out positions of other entities such as grenades, laser, shotgun etc. to make a proper demo. a demo also includes inputs that means i have to bruteforce the inputs to match the snaps in the physics to then put 25tps inputs back into the demo afterwards. this code would literally allow people to clone
20:47 < bridge> <_qey> Someone will take it and make a bot out of it somehow.
20:47 < bridge> <teero777> haha it's C99 i'll just make it unreadable as hell
20:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wonder if we can have a new demo format which contains enough information to make it play like a demo, but not enough to trivially copy it
20:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just all entities positions and properties to make them show correctly
20:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you could even round everything a bit to make it harder to brute force
20:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is better than a ghost for sharing and better than a demo as well its sharable with less risk
20:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this format could be derived from demos (or even just be stripped down demos, same format, idk how much data you can get rid of before playback gets funky) and used for sharing top rank replays
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> what? this is already the case
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> you can't trivially replay a demo
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> you can't trivially replay a demo ingame
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> you can't trivially replay inputs from a demo ingame
20:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought you had velocity and everything you get from the server (at 50tps)
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> no
20:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and no rounding
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> 25tps
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> you're missing half the states
20:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the 50tps just prediction and server side?
20:52 < bridge> <teero777> yes
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oke
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you increase tps to 100 is it then 50 thru the net
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or always 25
20:52 < bridge> <teero777> ? xd
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by changing the constant on both server and client
20:52 < bridge> <teero777> should me SERVER_TICK_SPEED/2
20:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> it should be sent every 2 ticks
20:53 < bridge> <teero777> should be SERVER_TICK_SPEED/2
20:53 < bridge> <teero777> *every second tick
20:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
20:53 < bridge> <teero777> mb i cant read
20:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do demos contain velocity
20:54 < bridge> <patiga> yes
20:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is velocity used, could it be removed
20:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and then positions rounded making it extra doobly hard to reverse them
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> yes it is used
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> and its important bruh
20:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cant you figure out velocity from position
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> no xd you only have 25tps bro
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> demo format isn't bad
20:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do something to the velocity idk x-x
21:03 < bridge> <teero777> NO
21:03 < bridge> <teero777> bro
21:03 < bridge> <teero777> racers need the velocity in the demo
21:04 < bridge> <teero777> imagine you want to check and compare different runs of you on a map and the velocity is just randomized by a little bit
21:04 < bridge> <teero777> that would be so bad
21:04 < bridge> <teero777> @sollybunny DO NOT touch the demo format
21:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ðŸ‘€
21:05 < bridge> <teero777> @sollybunny **DO NOT** touch the demo format
21:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do you wana add #
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> Demos are not how they are sharing the ranks
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> @sollybunny #**DO NOT** touch the demo format
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> @sollybunny # **DO NOT** touch the demo format
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (at the start)
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> #@sollybunny **DO NOT** touch the demo format
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> # @sollybunny **DO NOT** touch the demo format

21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (at the start with a space, there we go)
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for public demos, isnt a concern that they are play backable to some degree, making that as hard as possible for automatically public demos, means other than people wanting to keep their secrets, theres not any reason to not do so
21:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> but they have to rework the demo nameplates!
21:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> [Pepe_TradeOffer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/854897570949103617.gif?size=48&animated=true&name=Pepe_TradeOffer)
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> if it alters the reality of the demo that is a pretty good reason not to do so. and if it doesn't then it's still not trivial to compute the missing inputs
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> and duplicate ranks are very obvious
21:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if the positions or velocites are wrong, then you have to do alot more work
21:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but theyre a pain to deal with
21:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> solly you should fix #6138
21:11 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6138
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> yea @sollybunny get to work
21:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> stop thinking about ridiculing the demo format
21:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why youre so # **against** it
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> im against it because it makes my demos innacurate
21:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> vro tried to make a header in the middle of a sentince
21:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well i dont want any of it to be big /:
21:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> #against now trending on twitter
21:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sigh
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> sigh
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> a space
21:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sigh
21:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can always share your demos or more accurate videos, its just for public ones
21:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if there are public ones therell probably be a way to opt out
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> ðŸ‘† _touch_
21:14 < bridge> <teero777> yea you're making any demo inaccurate. that means that you cannot prove than any demo is real
21:14 < bridge> <teero777> i could be making a demo with fake physics and no one could ever confirm its real or fake
21:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but you could also make a tas which is exactly the same as a demo collected from a server
21:15 < bridge> <Assa> we are in desperate need of a validation feature and the demo needs to track inputs
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> haha and why would you do that if you have the power to do 500x better ranks than any r1?
21:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the authenticity is garunteed by ddnet, i dont want the demo fucker-ifier to be public or be used other than for public automatic demos from servers
21:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the authenticity is garunteed by the server, i dont want the demo fucker-ifier to be public or be used other than for public automatic demos from servers
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> it does track inputs :x just at 25tps
21:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the server can show fake records all it likes, but ddnet probably wont nor will it provide fake fuckified demos
21:16 < bridge> <Assa> can't I reverse engineer the inputs from a legit demo anyway?
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> guaranteed by my own server/software?
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> xd
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> you could
21:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what?
21:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by them being on a server not controlled by you
21:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and that server being part of a trusted community
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> and then someone reports that their finish didn't get recognized by the server and posts a demo
21:17 < bridge> <Assa> aks nether for demo of run -> reverse engineer -> playback inputs -> profit (& ban)
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> what do you do then lmao
21:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont understand
21:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if a finish didnt get recognised and they have a demo because their client recorded it (in full quality) thats fine
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a glitch unrelated to demo fuckifying
21:18 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> i finally deleted DDnet
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> congratulations
21:18 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> thx
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> nice
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> would you like your refund?
21:18 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> the question is
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> very #developer of you to let us know that you deleted ddnet
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people could always post full demos
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no ones stopping them
21:19 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> will you put me into dd basement?
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> @sollybunny you could make a demo fuckifying tool to fuck demos with an external tool so you can post them
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> that would be fine
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no ones stopping them, and i dont want to stop that, i dont want the client to record fuckified demos, nor the server to record only fuckified demos
21:19 < bridge> <Assa> I will put you on the ddcross
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> but dont alter the normal demos
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody has time for that
21:20 < bridge> <teero777> deen recently locked it due to some incidents. it will probably open in a few months. come again then
21:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for the purpose of releasing demos without allowing ye olde shitbag to try to recreate it (without the compute and/or effort  to just tas it), i do not see the problem with fuckifying them, since the demos being released in whatever quality is more than we get now

21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> omg
21:21 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> wAT
21:21 < bridge> <teero777> yes you can fuckify them as an optional post processing effect for players to protect their runs from possible hackermans
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for the purpose of releasing demos without allowing ye olde shitbag to try to recreate it (without the compute and effort to just tas it), i do not see the problem with fuckifying them, since the demos being released in whatever quality is more than we get now (nothing), and people can still post videos and full demos as they are doing now

21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> releasing demos from servers automaticlly
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for releasing demos from servers automaticlly
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont want to be on the cross

21:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for releasing demos from servers automaticlly whilst protecting against possible hackermans
21:22 < bridge> <teero777> yes that would be fine.
21:22 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> why not
21:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats all ive been suggesting
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> with a demo validation we could also do an input hash and catch replays
21:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ):<
21:22 < bridge> <teero777> okay, good solly. i can solve them anyways :bleh:
21:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :pepeW:
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it kinda hurts
21:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it always does the first time
21:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> some people arent strong ðŸ¦¾
21:26 < bridge> <annyonghaseyoitstella> ðŸ˜€
21:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a demo format that would be annoying to reverse: represent the movement of tees as a series of curves, fitting as long of a stretch of time as you can on each curve
21:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also very good for compression!
21:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> any way of describing files as a series of things with lesser and lesser magnitude is a good fit for lossy compression
21:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> any way of describing data as a series of things with lesser and lesser magnitude is a good fit for lossy compression
21:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> obvious first thought was cubic beziers (because everyone uses those for everything) but with knowledge of the game we could probably try to find a type of curve that fits Teeworlds movement better
21:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> of course nobody is going to implement this because it's way too much effort for way too little value
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just making everything fixed point 16bits for 50% space saving
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having full mouse direction is a waste you only need like 1024 directions
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having full mouse position is a waste you only need like 1024 directions
21:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the demo format I would've gone for if I was originally designing the game: literally just store all the inputs and nothing else
21:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> exceedingly easy to replay bot lol
21:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> well, initial state too if the demo doesn't start from map load
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats actually harder because teeworlds doesnt work without a server
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or relies on the server
21:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yes
21:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the demo player would just be a server lol
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the demo player is just a server
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it just subs in the demo data for the server
21:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it just subs in the server with demo data
21:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for my format you'd run a full server that reads in the demo file instead of doing networking for player inputs
21:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the client doesnt know what the server is doing
21:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if network conditions arent perfect then storing just inputs breaks instantly
21:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which actually isnt that hard... i just used to have shitty internet so im huffing copium
21:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> teeworlds do be a bit funny in a number of ways...
21:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> perfect networking conditions being not a single lost packet and consistent ping
21:51 < bridge> <teero777> :wq
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a way to exclude terms from the server browser search? the game's ping estimates always put Brazil at the top of my browser despite me having as much ping to there as I do GER servers lol
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i could just connect to the servers & have the browser cache the ping but i found that doesn't persist
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i could just connect to the servers & have the game cache the ping but i found that doesn't persist
22:13 < furo> There is an exclude filter under the search input. If that's what you are asking for?
