08:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Who is the original author of vi, which vim is based on
10:26 < ChillerDragon> I am thinking about giving variables a try for chillerbot-ux as in you can read out the value of a config variable and pass it to a console command such as `echo $player_name`
10:26 < ChillerDragon> would this get chillerbot-ux blacklisted as a cheat client?
10:28 < ChillerDragon> there is probably no git config surface free way of doing it anyways probably will not do it 
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Please do it
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬

10:42 < ChillerDragon> jopsti i love your approach to sabotage my 0.7 development. Instead of hating on me doing 0.7 you are just very supportive of EVERYTHING else i do. It causes such a good atmoshphere.

11:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> put bots on ur 0.7 client

12:48 < bridge_> <cipy29> I wonder how well his debugger works in practice, definitely made me curious
12:48 < bridge_> <cipy29> Did you use it?
13:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> No I always watch talks to fool my self into being productive and never act on it. Only liveoverflow managed to get me to get active after watching his videos \:)

13:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> help
13:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> my game instantly crashes when i turn off entities in this random map called blmapv7 i found in a server
13:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137712048797646928/DDNet_win64-steam_crash_log_2023-08-06_13-37-34_6952_29ec71ad337d3e48730ac45023dc427c8af4f173.RTP
13:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i can open the map in the editor completely fine though
14:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Please send the map
14:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> oh yeah oops
14:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137728437604323410/BlmapV7.map
14:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks
14:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> Works for me with Vulkan. Try updating your AMD driver. If you are using beta, switch to stable release instead. Or try the other way around.
14:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> I only noticed in the map that one of the external images cannot be found
14:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you try changing this image to something else and test if that still crashes if you use the modified map on a local server?
14:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137729751105159209/image.png
14:51 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i tried opengl rn and it only crashes on vulkan i guess
14:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> Or removing the image entirely would also work to test I guess
14:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137729941706915880/image.png
14:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then we could figure out if it's something we can prevent or if it's a bug in the AMD driver
14:54 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> yup doesnt crash if i change the image
14:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks for the info
