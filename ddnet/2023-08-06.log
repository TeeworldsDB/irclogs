10:26 < ChillerDragon> I am thinking about giving variables a try for chillerbot-ux as in you can read out the value of a config variable and pass it to a console command such as `echo $player_name`
10:26 < ChillerDragon> would this get chillerbot-ux blacklisted as a cheat client?
10:28 < ChillerDragon> there is probably no git config surface free way of doing it anyways probably will not do it 
10:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Please do it

12:48 < bridge_> <cipy29> I wonder how well his debugger works in practice, definitely made me curious
12:48 < bridge_> <cipy29> Did you use it?
13:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> No I always watch talks to fool my self into being productive and never act on it. Only liveoverflow managed to get me to get active after watching his videos \:)

13:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> my game instantly crashes when i turn off entities in this random map called blmapv7 i found in a server
13:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137712048797646928/DDNet_win64-steam_crash_log_2023-08-06_13-37-34_6952_29ec71ad337d3e48730ac45023dc427c8af4f173.RTP
13:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i can open the map in the editor completely fine though
14:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> Please send the map
14:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> oh yeah oops
14:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137728437604323410/BlmapV7.map
14:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks
14:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> Works for me with Vulkan. Try updating your AMD driver. If you are using beta, switch to stable release instead. Or try the other way around.
14:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> I only noticed in the map that one of the external images cannot be found
14:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you try changing this image to something else and test if that still crashes if you use the modified map on a local server?
14:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137729751105159209/image.png
14:51 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i tried opengl rn and it only crashes on vulkan i guess
14:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> Or removing the image entirely would also work to test I guess
14:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137729941706915880/image.png
14:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then we could figure out if it's something we can prevent or if it's a bug in the AMD driver
14:54 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> yup doesnt crash if i change the image
14:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> Thanks for the info

18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's my next clickbait commit
18:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Pog
18:15 < bridge_> <robyt3> We could probably fix it with an `#ifdef` if it's a problem
18:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Most windows users that try Linux use Ubuntu 12 for whatever reason
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think even chairn uses ubuntu 22 now
18:16 < bridge_> <deen> Let's wait and see, don't want to waste effort
18:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So we should be fine xd
18:58 < ChillerDragon> ah it back
18:59 < ChillerDragon> 50M incoming traffic is ddos isnt it? my internet is trash but not that bad
19:00 < ChillerDragon> oh o i timedout
19:01 < ChillerDragon> i spammed /save but didnt go through :c
19:02 < ChillerDragon> pog it stopped
19:02 < ChillerDragon> seeing live server stats on https://ddnet.org/status/ is very cool!
19:05 < ChillerDragon> ohno
19:05 < ChillerDragon> blazingly new fonts are invisible for me
19:05 < ChillerDragon> idk why i decided to merge while being timouted xd
19:06 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> good update
19:09 < ChillerDragon> i thought its new linux kernel or sumsin but i rebooted and the issue stayed
19:09 < ChillerDragon> lemme try ddnet without chiller hax
19:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> Any error in the console?
19:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe you are missing the font index file or the fonts
19:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> Because existing fonts were also renamed
19:10 < ChillerDragon> oh ddnet works
19:10 < ChillerDragon> so its a me issue
19:10 < ChillerDragon> there is a index file ?
19:11 < ChillerDragon> ah ok lemme make install
19:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> i always wondered
19:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> why do text atlases have different sized characters
19:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you render only one size and then up/downscale it wouldn't look good
19:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> If we used SDF we would only need one size I think but I haven't looked into how that works
19:14 < bridge_> <Voxel> ahh
19:16 < ChillerDragon> how is the font index file called?
19:16 < ChillerDragon> data/fonts/index.json?
19:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> yes
19:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> maybe you ignore it in your gitignore
19:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> previously it ignored all .json files
19:16 < ChillerDragon> i just dont have it system wide
19:17 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1691342302.png
19:17 < ChillerDragon> do i need anything else?
19:18 < ChillerDragon> do i also need to add some new fonts?
19:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, you need to make sure that the filename of the fonts match
19:18 < ChillerDragon> ok lemme mv data from the build dir then
19:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> The fonts were updated and some were renamed
19:19 < ChillerDragon> oh yikes that have me a full on blackscreen xd
19:20 < ChillerDragon> guess im starting my client from the build folder until ddnet 17.2 released and my package manager sets up the system files
19:20 < ChillerDragon> thanks for the info tho robsti
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh interesting
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does it cause the black screen in #bugs too? @robyt3 can u check, wats is Russian. Maybe some files are missing or smth
19:26 < bridge_> <robyt3> In don't know how this would cause a black screen. I can start the client fine with absolutely no files except the `.exe` and `.dll`s.
19:27 < ChillerDragon> i mean i clearly messed something up with the data dir
19:27 < ChillerDragon> if i delete the data dir i just get a black screen
19:27 < ChillerDragon> that used to be the all colorful one which was at least playable
19:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well I dunno, was random thought
19:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you send console log with `loglevel 2`?
19:29 < bridge_> <ikizuu> anyone know how to fix this when using cmake?
19:29 < bridge_> <ikizuu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137799535150768239/cmake_compile.txt
19:29 < bridge_> <ikizuu> missing a lot of stuff
19:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> Did you forget cloning the submodules? Do `git submodule update --init --recursive`
19:30 < ChillerDragon> pog i got the url DD
19:30 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/DD
19:31 < ChillerDragon> this is loglevel 2 of selfcompiled ddnet master on GNU/Linux gnome with no relative or absolut data dir available
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He uses OpenGL
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that makes a difference
19:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What are u even using without data dir @robyt3 .. shouldn't it only work with like OpenGL 1 which uses no shaders
19:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> Ah, looks like it falls back to OpenGL 1 without data dir
19:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe the fallback doesn't work for everyone
19:36 < bridge_> <ikizuu> oh yeah it works now thanks sir
19:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> I also get the black screen on launch when starting with OpenGL 3.3
19:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> When starting with Vulkan it successfully falls back to OpenGL 1, any with OpenGL 1 it "works"
19:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> I also get the black screen on launch when starting without data dir with OpenGL 3.3
19:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Guess the VK error handling is simply better
19:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For this soefici case
19:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Data dir must exist elitist
19:40 < bridge_> <ikizuu> @robyt3 now it says Access denied when i try to run it in vs
