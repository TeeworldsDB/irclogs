00:00 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> Can DDNet client connect to 0.7 servers?
00:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, currently not
00:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> @chillerdragon i cant believe it, someone's interested
00:04 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> lol
00:36 < bridge_> <Alexander> Chillerdragon so happy rn
00:56 < bridge_> <mei.s> from github
00:57 < bridge_> <mei.s> XD
00:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but how did you download it? which button did you press? can you make a screenshot?
01:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There is a open pr by me. If you compile it your self you can play 0.7
01:48 < bridge_> <mei.s> i downloaded
01:48 < bridge_> <mei.s> you know
01:48 < bridge_> <mei.s> CMake Error at cmake/BuildVulkanShaders.cmake:27 (message):

01:48 < bridge_> <mei.s> im taking this right now
04:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> init the ddnet-deps submodule

05:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> muahahaha
06:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> ryo are u using LVM at all
06:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think i will use it for my raid
07:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> should i use systemd or gentoo's thing
07:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^ xd
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye im using lvm
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i recommend openrc
07:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am pretty used to systemctl
07:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> is openrc's as good
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i was to
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> openrc is better
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u will see u just need to learn 2 commandd and its even simpler
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ask @learath2
07:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> sweet
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway ur using Linux so rtfm
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> r u with gentoo already
07:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
07:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> am i with it
07:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> what u mea
07:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> n
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u fine tune ur kernel or used genkernel
07:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> not there yet
07:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> downloading stage archive
07:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Developer channel be like:
07:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> 
07:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> windows question -> use Linux
07:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> 
07:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Linux question -> rtfm
07:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> what's up with the desktop profiles
07:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean
07:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is using gentoo
07:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so indeed rtfm
07:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read the handbook and follownit
07:45 < bridge_> <teero777> Infinite wisdom
07:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> tbh tfm has a lot of wisdom
07:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also its 7:45 i just woke up
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd not best time to answer :justatest:
07:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's late for me
07:46 < bridge_> <teero777> does time matter?
07:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> i had to build the computer and parts didnt arrive until 5 pm
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its fun
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> installing gentoo
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> unlike other distros where u click next
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u learn about linux
07:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol for mirrors we get 20000 in new york and 1 in utah
07:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> thankfully utah is the next state over
07:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
07:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> why can't CU or CSU host mirrors 😠
07:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> was gonna say smth and forgot
07:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> pro
07:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ewan
07:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> go full pro
07:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc there are minimal desktop profiles
07:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for tiled wms?
07:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use a twm
07:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh yea i remembered
07:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wanted to say portage, gentoo plg manager is the best in linux
07:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> better than pacman from arch
07:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wanted to say portage, gentoo pkg manager is the best in linux
07:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its true
07:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> teero try gentoo
07:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use flags are god
07:55 < bridge_> <teero777> I will sometime.
07:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also was a arch user
07:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and thought nah
07:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pacman too good
07:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fake
07:56 < bridge_> <teero777> haha you flexer

07:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> i tried tiling window managers
07:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> not for me
08:01 < bridge_> <teero777> try again
08:01 < bridge_> <teero777> till you suceed
08:01 < bridge_> <teero777> till you succeed
08:02 < bridge_> <teero777> they are very comfortable with many desktops
08:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's very unintuitive with how ppl design apps
08:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> confining an app to a section of my screen is not great
08:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> and modal/non-resizable windows still just float
08:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> also they all scale like shit. picom and its siblings are too stupid
08:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i need 150% fractional scaling which only GNOME can do properly at the moment
08:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> error failed to get a list of valid profiles
08:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> dope
08:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rtfm
08:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :monkaStop:
08:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use another mirror maybe
08:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use more than 1
08:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> note that ping doesnt matter that much for downloads
08:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its better to choose the best sv
08:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
08:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am r'ing t f'ing m

09:24 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
09:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^^ ty
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you know how to compile ddnet? Its here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sadly prs dont have artifacts so i have no windows build
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ah wait hack
09:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> on my fork its not a pr :D
09:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> hm also no artifacts there .\_.

09:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> here u go :) enjoy virus
09:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> please report bugs
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Prs should also have artifacts
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Was that changed?
09:40 < bridge> <matodor> removed 0.7 support
09:49 < bridge> <teero777> So much gap
09:49 < bridge> <teero777> I usually only have like 5px
09:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> mine is 15 xD
10:05 < ChillerDragon> oh wait they do jopsti
10:06 < ChillerDragon> it was gh bugging i guess
10:06 < ChillerDragon> it sowed a - on the artifact count earlier and there was no artifact section
10:08 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon u gonna revive vanilla and other pvp gamemodes with that pr :)
10:13 < ChillerDragon> thats what im hoping for but not sure if it works. but gotta try
10:14 < ChillerDragon> okay i made a proper ddnet 7 release now since heinrich refuses to review :D
10:14 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/ddnet7-client/
10:26 < bridge> <matodor> pls allow 0.7 to die 🥺
10:27 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Noooo
10:28 < bridge> <beautemps> Hey wonderful people o/ i first wanted to express my gratitude for the fantastic job you did with the new features implemented on ddnet and the editor lately. Really useful. thank you so much! 
10:28 < bridge> <beautemps> 
10:28 < bridge> <beautemps> I'd like to come back on the multiview. 
10:28 < bridge> <beautemps> I noticed, the camera movement sticks to the default zoom (10 i think). I tried to set the "cl_default_zoom 5" to get the frame bigger and somehow reduce the camera movements (especially the zoom which goes to crazy tho) but it seems that the multiview doesn't care about that what ever i set as default zoom. If i manually zoom- a few times before starting the rendering, despite the frame being bigger, the zoom strives to keep tees within the defaul
10:28 < bridge> <beautemps> 
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> In this example, i've a zoom set on 5 in the first frame, which is wide enough to get everything i want in the video. but on the second frame, it automatically zooms out pretty far away, as if it was considering the frame in the middle instead of the actual zoom i set before. 
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> 
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> 
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> An other thing about the multiview. When i pause the renderer. the camera keeps moving which makes an abrupt transition in the final video.
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> 
10:29 < bridge> <beautemps> This apart, the multiview feature is truly awesome thank you so much for implementing that :pepewithteddy:

12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I swear no human can write power shell without chatgpt
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's the weirdest shit language I've ever seen xD
12:16 < ChillerDragon> agree
12:22 < ChillerDragon> matodor is tru windows enjoyer
12:22 < ChillerDragon> using powershell and rewriting teeworlds in C#
12:26 < bridge> <matodor> im used stackoverflow \😁
12:34 < bridge> <matodor> true, because VALORANT anti-cheat works only on windows \😭
12:34 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon what's windows? I heard its used for gaming and other niche stuff
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon what's windows? I heard it's used for gaming and other niche stuff
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon I also heard its sometimes called `windoof `
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon I also heard its sometimes called `windoof`
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon I also heard its sometimes called `windoof` 😳
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how? make a screenshot of how you downloaded it
13:08 < ChillerDragon> if someone reacts with "?" to git submodule init command i always assume zip download
13:09 < ChillerDragon> the zip does not contain submodules
13:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it might be useful to report these well-thought out issues on github: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues. also @vy0x2
13:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I fail to see how it's hard to state how one downloaded something….
13:16 < bridge> <beautemps> i never stepped a foot on github. idk anything related D:
13:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not hard, I think. click "new issue" on that page, it'll prompt you to crete an account. afterwards you can choose a title and write some content text (you can just copy-paste your chat message)
13:25 < bridge> <beautemps> alright thx
13:33 < bridge> <robyt3> The issue about default zoom being reset should already be fixed in the latest nightly version (Steam beta)
13:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I think I actually wrote this myself, although I probably asked ChatGPT along the way 🙈  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/228d9967cbc7f30c3845d86144af96b6bb3f8ef3/scripts/send_named_pipe.ps1
13:42 < ChillerDragon> omg no
13:42 < ChillerDragon> there is powershell in ddnet code?!
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And that's how you stopped being a human
13:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I also wrote this before ChatGPT was available: https://github.com/Robyt3/RenderDOT
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/228d9967cbc7f30c3845d86144af96b6bb3f8ef3/scripts/send_named_pipe.ps1#L32
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this looks super suspicious
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the correct way to do this?
14:09 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not finding many usage examples, but it could be that calling `Dispose` instead of `Close` makes a difference. I can investigate this later.
14:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I think the script should also return a different error code when connecting to the pipe times out
14:29 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki rust is more bloat than java and ruby :P https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/100532/shortest-code-to-throw-sigill
14:30 < ChillerDragon> idk how i landed on that SO tryint to catch sigint
14:30 < bridge> <beautemps> i've that version and it's not fixed yet then. thanks for the answer, i'll wait for the next update :feelswarmman:

14:33 < bridge> <teero777> #7129
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> In my opinion this destroys the aesthetic
14:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7129
14:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in what way?
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> If many people join a server and form teams its always very satisfying to see the rainbow colors form. And it is rather a rare occurrence so I think the rainbow should be kept
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its hard to distinguish
14:40 < bridge> <mei.s> how can i
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please tell us how you downloaded the ddnet source code
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> show us a screenshot
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or tell us why you can't do that

14:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you clicked on "download zip"?
14:51 < bridge> <mei.s> yes
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> here, you can download ddnet-libs
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> put that folder into your ddnet folder
16:14 < bridge> <vy0x2> I will talk to Beautemps in dm and ask if we can enhance his experience, his description sounds like it is intended behaviour
16:14 < bridge> <vy0x2> Thanks for the ping.

16:22 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> Developers, please explain how hitboxes work in this game, and if there is a possibility to download them, please do so

16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What exactly do you want to have explained
16:25 < bridge> <cyberFighter> why the dummy is being pushed i guess
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And what the fck do u want to download lmao
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because he touches xdd
16:25 < bridge> <cyberFighter> probably like the hitboxes visualised?
16:26 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> how big TEE's hitboxes are, or rather how they are created, those hitboxes
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So u want source code?
16:27 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> XD
16:27 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> )))
16:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?xD
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> Probably this, there was a skin that does this iirc
16:28 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tbh i wanna know if tees have like 3 separate hitboxes (one for like unhook/hook tile collision, one for tee collision and one for hook/bullets) or does it work in a different way
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes there are multiple different
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Player player collision is 28 of 32 where 32 is the size if 1 tile
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Circle
16:30 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> like I want to know why Dammy's pushing me, I put him at .53 coordinates.
16:30 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> 
16:30 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> He's not supposed to touch me in any way, but visually... for some reason he did.
16:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tee collision is fatter than wall collision
16:31 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> for how long?
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think the problem in your video is stoppers allowing u to go into them
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rather than the collision itself
16:31 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> how big* (idk sorry for my eng)
16:31 < bridge> <learath2> You can try enabling fat skins, that's closer to what tee2tee collision hitbox is
16:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i didnt see the video so i immediatly expected another bot client lol
16:32 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1148626707922817156/image.png
16:32 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> I put it right before I showed the video.
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, fat skins are tee2hook sized, sorry
16:34 < bridge> <koid0600> i need to login how ?
16:34 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Koid, KoG server innit?
16:35 < bridge> <koid0600> yup
16:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://discord.gg/kog-king-of-gores-342003344476471296
16:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> follow steps in there
16:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> not our business 😛
16:35 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> What's the best skin to test this on? To be as accurate to the hitbox as possible.
16:35 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1148627584230371438/image.png
16:37 < bridge> <cyberFighter> im gonna just stupidly say like 0.2 tiles bigger than wall collision :troll:
16:38 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> TAHNK YOU❤️
16:38 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> XD
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Seems tee2tee collisions are 35px but a tile is 28px
16:39 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> tee2tee?
16:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> isn't a tile 32 px?
16:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tee to tile collision
16:39 < bridge> <teero777> a tile is 32...
16:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah makes sense xD
16:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tile is 32px, tee to tile collision is 28px
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> A tile is 32px, but a tee can move within a tile
16:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> thats why you can move inside a block
16:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> yes thats what im saying lol
16:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> Tees are 28px when considering collisions with the wall
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> 35px when considering collisions with other players
16:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> how big is it for hook/bullets
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> I'm reading that one now 😄
16:41 < bridge> <cyberFighter> a ok
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> 30px it seems
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> tees get fat  when they see another tee
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> life of a tee

18:22 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chillerdragon : how can i play on old chillerblock map?
18:22 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05RCkLxSkQg> this one
19:04 < ChillerDragon>  thats blmapchill -.- chillerblock sounds like chillblock which is another map xd
19:04 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps/tree/master/BlmapChill_versions some versions are in here
19:04 < ChillerDragon> @Anime.pdf if you need more versions you have to check the git history
19:07 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chillerdragon : i meant map on your servers, would like to stand 24/7 on my fav spot <333
19:07 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> watched your teeworlds 2019 yt video, now i want to afk there again
19:12 < ChillerDragon> ah yea i ran the old version on my server when someone requested it but reverted it back to latest
19:12 < ChillerDragon> name me a version number you like from that list and i can put it on
19:13 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> where flappy is not bugged
19:13 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> didn't you host both blmapchill and chillblock before?
19:14 < ChillerDragon> yea maybe one crashed idk
19:14 < ChillerDragon> flappy is bugged on all
19:14 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> dafuq
19:14 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i remember it worked back in 2019
19:14 < ChillerDragon> something broke i cba to fix it
19:15 < ChillerDragon> i merged a shitload of ddnet upstream into this bitsh
19:15 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> how do you see my stickers?
19:15 < ChillerDragon> i dont
19:15 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> skill issue
19:15 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :BLEHHHH:
19:16 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> well, if flappy is ded, then latest version is ok
19:17 < ChillerDragon> yea i gotta fix it someday
19:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> someday...
19:17 < ChillerDragon> when i finished promoting 0.7 
19:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> is flappy working on fokko's blmapchill?
19:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> steal it :notDraggory:
19:17 < ChillerDragon> ddnet++ flappy is broken
19:18 < ChillerDragon> fddrace flappy is working
19:18 < ChillerDragon> its more a server mod thing than a map thing
19:18 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> iirc you told me fokko made bots in ddpp, so they should be replaceable by each other?
19:19 < ChillerDragon> the codebases are somewhat similar yes
19:19 < ChillerDragon> i didnt look into the issue yet but i assume its not really in the actual flappy code
19:20 < ChillerDragon> more ddnet++ being so broken it broke physics to a degree where the bot cant move correctly anymore
19:20 < ChillerDragon> merging with ddnet codebase is a fulltime job
19:20 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> sounds like fun debugging
19:20 < ChillerDragon> indeed such fun
19:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
19:41 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://tenor.com/view/mauzimice-mauzymice-mauzy-mice-boykisser-cute-gif-16690839224429433467
19:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Thats exactly one reason why F-DDrace is closed source
19:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (people in general, not chiller obv)
19:42 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chiller kinda chill
19:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :think_bot:
19:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 gif
19:43 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> @fokkonaut also question, few days ago i saw someone talking about fddrace source, like he got it from somewhere, was that a bluff? are you developing it alone?
19:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I am developing it alone, yes. There is an old version public but it has many crashbugs and not many features xD
19:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> from before I went closed src again
19:45 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> if we don't count ddrace itself, most popular mods are closed source :poggers2:
19:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ofc
19:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz what people do with open src projects
19:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> says a lot about our society
19:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> noob argument
19:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao
19:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :BLEHHHH:
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> what did chiller do
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a reason u lost my respekt
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :cammostripes:
19:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> context not understood
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur mod is closed source regardless
19:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> like i need that right
19:47 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Im not arguing, but sometimes obsessiveness with all those licenses and stuff is weird
19:47 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> not pointing my finger
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but ill state it regardless
19:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont really care
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl have diferent ideals
19:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its so funny, because i already mentioned many times that it indeed will go open source again - just not yet
19:50 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> @ryozuki
19:50 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1148676446169092178/image.png

19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
19:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ppl have different interpretations (not pointing my finger)
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> interpretations and ideals
19:50 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> looks kinda unsafe
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @animepdf i agree with this ideals https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.en.html
19:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> a thing ppl dont understand is that unsafe in rust isnt inherently bad, its needed for some stuff
19:51 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> why do you even need rust if you don't use it's main feature, memory safety :troll:
19:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see it shows code from forks too
20:22 < bridge> <cyberFighter> can i have it
20:24 < ChillerDragon> omg does assembly do nullbyte termination watf?
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> assembly does nothing
20:25 < ChillerDragon> rite
20:26 < ChillerDragon> so it must be the bloat linux kernel i am syscalling into
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> exactly
20:26 < ChillerDragon> but in strace
20:26 < ChillerDragon> it shows it as empty parameter given
20:26 < ChillerDragon> isnt that asm?
20:26 < ChillerDragon> if i pass a bunch of nullbytes
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
