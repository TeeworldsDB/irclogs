00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i have no cable plugged into this adapter
00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the only active network adapter on my computer right now
00:06 < bridge> <Ewan> how the fuck am i talking in this chat
00:07 < bridge> <Ewan> how have i run 10 speed tests
01:03 < bridge> <zhn> don't remember if we had this here 
01:03 < bridge> <zhn> https://mmmds.pl/fuzzing-map-parser-part-1-teeworlds/
01:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Is there a way to filter tiles in a `CLayerTiles` struct? I know that `void CLayerTiles::FillGameTiles(EGameTileOp Fill)` exists, but is there a more general way to take one `CLayerTile` and only keep the tiles requested? For example, only keeping every tile that has an index of 1.
01:53 < bridge> <zhn> @heinrich5991 can you use @patiga's tool (https://mapview.patiga.eu/) instead of tw-webgl? eastbit doesn't work anymore
01:53 < bridge> <zhn> for this https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/web/
01:57 < bridge> <patiga> it wouldn't work that well :/
01:57 < bridge> <patiga> twmap is a little strict on parsing maps, and I haven't build a tool yet to apply general fixes to maps
02:00 < bridge> <patiga> ah I suppose it would be better than no webiste
02:02 < bridge> <patiga> @gerdoe you can already load the maps from the archive with mapview.patiga.eu like this: https://mapview.patiga.eu/?url=https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/Animations_c2aa2208a9f27fcfd8349f34cf1633c038c17bdedbc225c1cdd14d4ecc19c3c0.map
02:02 < bridge> <patiga> note that when the map parsing errors, you'd get a white screen and an error in the console
02:04 < bridge> <zhn> i know^^
02:04 < bridge> <zhn> also added bbcode for mapview on my forum
02:04 < bridge> <zhn> i'll move to my own instance tho, it's temporary
02:04 < bridge> <patiga> oh nice :D
02:04 < bridge> <zhn> should i somehow link you there?
02:05 < bridge> <patiga> I'm interested, yea :)
02:05 < bridge> <patiga> woah I'm tired. what I meant to say is that probably like 10% of those maps won't load (rough guess)
02:06 < bridge> <patiga> maybe more maybe less, haven't checked in a while
02:06 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, they barely open in editor, even
02:06 < bridge> <zhn> tons of maps with undefined images or just corrupted
02:06 < bridge> <patiga> yea :/
02:07 < bridge> <zhn> seems old maps are from 0.4 or 0.5, somehow they open in editor, but tilemaps are kinda messed
02:07 < bridge> <patiga> huh fancy ^^

10:58 < bridge> <learath2> I smell dev drama
11:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> where
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> I got mail about a merge, then a mail about a revert pr for that merge and 7 mails about comments
11:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> I thought that was expected
11:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :greenthing:
11:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> `you got mail`
11:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Patiga is there a backwards compatible way of storing more data per tile in maps. I was thinking about adding a redirect tile and it would be nice if the mapper could specify a port the tile is redirecting to. I mean yes it would work with map configs but is there something cleaner like for example how the speedup/switch data is stored.
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> its always new dev getting a feature fast
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fast merges always has been heinrich vs deen
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> depends on who is afk while the pr is opened
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i trained neural networks that predict deens and heinrichs afk times to get instant merges
11:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :nouis:
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if heinrich now starts reverting everything he missed i am in big trouble
11:23 < bridge> <tima08315> qq all

11:26 < bridge> <tima08315> qq all
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon you can fit 4 bytes in a tile, that's enough for not one but 2 ports even
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are refering to CTile i assume? I am not super sure how to interpret the whole thing. First I thought I only have one byte that is reserved in the CTile class.
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Then I thought the switch layer and so on somehow use more but no idea how that works
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then i got super confused when I saw the speedup layer clearly using more than 4 bytes
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d3442aa4207f7c78df5a5c478a4c35078e597059/src/game/mapitems.h#L241
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only one of then is reserved so if i start writing into the others older clients might interpret it wrong and everything explodes?
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and here the CSpeedupTile is using more than 4 bytes https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d3442aa4207f7c78df5a5c478a4c35078e597059/src/game/mapitems.h#L538-L545
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d3442aa4207f7c78df5a5c478a4c35078e597059/src/game/collision.cpp#L66-L71
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here it just reads the raw data and casts it to a CSppedupTile almost seems like you can store whatever share or form you want in maps without breaking backwards compatibility somehow
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, curious. I wonder if we ended up just versiongating it
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> Looking at the code a bit, I think it would only break the editor, curious
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> Though `sizeof (CTile)` is hardcoded in there when loading the map, weird
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I remember now, we store the tiles of our own physics layers completely separately
14:12 < bridge> <patiga> @tsfreddie I love your recap page, it looks awesome :owo: . could you make it possible to look back on recaps of past years? that would be neat!
14:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> done
14:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can figure it out how i'm sure
14:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> can't promise it won't break for other years tho
14:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i rejected 2025 and beyond just in case someone tries that and it cached the result for next year <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>

16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> remember to filtee out nameless tee and brainless
16:09 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
16:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the query seems completely wrong lmao
16:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm really not good at SQL

16:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> this should be more like it
16:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and it took over a minute to query oof
16:15 < bridge> <louis> so can i replace my kill tiles with these to send players to tutorial servers if they fail my parts? ðŸ¤£
16:16 < bridge> <louis> ah ye looks more correct
16:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ordered by percentage, the least replayed map is Flappy Bird with a whopping 0.0096% re-rank rate.
16:20 < bridge> <oxyzo.> to linear
16:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no sure if that is correct tho. that seems like a really replayable map

16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> SELECT m.Map, COUNT(*) as FinishesOnFirstDayOfRelease, m.Timestamp as ReleaseDate FROM race r JOIN maps m ON r.Map = m.Map AND unixepoch(r.Timestamp) - unixepoch(m.Timestamp) < 86400 AND unixepoch(r.Timestamp) - unixepoch(m.Timestamp) > 0 GROUP BY m.Map ORDER BY FinishesOnFirstDayOfRelease DESC LIMIT 10;
16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ```
16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> 
16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> Top 10 most popular maps on first day of release
16:33 < bridge> <patiga> that map has a special setting to not allow multiple ranks for the same name iirc
16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that make sense
16:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> there are three name that slipped through tho
16:34 < bridge> <patiga> maybe the map was changed ðŸ˜…
16:34 < bridge> <patiga> are the ranks on the three names old?
16:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> didn't check
16:34 < bridge> <patiga> eh not that important
16:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok it must be a clean up script
16:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1328387123824300092/image.png?ex=6786846a&is=678532ea&hm=76ad88b3af1ba3fc5d8f997fdf155335a8bd59204a7f84315975807a980998af&
16:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> these are really new
16:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> probably on some timer
16:36 < bridge> <patiga> huh interesting
16:37 < bridge> <louis> do u know why?
16:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> shouldn't dvd screensaver get the same treatment tho
16:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> my guess would be it being so easy to finish and it creates too many garbage records in the database.
16:39 < bridge> <patiga> yea
16:40 < bridge> <patiga> wat how did that message send
16:40 < bridge> <patiga> my guess is the same as freddies
16:41 < bridge> <patiga> flappy bird is a bit worse, as you can simply hold space and spam ranks that easily
16:41 < bridge> <patiga> might also be possible on dvd, not sure
16:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Some have been merged, but most not so far
19:09 < bridge> <learath2> Bug in rust????? Wow, useless language
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> no
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust is the best
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sqlx generally is getting more buggy the newer the lib xD
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 0.6 was best yet, but it has a vulnerable
19:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> In the code we check for time >=, and in a script we remove time > ðŸ˜„ Should probably fix it in the regular code
19:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> Also possible to finish on a server without a db connection at that time, will then later be inserted even if it might already be a duplicate
19:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ah
19:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> then it is amazing that this only happened 3 times it seems
19:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> nono, the script removes them
19:13 < bridge> <0xdeen> but I only started running the script recently
19:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> Oh, looks like the code was already correct.
19:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is the script a job that run on schedule
19:18 < bridge> <0xdeen> yeah
19:18 < bridge> <0xdeen> once a night
19:19 < bridge> <0xdeen> we have the same problem with team ranks
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Ikr
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Blessed i never had this bug
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i did get a nightly ICE that killed our coverage CI run and i now have to deal with it
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do u have coverage with nightly
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvmcov doesnt need nightly
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i recommend setting the nightly to a date u know works
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> we need it for #[coverage()] blocks
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> we have some runtime specific infrastructure that we canâ€™t really test so if we donâ€™t exempt those blocks our coverage is teriyaki
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> terrible XDD
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ig block isnâ€™t the word. function attribute or whatever
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i was gonna change our CI to use a pinned rust version
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> and or use nix but i havenâ€™t decided :justatest:
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> at that point we can try out fenix monthly so we can have nightly features but fewer windows for failure by only updating once a month
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> you build compiler. i build nightmare spaghetti SaaS-heavy tools thought up by big wigs in a boardroom

21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> is that the tiling assistant shell extension
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish it was better :feelsbadman:
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish ppl actually made gnome shell extensions but there are only like 3 good ones and when you enable more than that your desktop shits bricks anyway
21:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat nice!!
21:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it doesn't work with `common.h` from `ddnet_protocol` lib :feelsbadman:
21:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ohno why
21:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's all the booleans
21:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> they are declared in `common.h` and kernel stdlib header file
21:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shit
21:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just remove the typedef
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm planning to change `BLOAT` macro to be something like code space or something, so it will be either user space, or kernel space
21:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> new C has the bool keyword anyways
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```C
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #define KERNEL_SPACE 1
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #define USER_SPACE 2
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #if CODE_SPACE == KERNEL_SPACE
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> // blah blah
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #elif CODE_SPACE == USER_SPACE
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> // blah blah
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #elif !defined(CODE_SPACE)
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #error \
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     "CODE_SPACE is not defined. Define it to `KERNEL_SPACE` or `USER_SPACE`."
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #else
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #error \
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     "CODE_SPACE has invalid value, it must be `KERNEL_SPACE` or `USER_SPACE`."
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #endif
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
22:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How cursed is this?
22:16 < ChillerDragon> can we get a moderator on 45.141.57.31:8314
22:17 < bridge> <oxyzo.> we can, just dont want to
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller they want you to use the ticket system for that
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> create an account on one of the most unfree chat platforms so you can complain to moderators of an open source game ðŸ™ƒ
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> because a webpage is too hard
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> what are you making thatâ€™s going to be switching between kernel and user space depending on build config?
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> very cursed
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> > As an alternative the CHeap functions could be changed to return nullptr if the wanted allocation is too large, which would have to be handled explicitly when loading localization files.
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i would assert. when is a string that large ever valid in this case
22:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the lib user will have to set it themselves
22:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> lib users will have to set it themselves
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @milkeeycat what even is ur current project? i haven't really followed anything here xd
22:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> This one is a kernel module which would do something when a player connect a dummy
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> code conventions differ so strongly between codespaces that idk why youâ€™d need this
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> kernel panic
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> so itâ€™s a joke xD
22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> this one is trying to fix ddnet network lib I'm working on with chiller which I started because of kernel module xd
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> what is that check accomplishing for that goal
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> instead of blah blag it will include different header files
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> for what purpose
22:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to make the library be able to use necessary types and functions xdd
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> no like
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> the end goal
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> what are you calling differently
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> if ur doing kernel iâ€™d just keep that 100% isolated
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> but im also probably just not understanding
22:43 < ChillerDragon> defines lgtm @milkeeycat
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> what am i missing
22:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have a lib, I want it to be usable from user space and kernel space. To make it possible, I made `common.h` file https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet_protocol/blob/master/include/ddnet_protocol/common.h, `BLOAT` macro means whether to use glibc header files or define used functions as `extern` so they can be implemented the the code base where the lib is used. But it doesn't really work, because in my kernel module I use `linux/types.h` header
