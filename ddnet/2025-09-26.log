12:11 < G_> Test
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes please
12:12 < G_> Did it work?
12:21 < G_> IRC Rules These are the rules for #teeworlds on Quakenet:  Follow quakenet rules, you can find them at http://www.quakenet.org/faq/faq.php?c=136 Speak english, so everyone can understand what you say.

Don't advertise about other channels/goods/websites except if it
12:22 < G_> Oops
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon the javascript you posted is for meshgradiants in SVG2, doe we support SVG 2?
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> it's not even implemented by most browsers afaict
12:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well now we don’t
12:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t like it, neither does jupstar. So we ban it!
12:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Checking the svg version is also a good idea @essigautomat
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks can I get you to take a look at the quad clustering PR again?
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Some day
12:41 < bridge> <melon> real
12:41 < bridge> <Assa> so there's hope 🥲
13:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @scrumplex no way i randomly found an issue by you! I needed that xd https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/issues/2893
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> > Looks like this previously accessed out-of-bounds for ghosts, for which ClientId == -2. Using the default tuning doesn't seem correct for ghosts though. To correctly handle ghosts, we might have to determine in which tune zone they are when updating/rendering them. We should also handle ghosts differently than passing client ID -2 to the player rendering functions, or at least extract that into a constant.
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 what do I do about this? I don't get how this ever worked in the past
13:35 < bridge> <kebscs> ghosts have collision line?
13:36 < bridge> <Assa> yes, and you can crash the client with it
13:36 < bridge> <kebscs> ghost's hook doesnt even render
13:36 < bridge> <kebscs> why do they have collision line
13:36 < bridge> <Assa> yes, and you can/might crash the client with it
13:36 < bridge> <kebscs> should be deleted imo
13:37 < bridge> <Teero> lol
13:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Was this broken at some point? This is the code in ghost.cpp:
13:37 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> GameClient()->m_Players.RenderHook(&Prev, &Player, pRenderInfo, -2, IntraTick);
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> GameClient()->m_Players.RenderHookCollLine(&Prev, &Player, -2, IntraTick);
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> GameClient()->m_Players.RenderPlayer(&Prev, &Player, pRenderInfo, -2, IntraTick);
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like it was intended that hook and hook line are rendered
13:38 < bridge> <Teero> I've never seen a ghost hook ever
13:38 < bridge> <kebscs> same
13:38 < bridge> <robyt3> It's only a read access out of bounds so it might not crash because it accesses some valid value in the same structure
13:39 < bridge> <kebscs> hook could be fixed, collision line is useless for ghost
13:39 < bridge> <Assa> How/Can I get the tune zone of a ghost?
13:40 < bridge> <Teero> There are collision functions to get tunes at a position
13:40 < bridge> <kebscs> this would break with overridfe
13:40 < bridge> <kebscs> this would break with override
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> this would break as soon as we add tune locks btw,
13:40 < bridge> <robyt3> There definitely is ghost hook in version 16.9
13:40 < bridge> <kebscs> 16.9 👴
13:41 < bridge> <Teero> Yea, completely. The ghost format is pretty thin.
13:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** can someone explain github wikis to me? Why was I just able to edit and instantly publish this wiki? https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Change-of-default-CA-to-ZeroSSL
13:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how is that not dangerous?
13:43 < bridge> <Teero> cuz git.
13:43 < bridge> <Assa> yes totally, bad project settings probably
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> there is definately a ghost hook in 19.4, just no collision line
13:45 < bridge> <Assa> just tested it.
13:45 < bridge> <Teero> nice change chiller
13:45 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421100262927372380/Screenshot_20250926-134447.png?ex=68d7ce41&is=68d67cc1&hm=ccfe5c476c651c77df99ac797db17fd2d3f23614beab3b779d39e8f1c6022a7d&
13:45 < bridge> <robyt3> I suppose it never worked with the broken tuning value?
13:46 < bridge> <Teero> I'm relieved I'm not the only one who can't spell definitely correctly every time.
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> If there's no point to it, we can simply remove it, then the `RenderHookCollLine` function doesn't need to handle invalid client IDs at all (except by `dbg_assert` if you want)
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> Back to the question, how I can fix that at all, if I should just return on ClientId -2 or if we prefer default tunings
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Don't call `RenderHookCollLine` for ghosts
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Remove unnecessary client ID checks
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> What is clientId -1 btw? Because it has the same problem
13:47 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't look like `RenderHookCollLine` is called with any other invalid values
13:47 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't look like `RenderHookCollLine` is called with any other invalid client ID values
13:47 < bridge> <robyt3> So there's no need to handle that
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> Because, as of 19.4, it has a lot of code for other clientIds, I just wonder why it exists at all
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> I can just discard it all, nice
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> Because, as of 19.4, it has a lot of code for invalid clientIds, I just wonder why it exists at all
13:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless someone wants hook collision lines for ghosts and there was a past version in which it worked
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> idk why I'd ever want that
13:50 < bridge> <Assa> Any opposition? If not I am going to remove invalid client ids fully from the hook coll line
13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> isnt it for hook coll line preview in settings
13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> or is that coded differently
13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm maybe it is, i coded that
13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
13:55 < bridge> <Assa> I only find references in RenderPlayer and ghost.cpp
13:56 < bridge> <Assa> and you probably just render a CLineItem xD
13:56 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i think so if i remember correctly
13:57 < bridge> <Assa> okay looking into the ghost, the collision line could never have worked properly
13:57 < bridge> <Assa> it can't detect player collisions properly in the past
13:57 < bridge> <Assa> so the hook line would be dependend on the **current players**

18:31 < bridge_> <thrava> Oh I guess I have some entry point of this problem
18:32 < bridge_> <thrava> The sqlite downloaded from ddnet website haven't contain any primary key
18:33 < bridge_> <thrava> I'm stupid, I directly test on the downloaded ddnet.sqlite file with only change the table name to add record_ before its name
18:33 < bridge_> <thrava> I'm stupid, I directly test on the downloaded ddnet.sqlite file with only changing the table name to add record_ before its name
20:16 < bridge_> <kebscs> i did the same thing
20:16 < bridge_> <kebscs> is there a better way?
20:17 < bridge_> <thrava> You can just add a primary key
20:17 < bridge_> <thrava> or you just open ddnet-server.sqlite
20:17 < bridge_> <thrava> and copy the statement
20:18 < bridge_> <thrava> oh, this also mean you need a tool

21:02 < bridge_> <thrava> I wonder why the description of a vote was limited to be this short

21:16 < bridge_> <thrava> even if both the client and server recognize all of them to a same command, but because they won't execute any real function so it won't be a error then
21:17 < bridge_> <thrava> I haven't deep dived in the voting module so it's just what I'm thinking it possibly be
