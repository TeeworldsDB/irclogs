00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "free" as a word is awful, way too ambiguous. "open source" is so well defined, if the source is available it's open source, simple
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though of course the politically minded among us have destroyed that term by redefining it a billion times aswell
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should invent new words for these concepts that are more precise
00:42 <+fstd> LiBrE
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbf "libre software" is more precise than "free software"
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you are a free software proponent you might still be talking about "free" as in beer. If you are a libre software proponent I know you have a shrine to stallman in your closet
00:53 <+fstd> yes, yes
00:53 <+fstd> i can tell by a person's B/O whether they're going to say libre or not, tho
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol, 10/10 skill
00:59 <+fstd> in unrelated news i just accidentally pressed @ and put my whole inventory into a BoH
00:59 <+fstd> including another BoH
01:00 <+fstd> and the recovery trick no longer works so #quit >.>
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oof, boh in boh is such a sad fail
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, now that you remind me, I should play some nethack
01:07 <+fstd> doit
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i clean the stallman shrine every day with libre chemicals
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> librebleach?

01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki Did I tell you I actually saw stallman in person? Like not talk to him in person but saw him speak in Frankfurt

01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is his on my pc when I have haskell stuff installed on arch?
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> this
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably

01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nop, idk how haskell dependencies work though
02:11 <+SnowFox> deen: Re aus people. On the singapore server there are 3 of us :)
02:11 <+SnowFox> 100ms at least isn't so bad
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CUMMY> this is late but thanks for replying ig now we just wait for population ðŸ˜®
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CUMMY> ay chief is there any words about advertising this game or putitng in some microtransactions for advertising revenue?
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CUMMY> *screams in top 50 canada player
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CUMMY> "theres only 50 players in canada and playing 200ping euro race is kinda sickkk"
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> play on usa
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> devs wont add mtx
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its basically donation funded, only way this game would get advertised is if someone from community sponsored some streamer or yter to play it
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CUMMY> arent you a dev? or is it just deen
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im not a dev
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its open source, theres a bunch of devs who contribute small fixes and features etc
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> deen is like the main dev tho
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> deen is legend without who teeworlds already would have died
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Number of commits does not equal value of contribution. I do lots of small stuff, others work on larger topics

09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im in the first :poggers:
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> Btw TW will be 14 years old on 22.5.2021
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> @Ryozuki yeah but its funny how bors took over
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799552884902985798/unknown.png
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its a bot
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every pr is merged by it
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> yeah
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> but commit wise this is the ranking. But I think it's the same what github shows
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799553185026801684/unknown.png
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it hides bots
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> ah
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> But interesting you can see that ddnet is mainly developed in europe
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799553505933131796/unknown.png
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh: ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> but we might have known that already ðŸ˜„
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> and 2020 was by far the strongest year in development
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799553860640571402/unknown.png

09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> ok
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> git is so nice. you can see all this stuff
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well deen, heinrich and me are germans
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> + ryo who is spanish
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except gdin, is even anyone not from europe? xd
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok turkey might not count
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as europe
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie is from China
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh, does he also live there?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> currently yes
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok nice, then we have atleast one from far away ðŸ˜„
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :tee_thinking:
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i only see pictures from airports from u @TsFreddie thats why i wasnt sure xd
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> That was the flight to china :toptri:
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should stop rebasing my commits into a single commit
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it looks i do more
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799578041776078888/1610650680996s.png
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> half of my old commits are style fixes
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so devide it by atleast 2 xd
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> in vanilla I took out all the text and added them back one by one each commit
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen wait, cancel it, i think it should go above that break
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [2021-01-15 1202][storage]: failed to remove: /home/ryozuki/.teeworlds/ddnet-info.json.47679.tmp
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is fine but maybe is there a way to check
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the file exists?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt find any method on storage
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> open it and check if haandle is valid
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> virtual bool FindFile
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª did that
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen the pylint stuff breaks on the pr
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i found a fix for that
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```export CPATH="$CPATH:/usr/local/include:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include"```
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can I hire you to iron out the issues in cmake on macos?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i also had to comment out #include <Carbon/Carbon.h> and empty the tools/uuid.cpp and then it finally compiled server
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby does that get it to link to the system sdl?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk i was only compiling srv
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hey
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am trying to fix 0.7 chat messages when sent from a DDNet client on my server. 0.7 clients can only hold 128 character messages, ddnet has 256.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have made a little macro function and I really dont understand, how the ddnet client can pass through the bottom of the function, because there is a Sevendown check, which means its a ddnet client (0.6).
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #define SEND(id, flags) \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         do \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         { \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             if (Server()->IsSevendown(id) || str_length(Msg.m_pMessage) < 128) \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             { \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 dbg_msg("hi", "%d break", id); \
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 Server()->SendPackMsg(&Msg, flags, id); \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 break; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             } \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             { \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 char aTemp[128]; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 for (int pos = 0; pos < 128-1; pos++) \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 { \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                     char c = Msg.m_pMessage[pos+(i*128)-i]; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                     aTemp[pos] = c; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                     if (c == 0) \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                         break; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 } \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 aTemp[128-1] = 0; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 Msg.m_pMessage = aTemp; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 dbg_msg("hi", "%d sd: %d send %s", id, Server()->IsSevendown(id), aTemp); \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 Server()->SendPackMsg(&Msg, flags, id); \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             } \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             Msg.m_pMessage = aText; \
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         } while(0)```
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why is this a macro and not a function?!
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk i felt like it
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because i only need it inside of ::SendChat
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Make it an inline function if you *really* think the function call overhead will be bad
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its only defined inside SendChat
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but yeah a function might be better
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay thanks
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then you can also use return instead of confusing breaks
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will post the result soon
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if its working
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still not working
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and don't post code inline here please
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2021/01/msg00002.html
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the 0.7 client only prints one the first message
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > bullseye freeze started and its architectures
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Debian 11 inc
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> hesy
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> hey*
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> ich brÃ¤uchte hilfe hat jemand villt zeit?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @oklahoman english. just ask your question
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> I want to set up a teeworlds server at zap hosting get the right mod not set up he keeps changing to dm mod
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what mod? You need to download the correct modification
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> ddracenetwork new mod for new version
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that can't switch to DM mod. You should download the server from https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> is this for 0.7.2 ?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet runs based on Teeworlds 0.6, but supports 0.7 clients
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (assuming you have a maps7 directory with every map converted using map_convert_07
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> the problem he takes over the autoexec but not the server config that he changes the mod on ddnet
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok,now i understand. it's a gameserver prehosted by zap-hosting. that won't work with mods like ddnet
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could ask zap to provide ddnet servers
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can also host a server for free with https://trashmap.ddnet.tw/ if you just want to play occasionally with friends
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> I did it 2 years ago there too and since I could change the mod with the ftp access
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> @fokknaut admit that ur overhyped about macros since you found out about them lol 
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> @oklahoman yikes zap-hosting is not really having a good rep. I never had a tw server there and if you say it worked once to change mod it might still but meh..
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> @oklahoman ill host you a tw server for 1euro a month if you want :)
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait my current price is 2 euros might be not cheaper than zap idk
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm i can make u a better offer https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610729633.png
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> u can get as many slots as u want so for ddnet 64 or fddrace 128 + support for half the price of zaphostings 16 slots lul
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or buy vps for half of that price
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.netcup.de/vserver/vps.php
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> 2,69 > 2 and there is no teeworlds support :) and u have to do all the linux things ur self
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> also netcup not too good
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> i had plenty of lags there
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> and not too nice support
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i never have lags there
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and they have better support than anybody else
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.servercompass.com/
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> best support here
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> tw related support
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> not too cheap tho
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> can I only host one map per server?
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> at the same time yes
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> but literally every hoster will probably allow unlimited uploads for maps and you can change them
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> well "unlimited" is a strong word xd
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> i will host my 60 old ddrace maps ðŸ˜„
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> i think the teeadventures mod supported multiple maps at once
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> for 60 ddrace maps you can slap them all on the server and then add votes to switch maps
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> also weird flex that u mapped 60 maps o.O
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> ur at netcup Jupstar?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> I'm an old games i used to have my maps only hosted on xxlddrace games since the 0.5 trunk version
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> good ol times
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> "I like turtles" times xd
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> I was in the clans BaG F3aR and sMu
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> so ur interested in buying my sketchy product or can i go offline? xd
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> F3aR nice i remember them
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oklahoman> I will come back later
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon i know about macros for a long time, lol :D i just thought it would be usefull here, since its kinda the same as for example in server.cpp for the serverinfo, where some parts are only used in this function but need to be done multiple times
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> the 3rd 500 on github and githubstatus.com still like "this is fine"
19:38 <+Ryozuki> this is fine
19:39 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon maybe u got so many shit in ur github it bugged
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> xd maybe
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i reached some ratelimits for today and they bottleneck me with 500 lol i was active but it was under 1gb traffic i think
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chirstopher Moon> Has anyone used code signing before? Is there an alternative (preferably at no cost) to code signing, if any?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.cloudflare.com/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye i read about that
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> president has been in power for like 36 years or smth
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh no what are we going to do without unganda on th internet
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> some good memes came from uganda @Im 'corneum
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i hope you dont mean that red little mf
