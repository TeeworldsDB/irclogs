00:04 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> could also use homebrew or macports to get it but then it needs to be bundled
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> I wrote some script for bundling dependent dynamic libs on macOS some time ago: https://github.com/H-M-H/bundle_libs
00:15 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> no, you don't
00:15 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I disabled it
00:16 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> but now since it's bundled anyway, i reenabled it to have more consistent code
00:16 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> see the last few changes
00:16 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> feel free to change it if you can verify that it works fine on mac
