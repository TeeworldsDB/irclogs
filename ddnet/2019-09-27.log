02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jason54 | BlackPast> the score is not backing up
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lEARTH> hello
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lEARTH> guys
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lEARTH> pls help me
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lEARTH> i have a big problem
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> hello people
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> i need your help
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Because
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I upgraded my ssd disk
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> And installed teeworlds on it
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> And now when i move or hook i have a delay
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> When i do debug 1 in f1 and move, the ghost has a big delay, there was small delay on old disk
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Ping isn't the issue tho, i was testing it on private server and other servers with good ping
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tw doesn't rely much on disk access
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I upgraded it from like 50gb to 512gb
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> To allow windows to update
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Xd
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It shouldn't matter at all
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you maybe lose your settings
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I tried some settings combinations
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> And none worked
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe you have vsync on now and you didn't before? vsync likes to add some delay
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I have it off
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I had it off before disk upgrade too
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe try inp_mouseold ?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is also entirely possible that nothing changed but you feel like it changed
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> happened to me when I formatted my computer last, nothing actually changed but it just felt different
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> took me a week to get my throws on point again
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> Strange xd
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But i can feel on gores when i click A or D, my tee moves after a short delay, and when i release A or D, it also stops after a delay
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if your "ghost" has a big delay when debug is on, it definitely is ping
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I tried on my private server where i have 0 ping
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the ghost is whatever the server says your tee is doing
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I know
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> But ffs xd
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I can feel the difference
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I told you everything that came to my mind
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> It also can be mouse and keyboard problem, not teeworlds tho
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> I have no idea why os that happening
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noe> thanks for trying to help
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> use your old settings
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you can restore them
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I havent figured out which setting yet, but there is one that causes this
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Maybe antiping? xd
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> redownload tw then you should feel it
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> What why no xd
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because antiping doesnt cause input delay
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ah its input delay okk
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any1 on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2245 ?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or able to somehow hack the mac build of the client with latest xcode?
