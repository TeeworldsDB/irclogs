00:53 <+tee-> Hello.
00:55 <+tee-> deen: are you here?
15:09 <@deen> someone want to try hetzner's new ddos protection?
15:09 <@deen> https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/DDoS-Schutz/en
15:10 <@deen> I think I never tried them because they used to kick out everyone who was a target of DoS attacks immediately
15:12 <@deen> this could run GER a bit cheaper: https://www.hetzner.de/de/hosting/produkte_vserver/cx20
15:13 <@deen> not sure I want to do the work of setting everything up just to find out a day later that the ddos protection is crap
15:16 <@EastByte> might do that, although I'm pretty sure how the result will look like
15:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ACTom opened pull request #542: Fix lost first character when quickly input in chat (master...master) https://git.io/viLcw
15:19 <@deen> haha, me too. but sometimes you get surprised, see nfoservers being ok for a few months
