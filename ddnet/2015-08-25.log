00:00 <@deen> I'll try to fix all
00:00 <@deen> and with text input i mean writing arabic for example
00:00 <@deen> also, we should find another way to do text
00:01 <@deen> so we can add chinese fonts
00:01 < Savander> btw
00:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: for arabic you'll need another lib I guess
00:01 < Savander> i can clone it on my windows
00:01 < Savander> switch to this branch
00:01 < Savander> and try to compile
00:01 < Savander> ?
00:02 < Savander> or i need to download additional things?
00:04 <@deen> heinrich5991: no, that should work with sdl2
00:04 <@deen> ah, you mean for some text-together-stuff
00:04 <@deen> not even the basic stuff works though
00:04 <@heinrich5991> I ment for right-to-left text
00:04 <@deen> can't even get a single character
00:04 <@deen> Savander: it doesn't work on windows yet^^
00:04 < Savander> deen,  reaaallly :C
00:04 < Savander> im sad.
00:04 < Savander> :D:D
00:05 <@deen> i can try to fix it, one moment
00:06 < Savander> just joking, 
00:08 <@deen> Maybe now
00:08 <@deen> but untested
00:08 < Savander> i'll try
00:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you mean that RTL text works with sdl2?
00:10 <@deen> heinrich5991: no, i just mean that SDL_TEXTINPUT should be handled properly in input.cpp
00:10 <@heinrich5991> so you can input more characters?
00:10 <@deen> yeah
00:10 <@heinrich5991> that'd be great
00:10 <@heinrich5991> I bet the compose key would work then, too
00:10 <@deen> right now when I input ☺ it gets cut into 3 bytes and i get 3 wrong things
00:10 <@deen> the compose key always worked in sdl 1.2 for me
00:10 < Savander> it's funny, how many people are on steam community forum in teeworlds
00:10 <@deen> and now with sdl2 it stopped working
00:12 <@deen> i really wish we could have a DDNet tutorial, then releasing to Steam would make MUCH more sense
00:13 < Savander> yea
00:13 <@deen> a custom map for noobs, with some special support by the server for them
00:13 <@deen> so it can spawn dummies for you
00:13 < Savander> Yea, it'll be great
00:13 < Savander> even for standard client
00:13 < Savander> btw
00:13 < Savander> we can maka an article
00:13 < Savander> in teeworlds section
00:13 < Savander> aout ddnet
00:13 < Savander> with graphics, etc
00:13 <@deen> i don't know how to use steam
00:13 < Savander> i mean, a lot o fpeople reading those articel
00:13 <@deen> don't have an account etc
00:13 <@deen> but you can do it if you want
00:14 < Savander> Ye i know, my only problem is my
00:14 < Savander> english skills
00:14 < Savander> which are really bad :D
00:14 <@deen> you can send me text and i can proof read
00:14 < Savander> btw, there is a workshop
00:14 < Savander> im curious
00:14 <@deen> or ask someone else to write, for example in ddnet forum
00:14 < Savander> if it works
00:15 < Savander> if yes
00:15 < Savander> maybe we can put ddnet there
00:15 < Savander> ;p
00:15 <@deen> what's a workshop?
00:15 < Savander> it's place for custom maps, mods
00:15 < Savander> etc
00:15 <@deen> so ddnet would be a small mod among many and no one would find it there, meh
00:16 < Savander> not really
00:16 < Savander> there is rating
00:16 < Savander> you know
00:16 < Savander> more points
00:16 < Savander> you're highter
00:16 < Savander> ddnet probably will be at top
00:16 < Savander> ;p
00:16 <@deen> yeah, but only people who play TW would see it
00:16 <@deen> right?
00:17 < Savander> everyone
00:17 <@heinrich5991> I guess the best way for ddnet would be as a different application. I don't know whether it would get greenlit though
00:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, i doubt it as well
00:18 <@deen> i wanted to put it on steam, then i was away for a week and suddenly TW was on steam^^
00:18 <@heinrich5991> mhmh ^^
00:18 < Savander> haha
00:19 <@deen> i don't know, i get the feeling that all the work for ddnet was pretty useless
00:19 <@deen> if putting a game on steam gets you that many players immediately, why even bother writing a feature that brings you maybe 1-2 players
00:20 <@deen> block servers have hundreds of players without any development for years
00:21 < Savander> ddracenetwork has too
00:21 < Savander> but, it's abit different i think
00:21 <@deen> Savander: ddnet also has no development for years?^^
00:21 <@deen> and ddnet has far fewer players than the block servers
00:22 < Savander> ddrace > blockers
00:22 < Savander> xd
00:22 < Savander> blockers is a community
00:22 < Savander> it's hard to beat them i thing
00:22 <@deen> well, vanilla has beaten them easily :P
00:23 < Savander> steam is big
00:23 < Savander> that's why
00:23 < Savander> wait few days
00:23 < Savander> maybe weeks
00:23 <@deen> yeah, but if we then submit ddnet later, it won't even be greenlit because everyone has seen TW already and most are bored of it and they think ddnet is just some small mod of it
00:23 < Savander> they will discover filter options :P
00:26 < Savander> good night guys
00:32 <@heinrich5991> deen: and the work on ddnet definitely wasn't useless. you provide soo much for the ddrace community
00:32 < Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/sdl2-try3/bam.lua#L132
00:32 < Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/sdl2-try3/bam.lua#L146
00:32 < Savander> deen, 
00:32 <@heinrich5991> servers, updates, maps, etc.
00:32 < Savander> ^^
00:32 <@heinrich5991> tournaments
00:33 <@heinrich5991> you perhaps don't notice all of them, but a lot of people really like ddnet
00:34 <@deen> Savander: right
00:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, but as i said it's a pretty low number for the amount of work that goes in, just not worth it
00:38 <@heinrich5991> I don't know, maybe that's the wrong thing to measure
00:46 <@deen> sound also doesn't work anymore for me with sdl2^^
00:46 <@deen> sometimes crackles
00:47 <@deen> probably pulseaudio's fault
00:47 <@deen> doesn't work well for me and needs 5-10% cpu all the time

00:51 <@deen> i bet someone pulled in those 10 seconds!
00:52 <@deen> fixed the first sdl2 issue: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/d61b4ed9e75a52c45ad9e705751c0c43c2ecbe38
01:02 <@heinrich5991> cool =)
01:03 <@heinrich5991> what's SDL_TRUE, though... :o
01:12 <@deen> xcompose not working is likely just an sdl2 bug, hm
01:12 <@deen> The key you just pressed is not recognized by SDL. To help get this fixed, please report this to the SDL mailing list <sdl@libsdl.org> X11 KeyCode 0 (-8), X11 KeySym 0x0 ((null)).
01:21 < nuborn> hi, I tried to make a frame rate limiter
01:21 <@heinrich5991> good night
01:23 < Chairn> nuborn: savander and i did one ^^
01:23 < Chairn> wasnt very efficient
01:24 < nuborn> Chairn: was that the one in savanders repo? I tried that one :)
01:24 < Chairn> i did one myself, but savander already had one as well ^^
01:25 < Chairn> i tried both, and it's really shaky when you use it
01:25 < Chairn> probably a sync problem with the screen
01:30 <@deen> so sdl2 utf8-encodes the character twice...
01:30 <@deen> no idea why, but that explains why they come out all wrong
01:30 <@deen> hi cris272 
01:31 < cris272> hello deen :)
01:32 < nuborn> Chairn: I dont think that happened when I tried. but there will always be screen tearing of course
01:33 < nuborn> unless you have vsync on
01:33 < Chairn> hey cris272 
01:33 < Chairn> nuborn: but it also added some input delay
01:33 < cris272> hey :)
01:34 < Chairn> to avoid screen tearing, you should put a fps limit equals to a multiple of screen frequency
01:34 < Chairn> but not perfect
01:34 < Chairn> e.g 60 Hz -> 60,120,180,240 fps
01:35 < nuborn> Chairn: it will make the screen tearing stay at a fixed place on the screen (or move slowly). if you are lucky it will be at the top/bottom of the screen
01:36 <@deen> I'm also not sure if i like that we use scancodes instead of keycodes with sdl2. i have remapped a few keys, like escape on tab, and that doesn't work anymore
01:43 < nuborn> Chairn: I tried to make one that didn't add input delay
01:44 < Chairn> mine and savander's was pretty simple, just using thread_sleep(1) in a while loop
01:44 < Chairn> somewhere in CClient::run()
01:54 < nuborn> yes, you would have to update the game between each delay to avoid it
01:56 < nuborn> probably
01:56 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/693ed237e6a6f46dca6b9db16cc3bc1f9e04c9b4
01:57 < nuborn> oh, I see
01:57 < Chairn> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commit/e2e22fecd3380437b9a8a0bc6fd472d4a30d8eca
02:00 < nuborn> https://github.com/trml/ddnet/commit/50876c8270890f7e015a7c327c5d14fa7fc74c50
02:00 < nuborn> maybe you could test?
02:04 < Chairn> sure
02:04 < Chairn> just need a few time before
02:07 < nuborn> nice, thanks
02:07 < Chairn> i got something for you to test as well ^^
02:08 < nuborn> sure^^
02:20 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/044deb134f4b93bfdc1822953f08671810db63a6
02:22 < Chairn> how do i cherry-pick your commit?
02:22 < nuborn> I was wondering about the same question :P
02:24 < Chairn> meh, bad git
02:27 <@deen> git cherry-pick 044deb134f4b93
02:27 < Chairn> i tried for his, but didnt work
02:27 < Chairn> E:\Teeworlds_DDNet>git cherry-pick 50876c8270890f7e015a7c327c5d14fa7fc74c50 fatal: bad object 50876c8270890f7e015a7c327c5d14fa7fc74c50
02:28 <@deen> I'm now reporting SDL2 bugs to upstream because they're clearly not caused by us
02:28 <@deen> Chairn: have you added and fetched his fork?
02:28 < Chairn> no
02:28 <@deen> then do that
02:28 < nuborn> I made it work by adding chairn as a remote first, then "git fetch charin custom-background"
02:28 < Chairn> im not a pro git user ^^
02:28 <@deen> git won't google for the commit :P
02:29 < Chairn> i thought the code was unique for all the git users ^^
02:35 < Chairn> well, actually, your fps limiter is much better than mine ^^
02:35 < nuborn> how do I test it?
02:35 < Chairn> no more input delay
02:35 < Chairn> but, much more screen tearing
02:35 < Chairn> cl_background_entities %current% :P
02:36 < Chairn> but my commit contained some correction to a previous commit
02:36 < Chairn> you need cl_overlay_entities 100
02:36 < Chairn> and put a map into maps folder
02:36 < Chairn> then cl_background_entities mapuputintomaps.map
02:37 < Chairn> for instance move Optimum_crc.map and rename as Optimum.map
02:37 < nuborn> ok, I'll try that
02:37 < Chairn> i plan to add tile support because lots of background have tiles bg
02:39 < nuborn> I think the screen tearing seems higher when the fps is exactly 60, because it always stays in approximately the same place
02:40 < Chairn> i tried with 120
02:40 < Chairn> your fps limiter is weird cuz when you set a value, you got 10-15 fps above this value
02:40 < nuborn> Chairn, do you have vsync enabled?
02:40 < Chairn> with 120 i had 140(but with 150 i had also 140)
02:40 < Chairn> not on this client
02:41 < Chairn> anyway, in game vsync never worked for me
02:41 < Chairn> i force vsync via nvidia panel
02:43 < nuborn> that's strange, I'm not sure how well the limiter will combine the vsync outside of teeworlds. maybe you can try gfx_vsync 1?
02:43 < nuborn> or without vsync in nvidia
02:48 < nuborn> the custom background worked perfectly
02:48 < Chairn> did you try %current% and changing map?
02:48 < Chairn> ahaa, gfx_vsync was already 1, but not working
02:51 < Chairn> well
02:51 < Chairn> forcing computer to use nvidia graphic card instead of intel chipset is way better
02:52 < Chairn> no more screen tearing
02:52 < Chairn> if fps set to 120
02:53 < nuborn> what should cl_background_entities %current% do?
02:54 < Chairn> use current map background
02:55 < Chairn> so you have the entities + original map background ^^
02:55 < nuborn> do you write "%current%"?
02:57 < Chairn> normally, it should work without the quotes
02:57 < Chairn> cl_background_entities %current%
02:58 < Chairn> i must say that your fps limit is really great
02:58 < nuborn> if I write that it resets the background. but if I write the name of the map, it works, including when I change the map
02:58 < Chairn> are you on private server?
02:58 < nuborn> yes
02:58 < Chairn> maybe because current map is in maps folder
02:58 < nuborn> yes
02:58 < Chairn> %current% looks into downloadedmaps
02:58 < nuborn> oh!
02:58 < nuborn> haha
02:58 < nuborn> ok
02:58 < Chairn> ^^
02:59 < Chairn> try ddnet server
02:59 < nuborn> yeah, now it works perfectly
02:59 < nuborn> and changes the background when I change map
03:25 <@deen> nice people on the ddnet usa server
03:26 <@deen> explaining steam noobs how to chat and play novice maps
03:35 < Chairn> they found ddnet by themselves?
03:36 <@deen> no no, old ddnet usa players are there and are waiting for noobs to find ddnet
03:37 <@deen> i joined as nameless tee because i'm testing sdl2 stuff and they started explaining to me^^
03:37 <@deen> and asking if i use steam etc
03:39 < Chairn> xD
03:47 <@deen> hm, mouse is much slower with sdl2
03:47 <@deen> same in TW 0.7
03:48 <@deen> players will not enjoy finding new mousesens settings
04:21 <@deen> feels really sluggish, can't fix it with some factor. if anyone has an idea how to get back the old mouse feeling, tell me please
07:40 < laxa> tw 0.7 uses SDL 2 ? That's nice to know :)
10:26 <@deen> heinrich5991: i don't think we have on-demand loading of skins yet, unfortunately =/
10:26 <@deen> but i really wish we had it and eeeee has a PR for it
10:26 <@heinrich5991> oh, ok
10:26 <@heinrich5991> thought you had already merged that
10:27 <@deen> i'm still waiting for the PR

10:31 <@deen> not a single ddrace server...
10:32 <@EastByte> hm
10:35 <@heinrich5991> maybe people who can click uncheck the flags can also change their names?
10:35 <@EastByte> yea
10:40 <@deen> I don't see any player increase on ddnet, rather a decrease :P
10:40 <@deen> our forum is weird, they're discussing improving the GER blocker servers
10:40 <@deen> I don't think they even noticed that they're down
10:41 <@EastByte> yep, that's weird
10:41 <@deen> it's pretty said that they play block on the bot clan servers now
10:50 <@deen> sad*
10:54 <@heinrich5991> the clan's name is bot?
10:54 <@deen> no, Baumalein, they make the bot client
10:55 <@deen> hm, with sdl1.2 the mouse feels like it moves exactly as fast as on desktop
10:55 <@deen> but with sdl2 it feels sluggish and even making it faster doesn't help
11:01 <@deen> hmmm, maybe making it twice as fast feels ok-ish
11:06 <@deen> hi Cadillaxx 
11:11 <@deen> ooooh, the slower mouse is only when using the development version of sdl2!
11:11 <@deen> caused by this "bugfix" https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/c9c61d66cfa0
11:12 <@deen> but it's planned to be released in 2.0.4, hm
11:13 <@deen> and this confirms that 2x sense should work, guess I'll leave it for now and wait until 2.0.4 is released: https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2963
11:14 <@deen> didn't someone have working copy-paste support with sdl2?
11:14 <@deen> i can't find it anymore
11:17 <@deen> ah, it's in sdl2all branch of swick
11:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: will 2.0.4 have a regression or an enhancement wrt. mouse speed?
11:19 <@deen> a change
11:19 <@deen> for me it's a bug since everyone on linux will be used to this mouse sens and now it halfes
11:19 <@deen> but i think on windows it's actually 2x slower
11:19 <@deen> and so should then feel on linux like on win
11:20 < erfan_zone> hi
11:20 <@deen> hi
11:20 < erfan_zone> deen
11:20 < erfan_zone> when you
11:20 < erfan_zone> run server?
11:21 <@deen> so you want an official ddnet server?
11:21 <@deen> did i get that right?
11:21 < erfan_zone> yes
11:21 <@deen> I'm trying to log into the server
11:21 < erfan_zone> yes
11:22 < erfan_zone> deen
11:22 <@deen> took 3 minutes to connect^^
11:22 <@deen> weird
11:22 < erfan_zone> ok
11:22 <@deen> what's a "client server"?
11:23 < erfan_zone> what?
11:23 <@deen> in the PM you wrote "mr deen please first run client server is very Important"
11:23 < erfan_zone> yes
11:23 < erfan_zone> can you?
11:23 <@deen> yes, i'm setting up the server right now
11:23 < erfan_zone> thanks :X
11:26 <@deen> i'm not sure if you understand how official ddnet servers work
11:28 < erfan_zone> mr deen
11:28 < erfan_zone>  !: i need block server with special client just players can join with this client and other clients cant connect to server
11:28 <@deen> nope, that's not what we have
11:28 <@deen> and i can't make that
11:28 < erfan_zone> its hard?
11:28 <@deen> impossible
11:28 <@deen> you can always fake another client
11:29 < erfan_zone> just player can connect by ddnet normal
11:29 <@deen> then everyone can take ddnet client and add their bots
11:29 <@deen> and still connect
11:30 <@deen> the only thing you can do is to moderate the server, kicking botters
11:30 < erfan_zone> yes
11:30 < erfan_zone> can you do in block server?
11:30 < erfan_zone> kicking botters
11:30 < erfan_zone> ?
11:30 <@deen> i personally won't, but i can enable kicking, sure
11:30 < erfan_zone> ok
11:30 < erfan_zone> yes
11:30 < erfan_zone> enable kicking in
11:30 < erfan_zone> block
11:31 < erfan_zone> just in block server
11:31 < erfan_zone> thanks
11:31 <@deen> there is also kicking on any other ddnet server :P
11:31 < erfan_zone> :X
11:32 < erfan_zone> thanks mr deen
11:32 < erfan_zone> sory for my english is bad :D
11:32 < erfan_zone> i am 15 years old
11:32 < erfan_zone> 16
11:32 <@deen> it's ok
11:33 < erfan_zone> :X
11:33 <@deen> i just wonder whether you know what DDNet server means
11:33 <@deen> it means the server is connected to the database of all official ddnet servers worldwide
11:33 <@deen> and they automatically get new maps
11:34 <@deen> it also means you can't just change settings or upload your own maps
11:34 < erfan_zone> i khow
11:34 <@deen> ok, good
11:36 < erfan_zone> mr deen
11:36 < erfan_zone> how can kick bot clients base on ddnet source so ?
11:36 <@deen> i don't understand
11:38 < erfan_zone> i dont want bot can join :(
11:39 <@deen> impossible, sorry
11:41 < erfan_zone> you told me you can kick other clients so i tell you how you can kick bot clients writen on ddnet source
11:41 < erfan_zone> we can
11:41 <@deen> no, we can't kick players based on their client, it's impossible
11:41 <@deen> you can kick clients by hand
11:41 <@deen> or let your players vote to kick
11:42 < erfan_zone> ok run this
11:42 < erfan_zone> do you have link for help compile in linux
11:42 <@deen> no, i'm setting up the server
11:43 < erfan_zone> ok
12:03 < erfan_zone> mr deen
12:03 < erfan_zone> bego can you filter version of famous bot clients ?
12:03 <@deen> no
12:03 < erfan_zone> why?
12:03 < erfan_zone> just in block
12:04 <@deen> they don't identify themselves as "hi, I'm a bot client"
12:05 < erfan_zone> so whats this?
12:05 < erfan_zone> MACRO_CONFIG_STR(SvClientSuggestionBot, sv_client_suggestion_bot, 128, "Your client has bots and can be remote controlled!\nPlease use another client like DDNet client from DDNet.tw", CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Broadcast to display to players with a known botting client")
12:06 <@deen> that works for very few bot clients and has long been fixed in that bot client
12:17 < erfan_zone> mr deen
12:17 < erfan_zone> if we give you version of client has bot
12:17 < erfan_zone> can you filter that?
12:19 < erfan_zone> deen: 
12:37 <@deen> erfan_zone: there are no such versions
12:37 < Savander> hi
12:38 <@deen> hi
12:42 < erfan_zone> mr deen
12:43 <@deen> erfan_zone: yes?
12:43 < erfan_zone> can you def from ddos?
12:43 <@deen> no
12:43 < erfan_zone> a little?
12:44 < erfan_zone> from udp
12:44 <@deen> probably not
12:44 <@deen> usually the server gets shut down in iran when ddos attacks happen
12:44 < erfan_zone> yes
12:44 < erfan_zone> can you close udp port?
12:44 < erfan_zone> close udp 23 port
12:44 < erfan_zone> port 23 udp
12:45 <@deen> that doesn't help
12:45 <@heinrich5991> (udp port 23 is probably closed)
12:46 < erfan_zone> please do every work to help for def ddos
12:46 < erfan_zone> heinrich can you def from ddos?
12:46 <@heinrich5991> no
12:46 < Savander> erfan_zone,  DDOs proteciton is really expensive
12:47 < erfan_zone> where?
12:48 < Savander> what where?
12:48 < erfan_zone> ddos protection
12:48 < erfan_zone> expensive?
12:48 < erfan_zone> how much doler?
12:49 < Savander> it's very often individual offer
12:49 < erfan_zone> we are in iran
12:49 < Savander> i don't know, how much in iran
12:50 < Savander> don't even know if someone offer good ddos protection
12:50 < erfan_zone> and we dont have ofissial account in bank
12:50 < erfan_zone> can you give me 1 free ddos protection
12:50 < erfan_zone> ?

13:28 < erfan_zone> after
13:28 < erfan_zone> restart
13:28 < erfan_zone> how run ddnet?
13:28 <@deen> i will set it so it runs automatically, 1 moment
13:28 < erfan_zone> ok
13:28 < erfan_zone> good
13:29 < erfan_zone> deen i go by other client
13:29 < erfan_zone> but it dont kick me
13:30 <@deen> yes, i told you there is no bot protection
13:30 < erfan_zone> you say if come by other client kick but if go by ddnet client dont kick
13:30 < erfan_zone> yes?
13:30 <@deen> yes
13:31 < erfan_zone> but i go by xxl ddrace and it not kick me
13:31 < erfan_zone> can you test it?
13:31 <@deen> you have to kick the person manually
13:31 <@deen> bot client will not be kicked
13:32 < erfan_zone> ok
13:42 < ochristi> deen: maybe some input threshold
13:44 < erfan_zone> deen
14:14 <@deen> ochristi: i tried, human players can click faster than the bots^^
14:14 <@deen> erfan_zone: yes?
14:15 <@deen> server down already?
14:15 < Savander> maybe you can check interval between clicks
14:16 < Savander> in a specified time?:D
14:16 <@deen> Savander: i did, humans click faster
14:16 < Savander> bot's probably do it the same
14:16 < Savander> all the time :D
14:16 < erfan_zone> deen: they attack me :D
14:16 <@deen> sure, we can implement that and 1 day later bots do it a bit differently
14:16 < erfan_zone> it is new record
14:16 < erfan_zone> :D
14:17 < Savander> deen, ofc. Cheaters always will think about new anti anti-cheat code
14:17 < Savander> xd
14:17 < Savander> that's normal. :D
14:18 <@deen> yeah, but i don't plan to spend my time implementing new anti-bot measures
14:18 <@deen> Savander: did sdl2 work on windows?
14:19 < Savander> nope
14:19 < Savander> i had to change in bam.cfg
14:19 < Savander> 2 things
14:19 < Savander> (SDl wasn't  copied)
14:19 < Savander> but then  i had a lot of errors
14:19 < Savander> in every single class
14:19 < Savander> and in eveyr single function soo
14:20 < Savander> if you want, i can make a log
14:20 < Savander> :p
14:23 <@deen> yes, please
14:24 < Savander> ok, wait a second
14:48 < Savander> deen, http://savander.pl/upload/sdl2-try3.txt
14:48 <@heinrich5991> Savander: that looks like the python scripts were not executed correctly (?)
14:48 < Savander> wow?
14:48 < Savander> impossible
14:48 <@deen> right
14:49 < Savander> because i compiled a lot of client
14:49 < Savander> on this computer
14:49 < Savander> that's weird
14:49 <@deen> src/game/generated/protocol.cpp missing?
14:49 <@deen> and .h
14:49 <@heinrich5991> rather .h
14:49 <@deen> ^^
14:49 < Savander> there
14:49 < Savander> is
14:51 < Savander> but
14:51 < Savander> wait, without
14:51 < Savander> anything
14:51 < Savander> i mean, they are empty
14:51 < Savander> but server_data.h has code
14:51 < Savander> inside
14:52 <@deen> remove them i guess
14:52 <@deen> might have happened because of old compile problems with sdl2
14:55 < Savander> maybe
14:55 < Savander> ook
14:55 < Savander> you was right :D
14:55 < Savander> but still can't compile it
14:55 < Savander> wait, i'll give you log
14:59 < Savander> deen, http://savander.pl/upload/sdl2-try3.txt
15:04 <@deen> Savander: ha, was an sdl2 bug
15:04 <@deen> fixed now

15:53 <@deen> steam greenlight fee is 90 €?
15:53 < Savander> not 100?
15:53 < Savander> 100$
15:54 <@deen> so, should we try to make ddnet greenlight?
15:54 <@heinrich5991> (if you don't want to pay that fee, you can use my steam account to propose ddnet)
15:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: of course i don't want to pay 90 €^^
15:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: then it would show as being made by "TW developers"?
15:55 <@deen> but yes, would be great
15:55 <@deen> I'm just wondering what we should do before trying to put it on steam
15:55 <@deen> i
15:55 <@deen> I've been asking people to make a tutorial map for many months, so i don't expect anything to happen there
15:56 <@heinrich5991> deen: "Teeworlds developers" – that's a free text field
15:56 <@heinrich5991> you can write anything you want there
15:56 <@deen> oh, great
15:57 <@deen> i can't even manage to make a steam account anyway. can'T read their captchas =/
15:58 <@heinrich5991> now *that* sounds like an excuse ^^
15:59 <@deen> oh, actually what I enter is right, but still "Your account creation request failed, please try again later."
16:00 < Savander> how it would work?
16:00 < Savander> I meean DDNet and teeworlds on steam
16:00 < Savander> DDNet as modification of teeworlds?
16:00 <@deen> Savander: just as a separate game i think
16:03 < Savander> I thinking, what steam will do with it
16:03 <@deen> not greenlight it :P
16:04 < Savander> huh.
16:04 < Savander> In descriptions should be
16:04 < Savander> it's a modificatiom
16:04 < Savander> maybe xd
16:06 < Savander> btw deen  you saw
16:06 < Savander> my log?
16:06 < Savander> latest?
16:08 <@deen> yes, but it was the same code in ddnet-master
16:08 <@deen> so i'm not sure why it doesn't work now
16:09 < Savander> hm
16:21 <@deen> which good videos and images should i add to the steam greenlight submission?
16:21 < Savander> trailer
16:21 < Savander> Aoe's
16:22 <@deen> yep, anything else?
16:22 < Savander> screen from facebook
16:22 <@deen> yep^^
16:22 <@deen> those 2 were my first ideas haha
16:22 < Savander> :D
16:24 < Savander> check
16:24 < Savander> your folder
16:24 < Savander> with images
16:24 < Savander> witch was on main page
16:24 < Savander> :D
16:24 < Savander> all of them
16:25 < Savander> were good
16:25 <@deen> yeah, but they're only "fun" images
16:25 <@deen> they don't show gameplay
16:25 <@deen> they're more for people who know the game already
16:26 <@deen> I'll add some good ones from here: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=955
16:28 < Savander> ye
16:28 < Savander> definitly
16:28 < Savander> you shoud LD
16:30 < Savander> btw
16:30 < Savander> you can add more images
16:30 < Savander> than 5
16:53 <@EastByte> o_be_one: I'm currently working on a teeworlds bpf firewall filter :)
16:54 <@deen> I'm trying to write a DDNet description text
16:54 <@EastByte> you are pretty good at writing
16:55 <@deen> funny that you say that because i never liked writing
16:55 <@deen> always thought it's useless and wanted to code instead :P
16:55 <@deen> or do science!
16:55 <@EastByte> science!!
16:56 <@deen> then i found out you have to write papers in science :P
16:56 <@heinrich5991> in science you'll have to write a lot too
16:56 <@heinrich5991> yea
16:56 <@deen> yeah, i'm not so happy about writing papers
16:57 <@deen> and I'm not sure how to make people interested in ddnet
16:57 <@deen> understand what it's all about
16:57 < Savander> in description you can put some videos too
16:57 < Savander> :PP
16:57 <@deen> yes, already have 10 videos :P
16:57 < Savander> hahaha
16:57 < Savander> ok
16:58 < Savander> :D
16:58 <@deen> it's funny that no one makes kobra videos
16:58 <@deen> most popular ddnet map, nothing on youtube
16:58 <@deen> (only 1 video, but didn'T look that great)
17:00 < Savander> xDD
17:00 < Savander> hahaha
17:00 < Savander> so
17:00 < Savander> come, we can do speedrun
17:00 < Savander> i'll record it
17:00 <@deen> nah, i'm writing^^
17:01 <@deen> i don't even know if speedrun is the best, or more normal gameplay
17:01 <@deen> I find this video fun: https://youtu.be/zjRR2eCN2e4
17:01 <@deen> you really see what it's like on a full, normal ddnet server
17:01 <@deen> exactly what you can expect when you play the game for thefirst time
17:02 <@deen> ah, they're in team^^
17:02 <@deen> demo just bugs at the start haha
17:02 <@EastByte> :p
17:03 <@deen> we should put the first team packet into demo at start
17:03 <@deen> so you know who's in which team
17:04 < Savander> :D
17:16 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/steam.png
17:16 <@deen> ^ any suggestions?
17:17 <@deen> maybe i should write a line about teeworlds too
17:17 <@heinrich5991> release date: summer 2013?
17:17 <@deen> that it's on steam
17:17 <@deen> since then ddnet is developed
17:17 <@deen> or what kind of release date do they want?
17:17 <@heinrich5991> ah. I think you should put the date you expect the steam release
17:18 <@deen> so "RIGHT NOW"?
17:18 <@deen> ^^
17:19 <@heinrich5991> that's basically what I put there
17:20 < Savander> looks good
17:22 <@deen> sooo, publish?
17:23 <@heinrich5991> there's ddnet on facebook? ^^
17:24 <@deen> yeah, for a few days: http://facebook.com/ddracenetwork/
17:26 < Savander> deen, 
17:26 < Savander> ypi
17:26 < Savander> you're able to put
17:26 < Savander> image in description
17:26 < Savander> via partner page
17:26 < Savander> you need to upload image to their servers
17:34 <@deen> heh, funny comparing the reaction on TW forum and ddnet forum on announcing greenlight
17:35 < Savander> yea
17:35 <@deen> on TW forum all positive
17:35 < Savander> for me it's good
17:35 < Savander> D:
17:35 < Savander> but, leute is alwayes negative
17:35 <@deen> yeah, but he's always the first to respond
17:35 < Savander> event about Teeworlds on steam
17:35 <@deen> so everyone reads his opinions immediately^^
17:35 < Savander> he was negative
17:36 < Savander> because, to much players
17:36 < Savander> because community will be worser etc
17:36 <@deen> well, he's not the only one who wants ddnet to get much smaller
17:36 < o_be_one> awesome EastByte tell me more soon :D
17:36 < Savander> I don't really like his opinions
17:36 < Savander> very often im against them
17:36 < Savander> :p
17:38 <@deen> we have some really toxic people in the community
17:39 < Savander> that's true.
17:39 <@deen> i think they really manage to make a lot of things negative
17:39 <@deen> not sure what to do about that
17:40 < Savander> You should tell poeple on servers
17:40 < Savander> about steam greenligh
17:40 <@deen> i just did^^
17:40 < Savander> (not once, few times, every few hours maybe)
17:40 < Savander> ;P
17:40 < Soreu> Just add it as one of chat announces
17:41 < Savander> And they should leave a comment
17:41 < Savander> on steam greenlight
17:41 < Savander> 700 players 
17:41 < Savander> via steam
17:41 < Savander> :c
17:41 < Savander> 1400 players
17:41 < Savander> in game
17:42 < Savander> wow
17:42 < Savander> 300+ more players
17:42 < Savander> in 1 day
17:44 <@deen> ouch, half the people vote "no" on releasing it on steam =/
17:44 < Savander> deen, 
17:44 < Savander> you should add more
17:44 < Savander> links i guess?
17:45 <@deen> what links?
17:45 < Savander> now it's only facebook
17:45 <@deen> you can't add any other
17:45 <@deen> only youtube, twitter
17:45 <@deen> nothing we have
17:46 < Savander> oh
17:46 < Savander> :/
17:46 < Savander> you have
17:46 < Savander> youtube
17:49 < Soreu> I have doubts if both movies on steam about fails are good idea, except if they are only for players who are playing it for longer time (since only they will understand them)
17:54 <@heinrich5991> #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
17:54 <@heinrich5991> no
17:54 <@heinrich5991> I mean
17:54 <@heinrich5991> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2125#p22736
17:54 <@heinrich5991> "We are not able to handle so much players, but its even harder to handle one hi_leute_gll!"
17:55 < Savander> :D:D
17:55 < Savander> that's ture
17:55 < Savander> "D
18:03 <@deen> I guess it was a mistake to post that on Steam Greenlight
18:03 < Savander> why?
18:03 <@deen> everyone is negative about it
18:03 < Savander> oh sop.
18:03 < Savander> stop.
18:05 <@deen> "Bad idea to add another client for existing game in steam. It is better to use workshop or something like this."
18:05 < Savander> it's not true, you see more negative comments than positive, because it's easier to write negative opinion.
18:05 <@deen> "this is TeeWorlds .-."
18:05 < Learath2> well it kinda is :/
18:05 < Savander> Yup, but workshop is weird
18:06 < Savander> :/
18:06 < Learath2> I do like the idea of it being on steam but im not sure if it fits in greenlight
18:06 <@heinrich5991> mods are fine on greenlight, at least as per valve
18:06 < Savander> i don't really konw how iit works
18:06 < Savander> just give a time for this
18:06 < Savander> ;p
18:09 <@deen> If we had put DDNet on Steam Greenlight before TW, it would've made much more sense, we had 50-80% of TW players
18:09 <@deen> Now the people are right, it's just a small mod in TW with 10% of players, hm
18:09 < Soreu> I also thought about using workshop instead, but as i said - i don't really know how steam works
18:10 < Savander> deen,  just stay it there. You don't lose anything :p
18:17 < Soreu> up to 26 guests on forum is something weird
18:17 <@deen> ?
18:17 <@heinrich5991> Soreu: I'm not really sure how the workshop might work for that
18:18 <@heinrich5991> or whether at all
18:18 <@deen> how are valve's mods released?
18:18 <@deen> i think some of their well known games are mods, are they in workshop?
18:19 < Soreu> deen: i just think that mostly in "who is online" i saw max 15 guests, moment ago it was 26, and earlier even 42 users in total
18:19 <@deen> "who is online" on steam?
18:19 <@deen> or ddnet forum?
18:19 < Soreu> forum
18:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: valve has mods?
18:20 <@heinrich5991> there are some mods, e.g. of portal that were released via greenlight
18:20 <@deen> Counter-Strike and Team Fortress are Half-Life mods, or not?
18:20 < Soreu> heinrich5991: i mean adding DDNet as mod to current Teeworlds game, but for that mods would have to finally partially give any kind of support if i'm not wrong, or just be less against modifications
18:20 <@heinrich5991> rexaura, thinking with time machine, portal stories: mel
18:21 < Soreu> heinrich5991: i mean adding DDNet as mod to current Teeworlds game, but for that devs would have to finally partially give any kind of support if i'm not wrong, or just be less against modifications
18:21 < Soreu> ^ sry
18:21 <@heinrich5991> deen: well. "mods". they originated from that, but now they're basically completely independent
18:21 <@heinrich5991> just using the source engine
18:21 <@heinrich5991> (but all their own version of hte source engine)
18:22 <@heinrich5991> e.g. heroes of the storm also uses the starcraft 2 engine, but it's hardly a mod
18:22 <@heinrich5991> Soreu: I don't know how that'd work tbh
18:23 <@heinrich5991> http://ddnet.tw/www.ddnet.tw.png :D
18:23 <@deen> right^^
18:24 < o_be_one> i meet game ddos manager in september :p
18:24 <@deen> i hope "anti-ddos manager"
18:24 <@EastByte> definitely managing all ddos attacks
18:24 < o_be_one> anti-ddos game manager
18:24 < o_be_one> i'll ask to blacklist ddnet cause ddos are from this network ahahahahah :p
18:25 <@EastByte> o_be_one: what are you gonna talk about?
18:25 <@EastByte> game filter improvements?
18:26 < o_be_one> OVH has an anti-ddos with filters for game servers, and i'll move to France to meet my team and the team who's managing this anti-ddos system
18:29 <@EastByte> I hope you'll have fun
18:33 < laxa> New anti-ddos system : problem ? We plug out the cable, no more ddos !
18:34 < Learath2> well many providers do that :D
18:35 <@deen> welcome, Lady
18:36 < laxa> I understand
18:36 < laxa> so when people say
18:36 < laxa> Lady and gentlemen
18:36 < laxa> they directly speak to you right ? :p
18:36 < Lady> yes
18:36 < Savander> xD
18:36 < Lady> they say ladies and gentlemen
18:37 < Lady> so they speak to me and my kitty

19:29 < Savander> <jxsl13> Savander

19:30 < Savander> for normal messages
19:30 < Savander> works
19:30 <@heinrich5991> deen: wow. it's interesting that that's tipping point
19:30 <@heinrich5991> just today I added someone :D
19:31 <@deen> Savander: i have it like this in ddnet:
19:31 <@deen> pPlayer->m_LastChat+Server()->TickSpeed()*((31+Length)/32) > Server()->Tick()
19:31 <@deen> ah, that's only for without /
19:32 <@deen> in CGameContext::Whisper() i just have if(ProcessSpamProtection(ClientID) return;

19:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #303: Set 5 as minimum mousesens instead of 0 (master...master) http://git.io/vs7Ew
19:37 < Savander> i don't know how to fix it
19:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: maybe it takes a few minutes to update, or you can try adding me: http://steamcommunity.com/id/deen_ddnet/
19:38 <@heinrich5991> https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/39p81q/could_not_invite_their_friends_list_is_full/
19:39 <@heinrich5991> made a friend request
19:39 <@deen> Savander: it has some spam protection, but not much
19:39 <@deen> you can't spam whispers, only about 1 every 3 seconds
19:40 <@deen> maybe you should auto-mute when someone does too much
19:40 <@deen> oh great
19:40 <@deen> i have to pay 5 $ to become a friend with someone^^
19:41 <@deen> the error is not very exact
19:41 <@EastByte> a proper spam protection :p
19:41 < Savander> ehm
19:41 < Savander> that's ture
19:41 < Savander> :D
19:41 < Savander> it's steam
19:41 < Henningstone> It's $team, ya
19:41 <@deen> when i registered they said "this nick is available" and registration still failed all the time. at some point i tried another name, and immediately it worked...
19:41 <@deen> hi cris272 
19:42 < cris272> hey
19:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: I think I was able to add friends to a new steam account
19:42 < Savander> yup
19:42 < Savander> new accounts
19:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you tried accepting my friend request?
19:42 < Savander> can't invite anyone
19:42 < Savander> but another account
19:43 < Savander> can invite you
19:43 <@deen> done!
19:44 <@heinrich5991> deen: added you, guess you'll need to accept
19:44 <@deen> yep, thanks
19:45 < Chairn> hey uchar 
19:45 < uchar> yo! hi Chairn
19:45 < Chairn> you wanna test my background feature?
19:46 < uchar> yeah.... you use linux?
19:46 < Chairn> no, why?
19:46 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/tree/custom-background
19:47 < uchar> ah oks
19:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vs7rp
19:49 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d673aa0 def: Updated jungle_main.rules (by hi_leute_gll)
19:54 < Learath2> deen: do we have new people on ddnet ?
19:54 <@deen> Learath2: nope, lower player numbers
19:55 <@deen> everyone goes to vanilla to play with the noobs
19:56 < Savander> haha
19:56 < Savander> deen,  i saw
19:56 < Savander> new players on ddnet
19:56 < Savander> i teached them something!
19:56 < Savander> how to play, etc!
19:56 <@deen> cool
19:56 <@deen> haven't been on the servers, just looking at numbers
19:58 <@EastByte> brown tees everywhere
19:58 <@EastByte> and what feels pretty strange, the chat is silent
19:58 < Henningstone> zombies everywhere...
19:58 <@EastByte> ^
19:59 <@EastByte> sometimes feels like a zomb mod
19:59 < Henningstone> yeah all look the same, nobody can play xD
20:00 <@EastByte> oh looks like one master really isn't responding?
20:00 <@deen> heinrich5991: thanks for letting me use your account for steam =)
20:00 < Henningstone> overload? o_O
20:04 < uchar> Chairn some script says me: fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
20:05 <@heinrich5991> deen: you're welcome! I'd love to see a teeworlds mod on steam.
20:05 <@heinrich5991> uchar: hi!
20:05 < uchar> hey hi heinrich5991!
20:06 < uchar> any plan for workshop integration or something?
20:09 <@heinrich5991> no plans of integrating steam code whatsoever
20:09 <@heinrich5991> (and I can't say that I view that as a bad idea)
20:10 <@deen> half the TW players are on a server starting with "! "
20:11 < uchar> what is "Statboard"?
20:11 <@deen> statistics board for kill-based mods
20:11 < uchar> i press the binded key but... nothing happens
20:11 <@deen> and vanilla
20:11 < uchar> ook
20:11 <@deen> i don't think it works in ddrace
20:12 < uchar> perhaps good idea add "tooltips" on labels...
20:12 < uchar> :\ xD
20:13 < uchar> for know that these "command" only works in some gametypes
20:14 <@deen> hm, yeah
20:14 <@deen> i also thought about soething like this
20:28 <@heinrich5991> deen: was Kobra 4.map in the current folder when you executed config_retrieve?
20:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes
20:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: how long was TW on greenlight until it was greenlit?
20:30 <@deen> and did steam get in touch with you before or something?
20:31 < Savander> deen,  i think it was after 1 week
20:31 < Savander> or 4 days
20:31 < Savander> (i watched it)
20:32 <@deen> oh, that's quick =/
20:33 < Savander> but
20:33 < Savander> teeworlds had 100 comments
20:33 < Savander> in first day
20:33 < Savander> :p
20:33 < Savander> ^>^
20:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: it was 7 days until being greenlit
20:33 <@deen> yeah, ddnet is not getting that much attention yet, hm
20:34 < Savander> don't worry
20:34 < Savander> 2weeks 
20:34 < Savander> maybe 3
20:34 < Savander> and will be greenlit
20:38 <@deen> more no votes than yes for greenlight so far
21:09 < eeeee> missed the highlight, you guys needed anything?
21:09 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I think it was about on-demand loading of skins
21:20 <@deen> eeeee: yes, I'd like on-demand skin loading from hard disk!
21:20 <@deen> lower memory usage with more skins
21:21 <@heinrich5991> one problem with that is: what do you display during the loading time of the skin?
21:22 <@deen> default skin
21:23 <@deen> or nothing?
21:23 <@deen> hm, right. when the disk is really slow it might take a moment
21:27 < fstd> or if the disk has to spin up first
21:27 <@deen> yep, that's what i was thinking about
21:42 <@deen> chile ddos
21:46 <@deen> it happens so regularly that i really believe the hoster is ddosing us so that I have to pay extra for the traffic
21:47 < Henningstone> chile... could be true :0
22:07 < Savander> don't know
22:07 < Savander> if it was complained
22:07 < Savander> but if you touch someone in speeders
22:07 < Savander> this guy just getting ultra speed
22:07 < Savander> to up
22:14 <@deen> maybe not such a good idea to post ddnet on steam
22:14 < Savander> .
22:14 < Savander> why? Wait few days
22:14 <@deen> people are writing me private messages with stuff like "ddrace = cancer", "you destroy teeworlds" or "how much can you be in love with yourself deen?"
22:15 < Savander> ofc
22:15 < Savander> you don't see others or waht?
22:15 < Savander> you know, a lot of people want ddnet on steam at this moment
22:15 <@deen> yeah, but i don't really want to deal with all the haters
22:15 < Savander> You should take care of them
22:15 < Shiki_> I wonder why so many folks on steam treat ddnet as a mere teeworlds client
22:15 < Savander> deen,  just fuck it
22:15 < Savander> don't read it
22:16 < Savander> ;p
22:16 <@deen> Shiki_: i guess they've never tried it or are not interested in ddrace
22:16 < Savander> really, you should take care of haters.
22:16 < Shiki_> for me it's the game in its own right that just happens to be implemented on teeworlds codebase
22:16 < Savander> shouldnt*
22:16 <@deen> Shiki_: that's how i see it too and that's what i tried to explain in the steam explanation
22:17 < Savander> Just fuck those haters and do your good job
22:23 < Shiki_> screenshots are kinda weird^^
22:23 < Savander> "D
22:45 < Chairn> "Do it Gabe.. Good luck guys <3 from Megaman "
22:45 < Chairn> there are also good supports
23:10 <@deen> Shiki_: on steam? if you can link me to better ones, I'll upload them
23:10 <@deen> i just took what i found
23:47 < Mahdi> Hello :)
23:48 < Mahdi> How do you record your videos?
23:49 < Mahdi> One way is recording the demo ( and you can use the slowmotion which is so cool) but in this case can you bind the player controls?
23:49 < Savander> on scroll
23:49 < Savander> you can inscrease speed of video
23:50 <@deen> hi Mahdi 
23:50 < Savander> deen,  bind for play_demo exists in this version?
23:50 <@deen> Savander: i think not in the released one, but should be in the next version
23:50 <@deen> or maybe it's in already
23:50 < Savander> ah
23:50 < Savander> it is
23:50 < Savander> i guess
23:50 < Savander> or it's my verison...
23:50 < Savander> :/
23:50 < Savander> "playdemo" in console
23:54 < Mahdi> It would be better to bind slow-motion on keys. ( Have trouble making it normal speed ) 
23:59 <@deen> i think best would be to record raw demos and then cut them together in an editor
