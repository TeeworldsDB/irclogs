03:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> anyone had issues running ddnet with xwayland before?
03:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm using xwayland-satellite and it's just a black screen after Vulkan context
03:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> not sure why its not just... running with Wayland though
03:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i thought this was possible
03:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i installed via arch package
03:33 < bridge> <gorp_tw> holy shit there's an Arch Linux wiki page for DDNet? that's awesome
03:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> any1 know how to speed this up?
03:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374199618811723797/image.png?ex=682d2ea0&is=682bdd20&hm=7479f57706fef4e8f13d3d6d0343652346b696f4c373f1d10c794aac4368dd60&
03:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want unique, mostly unused names
03:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this took 30 seconds
03:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> Also tried using xwayland-run instead
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why do you need to run it in xwayland
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
03:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I shouldnt need to right lol
03:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ya idk what SDL needs at all
03:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i thought this would be managed completely by the package
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .
03:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> so do I have to stick this in my login or whatever
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no
03:42 < bridge> <gorp_tw> just surprised is all
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well .profile
03:42 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would recommend
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as well as the hundred other env vars you need
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but first test it
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland ./DDNet
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well act i put it in your desktop env rc
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> incase you every wana run xorg
03:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> SDL_VIDEODRIVER is set but re-running DDNet still attempts to get gfx with x11
03:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i will try to restart my session
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you dont export it DDNet doesnt get it
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unless you put it directly beforehand as
03:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this
03:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if DDNet can't get wayland it will try x11
03:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I think I can set environment variables related to the session in niri
03:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> niri's config
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if that doesnt work then setting the envvar doesnt work
03:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> new error!
03:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> requested presentation mode was not available. falling back to mailbox / fifo relaxed.
03:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but window is black regardless
03:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> Vulkan error
03:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ??
03:48 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i must need a lot of vars...
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats not really an error
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but is a symptom of something else
03:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> is there a way I can put this ddnet config?
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> non
03:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> like use wayland instead
03:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> fucked up
03:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> well either way, still just blank
03:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> anyone here play on Wayland?
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet config shouldnt have config for that
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the environment should do those
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if they are required
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why every idiot needs a seperate and multiple env vars
03:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> XDG_SESION-TYPE is all you shoul d need
03:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wow nice discord lag
03:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> not really sure what you're saying
03:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> are you mad at SDL or something
03:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes
03:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and chrome
03:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by extention all electron based apps
03:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gtk and qt idk abt them
03:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> qt is fucked
03:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i suppose I cannot play ddnet unless i use steam
03:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gtk is fucked but better than qt
03:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> see what env vars steam sets
03:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i havent even tried steam at all yet because Wayland is a mess with steam
03:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> obviously
03:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres a well defined
03:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> standard setting
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for whether to use wayland or x11
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and no one bloody uses it
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> env | grep x11
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
03:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> GAH
03:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `cat /proc/<PID>/environ | tr '\0' '\n'`
03:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you get it to run in steam
04:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> Steam works and I wish I knew why
05:04 < bridge> <louis> doesnt steam sometimes use its own stuff
05:04 < bridge> <louis> gamescope or whatever
05:05 < bridge> <louis> hm only on steam deck ig
05:06 < bridge> <TsFredopile> You can install gamescope manually
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> if using dbeaver I like the “explain plan” option a lot because it’ll tell you what the optimizer is thinking
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing sticks out to me as apparently slow but i’m not that smart with sql
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> deen tho. he might know
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i apologize gorp i responded to the wrong message.
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i meant to respond to this
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it works fine but I get better latency in gamescope in a VT
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> what… Qt has its own detection system and the first thing it looks at is this env vat
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> do u mean qt5
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> what… Qt has its own detection system and the first thing it looks at is this env var
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> because that just doesn’t have a Wayland platform plugin
05:13 < bridge> <Ewan> it is, if you have nvidia i can share my big ol list of env vars
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/ewancg/shit/blob/main/nix/os/graphics/machine.nix>
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ^ nvidias
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/ewancg/shit/blob/main/nix/os/desktop/hyprland.nix>
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ^ wayland (hyprland session ones should be changed)
05:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve only gotten ddnet to work under xwayland specifically by virtue of hyprland’s implementation so idk how easy it’ll be to set up from scratch. i know for single-window game applications gamescope would provide better results (this is what steam uses on le deck)
05:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve only gotten ddnet to work under xwayland specifically by virtue of hyprland’s integration so idk how easy it’ll be to set up from scratch. i know for single-window game applications gamescope would provide better results (this is what steam uses on le deck)
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> gamescope with automatic backend detection should work the same as xwayland in this case, only con is you have to manually set window dimensions
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> gamescope with automatic backend detection in ur desktop should work the same as xwayland in this case, only con is you have to manually set window dimensions
05:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i was moved towards qt5
05:43 < bridge> <Ewan> why?
05:43 < bridge> <Ewan> last ver came out in 2020 unless you count the (enterprise only) lts extension
05:43 < bridge> <Ewan> you want them to use a time machine? they were on top of the wayland stuff from the start
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> Qt natively has the means to behave as a wayland compositor and they have a whole module for it
05:44 < bridge> <Ewan> big chads
05:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
05:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and they require an env var
05:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which isnt xdg_session_type
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like it falls back to what XDG says unless it has reason not to
06:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for the brief period when i tried wayland, everything wanted to use xwayland
06:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> chrome wanted platform ozone, gtk, qt and sdl wanted env vars, steam never worked, sdl needs one
06:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> chrome wanted platform ozone, gtk, qt and sdl wanted env vars, steam never worked
06:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> de have the advantage of being the people who are working on wayland
06:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how they get it to work so seemlessly
06:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if it does
07:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> aaaaaaaa
07:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> can things just use wayland
07:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> alreadu
07:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> already
07:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s very difficult in a lot of scenarios
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> afaik the pull request to get it in dolphin emu still hasn’t been merged
07:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we are not wayland yet till everything respects xdg_session_type
07:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> change my mind
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> SELECT r.name
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> FROM race r
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty>   JOIN maps m ON m.map = r.map
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> GROUP BY r.name
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> HAVING MAX(m.points) <= 8
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> LIMIT 1;
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> 
08:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> But compare with "explain" to be sure
08:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> im on x11
08:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cvery interesting, unfortunatley i have long deleted the 6gb of database
08:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doesnt the having max bit go on for ages
08:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like there could be a name with 1 4pt complettion very very far away with a 5pt one
08:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> = long
08:56 < bridge> <learath2> Based choice
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it just works for me
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont witch to wayland until it is polished
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> wayland is way less logical for the end user in a lot of fucking ways tho
09:08 < bridge> <Ewan> like, client side decorations are a joke for accessibility purposes
09:08 < bridge> <Ewan> and performance is not always better as far as i know
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> you have to opt out of certain niceties to benefit from it imo but even then it wouldn’t inherently be better than x
11:04 < bridge> <learath2> Old software keeps winning fr
11:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hmm well
11:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> after tweaking some stuff, everything works with xwayland-satellite
11:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i don't think any aspect of wayland is not "polished" its ofc a software thing
12:09 < bridge> <kebscs> this was a ready pr for like months now
12:09 < bridge> <kebscs> this is a ready pr for like months now

12:43 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how to recreate
13:29 < bridge> <robyt3> This should already be the case if the window wasn't active before. But if you switch to the window with alt+tab then it's already active and should also handle the next mouse click.

14:37 < bridge> <prozacpal> i want to get netmsg_clientver data on the server side in fng2

15:02 < bridge> <prozacpal> i did this:

15:02 < bridge> <prozacpal>         if(Msg == NETMSG_CLIENTVER)
15:02 < bridge> <prozacpal>         {

15:03 < bridge> <prozacpal> ```
15:03 < bridge> <prozacpal> but im stuck on the 'sending initial client info' screen
15:03 < bridge> <prozacpal> when entering the server
15:03 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet has this in code idk what initial client info
15:04 < bridge> <prozacpal> i already got it from the ddnet code
15:06 < bridge> <prozacpal> this code is works in ddnet source
15:06 < bridge> <prozacpal> the same code does not work in fng2
15:08 < bridge> <kebscs> idk then
15:14 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm fixed
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat ever used locks along with tokio?
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:25 < bridge> <sucrelol> Is there any way to have the list of the players name on DDNet as a file or website api request or anything that can be close to that.
16:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm a big rust async noob
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> async coloring is a pain sometimes
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure getting async correctly done in a language is the biggest hurdle
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat if u dont use, for example, tokio version of RwLock, which when u use .read() you have to .await then
16:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no async, no hurdles :santatrollet:
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u use the normal std rwlock
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant hold the lock
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> across await points
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> pain
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it makes sense
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> the lock guard is not send
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it makes u either:
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Carefully use the std locks to avoid holding them across await points (pain)
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Use tokio RwLock which can be held across await points, but you have to .await them, which means u have to convert any function wanting to use this lock to async, even if it only does that, getting the lock
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> also tokio rwlok is not refunwindsafe, so u cant catch_panic if u use it
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/trait.RefUnwindSafe.html
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/trait.RefUnwindSafe.html
16:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I should write something to get more familiar with async
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> 😭 why is there no solution
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> atleast put a ridiculous solution man
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> like 25221 21111 64
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> or smth
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> but there is none :(
16:42 < bridge> <teero777> unfun

16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Not like this is a trivial problem though, is it? Am I missing sth? Diophantine equations are a pain
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its extremely hard problem
16:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The meme is that you're taking the traditional caption "95% of people can't solve this" and making it *extremely* true by making sure that the real figure is closer to 99.9%
16:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there's a bunch of them and they're great
17:05 < bridge> <aegisub> in particular it's inevitable for there to be diophantine equations like these whose smallest solutions are massive
17:05 < bridge> <aegisub> diophantine equations are turing complete so there can't be some simple bound on smallest solutions based on the coefficients, otherwise you could just determine solvability by exhaustive search

17:23 < bridge> <aegisub> Given 🤪 and 🥕_i the condition that 🥕_i = 🥕 o 🍓_i for all i is equivalent to 🥕((🍏, i)) being equal to 🥕_i(🍏) for all i in 🍎 and all 🍏 in 🥭 _i. Since all elements of 😳 are of the form (🍏, i) for some i in 🍎 and some 🍏 in 🥭 by definition, this defines 🥕 uniquely. Moreover, every element of 😳 can in fact be uniquely written as (🍏, i), defining 🥕 in this way makes it well-defined, so there e

17:29 < bridge> <learath2> Is it even doable by hand btw?
17:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> @cyberfighter pls asmr
17:35 < bridge> <aegisub> it's very tedious but not impossible
17:36 < bridge> <aegisub> it's described in the aops post, and none of the individual computations are too hard
17:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like your funny words, magic man
17:37 < bridge> <aegisub> showing that it's the smallest solution is trickier though, you have to compute the rank of the curve for that
17:37 < bridge> <aegisub> you started it
17:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just picked the one that looked the most intimidating to me
17:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I skipped the one that was asking you to prove or disprove the Riemann hypothesis in fruits because I found that was a bit too on the nose
17:57 < bridge> <louis> lol aops blogs have some gems huh
17:58 < bridge> <louis> when i was on that site most of the blogs were troll
18:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @aegisub i didnt know ur a math guy thats cool
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> lately new ai slop about coding is out

19:14 < bridge> <gorp_tw> achieve a cryptic style !!!!
19:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> do we have any steam telemetry? like downloads to uninstalls
19:17 < bridge> <Ewan> No everyone else does but they told gaben they don’t want the numbers because it’s a violation of user privacy
19:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i mean it is
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> He had them patch the Steam servers to exclude DDNet
19:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i agree
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> true story
19:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> BUT
19:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> it would be really nice to know who is leaving the game forever in 1 minute
19:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i have this type of person in my head that is mostly theoretical but mythical
19:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and it would be nice to know how big this group is
19:20 < bridge> <gorp_tw> IME as soon as someone gets that first drop of "hey you can do cool shit with another tee" they are much less likely to leave and will hop on for day 2
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i got a stable full of hoes
19:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> getting them in game with real players quickly and with decent retention is really important to me, because the elitist mentality does more of a disservice to the game, I think it deserves to be popular really
19:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm gonna write a 100 page manifesto
19:30 < bridge> <vahemaaa> hello @sollybunny sry for ping, what about adding `cl_nameplates_same_clan_color`?

19:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think that should be default behaviour
