01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or someone could go ahead and figure out what actually causes the velramp crash, I couldn't really debug it
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 gdb?
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> debug build of course
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing is recreating the crash
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i talked with learath we couldnt find how
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even setting the same tune zone values
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it happened on official servers?
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then we should have core dumps
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if testservers count as official...
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes i think on official
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9084277
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tunes used in maps
12:12 <@deen> quite a few negative values, see
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we surpassed 400GB of uncompressed teehistorian data yesterday
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Apply my fix @heinrich5991
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991  is that a new record or what
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum no, it just accumulates more and more data
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we'll have 1.0TB of uncompressed data by february 2019 or so
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> aah
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it stored on some of the admins personal harddrives?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yours? ðŸ˜„
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and on @Learath2's and @deen's
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so, you guys just constantly have a download going on forever now?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kinda
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> couple of times per day
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats kind of funny tbh ðŸ˜„
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why dont you only save finishes and when you have 1tb full it deletes the oldest recordings (non finish)
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because we wanted to be able to accurately replay finishes
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> teehsitorian sucks
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so you want the movements before entring the startline
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> yes
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://www.amazon.de/Seagate-Desktop-interne-Festplatte-SATA/dp/B005T3GRNW
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats only 100â‚¬ to harddrives per year from now on then
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure u can get a better deal with some aws services
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> amazon sells some super cheap storage as far as i know
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://diskprices.com/
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum I mirror these files across two hard drives, so one can fail. I also have mirrored backups of these files ðŸ˜›
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> mirrored means?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the same file is on two hard drives, so if one fails, we still have that file
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> aah
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> back when I designed teehistorian, I made a quick estimate of ~1GB/day
14:39 <+Learath2> on the slight chance that any of you here know physics... could a massless spring conserve mechanical energy? :P
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we deemed that acceptable, so that we could buy hard drives faster than we accumulated data ðŸ™‚
14:40 <+Learath2> also heinrich5991 my cron apparently failed again...
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> as i understand mechanical energy. almost everything conserves it
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no wait im confused with potential energy now
14:42 <+Learath2> yeah but a massless spring can't store any kinetic energy, pull on it with F, you do work F(dx) it gets energy 1/2k(dx)^2, there is 1/2kx_max amount of energy missing
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so youre wondering if it would bounce back at all after pulling on it?
14:44 <+Learath2> it would always bounce back, I'm wondering whether it would keep going after I let go of it (impossible as it cant have any kinetic energy) and also wondering where is the other half of the energy going
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there are no massless springs
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> aah
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and there are also no massless cars in the vacuum speeding on the highway
14:45 <+Learath2> we do assume that in a lot of elementary physics questions
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but in physics lessons, we have models ðŸ˜‰
14:45 <+Learath2> also no massless strings :P
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but don't you have a mass attached to the massless spring?
14:46 <+Learath2> nope
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2's doesn't
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have another question: if i have a stick thats 1 lightyear long and one one end there is a button and i push the other end, didnt i transfer information faster than light?
14:47 <+Learath2> there is some energy missing and it kinda bothers me, I account it to "A non-real construct does not need to obey to the conservation of energy" but not sure if that's valid
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, because the stick on the other side doesn't move at the same time
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'd compress the stick instead
14:48 <+Learath2> say the stick is completely incompressable :)
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it can't be incompressable
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> black hole stick
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ðŸ˜„
14:48 <+Learath2> the perfect stick, an ideal stick :D
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you'd have faster than light communication
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, this is where this model displays inconsistent statements with reality
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like: when we add speeds, it's fine in day-to-day physics
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when we do it on relativistic levels, it's not
14:51 <+Learath2> I find the laser pointer one much nicer btw, take laser pointer, point it to the moon, with a flick you can move the dot from one end of the moon to the other, what sorcery?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not really i think
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would light, in this lenth, be like a floppy water stream?
14:53 <+Learath2> not really, light always takes the shortest route
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Just an apparent motion, not a real one, like moving a stick diagnoally at c
14:54 <+Learath2> deen: yeah, still kinda cute that you can actually have sth moving faster then light
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can have things move faster than light in diamond ðŸ˜›
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's only 200 000 km/s in there ðŸ˜›
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because light is slower there...
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but in truth the light is same speed, it's just bouncing around, right?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fSqFWcb4rE  is this real?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but the trick is to film it millions of times
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and take a photo at different times
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in each filming
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wow
14:55 <+Learath2> actually, they also used reconstruction
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it's not a single light stream you're watching
14:56 <+Learath2> from what i understood from a paper that's definitely above my understanding of physics that is
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> couldnt i just use a lot of cameras that are alligned inbetween their fps and make it a one taker. if i somehow manage to make them look through one lense?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought their main problem is storing the data quickly enough
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and how do you plan to switch the lens? you have a mirror that's moving faster than light?
14:58 <+Learath2> they'd need to store around a petabyte of data per second with horrible bitrate, i really think it's mostly reconstructed from the few frames they grab
15:00 <+Learath2> physics while fun to discuss, is pretty darn boring to study sadly
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> most of science is boring
15:01 <+Learath2> natural sciences yeah I guess not too fun
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no, i meant there are a lot of people that say the like science and its so fun. but tbh its just the results of it thats cool. who actually cares how exactly they landed on the moon in detail?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no, i meant there are a lot of people that say they like science and its so fun. but tbh its just the results of it thats cool. who actually cares how exactly they landed on the moon in detail?
15:04 <+Learath2> I'd read that one, what's boring for me is all the memorization for memorizations sake
15:04 <+Learath2> especially in biology for example, all you do is memorizing random shit
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I guess I was lucky with my "Modern Physics for Computer Scientists". It was more about discussing fun concepts, how they can be used for CS, and not so much math and theory behind ðŸ˜„
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> biology is really cool, but I never remembered the names indeed
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really liked biology in high school but I'm sure it's the reason that I can't remember anything nowadays, it burned my temporal lobe ðŸ˜›
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (I had physics as minor in BS, biology as minor in MS)
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Getting Phys1 now :/ I should actually study for that one
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ds9a.nl/amazing-dna/
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See for example
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> dna is really impressive, they even have a stopcode, it's like someone actually coded it ðŸ˜›
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> funny how nature came to the same conclusion we came to in computer science
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and i barely made it through grade 10 and didn't even try a-level.

15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> why doesn everyone in TW study until age 25
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn = does or doesn't?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh.  does*
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 18 when finished with high school, 1 year break, 3 years bachelor, 2 years master = 24
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 16 when i finished school. started working from then on
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> at least i dont work at Mc donalds
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Linux nerds play TW because nothing else works on Linux, and they keep studying because they are too lazy to work ðŸ˜„
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> they could as well start neet life if they are too lazy
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> dropping school and starting working can be a deadly mistake if you lose your one job
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> employers like diplomas for some reason, even tho they are pointless imho
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk where you live but its not a regular job. you just kind of switch between school and work and after 3.5 years you get your diploma
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, not useless, you prove that you can pick up new topics and study, and end up with some related education that might be relevant for the job
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk if thats a german thing or if every country does it so
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and how does that relate to my ability to code in C? I'm yet to learn anything interesting and I doubt the math analysis will be of any use in my future
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum it's quite popular in Germany ("Ausbildung"), and originated in the middle ages in Europe for the city jobs that needed a few years of training
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum now that one sounds useful
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 In CS there's obviously a disconnect, since most CS people end up in software engineering instead
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> after i have that diploma i can start the same kind of job at anothe rplace but i dont have to learn it first so i can make real money.
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> "real money"   its not a lot but its more than only 860â‚¬ per month
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm actually studying CEng, which seems to have even more of a disconnect then usual
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> disconnect?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does it mean?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> plug out lan cable and wait
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> disconnect as in the things we learn at school are not really useful to the jobs we end up doing
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen pls fix my map GetSpeed2 and delete first rank

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 i think heinrich was against the change konsti just posted because it uses a glitch
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> im not "lazy" i just dont forget things 1 week after they happened @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti n
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> nice try tho
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Like dozens of maps using glitches
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is there any chance that someone here used pcsx2 emulator for windows?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did long time ago
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i bot everyday
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i am to retarded to use it.  it kind of worked yesterday. but now i changed a bit and nothing works anymore.      ffs i only want to play gran tourismo 4 again.:feelsbadman:      anyway. iam on their forum now.
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> gran turismo
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> good old memories
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ikr.
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> tekken
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> fifa street
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have 3 copies of gran tourismo4
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> budokai
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also got shitload of ps2 games but the ps2 is broken
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :danAmazing:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah. my ps2 can only play a few games anymore and gt4 was the first that wnet down. thats why i bought new copis bcs i hoped its the disc
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i got like 2 ps2's that i never use
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> send
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> its like fifteen euros here
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> XD
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i got them since like 2012
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i even have the old logitech wheel with the GT logo. still works great
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i remember the game
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> rc revenge
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> all the other games used to work (before i fucked up the emulator)  just gt4 didnt and its the only game i care for >.<
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> gta sa was fun
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I preferred gta sa on pc

17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something wrong with your disk?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the CRC of the map inside the demo is wrong, so likely the map wasn't written properly
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my disk works fine
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i newly donwloaded the map
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but since i could play fine on the server it had no problems i guess
18:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vpR6j
18:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8225077 def: Explicit type conversion
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should have used a `!!` to make it confusing
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> should have used `!a!=!!b` to make it look extra sexy
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then maybe it's taking the wrong map into the demo. have a way to reproduce @ChillerDragon ?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsbadman:
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen unique ger fly server and as i said win10 ddnet 11.1.4 fresh download of flying2fruity
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt try agian im not at pc anymore
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> can i use bots and not get banned
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, just play on your own server and not on DDNet
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @deen can i bot on fake name and not get banned in my main name
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen pls convince @qshar reenable https download on Kog servers, my brother say a real gores player already have all gores maps :feelsbadman:
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why did he disable it in the first place?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Incompalibility with [boz]clients
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Incompalibility with [bot]clients
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ? if http downloads are on on a server you cant use bot clients?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> He said some nobo clients 2 bad
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't even make sense wtf, http downloads are a client feature
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @Learath2

23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how can he even disable it ðŸ˜› If it's on our map server you can do http download from our server with ddnet client
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if we have KoG maps on there though
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> nobo
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> he disabled on KoG servers
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he can't
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fokkobot is lying
23:17 <+Henningstone> aren't you guys maybe talking about fastdl instead of http download?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the map is available on maps.ddnet.tw it will be downloaded from there
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, if it's fastdl there are some badly coded shitclients that fail on it ðŸ˜›
