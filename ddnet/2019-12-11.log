01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> help
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> am linux noob
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> when i alt+tab to teeworlds when i have another window open it just randomly changes the resolution
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> like i'll be playin 16:9 fullscreen, tab to discord, tab back, and like boom now its 3:4 all of a sudden
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> also how do i compile ddnet on linux?
08:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @louis https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/#building-on-linux-and-macos
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @louis `gfx_resizable 0` is what you want
14:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg thats awesome thanks @Patiga i was wondering what messed up my tabbing xxD
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ah ok
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it intentional that top5 with negative number is in reverse order? looks kinda odd
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> to see the bottom 5 etc
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what he meant is that it doesnt show the same if you write `/top5 -1` or `/top5 <last rank>`
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its inverted
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on filescore it does, but not on sql score
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what he meant is that it doesnt show the same if you write `/top5 -1` or `/top5 <last rank - 5>`
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon while you added /map and random map and all that stuff you forgot about file score. you need to define functions and variables there too, even if they dont do anything. they need to be able to get called when there is no sql
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen but if i want to see the worst rank i expect the last entry of /top5 -1 to be the worst not the first its in reverse order 
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .99
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .98
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .97
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .96
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .95
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh fokk just explained sry for dup
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any issue with /map or do i have to look in my irc client? xd
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idkj
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> while i was cherry picking i wasnt able to build, i have SQL turned off. I thought you forgot to also add the funciotns and stuff to filescore but i think it was just me
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen you can remove the motd "download ddnet client for 64p", vanilla client supports 64 already
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut really? when did vanilla 0.6 client add it?
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> i thought it was 0.7 only
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i meant ofc on 0.7 server
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because there the same MOTD appears
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not the one with map info in it, it just says download ddnet client
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Guys, website's jekyll (iirc) can handle `.scss` files, or do I have to stick to `.css`?
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> @deen maybe check if NUT_race5 & Nut_race
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> is in record_maps 
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> if yes
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94>  delete Nut_race5 from record_maps keep NUT_race5 (with the current date)
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> 
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> same with     
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <teini94> run_inTheHell
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> why?
21:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> he wants to hack ddnet :monkaS:
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ddos> Ddos
