10:12 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 debian be like ... https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659946301.png
10:12 <+ChillerDragon> do i need to compile wireshark from source? :D
10:12 <+ChillerDragon> or does it have todo with me putting it in ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/3.4/epan/ as it suggests in the readme
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, isn't there an entity which has no collision to the player and the hook, but has collision for weapon projectiles?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> If not, then I would like to help making designs for new entities like that
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> weapon tele?
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 oke nice i compiled wireshark 3.6 from source and put it in 3.6/epan to get it working :) maybe it makes sense to update the readme
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> Would be nice if this packet would have some info too :) https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659952021.png
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> it should be NET_CTRLMSG_ACCEPT
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> or ctrl.accept in your lingo
11:58 <+ChillerDragon> what the hell github? is this some profile styling thing or is this real? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659952695.png
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm thats the status :D what a troll he is really fucking his own reputation
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: theoretically, this message doesn't exist anymore: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d3fc0807d5f59d88661c8e58854805b064db3c4d
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> wot
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> my server still sends it
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> wait the commit you sent added the message so it is practically there
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you're right
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: should be fixed
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> weap tele won't do instantanious blowups, right?
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> otherwise, i would've done that
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> weap tele do instantanious blowups, right?
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> weap tele does instantanious blowups, right?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> But yeah, you can use tele to teleport out projectiles, but it's not what I want to point out. there is no entity which has hitbox to projectiles only, so that it's similar to the hook-blocking entity (the one with all direction and and one with one direction blocks)
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> omg its sending the token in wrong ednianess aaaa
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> how did that happen :D
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait is this code flippin the endianness?```c
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aBuffer[i++] = (pPacket->m_Token>>24)&0xff; // token
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aBuffer[i++] = (pPacket->m_Token>>16)&0xff;
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aBuffer[i++] = (pPacket->m_Token>>8)&0xff;
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aBuffer[i++] = (pPacket->m_Token)&0xff;
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fakin bitflippas
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit yes!
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> omg its working
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: what are you doing?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, tokens don't really have an endianness, just send them out the same way you received them
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Well they ended up wrong.Im trying to support connecting to 0.7 servers with ddnet Client.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's what you wanted to use my dissector for? ^^
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea for debugging.
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool 🙂
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But my 0.7 server is already printing pretty much the same information but still very cool to have a dissector
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> Good morning or evening, could you explain to me how to create an xp system, I mean by making a kill you get a point
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA4ENrxzXvY
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> oh
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> thanks
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> can you tell me where i start work
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> in what file or where
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> but i need it with a register and login, so u can save your points 😬
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> its all in the video and video series
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> also on how to create a account using chat commands
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> i could send you some filenames but not sure how much that helps. What code base do you use ddnet or teeworlds? Anyways gamecontext.cpp and ddracechat.cpp are good files to look at
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> vscode
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> just skip through the videos if you are only interetested in the general idea
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> oh wait what do you mean with it
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> im using ddnet
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> and an xp system like BlmapChill? i mean farming from staying in a tile
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> 1 xp and money per sec
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> fokkonaut tell me to look https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> i did not cover farmtiles yet but good idea i can do that
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> you can do those in character.cpp
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 if you are interested in ddnet with accounts and farmtiles you can also try https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP sadly it is not very stable right now
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> thanks!
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> amh what i have to do xd
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> for farmtiles?
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> you can define tiles in this file https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3273781d3f577bb6dba16b3d19d4e9e73fbd6e8a/src/game/mapitems.h
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> ohhh
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> ddnet++
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> how can i use it
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> and then their logic here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3273781d3f577bb6dba16b3d19d4e9e73fbd6e8a/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1394
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> okay
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 its a ddnet server you just start it and then you can use chat commands in game like /register and so on
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> is like a normal ddnet?
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> it is like normal ddnet + accounts and a few other additions
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> how can i start the client xd
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> there is no client
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> its server only
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> only files?
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> did you ever start a teeworlds server? -.-
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yes..
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases/download/v.0.0.7/windows_DDNetPP.exe
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> but not like that
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> here is a exe that you can just double click to run
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> that build is from 2019 so its quite outdated i recommend building it from source
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i need it for?
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> do you know how to compile ddnet source code?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:cagentpatpat:785420444924248085>
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> D:
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> well then i recommend starting with that
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> before you think about writing code
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsoGOfBqPns
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Netsu_07 i already told you to look at the building instructions on github.com/ddnet/ddnet like 1 hour ago :D
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> works the same way for ddnet
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i know i just send you 30 messages but ur more interested to trash talk with ur friends
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> xd
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, you wrote me "send portal files plz"
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> before that
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do you delete your message
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> im talking with you not 50 people
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i mean
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they can see it anyways
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> 1930 people
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i know
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like not
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> foko shat
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> im trying to learn with chiller not with you
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do you delete your message
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut @Netsu_07 please stop taunting each other
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 chill, its a player from my server...
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> nice reason xd
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> cyber police arrived !
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> what is your final goal even @Netsu_07 ?
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> and how much work are you willing to put in?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i can spend 5 hours a day into that
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> make a good server, not a trash one
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> im trying to learn
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> so
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XxJoelMexX> KOG BRA ?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> block server
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XxJoelMexX> SIM
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XxJoelMexX> 😠
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> wha?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XxJoelMexX> 😦
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 okay so i really recommend getting the source code to compile and then do a few changes to it and see how that works
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> 5Gb of visual studio
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> wow
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> yes
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> okay
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> thats why i asked about your commitment
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> the first step is the hardest
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yea xd
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> chiller is that?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006267110680432680/Cattura.PNG
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i have to dowloand vscode after right?
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> you dont have to
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> this step is optional
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> oh
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> thats grate
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> i personally think vscode is nicer than visual studio as its more lightweight and faster
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> but you can also use visual studio to edit the code which makse sense if you use it to compile as well
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> mh
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> could you tell me all the steps i will have to do? I mean by learning how to create map systems
20:30 <+ChillerDragon> no i can not "tell you all the steps [..] to create map systems" in this chat
20:31 <+ChillerDragon> I do not even know what "create map systems" is 
20:31 <+ChillerDragon> You seem to have a very complex goal. I can not give you detailed instructions on all of it. But as I said to get started developing in ddnet you need to be able to compile and then you can play around with the code to get familiar
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> my youtube series gives some examples and is designed for complete beginners to get their hands dirty https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB_aSIOmdu4&list=PLhJkqAQmOh5LyYOfnMy4PJB6CSZltQyTc its made for teeworlds not ddnet but the concepts are pretty much the same and you can apply it to ddnet code. I usually mention what woud be different in ddnet
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> and then you can tackle your bigger goals of build a full ddnet mod. Start with small goals and go step by step
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> this mork even for ddnet?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> or only teeworlds
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i arl did that
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> bit my teeworlds is bugged like shit xd
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> how is it bugged?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> all the fonts are bugged
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i send u a photo
20:37 <+ChillerDragon> make sure your data folders are in the right location
20:38 <+ChillerDragon> you need a data folder next to the client that you start
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> finally a tutorial to teach a monkey(me) how to compile this, and i like how the volume keep getting lower:kek:
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006270314650550374/Cattura.PNG
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> have you tried other language?
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> @cheeser0613 somehow i always fuck up sound
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> nop
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> wait
20:39 <+ChillerDragon> ou that screen looks cursed :D 
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yea xd
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> visual studio is dowloand
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> grate
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Disable texture compression
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i will start
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> ?
20:40 <+ChillerDragon> well you are interested in server development anyways so you can ignore the client
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> In graphic settings inside the game
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Then restart
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> what do you mean cursed, it looks normal to me
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006270770202300466/unknown.png
20:40 <+ChillerDragon> CHINA be like :D 
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> latest version has better symbol support
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> aaa thanks
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> is fixed
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> jopstar pro
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> u can ask him anything gfx related
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> hhahaha
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> he is founder of amd
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> chiller so i do that?
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> yes
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I made rtx 4090 single handed
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> wat ever "that" is 
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> and i start modify some codes?
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar amd rtx 4090 :d
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Yes
20:42 <+ChillerDragon> yes gogogo hack away
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> 4090x
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> 8080
20:43 <+ChillerDragon> 3000
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> pink rat
20:46 <+Konsti> Serious question: Why is the name "Niger" banned on DDNet? Its a country in Africa and a State in Nigeria. Pretty racist lol
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> is it?
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> isnt there a active player with a way more offensive name?
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> I can hear heinrich furiously breathing in my neck
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> "please do not discuss rules"
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> admins words are final and authority should never be doubted in public chat in the ddnet state
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> discussing rules is a bannable offense
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> Konsti: maybe some trol used it to be offensive and then someone tried to fix the situation
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont say that or u get banned, i already got timed out for explaining smth
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Let's start a revolution chillerdragon
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> last revolution got ryo (the best mod) kicked from staff
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> no chance
20:51 <+Konsti> Ryo became good based goy after he was kicked
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> Konsti even has to use irc
20:51 <+Konsti> i like IRC
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> OKE
20:51 <+Konsti> no accounts=good
20:51 <+ChillerDragon> yes irc is good
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> but that fact that you need a "no accounts" place to be able to freely speak is sad
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> censornet
20:52 <+Konsti> deen is the best admin
20:53 < fokkonaut> true
20:53 <+ChillerDragon> all hail deen
20:54 <+fokkonaut> i rqed discord cuz of heinrich
20:54 <+Konsti> xd
20:55 <+Konsti> understandable
20:55 <+Konsti> some admins try too much to influence players and chat behaviour. That doesnt work in a game full of emotions and people of all countrys
20:56 <+ChillerDragon> mimimimi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance
20:56 <+fokkonaut> true Konsti
20:56 <+fokkonaut> dont hate me but he might just close off the bridge so i cant type here haha
20:56 <+Konsti> rip
20:56 <+fokkonaut> i smell it
20:56 <+ChillerDragon> a wot
20:57 <+ChillerDragon> no riot in my irc pls :c
20:57 <+ChillerDragon> i live here
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No u
21:01 <+fokkonaut> no u
21:02 <+ChillerDragon> learath dont ghost pink rat he asked question :c
21:03 <+ChillerDragon> Konsti: btw why do you even care?
21:03 <+ChillerDragon> do you want to play with that name? or just curious?
21:03 <+Konsti> curious
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> black lives matter
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> because
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What was the question?
21:07 <+Konsti> [20:46] <+Konsti> Serious question: Why is the name "Niger" banned on DDNet? Its a country in Africa and a State in Nigeria. Pretty racist lol
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> d
21:08 <+fokkonaut> It's actually also a pre-name
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It probably got banned because it is within 1 levenshtein distance of the racial slur you love so much
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Namebans we do with levenshtein distance 1 or 2 by default if the word is long enough
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> but there is a player using the name with 0 levenstein distance?
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> or used to be maybe he is banned now :c his points are still there
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm in the middle of the Mediterranean. Mine is just a guess
21:15 <+ChillerDragon> is "guy" banned? hrhrhr
21:16 <+ChillerDragon> i red "Mediterranean mine"
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "gay" isn't banned either afaik
21:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah
21:16 <+ChillerDragon> because gay is not a insult :p
21:16 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet very anti lgbtq+
21:17 <+ChillerDragon> i mean queer ppl also use the term gay but most players using that name use it in a negative sense
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes so anti lgbtqiaa2s+ that we famously ban all of them
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> tripple iaa standard
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> wotefek is that xd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't follow it anymore either.
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> well its no secret that homophobia is widly ignored/accepted in ddnet
21:20 <+fokkonaut> but u get banned if u say 1 thing against "moderation"
21:20 <+ChillerDragon> i guess you can not make it right for anyone
21:20 <+ChillerDragon> everyone*
21:20 <+ChillerDragon> omg english is hard
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > well its no secret that homophobia is widly ignored/accepted in ddnet
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I try to work against that; ingame moderation tools are limited unfortunately
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can't fix things not reported to us
21:22 <+ChillerDragon> its not about big incidents
21:22 <+ChillerDragon> its more like that it is common sense that "gay part" means "bad part"
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > but u get banned if u say 1 thing against "moderation"
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that refers to getting muted for discussing moderator actions
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> most of the users have nothing against gays but that wording still gives convidence to those who actually mean it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > its more like that it is common sense that "gay part" means "bad part"
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although I wouldn't use that word this way, I wouldn't say that this is what I'd understand when you say 'ddnet has a problem with homophobia'
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also in the dictionary, with that meaning
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > (slang, derogatory) Used to express dislike: lame, uncool, stupid.
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> i know "gay" as happy?
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> not lame
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > i know "gay" as happy?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not really in use anymore
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> maybe im just too conservative then haha
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it falls more under the 'thou hast angered me' category
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> should ask some queers if they feel offended by that
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> fokkonaut: do you mind me saying "gay" hrhrhhr
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> ok lame joke sorry
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> wotefek is "thou hast angered me" :D
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> older english
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly always found this discussion silly. Words have different connotations in different regions in different contexts. Calling a part gay has nothing to do with homophobia but just habitual speech. Does "fuck" really have anything to do with intercourse in most contexts?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sanitization of language is a silly liberal fetish. Do you think banning the use of words will change the opinions of people?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> A so only Shakespeare uses gay as happy
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I am with you to some degree. But nobody gets offended by fuck. Using a minority as a synonym for bad normalized discrimination imo
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It creates a bad stigma even if it’s just a joke
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It becomes a very thin line if those jokes really get into details of the sexual orientation
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And do you think banning people that are not actually homophobic for habitual speech will fix homophobia?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think banning the n-word made Konsti less of a white supremacist?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> To that degree that it took me way to long to realize that one dude in tw Chat honestly had proper hate against gays
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No I don’t think that
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im against censor
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just wanted to point out how I feel about that
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I don’t approve the tolerance Paradoxon
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I prefer anarchy
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anarchy means I kick you out because I have +o?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that's bad anarchy
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Anarchy in the sense of nobody with kick rights
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Everyone has the same power
21:33 <+Konsti> lmao heinrich you cannot apply "western standards" to a worldwide community with mostly very conservative religious playerbase. You one one side have strict christians in East Europe and Latinamerica and on the other Hand strict Muslims in a big part. xD You cant force them your subjective opinion about Morality 
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not just anarchy, who is stopping people from getting more power?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddos is anarchy 😉
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can tell them not to insult others, regardless of where they're from
21:35 <+fokkonaut_> PuBliC mOdERatIoN DiscUsSIonS wILl bE bAnnEd
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please stop it 😦
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes it’s not all good. But rules don’t help against ddos either
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
21:35 <+Konsti> that is, regardless where they from, a common thing in an emotional game like teeworlds. This isnt a safe space
21:35 <+fokkonaut_> @heinrich5991 just see how you treat me, LOL
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't said a word about 'safe spaces'
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I just like environments where admins don’t use their power to enforce rules. That’s what I mean by anarchy
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just said "I can tell them not to insult others, regardless of where they're from"
21:36 <+fokkonaut_> ok nvm bro xD
21:36 <+Konsti> and having different views on lgbt is not your business because not all the world shares your opinion xD. You wouldnt even find staff in chile servers to make people stop that
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and if you disagree with that, I'll be happy to show you the door, Konsti
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 'having different views on lgbt' doesn't mean you get to insult people
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just being an asshole
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not anarchy. That requires some sort of all powerful entity to keep everyone equal or requires everyone to be all powerful
21:37 <+fokkonaut_> I definitely wasnt kept equal for heinrich ^^
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some sort of messed up socialism
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes. Totally agree
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (<@749222324980416602_=5bquakenet=5d=20=4bonsti>)
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anarcho communism of sorths
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't get where you come from that you think it's okay to insult people if they're from a certain subgroup
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but only then
21:38 <+Konsti> i mean im glad ddnet has pretty low level of moderation, otherwise i would be lifebanned and i agree there should be a minimum level of "behaviour" but damn let people express their emotions if they die after 4h of playing xD
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give an example of behavior you wouldn't want to be banned, Konsti?
21:39 <+fokkonaut_> saying "chill" to you, thanks
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I mean. A admin should implement code to enforce rules not human decisions
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
21:39 <+Konsti> doesnt mean they have to shout "NI****" but crying in caps and calling someone a retard shouldnt be punished because its emotions
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How could code that cant even figure out the structure of sentences figure out what hate speech is
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Like use antibot code to ban bots and allow alll chat usage. Whoever is offended can use client side mute feature. And there is no need for a admin to punish users manually
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just allow hate speech
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And let every user censor them self what they dislike
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But ye I get it kids game and all
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you do this?
21:41 <+fokkonaut> make tw 18+
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You make your own community and allow hate speech a là 4chan
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It’s not that I want to do hate speech. I just wan to speak freely and discuss rules without the constant fear or getting banned by ddnet staff due to their disagreement
21:42 <+fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
21:42 <+fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You spam, then you wonder why you get banned
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bizarre behaviour
21:42 <+fokkonaut> Didnt spam
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When did you ever get banned for discussing rules? There is very little you ever get banned for. Grossly offensive speech is the only thing that comes to mind
21:44 <+Konsti> you get instantly banned for discussing rules
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discussing specific moderator actions is a mute
21:44 <+Konsti> "creating drama"
21:45 <+fokkonaut> I got timed out today for saying "chill he is from my server"
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti: We are discussing rules right now. Are you banned?
21:45 <+fokkonaut> heinrichs reason was: dont judge my moderation
21:45 <+fokkonaut> LMAO
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh i did. get banned and muted a lot
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Not recently but it happens
21:46 <+Konsti> and discussing mods... lmao. Censorship really doesnt help. Admins absolutely dont care about reports. So you ban one by one unless someone is so bad that it creates a shitstorm
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discussing specific moderator action*
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And we ofc care about reports, recently a mod was removed due to player reports
21:49 <+fokkonaut> > unless someone is so bad that it creates a shitstorm
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Imo it creates a toxic environment when there is a administrator that decides what is allowed to say and what is not
21:51 <+fokkonaut> F3
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I do not feel like I can speak freely in here
21:51 <+fokkonaut> heinrichs response once: "you cant"
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And I would not call my self a hateful or edgy person
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yet you still do speak extremely freely
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How do you know what I hold back?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are responsible for the kind of speech on our servers. I'm sorry. We don't want to allow hate speech. It's very simple
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I wouldn‘t consider disagreeing with a admin hate speech
21:52 <+fokkonaut> was just about to say tha
21:53 <+fokkonaut> t
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How hard it is to not just be hateful of others? Literally 3 rules. Keep personal drama in DMs, don't use hare speech, don't talk about specific moderator actions
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It’s the last part
21:54 <+fokkonaut> You see how good rule #3 works? Disallowing things never worked in history, you should simply talk openly about it, make clear what is happening, instead of (maybe) having conflicts based on misunderstandings.
21:54 <+fokkonaut> aka heinrichs judgements
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Idk why you guys want to be able to say the n word so badly
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Instead of reporting his supposedly horrible action to any of the admins you've been going on about it with an open racist and a libertarian. How sure are you that his moderation action was wrong,m
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Missed the pint
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Dr.Funmanteddy)
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Point
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> not really
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> you say you want anarachy
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and thats dumb af
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are so confident he made a gross mistake, go report it to any of us. Do you think heinrich controls all 5 of the admins?
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> its not a restriction of your liberties to be able to not use hate speech to others
21:56 <+fokkonaut> @Learath2 I go with nobody, I am just agreeing with Chiller that its better not to censor talking about moderators' actions. LOL
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to be fair, they're currently talking about the rule "do not discuss specific moderator actions"
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I prefer toxic messages from people without power that I can mute. Over toxic admins that censor me for everyone based on their emotions
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In reality you know you've been acting like a total degenerate for the last 3 months, that's why you go on about it publicly trying to get fringe people on your side
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> different debate
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i say you saying you think hate speech shouldnt be banned
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> saw*
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Multiple admins exist. If you think one of us muted you for emotional reasons. Just report it to another
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> idk if the admins are toxic or not
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not you, fokkonaut
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> from what ive seen they have be doing a good job
21:58 <+fokkonaut> @Learath2 in reality its you being a degenerate, lol. It started with your anger :) I just dont want to keep it silent anymore, since of course in that situation you were "not the one to make a mistake" :D Of course, cuz an admin can not do any mistakes.
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea it’s okay sure.
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Until it isn’t \:d
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I want a revolution. Then u can call myself revolutionary, and that's pretty badass
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And if it isn’t there is no space for conversation anymore
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> wow the slippery slope fallacy
22:00 <+fokkonaut> @learath2 instead of solving things diplomatically you try to push one to the corner and try to hide your own mistakes.
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't want to keep it silent. Yet you didn't even try complaining to another admin. You just went and made vague accusations
22:02 <+fokkonaut> What kinda admin writes "In reality you know you've been acting like a total degenerate for the last 3 months, that's why you go on about it publicly trying to get fringe people on your side"?
22:02 <+fokkonaut> As an answer to "I go with nobody, I am just agreeing with Chiller that its better not to censor talking about moderators' actions. LOL"
22:03 <+fokkonaut> So much to the topic hate speech
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Simple, it wasnt an answer to that
22:03 <+fokkonaut> Well, it doesnt matter whether it was a direct answer or not
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fokkonaut: please report problems with specific moderator actions to other admins, not in public chat. this is your last warning
22:04 <+fokkonaut> What? I was just referring to the last messages he wrote
22:04 <+ChillerDragon> what was the reason for that rule again?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm a bit late, sorry
22:04 <+fokkonaut> Yea heinrich, better check the history and see it yourself
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also @Learath2 and fokkonaut, calling others degenerate is clearly insulting
22:04 <+ChillerDragon> What about a ddnet server where there are no chat rules? o.O
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> host one ChillerDragon
22:05 <+ChillerDragon> i offer it to deen every year
22:05 <+ChillerDragon> he declines
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> host one outside of DDNet
22:05 <+ChillerDragon> i do that since always
22:05 <+ChillerDragon> but i can not get ddnet points and use the chat freely
22:05 <+ChillerDragon> for example using chat bots and similar
22:05 <+fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Look. If an admin that tries to go against us disliking such rules comes with insults around the corner, why should I say "hey, bro, very nice of you, thanks!"
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you shouldn't insult people
22:06 <+fokkonaut> @Learathj2
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Not possible if you have more than >10 players ^^
22:06 <+ChillerDragon> heat has to go somewhere 
22:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Avolicious hm?
22:06 <+ChillerDragon> omg discord replys
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and another person also doing that isn't an excuse
22:06 <+ChillerDragon> i rq
22:06 <+fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 no, of course its not, im not saying that, but do you see how you prefer him again over me?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 hasn't been insulting me in DMs in the last couple of hours, last that I checked
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also pinged him
22:07 <+fokkonaut> I havent insulted you either
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Insults aren't hate speech. The way you have been acting for the last 3 months, I just haven't found any words to describe it better
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Hosting a service for all kinds of people comes with responsibility, by law and 3rd parties
22:07 <+fokkonaut> I told you what I dislike, cuz you muted me for "public moderation discussion"
22:07 <+fokkonaut> > Insults aren't hate speech. The way you have been acting for the last 3 months, I just haven't found any words to describe it better
22:08 <+fokkonaut> Ah, and you felt attacked by the freeze change
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> complain to other admins, not in public chat fokkonaut
22:09 <+fokkonaut> Well, if learath insults me and has so much anger he doesnt know where to put, and you keep ignoring the important questions i asked u in dm, then where else should i go? Why do you make yourself an enemy if only I want to solve things diplomatically and with same rights for everyone in here?
22:09 <@heinrich5991> (kicked)
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> @ChillerDragon, just read JuSchG ( Jugendschutzgesetz ) in germany ( esp. Abs. 3 §10 a, b )
22:09 <+fokkonaut_> Very original.
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> " if only I want to solve things diplomatically", that always don't sound good
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
22:09 <+fokkonaut_> Maybe keep out if you dont have a clue
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I saw your convos with heinrich too
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> i pretty much know
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://tenor.com/view/why-cant-we-be-friends-freddie-kreuger-darth-vader-dracula-jason-voorhees-gif-5469319
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> <3
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not particularly angry tbf
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if you don't trust me to take proper action either there is still deen, murpi and snail
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I made the IRC channel moderated, and kicked Nimda which voiced all joining people
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5 people with admin rights, yet you don't believe a single one will agree with you. Could it maybe be that maybe you are in the wrong here?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, at least I installed an IRC client on my new laptop now
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> As I learned things from here, it's never a good thing to blame others if you cannot see the problem in the first place and somehow fokko's conversation kinda proves that he likes to dodge solutions for those problems and just want to create more out of spite or hate
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yeah makes sense
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> fokkoff-naut :gigachad:
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf: please ban fokkonaut from the bridge, he's evading
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> insult
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> jk, idk, imma just sit and ear popcorn while i read this chat 🍿
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, before I go sleep. I'd like to restate. We have very little rules and discussion of them are completely fine. Don't use hate speech, keep personal stuff in DMs and report specific mod actions you disagree with to admins.
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> jk, idk, imma just sit and eat popcorn while i read this chat 🍿
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> lol how many accs would you use to argue?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just have a bit of fairness
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then its fine
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fokkonaut: Just where do you see this going? Do you think we'll reconsider if you keep evading?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> btw how do you guys join discord server as a bot? seems quite interesting.
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> why not use the discord mobile client?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> done
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> external app or website which you can anonymously join to a discord "bridge" via bot accs like fokkonaut has
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can join this channel on irc.quakenet.org (#ddnet) and on matrix
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> so basically all custom? whats the appeal in doing that other than coding something up yourself?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf can probably tell you how to connect on matrix
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> https://discord.gg/MSYcjYvU6e
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> 👀
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> oh cool cheers, will take a look
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not custom, it bridges existing chat protocols together. IRC, matrix and discord
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#ddnet:matrix.org contains all currently bridged rooms (#developer and #wiki).
