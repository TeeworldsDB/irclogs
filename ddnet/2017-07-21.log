10:30 < Learath2> morning heinrich5991 
10:30 <@heinrich5991> morning :)
17:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: could you fix the mysql cmake build?
17:37 <@deen> i don't understand what it's supposed to do
17:37 <@deen> but it should use mysql_config
17:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: I can try it tomorrow
17:46 <@heinrich5991> (semester ends today)
17:53 <@deen> anything else that doesn't work with cmake yet?
17:54 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Guys, have you read any good book or articles about designing relational databases? Can you recommend something?
17:54 <@heinrich5991> still mac
17:56 <@deen> Savander: I work in that field, but no
17:57 <@heinrich5991> do you want to write a database server or do you want to write an application that uses a database?
17:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Application, that uses a database
17:57 <@deen> aaaah
17:57 <@deen> I thought you want to write your own DB too
17:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Hah, nope. IM webdeveloper
17:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Can use databases, but it's better to know more than less
17:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> about designing or prototyping databases
17:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you know, normalization, etc

19:54 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master b57ffa4 def: Use scancodes instead of keycodes for input (fixes #796, please test)
20:02 <@deen> ^ this WILL break your binds.
20:02 <@deen> but then binds will be independent of keyboard layout
20:02 <@deen> I guess that's a good thing
20:02 <@deen> And I actually started preparing for Scancodes when we did the move to SDL2, I think I just forgot to finish it
20:06 <@deen> So I'd appreciate some testing of whether this works fine and is acceptable for the next release
20:19 <@deen> nightlies are available at the regular location, make sure to make a backup of your settings_ddnet.cfg  beforehand: https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-builds/
21:01 < Socialdarwinist> It does work, has reverted the bugs, and has not broken any binds of mine, deen.
21:02 <@deen> Socialdarwinist: great, thanks for the bug reports
21:02 <@deen> and for testing
21:08 < Socialdarwinist> Now all the bugs in DDNet that have vexed my the whole year are gone. Only this now one now: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/794
21:09 <@deen> Socialdarwinist: Thanks to heinrich5991 https://maps.ddnet.tw/ now also provides maps from other popular servers, including inf
21:11 < Socialdarwinist> I get 403 there.
21:11 <@deen> oops
21:11 <@deen> same problem as heinrich, haha
21:11 <@deen> have to fix the permissions
21:12 <@deen> fixed
21:14 < Socialdarwinist> Great, then we need only someone who makes a PR to the InfClass repo, so the client nows that the maps are there, innit? :>
21:14 <@deen> hm?
21:15 <@deen> They can just embed the PNGs if they've been worried about filesize for ddnet client users
21:16 < Socialdarwinist> Or in other words, so the maps include the PNGs directly instead of accessing the skin folder.
21:16 <@deen> yes
21:16 <@deen> but I'm not sure if they'll be happy with that
21:16 < Socialdarwinist> It makes no sense now to have the maps in the database that access the skins folder.
21:16 <@deen> since they might have players with other clients
21:18 < Socialdarwinist> I am not sure why you do not just make an exception for the skins like for the mapres folder. Whoever replaces his skins knows that this can break things (which should not happen anyway), and else there are no security-relevant files there.

21:44 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 0b5942f def: Add special handling for infClass class selection (fixes #794)
21:55 < Socialdarwinist> Thanks, deen. It works.
22:58 < Socialdarwinist> heinrich5991 I am a bit puzzled about the formation of the map selection in the DDNet map database. I see for example that there is regular infc_provence and no infc_altepetl (which is used by both Official and 626 InfClass).
22:58 <@heinrich5991> Socialdarwinist: I believe map collection was started just recently over there
22:58 <@heinrich5991> might come up in a couple of days
23:02 < Socialdarwinist> Ah whatever, I just said that I am puzzled specifically about how the selection comes about, appearing mixed, but I have patience about it. Though I could inform some guys from Egypt that they could have better chances of joining InfClass with HTTPS downloading, as Egypt has suffered internet cuts since the 2011 upheaval.
23:04 <@deen> heinrich5991: find_library looks for libopusfile.dll?
23:05 <@heinrich5991> context please
23:05 < Learath2> deen: it calls FindOpusFile in cmake/ iirc
23:05 <@deen> I'm trying to fix the windows cmake build
23:05 <@heinrich5991> which file? cmake/FindOpusfile.cmake I guess?
23:06 <@deen> yes

23:06 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 6a76bf9 def: Add some debugging to cmake
23:06 <@deen> On Windows only Ogg and Opus work with bundled libs
23:06 <@deen> rest doesn't find the bundled libs: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heinrich5991/ddnet/build/1.0.352
23:06 <@heinrich5991> I'd guess it looks for opusfile.dll
23:07 <@deen> so I'd have to use NAMES opusfile-0 for windows instead?
23:07 <@deen> or rename the dlls and figure out how to change the linking in the libs
23:07 <@deen> so that they work without the -0 name
23:09 <@heinrich5991> I don't remember how I did that last time
23:09 <@heinrich5991> you could look at the repo state before the libs were updated
23:09 <@heinrich5991> and I don't have a windows machine net to me right now
23:09 <@heinrich5991> *next
23:09 <@deen> I'll do it with mingw anyway

23:13 <@heinrich5991> at most I renamed some files
