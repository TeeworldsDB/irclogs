08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> went to a party and went home
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> does this pic look ok
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> stopped in traffic for construction at midnight
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> made with pixel 8 pro
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> your photo looks ok

08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> clarity is pretty decent
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> the 1 and 2 zoom camera
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> are so different
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> google phone buyers :justatest:
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> is that bas
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> bad
08:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> my game still crashes
08:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> wtf
08:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> how is it even possible no one else has this issue
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/tiles/TELE_GUN/
09:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> i think my issues were caused by the opengl renderer
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Because nobody uses Linux xd
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I had issues with ogl on Debian 11 or smth too
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But apparently they are fixed
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> first time seeing that tag :kek:
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348226522426642432/image.png?ex=67ceb14b&is=67cd5fcb&hm=f9ade1d678178efe396e91b937e759e321faf657315424d96f1beadf94bfe193&
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ryo is new leader
11:03 < bridge> <zwelf2> open issue with backtrace including debug symbols with gdb?

11:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> I just switched to vulkan
11:26 < bridge> <pilonpl> But idk how it got changed to opengl in the first place
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was decided in the council of devs
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> council of devs <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> it just means we are accepting prs but no "core" devs will work on it
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh used wrong remote URL üòÇ
11:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> you meant to push that on your remote? <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
11:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> having 18 commits locally not pushed is respectable, i get anxious when i have more than 3 non pushed commits
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I already have a PR open. But accidentally used the ddnet repo URL instead of jupeyy to push it
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> ooooooh xD
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> the changes look interesting
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> time to stream again?
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> ü§∑
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Soon
11:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> looks like you only did smol things for automapper, do .rules work yet‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ?
11:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> looks like you only did smol things for automapper, do .rules work yet ?
11:44 < bridge> <patiga> @tsfreddie heyo, what was your motivation to integrate the dpi scale in the aspect ratio calculation in the UI? Is that how other programs do that? I never had a hi-dpi monitor
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Automapper is fully functional with wasm modules and a internal format used in the automapper creator ui.
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .rules are not.. If you are interested. U could implement the new interface
11:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> in ddnet?
11:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> got a vision for it? - otherwise i can freeball it and have a look later
11:45 < bridge> <patiga> yea in ddnet
11:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm pretty sure some games do that and some don't. and different system behave differently
11:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> especially macos
11:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it creates a larger render buffer than the resolution stated
11:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> or smth like that
11:46 < bridge> <patiga> and is the hi-dpi'ed resolution preferred or the non-dpi'ed resolution
11:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> no idea
11:46 < bridge> <patiga> (only to show it to the user)
11:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> realistically it might not matter? but practically neither are preferred if OS didn't do it right
11:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> mac can have larger buffer than actual res if you show the non-scaled window size
11:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> windows can have larger window in windowed mode in some specific settings / devices if you show the scaled size.
11:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> in other word mac might render 4k in a 1080p windows and windows might render 4k in a 8k window.
11:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just show the window size i guess
11:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> in other word mac might render 4k in a 1080p window and windows might render 4k in a 8k window.
11:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm assuming it's for ddnet-rs? not like you are trying to change how ddnet works?
11:50 < bridge> <patiga> I'm fixing a crash in ddnet rn ^^
11:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oof
11:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then i have no idea what to do
11:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just pick one and show it to user, it's probably fine either way
11:51 < bridge> <patiga> üëç
11:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is the crash related to what i did like 3 years ago or something
11:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :pepeW:
11:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although to be fair, the windows thing is just a backcompat artifact in windows. i'd rather see the actual rendered resolution as a user to judge how well it is performing?
11:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think
11:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> idk
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> üëÄ
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348247708888072202/image.png?ex=67cec507&is=67cd7387&hm=2084ac7c73f06f6cd33ac7e373670eeff26cf020c92c5f21620472c002ada203&
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ~~need better avatar than tw splash~~
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> send one
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:  say a teeworlds skin, like the 16 built-in
11:56 < bridge> <patiga> yea, appears so :justatest:
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:  say a teeworlds skin, like from the 16 built-in
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> has it been crashing for 3 years
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
11:56 < bridge> <patiga> its really difficult to get the crash
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> iirc it was just a macos specific
11:57 < bridge> <patiga> you'll either have to have a dpi scale < 1, or trigger another bug which makes the game think so
11:57 < bridge> <patiga> and I triggered the other bug
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oof
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> at least doesn't sound like it was entirely my fault
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> twinbop
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> really old
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348248842059124756/image.png?ex=67cec615&is=67cd7495&hm=a19077942454822f567e15a8076dafb6ac82e628d027f8712b0e73c48daa2fae&
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but at least nothing have used it before
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kekw:
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:00 < bridge> <kebscs> Noo üòÇ
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can try whatever u want
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie can u send it as png
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> it says webp bad
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh wait
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess im saving it wrong
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rules++ would be interesting too
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348249355483873311/image.png?ex=67cec68f&is=67cd750f&hm=28b3925ed79bcf247ee405c335025523ac38f0e56a91a437ec983f2224187700&
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> github is dumb
12:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> why can't drag and drop just work on wayland
12:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348249866060566631/twinbop.png?ex=67cec709&is=67cd7589&hm=65b9e93c788661699cd6f350c8dd217c844e6846ee40c272affdaa627e02b7c6&
12:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh it doesn't work from dolphin's samba thing
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its done
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> with imagemagick
12:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nvm then
12:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
12:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think the built-in Gwenview cropping thing just saves webp as default for some reason?
12:04 < bridge> <patiga> nah very specific
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348250304801669160/image.png?ex=67cec771&is=67cd75f1&hm=bec926346c53fb3909f9fc2f33eaad9c58c3632145d2b66fcd94aa6abb1db1f0&
12:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> english context is really weird. in chinese we usually say "yes, it's not your fault" lmao
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think it looks so good
12:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think it did it correctly :think_bot:
12:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> where did the padding comes from
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> discord says webp
12:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> bruh
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe a macos thing
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
12:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348250607495942215/twinbop.zip?ex=67cec7ba&is=67cd763a&hm=79b19ac6eb8e72e52228ea824eb24e7fece30b9e45cf3a737a5c9ba17dd02614&
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so like my first instinct reading that is like "nah, it's totally your fault" in chinese
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348250777751257188/image.png?ex=67cec7e2&is=67cd7662&hm=1dde76b0b5f496422fedcf08fe734a1bd7212fb8e8b6a45976b3b1acbf5ca087&
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> actually
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u see this https://github.com/apps/ddnetbot
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't even know what that page is
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what is a badge
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> does bot have to have a padding
12:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348251037424816162/image.png?ex=67cec820&is=67cd76a0&hm=1e4c431834b6e117e6cd6bfd0dca1f09ad2a7e8ab67f0d37f0987f6bc552cdf5&
12:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye
12:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe it is just a github app thing that you can't just use images. it has to be a badge or something
12:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> xD
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its too high res
12:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that seems to be padded too
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the other image i used
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> showed bigger
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> the tw
12:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ah. weird
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348251375724920923/705559.png?ex=67cec871&is=67cd76f1&hm=d75f123e649d7955c9c67aef5e70654cdaf60bf43d4870500a3e2e6f1584b0d5&
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe transparency helps
12:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> how does it even process transparency. it's just pngs, github out there running pixel checks?
12:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye, i don't have a transparent one sadly
12:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't have anything that can open my original psd rn
12:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> made with https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/ lmao
12:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348252078497206282/twinbop-modified.zip?ex=67cec918&is=67cd7798&hm=69bf821a1984c5d1beaa422d236f7b3c1001c1b396ba37227011c4b0c628789d&
12:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i can only imagine some company be like, nooo! our company logo got cropped and github just ran some random check to make sure not to crop anything in the badge for corporate apps or some shit like that.
12:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> you want it transparent or wha
12:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> removed white

12:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> pro
12:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> fuck i missed a corner

12:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what corner
12:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't see any
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> i messed this one up
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348254372940873800/image.png?ex=67cecb3b&is=67cd79bb&hm=18feca4435336b1258f110f8f1ca8c3685ba311908663a50029ecb999b867153&
12:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> probably fine
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> true, cant see it anyway
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it's gonna get shrinked and filtered out anywa
12:34 < bridge> <zhn> scrolling scoreboard instead would be annoying i guess
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I personally hate the idea of having to scroll xd
12:36 < bridge> <zhn> same
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We could save width per row and do more rows totally instead horizontal
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then the font size per row can be bigger
12:52 < bridge> <remakepower> So we need an other way.
12:52 < bridge> <remakepower> :thonk:
12:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> we could also hide "unimportant" information to fit more information in (e.g hide max team, hide ping, hide skin)
12:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> we could also hide "unimportant" information to fit more tee's in lower resolutions or on full servers (e.g hide max team, hide ping, hide skin)
13:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg yeah that sucks but Canada really had to happen now. See you next time!
13:03 < bridge> <zhn> what happened
13:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where is the meeting recording? Hehe
13:05 < bridge> <zhn> my does too but idc honestly xd
13:05 < bridge> <zhn> too lazy to play with gdb
13:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs really cool ryo!
13:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Was there also some plan made on how to reach 666 issues and 0 prs again?
13:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That is a teeworlds logo. Should probably be a ddnet logo for ddnet stuff.
13:10 < bridge> <zhn> chiller read to end xd
13:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I also saw now he went instead of the official teeworlds logo with another non ddrace icon :D
13:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo it should be the hula hoop tee
13:14 < bridge> <zhn> circletee is kinda meh, will be too small there for icon
13:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs hot and ddnetish https://flathub.org/es/apps/tw.ddnet.ddnet
13:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then at least the orange tee without the floor
13:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But standard tees with explosives is not ddnet
13:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs teeworlds
13:17 < bridge> <zhn> twinbopp > everything else
13:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Too sexual for serious GitHub bot
13:23 < bridge> <remakepower> what's the meaning of *0.7 style communication* in #5064 ?
13:23 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5064
13:24 < bridge> <remakepower> Does it mean to send a 0.7 packet?
13:26 < bridge> <zhn> no
13:26 < bridge> <zhn> it means it uses tocken for connless packet afaiu
13:26 < bridge> <zhn> token*
13:26 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh OK
14:42 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does the inputs in `DoClearableEditBox` changable? e.g. if i change the value of char[] that gives to the static CLineInput, will the words in the edit box change?

15:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ship it
15:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> test in production
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> it works now
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> test it on my fork
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348296147290030100/image.png?ex=67cef223&is=67cda0a3&hm=7fb917474933ea51defc64d5eb9c5c4908438d559cc084c7fddf73d6186adb8a&
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller troll
15:07 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> u slow old man
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> the labels need to exist in the repo
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> claim, unclaim on issues to claim a issue
15:09 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> why cant i use the bot? it only listens to you
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> because its not ur pr
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ur not a member of org
15:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> sucks
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its ur issue or ur pr u can do stuff
15:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> make it available to everyone
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> why?
15:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> power to the people
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> make a pr
15:10 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> maintainers can already do these things
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can test
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> this allows pr authors to do it
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> u didnt understand
15:11 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> nah i spend enough time on your propriatary bot i will go and continue doing open source work
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> its open source xd
15:11 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> where code
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh wait
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill public it
15:11 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> gottem
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> that's neat ^.^ is this only for maintainers or can I set it to ready again as a contributor?
15:12 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> only if its ur pr
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> uhm, yes ofc üòÑ
15:12 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> why ofc
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> because I shouldn't be able to do stuff with other peoples PRs
15:12 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> all the code and comments are public everyone can determine if the pr is ready or not
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> because I shouldn't be able to do stuff with other peoples PRs (as a contrib)
15:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> why not
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> I could also set it to ready if it's clearly not
15:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> maintainers are clearly too busy to do it all
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> or grief all PRs
15:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> we soon have 100 open prs
15:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you can already grief prs with spamming comments and shit
15:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> nobody does it
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddbot
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> the code
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can set it rdy if its ur pr or ur a maintainer
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> In a sense, I already do, but I try to be helfpful with my rieviews
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also want it to remove the waiting on author tag if the author pushes any commit
15:14 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> 2 class society 
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> nothing stopping you from creating your own open source game
15:15 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> skill issues are
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> yes, education is actually an issue of societey
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> yes, education is actually an issue of society
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> if someone spams we can block them form the repo btw
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> from*
15:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i have enough skill to know that this pr which is not mine is waiting for a review ... https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7737
15:16 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki yes 
15:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki so make it open to all and block if needed
15:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and if 3 non contributors do !ddnetbot merge it gets merged
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> When is the bot ready on the public repo @ryozuki ?
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> guess I am asking too early, 3 hours old üôà
15:32 < bridge> <robyt3> You can reuse one CLineInputBuffered for one popup and set the text. You shouldn't change the buffer directly but use the CLineInput functions to set the game.
15:37 < bridge> <louis> ermm, so deen approves but ryozuki doesnt then its instantly closed no discussion?
15:38 < bridge> <louis> moreso talking about the issue
15:41 < bridge> <Assa> don't we also have a robot skin in the game, can't we use a render of this one? Yes you like the ~~trash~~ funny rocket image, just showing an alternative for something more professional
15:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :greenthing: ask ryo not me
15:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @louis deen approves everything <:justatest:572499997178986510>
15:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although i don't know what's funny about that one, i made 16 of them back in 2020 and haven't used it all anyway.
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> anyone a clue how to render a skin? I know the bot can do it, but this is coupled with an upload and the bot is missing a command -.-

15:51 < bridge> <zhn> hq skins
15:51 < bridge> <zhn> twinbopp >>>
15:51 < bridge> <Assa> I now understand what my issue is with all of this
15:51 < bridge> <Assa> Teeworlds 0.7 added a bot-overlay for skins
15:52 < bridge> <Assa> so I can render any skin and put them "over"
15:52 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348307541121306654/bot.png?ex=67cefcc0&is=67cdab40&hm=93a6ff1589e20b6e1310c2c5f381d4f0028321b86ef201b838efb3565bfb599b&
15:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye the two bots don't really have UHD at least in the db
15:55 < bridge> <oxyzo.> use ai to get 32k ultra hd
15:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean i could probably draw another twinbopp and not use my 2020 design
15:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> on second thought after the hate i got from the email template i probably shouldn't touch anything graphics related tho lol
15:59 < bridge> <zhn> what email template lol
15:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> for the ddnet account
16:00 < bridge> <Assa> dunno

16:00 < bridge> <zhn> it was fire ngl, who flamed u lol
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just randos tho. there's always like one or three of them. like everytime i post something graphics
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not like i always show up in #showroom tho.
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kekw:
16:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> don't we have svgs for tees

16:03 < bridge> <Assa> This was just a fast gimp layer thingy, don't worry about it :justatest:
16:04 < bridge> <louis> i might have the robot skin svg but its on an old hard drive and i dont have a reader atm
16:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i forgot whoes svg is this
16:05 < bridge> <zhn> from ddnet-svg repo i suppose
16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> someone gave it to me for biggernouis
16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ravie!
16:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i remembered
16:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> bruh this renderer sucks (not really)
16:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348311012834545855/image.png?ex=67cefffb&is=67cdae7b&hm=e42d6d7af735d7e384c7305d59350398c82a3bdcadf1a1dfafdc7aaba379806a&
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think it's just canvas rasterizing things before render.
16:07 < bridge> <Assa> there is also the npm rendering module
16:07 < bridge> <Assa> if you are willing to waste a lot of time for a bot image on github üôà
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> bro you rendered a svg url just fine moments ago

16:53 < bridge> <teero777> yo does anyone know where the flags for the score type are in the demo?
16:53 < bridge> <teero777> i was looking at CNetObj_GameInfo::m_GameFlags but it apparently it's only relevant for 0.7?
16:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think it was hardcoded for ddnet ddrace race gametypes like 5 years ago
16:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not sure what it is now
16:55 < bridge> <teero777> well, no.
16:55 < bridge> <teero777> the default is just score
16:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Set `GAMEINFOFLAG_TIMESCORE` in `CNetObj_GameInfoEx` for time score, otherwise it's points score
16:55 < bridge> <teero777> ah nice thx
16:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean it was checking for game type name before i think?
16:56 < bridge> <robyt3> See also https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8384
16:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe it was just for fng

17:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> seems like i need to rebase again
17:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> haven't been keeping it up
17:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe it is my fault lol

17:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> cring they use microsoft github
17:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> such open source engine

17:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> unless you are a gitlab influencer and bitbucket influencer as well
17:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> twmap is actually free software distributed on blaze it stoner netherlands only half propriatary platform
17:27 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy bitbucket for sure not, gitlab yes
17:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> fair
17:27 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy i gave you upvote. Should be merged soon.

17:28 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its ryo texting from his phone
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks how did you escape ryo
17:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i honestly thinks maybe chiller is at least responsible for a few github downtime cuz how he used the thing
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Caught
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> chiller: oh no
17:28 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @cyberfrighter use python interpreter and the help() command to explore the lib
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
17:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> üò¨  ryo and juppy living together is the ship i can get behind.
17:29 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so for example ``import twmap;help(twmap)`` and then you just pass any variable into help() that you need more details for
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ryo and robyt3 my anime girls
17:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> Chiller should we bump his PR together
17:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> I ship em already
17:31 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy this was one of my alt accounts https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24
17:31 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> took down gh emai queue for a day

17:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> I don't use shells I use flakes
17:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> But there 100% is a Godot dependencie flake
17:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> Or a build.nix for godot
17:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> Peak dev meeting
17:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i was using flakes until i upgraded my system flake and think maybe i don't want to have random version locking for things that i rarely use
17:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> nice @ryozuki !
17:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> who drew that?
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'll geo guess your location now

17:43 < bridge> <louis> honestly there must be some way to generate docs from the python help() outputs
17:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think the help() outputs already are generated from rust code
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Aren't you something of a developer yourself?
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> DDNet on the cloud soon?
17:43 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> anyways i think so far nobody requested text docs

18:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> was it akward? xd @ryozuki 
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> what determines the race time?
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> sending a CNetMsg_Sv_DDRaceTime doesn't do anything...

18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
18:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> who carried jupstar through springlobe?
18:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> Jupstar is good gamer tbh
18:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> Probably Deen tho
18:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar talk about ddnet rs was amazing
18:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> any planned updates soon?
18:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @hectavoxel soon there is caves and cliffs update
18:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> and deen didnt know about ddnet rs xd
18:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> such a deen thing to not know

18:34 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> are their voices hot? jupstar
18:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> Not being a gigachad of your level scares me
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Learath has a very high, almost pitched voice
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think he used voice change
18:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> @learath2 even when drunk?
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then he wqs a bear

18:50 < bridge> <teero777> say hello
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im eating and taking a plane soon maybe next time xd
18:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ddnet uses the m_WarmupTimer for that
18:51 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you shouldve named yourself VulkanFan1996
18:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> also in here https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/snap_items.html#obj_game_info
18:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its all snap
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> What did you end up eating? There is an excellent vietnamese restaurant near the church
18:51 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is also m_GameStartTick ddnet extension
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Geo guessers go
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> im literally setting that to {} and the timer is still counting
18:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/0a12b1e4d9c2b26da43901ea1b12fc2f7bb25d83/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L557-L652
18:52 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ddnet has extensions on top of vanilla timers
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> oohhh i see

18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> repost
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> we went for german classic
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> Sensible
18:53 < bridge> <teero777> chiller do i send a gameinfo for every client then?
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> Sp√§tzle is very germany
18:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Looks good, just bit burned
18:54 < bridge> <teero777> but how does the gameinfo identify itself to what tee es geh√∂rtz
18:54 < bridge> <teero777> but how does the gameinfo identify itself to what tee es geh√∂rt
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lel
18:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ah no i think only every tee gets their own
18:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not all
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Belongs to
18:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the server sends one to every tee
18:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not every to every
18:55 < bridge> <teero777> hmm okay how do demos do that tho xd
18:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> I think I'll order sp√§tzle now..
18:55 < bridge> <teero777> you are getting all of them?
18:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no you only get your own
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So why didnt u come. Wife and child are not valid reasons
18:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> do you see a different timer in the demo if you select another tee?
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> I wasn't invited.
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> yes i think so
18:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ouch
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> :cammo:
18:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there is only ever one gameinfo
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh, thought so tbh
18:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> with the id 0
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> I could've came over just for a beer as I said, 2 hour drive
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn rust to join the club
18:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> there cant be more than one
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, if they have Apfelwein try Apfelwein. It's very local
18:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> I literally coded rust with @jupeyy_keks man :feelsbadman:
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm the wrong person for that anyway
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i am pretty sure the timer should be wrong in the demo when you switch @teero777 
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr dont take it personal tho, its hard to organize and stuff ig
18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> No it's okay it's okay, 
18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> You
18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û>

18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:peperuncry:1106634575259648081>
18:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yea it is just tested @teero777 just to be sure demos dont do any shenangians
18:58 < bridge> <teero777> yea wtf demos very stupid
18:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> What are we getting for dinner?
18:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont know demos well but i know the vanilla protocol and it for sure only has one timer
18:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
18:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Sushi, or course!
18:58 < bridge> <teero777> i gues it just is like that
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddcon barcelona
18:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 vanilla demos have no selecting of other tees so they dont need other tee timers
18:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> Vegan sushi is really good if made correctly ü§∑
18:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> also vanilla only has one timer for all
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Facts
18:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh i was referencing a meme

18:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sending it in #off-topic
18:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oh damn I missed the joke
18:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ok I'll rq
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A vegan eater besides me would already have been a good reason for you to come xd

19:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> bors was such a contribution farmer
19:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw i think we probably should add cancel conditions to actions?
19:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> someone rebases a few times and the actions are just running for hours
19:15 < bridge> <patiga> use the `help` function on everything, theres a lot of information in there. apart from that, you can look into the twmap-py repo on gitlab to find example scripts

19:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw :nouis:
19:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we have dev vc now?
19:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> add that üëç
19:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't dare submitting PR for workflow tho, cuz I can't even test it.
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> all in vc muted
19:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> staying in vc muted is enough to give me anxiety lmao
19:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I have a problem
19:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think deen is the only person I've spoken English to since college.
19:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Test it in your fork just open prs there
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think it just shows it if you not part of the call
19:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> They were indeed all muted when I joined
20:05 < bridge> <chairn> why is there a developer-vc ?
20:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Bcs developers want to vc
20:07 < bridge> <chairn> why not use one of the general-vc ?
20:07 < bridge> <chairn> there's always a free one
20:08 < bridge> <teero777> because people join and want to play ddnet
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Apparently people were joining and bothering them for non development things
20:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> i remember one time when we had almost everyone in vc playing stronghold
20:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> good times
20:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now you can only have everyone in vc playing linear
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> would ddnet accept a pr bringing back vanilla gamemodes?
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> wdym?
20:23 < bridge> <Solly> ddnet server can only do ddnet rn
20:23 < bridge> <Solly> but if possible it would be epic if vanilla gamemodes could come back
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> yes ofc this is an own gamemode. why would it support different gamemodes
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> so much blopat
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> so much bloat
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> there are seperate servers
20:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Alsp you would need to unblock std from non modded server
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i advice u go airport soon because we had to take a uber because train was kaputt
20:24 < bridge> <teero777> why would it be one?
20:24 < bridge> <wizardrypanda> what is the main langauge this game is based on?
20:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Also you would need to unblock std from non modded server
20:24 < bridge> <Solly> if u mean not allowing things to use ctf, ddnet can be the exception if its close enough to normal ctf
20:24 < bridge> <teero777> c++
20:24 < bridge> <Solly> if u mean not allowing things to use ctf, ddnet can be the exception if its close enough to normal ctf (equivilant to 0.6 server with more chat commands)
20:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust
20:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> obviously
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but it would be cool if it was all in 1 place
20:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> That's a bit of a semantics you would need to get both discussion
20:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> We are still not teeworlds believe it or not
20:25 < bridge> <wizardrypanda> goated language
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> well i dont mind either way having ctf+ or ddctf or something like that but i think it should be fine
20:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> my man
20:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> :gigachad:
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> but tw server is kinda wack
20:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> std gamemodes are reserved for unmodded teeworlds server only and unblocking that kinda means a point of entry can now be argued with. Since faking std mod was REALLY heavily moderated through masterbans
20:26 < bridge> <Solly> well sure call it ddctf or ctf+
20:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Even though Heinrich is involved on both side
20:26 < bridge> <Solly> the name of it isnt something i care abt
20:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I believe you would need to talk to both side for that to happen
20:26 < bridge> <Solly> so heinrich
20:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Then probably
20:27 < bridge> <Solly> and zcatch and fng
20:28 < bridge> <Solly> what does the ddrace gamemode file look like
20:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But I don't think including ddnet gamemodes really does anything. Cuz we were hosting fng under the ddnet before the community thing. (Maybe we still are? Haven't checked since CHN fng is not ddnet anymore)
20:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But I don't think including ddnet gamemodes really does anything. Cuz we were hosting fng under the ddnet tab before the community thing. (Maybe we still are? Haven't checked since CHN fng is not ddnet anymore)
20:29 < bridge> <Solly> teeworlds is unmaintained
20:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So it's not like lower discoverability
20:29 < bridge> <Solly> theres lots of things better about a ddnet srever than a tw server
20:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ddnet insta maintains full std and fng and catch
20:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> With ddnet code
20:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> No one is host fng with tw codes nowadays
20:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Just contribute to insta if you need something fixed on vanilla gamemode
20:31 < bridge> <Solly> oh it does
20:31 < bridge> <Solly> <https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta>
20:31 < bridge> <Solly> i assume then this is not wanted upstream
20:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> as much I want ddnet-pvp back. Since we had a weapon system and a somewhat complete game controller ddnet-insta is very well maintained
20:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Since chiller is such a freeman
20:35 < bridge> <learath2> Huh? Train was fine. I took one
20:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> u lucky
20:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ours stopped due to some police styff
20:37 < bridge> <teero777> when are you gonna give it back?
20:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chillerdragon: I assume any downstream refactoring in ddnet-insta would screw the maintainability right?
20:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Actually. DDNet kinda need the weapon system :justatest:
20:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Idk if I can make it into ddnet and have 100% non-changed physics
20:59 < bridge> <zhn> mod-related with no profit for ddnet, declined :troll:
21:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Not really mod related
21:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The ddnet-pvp weapon kinda separated all the mangled projectiles where all the weapons are just weaved together by if statements.
21:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But reimplementing them separately is probably super risky to physics
21:08 < bridge> <zhn> it was kinda ironic since half of downstream related prs go to nowhere with this claim
21:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> they can always fork
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> im on the plane
21:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we forked and other mods could too :nouis: :nouis: :nouis:
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i die remember me
21:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Plane wifi or just on the runway
21:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> ü´°
21:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has wifi but i wanted to be dramatic
21:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> havent taken off yet tho
21:10 < bridge> <oxyzo.> good luck
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> still waiting on ddnet-rs to finish ddnet compatability so i can make my own gamempde
21:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Can you not already?
21:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Is it free
21:14 < bridge> <zhn> yeah same question
21:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
21:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The one time I got plane wifi they charge by minutes and very expensive
21:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
21:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> lufthansa wifi is the first airline i see doesnt make me register for wifi
21:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just a button
21:15 < bridge> <zhn> i would glad to see it in ddnet-insta but chillerdragon is really cautious about merge conflicts
21:15 < bridge> <zhn> no snitching, woah
21:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> what snitch xd
21:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe I'll just do it in ddnet. But it might take a year to merge since I don't want to break physics
21:21 < bridge> <hectavoxel> its missing like, half the features and i dont feel like coding it in
21:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
21:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe not, I should do something more productive üòï
21:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> I might look into .rules support for ddnet-rs, if that is functional we could finish my map :owo:
21:41 < bridge> <hectavoxel> there is support, i just have yet to figure it out
21:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> Jupsti said no .rules support, only ddnet-rs's own
21:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh you want to pr your weapon system to ddnet-insta? Yea if it doesn‚Äôt touch ddnet code it‚Äôs good! If it touches ddnet code it‚Äôs not good. So far I see no need for a weapon system because the weapons work as they are
21:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What do you you mean by downstream refactoring? And what by maintainability? Which downstream? A downstream of ddnet insta? Or ddnet insta as downstream of ddnet?
21:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'd basically make a compat layer so .rules work with ddnet-rs system
21:43 < bridge> <hectavoxel> üíÄ
21:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye it touches like every ddnet code
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then not good
21:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So I might just touch ddnet instead since they needed them more than vanilla.
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Need it for what?
21:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Jetpack, old shotgun, some Lazer stuff that I forgot
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just to make the code cleaner?
21:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Prob
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
21:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I shouldn't do it tho, cuz I really need to start making some dollars
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If it increases pvp fork maintainability you have my vote hehe
21:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you look at the automapper creation tool yet? Some feedback on usability would be nice I guess
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i did
21:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i forgot where i talked about it
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dollars have no value. Teeworlds mods do!
21:46 < bridge> <teero777> what can i exchange my teeworlds mods for
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Money is made up. It‚Äôs all fake. Once the big resession hits you will regret having worked for dollars
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: you don‚Äôt need to exchange. It has intrinsic values. You can play it
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can‚Äôt play dollars
21:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The weapon systems in ddnet-pvp is mostly to separate exploding weapons (for Lazer jumps) from regular weapons but it enables downstream forks to do some wacky stuff like having 16 weapons or different classes with different weapons without coding them all in projectiles
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do it
21:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> No
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I pay you dollars
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> jk im broke
21:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Now that chiller asked me to do it I kinda don't want to anymore.
21:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> trying to remember
21:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> isnt it like, each tile rule is a name and you need to assign a group and index to it?
21:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The power of influencer
21:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im mobile so its hard to remember
21:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea you need to want it your self
21:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> My ADHD brain wants it
21:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But my wallet and mom don't
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'm also mobile so I can't check xD
21:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs some healthy adhd brain cravings
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> Iirc you create a group, select tiles and assign an index rule to it
21:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Could also have been drugs
21:51 < bridge> <zhn> casino
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fair
21:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I also promised someone to make April fool scheming so I'm pretty busy this month too
21:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> hello my beloved tw protocol experts zhn and chiller
21:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I also promised someone to do some april fools scheming so I'm pretty busy this month too

21:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Can anyone verify this?
21:51 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sounds complicated
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ddrace > casino
21:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> still waiting on snow and furo to help make a GUI for my automapper maker
21:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I verify cellegen
21:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hello rust pro @kollpotato
21:52 < furo> @hectavoxel Working on it, coming early 2027
21:52 < bridge> <hectavoxel> :troll:
21:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller im not a rust pro
21:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> memory is hard
21:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i hate memory
21:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How to create a mutable variable holding the int 7 in rust? @kollpotato
21:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw can someone tell me whether the hours played stats on ddnet is just total races
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> let mut = "7".parse::<i32>().unwrap();
21:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> `mut u32 int = 7`? i dont code btw
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk might work
21:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not like they have a server tracker that counts time in server right?
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Confirmed rust pros @hectavoxel @kollpotato
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd i forgor the name for the variable
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> it doesnt compile
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao
21:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chillerdragon: are you rust bros too
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk which stats you refer to @tsfreddie but there are some for master server play time in think
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can look at mine to figure out
21:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The playtime heatmap thing
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am online a lot and I basically finish no maps ever
21:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> On ddnet.org
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah yea that one is red for me usually
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So it‚Äôs only the time you show up in master
21:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Cool

21:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> half of that is him being afk
21:56 < bridge> <teero777> you mean 99% xD
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> who are these chiller
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348399137602797669/image.png?ex=67cf520e&is=67ce008e&hm=d9fd9424e874b1ad9fc1394d14e8bb1f2b2bda9af5c7dcf5e11a9eacbe4f12c2&
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> they are always there
21:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Any idea how quickly does that stat update?
21:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> once per week i suppose
21:57 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: quick C quiz. is "%%" one or 2 characters
21:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Bummer
21:57 < bridge> <teero777> ChillerDragon: quick C quiz. is "%%" one or 2 characters in memory
21:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Oh wait.
21:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I already had my own tracker
21:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi from the air
21:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> What am I even asking lmao
21:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> crap we summoned ryozuki
21:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I forgot I ran a custom tracker on twcn
21:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> I say 2
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> But it's probably 1 for a stupid reason
21:58 < bridge> <zhn> im none of expert :feelsbadman:
21:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> trick question: its 3 because fuck you
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: clan gives a hint. term-zx-8 means it‚Äôs a term-zx client (ncurses version of chillerbot-zx illegal fork of chillerbot-ux) running on ger8.zillyhuhn.com to farm stats in 0XF city server
21:59 < bridge> <zhn> another nerdy fuck language with c in its name holy moly
21:59 < bridge> <teero777> actually correct xDDD
21:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's for, even the `"`'s are saved as individual characters
21:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> WHAT
22:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's four, even the `"`'s are saved as individual characters
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In runtime memory? I would call strings on the binary to figure out @blaiszephyr
22:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> ????:KEKW: :KEKW:
22:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkalaugh:
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> well in a printf it would be one since %% is escaped to % and also a null character obv but in a normal char its not escaped so its %% + null character
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> = 3
22:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon sounds epic
22:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> but why do u need stats
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To climb leader board
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am top5 level
22:02 < bridge> <teero777> hes farming virtual worthless points
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Same as Fred is farming worthless dollar
22:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> as any self respecting ddnet player would do
22:02 < bridge> <teero777> yes
22:02 < bridge> <teero777> i love farming virtuall ddnet points instead of learning
22:02 < bridge> <teero777> i love farming virtuall ddnet points instead of learning for exams
22:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> so true
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> i love farming virtual ddnet points instead of learning for exams
22:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> i quit ddnet for 3 weeks
22:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> to study
22:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> now im back
22:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs why I automated it so I can study and farm
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> how long have you been gone?
22:03 < bridge> <teero777> smart
22:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> xDDD
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi back im dad
22:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi dad
22:04 < bridge> <teero777> but it messes up your actual stats tho
22:04 < bridge> <teero777> which is sad
22:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> epic stats
22:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348401132422172744/image.png?ex=67cf53ea&is=67ce026a&hm=f705776d27a5321ecfc6577938efcdb96f4afd686fadd7e0a12deba3480b1d05&
22:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the escape happens at runtime right? Or at compile time?
22:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> its like a flex idk
22:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://tenor.com/view/patrick-star-spongebob-squarepants-wow-mindblown-gif-13169052
22:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Bruh I was about to say if it was null terminator imma flip :justatest:
22:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> New llm test dropped tho
22:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348401316992389200/Screenshot_20250310_050314.jpg?ex=67cf5416&is=67ce0296&hm=22b523c543b081d56ac324e5026654d1e83dab3af31ea06644af53f1591b02bf&
22:05 < bridge> <teero777> dunno when the escape happens. should be at compiletimer
22:05 < bridge> <teero777> dunno when the escape happens. should be at compiletime
22:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I always play with dummy. Always! So ChillerDragon.\* is my actual stats
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> 5000hrs it says
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> how
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> you are never online
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> liar
22:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> can't it be during the parsing?
22:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe I sometimes afk with dummy too
22:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> or is there some dark magic requiring the compiler to do it
22:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But then it‚Äôs my actual main pc running
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> "sometimes" xD
22:06 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348401677832552588/image.png?ex=67cf546c&is=67ce02ec&hm=25479e8cc0f387ad21a8a3b8e39081c831e7cc0a8a5c99d1edaebd1441468193&
22:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Have you seen chillers GitHub heatmap. It's just his personality.
22:07 < bridge> <teero777> everything that can be done at compile-time should be done at compile-time
22:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I'm surprised chiller doesn't write pixel letters in his GitHub heatmap tho
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh boi those 4090 electricity bills
22:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> never heard that before tbf
22:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i see the point
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I doubt it
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> printf is implemented in libc
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How would it know what happend at compile time and what didn‚Äôt
22:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The compiler can‚Äôt just mess up a string based on which method it‚Äôs being passed to
22:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> printf is not a macro
22:09 < bridge> <teero777> it should be optimized
22:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> You might fell into zigs trap by saying that. Rust ppl and zig ppl are born enemies! you can't fold!
22:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> zig looks solid to me
22:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> i would use it whenever i want to use c
22:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> which is never
22:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I would rather the write c tbh
22:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I would rather just write c tbh
22:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> Zigs syntax is to much for my brain
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> chiller im asking the mighty llm
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> lets see
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> have u seen c++?
22:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and rust syntax isn't?
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> noooo
22:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> its at runtime
22:11 < bridge> <teero777> C is bad from now on
22:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> rewrite c in rust so its not that bad
22:12 < bridge> <teero777> rust is worse
22:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think no one said c is good but like most things start in c now
22:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1741554779.png
22:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> everything else would have confused me really hard
22:14 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1741554869.png
22:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is rust bootstraped? I've never checked what lang rust complier is in
22:14 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> idk how you even got me to try it
22:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> ofc
22:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> used to be written in ocaml like 15 years ago
22:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> cool
22:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Are all native langs bootstrapped
22:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Seems common
22:16 < bridge> <Assa> funny story about programming languages. The first compiler is often written in C and then used to cross compile into it's own language
22:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> idk if thats how cross compile worked
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> most of them are yea
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> seems weird to use another language if you‚Äôre knowledgeable enough about yours to be writing s compiler for it
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of languages just hold off on that until they are mature or stable enough
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> seems weird to use another language if you‚Äôre knowledgeable enough about yours to be writing a compiler for it
22:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Fair
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> tho if someone was to do an AOT JS compiler i‚Äôd hope it‚Äôs not written in JS
22:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> isnt pypi written in python and faster than CPython?
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> is  cpython the reference implementation  of python or the C api?
22:26 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> reference implementation as far as i know
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> from what i read about the former it was more a fundamental speed increase
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> because of some weird parallelization limitations
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk
22:27 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the fastest of course is Jython because its written in java
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> really?
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs cool tbh
22:28 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> fastest was a joke
22:28 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Too bad, assemblyscript is bootstrapped which is kinda typescripty
22:28 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but Jython is a thing and i wouldnt be surprised if its actually fast
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ah rip
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> there‚Äôs AOT java & it‚Äôs pretty good, just not widespread
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> graalvm native-image
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but u can make fast java too
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs just laborious and you have to know the JVM more than anything else & is not a sustainable thing to dump lots of time into nowadays
22:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think assemblyscript wrote their code to be compatible to both typescript and their own weird lang from the beginning so it wasn't technically bootstrapping?
22:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Although maybe compile to wasm doesn't count as native
22:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Although maybe compiling to wasm doesn't count as native
22:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> even tho porting native to web usually means wasm
22:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
22:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's a weird lang I guess.
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> have you heard the chinese lang called easy or EPL
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> No
22:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It is still way too common in china and I hate it. There are always some random kid that just shares their app coded in EPL everywhere and lots of them are flagged as malware.
22:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kek:
22:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's like visual basic but the keywords are chinese
22:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh no
22:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> And I guess it supports Chinese identifiers
22:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348409291295559742/202304151681537886213060.png?ex=67cf5b83&is=67ce0a03&hm=cc9421650491701bfacdcb76856832848116e364e37a2292fe56cbad13825ce4&
22:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's too cursed
22:37 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> looks like noby fng code
22:37 < bridge> <teero777> fr
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
22:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It is like way too common for a lang this cursed
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i can see that being genuinely beneficial for brevity
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> you just have to be used to it
22:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the russians have one too
22:38 < bridge> <hectavoxel> rustheads showing off their memory safe code (its false news since i cant remember any of this shit)
22:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> it makes sense not everyone is latin ascii enjoyer
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
22:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> good that there isnt one with german umlaute √§√∂√º√§√∂√º√ü
22:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> If like 10 kids claims that they know programming maybe 3 of them started with EPL and 1 of them make cheats with it.
22:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think ms excel macros are localized tho
22:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> which is cursed
22:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's std lib is really memory hacking friendly for whatever reason?
22:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> china moment
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean rust has thorough unicode support for identifiers so there‚Äôs no reason you couldn‚Äôt ‚Äú`type`def‚Äù a whole bunch of shit & just make your own stuff in your own lang
22:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> reminds me of the points in scoreboard py project
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess u still need latin for keywords but that‚Äôs simple preprocessing that can even be done with a build.rs
22:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Made even more cursed by the fact it uses Win32 directly
22:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the screenshot, not the language
22:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Also I can get behind the rationale of being easily readable
22:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> But it is not in chinese grammar order
22:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> And why would anyone enjoy switching IME back and forth
22:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Maybe their lang is so good that it supports both ( and Ôºà as brackets but that's even more cursed
22:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Also wtf you've seen nobys code?
22:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> new language
22:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> uses its own set of 16 symbols that have no equivalent in any human language
22:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the compiler doesn't even understand text files
22:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unicode what? nah, 4 bits per symbol
22:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> even I couldn't be in the cool club to see his stuff
22:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I'm intrigued
22:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and it's fast to type because you don't have to deal with special symbols, it's just home row and the row above it!
22:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So what exactly does it read... Just 4bits of predefined symbols? So like binary but you can write it out on paper?
22:47 < bridge> <teero777> i have only heard rumors about it
22:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though you do need a special editor...
22:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you should make that
22:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I can totally see it as a star farmer
22:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's cursed because it'd be a bit hard to learn
22:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but like, it's not *that* hard to learn, an alphabet of 16 symbols is easy to memorize and you don't need that many keywords for a programming language
22:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and makes for excellent obfuscation against the uninitiated :D :D
22:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but if the symbols aren't Satan related imma be disappointed
22:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The idea came to me years ago because I just like things that feel arcane
22:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> star farmer?
22:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> a GitHub project with lots of stars I guess
22:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
22:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ah, my github is way barren :pepeW:
22:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I never make anything worth showing off
22:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and I'm *still* somehow not in the habit of starting everything with a git repo, so I have a lot of little things that aren't even in version control
22:53 < bridge> <oxyzo.> https://ddnet.org/maps/Barren
22:54 < bridge> <oxyzo.> haha get it cuz barren and barten like
22:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> git init everything 
22:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> my home folder is a git repo
22:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> my teeworlds folder is a git repo with 17 sub repos
22:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> my pictures and videos folders a git repos with sub repos
22:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Your life seems fun
22:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> when i touch servers which are not mine i git init first before running commands so i know what i am breaking 
22:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> when i use kdenlive to edit videos i usually commit the project file every 5 minutes xd
22:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> git is goated
22:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i have 3 github ORGANIZATIONS only for tw demos
22:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
22:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> are kdenlive's project files nicely enough structured that you get meaningful diffs out of them?
22:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or are you just storing binary blobs in git?
22:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes its xml
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but i also do binary blobs like images, videos, demos and pdfs of course
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so many pdfs
22:57 < bridge> <kebscs> :justatest:
22:57 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348414351656091759/image.png?ex=67cf6039&is=67ce0eb9&hm=5de79b0a997e4f64559a825310c1499cbe06b4007edc544b20923d15aecade4c&
22:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Your disk space must be astronomical to store the entire history of chillerdragon
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> no
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> githubs disk space
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its all running on bill gates hard drives
22:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You remove them locally?
22:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i do git push rm -rf
22:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Bruh
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> CRAZY WORKS
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> INSANE EVEN
22:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if i get blocked on github i cant login to my bank account anymore
22:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So there is just chillers naked photos lying somewhere in the azure server
22:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think ms uses aws actually
22:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> their products are so shit they dont use any of them
22:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
22:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You just have naked photos of yourself lying around?
22:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> they use linux/macos over windows, aws over azure
22:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> If you say all my photo history then probably
22:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't think such things of me even exist!
22:59 < bridge> <Solly> is that not because github used to not be owned by microsoft
22:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i store personal photos on a usb lol @inv41idu53rn4m3 in a git repo without remote
23:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Not anywhere I could retrieve but that at least happened once even if I don't remember
23:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thats the nice thing about git it doesnt need a remote
23:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @inv41idu53rn4m3 so go git init everything
23:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this reminds me
23:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> there was this weird programming language where literally it looked like ‚ô§‚ô°.{¬£¬•¬•¬•¬•..~} or some shit
23:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and it was some functional language
23:00 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i forgot the name, and everything else aboht it
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i nearly die from turbulence
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> git is not about showing off
23:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its about backups, synchronization and collaboration
23:01 < bridge> <chairn> sounds like any code golf language
23:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki f
23:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> You can only die from crashes and asphyxiation
23:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> APL or something alike
23:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki its you being on the phone in the plane
23:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you gonna crash it
23:01 < bridge> <chairn> no, people have died from turbulence
23:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> array based langs
23:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So chillerdragon being a GitHub influencer is just chillerdragon influencing github's service quality
23:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes
23:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> how? seatbelt malfunction and bonk in the head?
23:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> panic attack
23:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller how manu followers u got
23:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 150
23:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> less than u
23:02 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> also ur followers are more valuable
23:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Oh, like APL? Or BQN? Or J? Or Uiua?
23:02 < bridge> <chairn> and objects falling onto head
23:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ah, that makes more sense
23:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i sent some issues and prs to some trending cyber security repos and got a bunch of cyber sec followers who have logged into gh twice
23:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i got seatbelt
23:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and some from yt who learn to code tw
23:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Still bonking in my book
23:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> gonna land soon
23:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki your followers are actual devs who could or even actually do read your code
23:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its pretty cool
23:03 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> and you have sponsors and shit
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 1 guy
23:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea yea sort of like that
23:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> the language itself was written in the nerdy ass programming language, and the logo was some weird circle thing
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> that keeps giving me 5 a month
23:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I have like 10 followers
23:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think he forgot he is sponsoring me
23:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Weird circle thing...
23:04 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> lmao @ryozuki 
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> frfr
23:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
23:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it has its own website and it was blue
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> its been like 2 years

23:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also on liberapay if u want a foss alt to support me
23:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
23:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> FOUND IT
23:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> YES
23:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's the new gay one
23:05 < bridge> <hectavoxel> guys can we rewrite ddnet in uiua :troll:
23:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I do have a ko-fi routed to my UK bank account that I can't spend tho
23:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
23:06 < bridge> <Solly> ive compile dddnet 5 times i cant get ubsan to catch fpes ):
23:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to set smth as env on runtime
23:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the `both` operator is bi flag-coloured
23:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and the `transpose` operator is trans flag-coloured
23:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh right i forgot they did that
23:06 < bridge> <Solly> ive done that
23:07 < bridge> <Solly> this time im tryingt setting fsan-recovery=all

23:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Actually. Idk why it is hard for Chinese to get money from outside world. I can spend money via VISA just fine most of the time.
23:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> wall
23:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> You can wire money into china, but I don't think any e-commerce supports china
23:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't know why the gay stuff bothers me so much
23:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Sorry, am I bothering you
23:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i wonder how many shitty remarks were made from this üíÄ
23:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean with Uiua
23:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Someone should make a out of context irclog collection

23:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye that is weird
23:11 < bridge> <hectavoxel> they added @sollybunny into uiua
23:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's weird and goofy and so unprofessional idk it just annoys me way too much
23:12 < bridge> <Solly> huh
23:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im sorry :justatest:
23:13 < bridge> <Solly> this isnt a serious programming lang is it?
23:13 < bridge> <Solly> also u can use ur own font /shrug
23:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They do advertise it pretty seriously, but yeah, by its nature it's obviously never going to be used for serious software
23:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think stuffing these in wherever places makes people question their motive so I would appear more unprofessional that way. With everything going on it is really hard to tell from satire and support.

23:18 < bridge> <Solly> i dont think its meant to be professional, doesnt mean its bad or cant be used to do everything.
23:18 < bridge> <Solly> i dont think "eheh trans colors because its *trans*pose" is that deep #
23:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> `both` is a funnier joke imo

23:22 < bridge> <Solly> finaly a stacktrace
23:22 < bridge> <Solly> oh tahts what u meant by purge
23:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Maybe there is a command that I just don't know tho
23:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Not like I mod discord everyday lol
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> noob mod
23:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I know basically nothing about modding
23:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I am still blue cuz some CHN mods channels through me
23:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
23:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> And I track what's going on and announce them in CHN mod group I guess
23:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You know I used to not be irritated by that stuff
23:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> then I had my "maybe I'm trans?" phase
23:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> now I have severe internalized transphobia
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> good to know
23:33 < bridge> <Solly> gah why is it reporting modes when
23:33 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348423536800301136/image.png?ex=67cf68c7&is=67ce1747&hm=8d84673cb6f8434b06dda56b9d09204527b9c4a86330fd7d4e043fdd388d0799&
23:33 < bridge> <Solly> there are none
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> huh
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> trying to fix sdl3
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> nice
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> gl
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> and its giving me modes with 0 width and 0 height
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> im sleep
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> = fpe
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> good idea
23:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> as a bisexual its still a bit corny :nouis:
23:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh shit this is old news
23:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sorry im at work
23:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but at least it's not like `bisect` or something lame like that
23:40 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348425260592136233/image.png?ex=67cf6a62&is=67ce18e2&hm=080114c73c37d6f57608cc6767cd6aa36cfe34c85132312cb5b1d1417e52e93d&
23:40 < bridge> <Solly> hmm
23:41 < bridge> <Solly> why is it giving modes in windowed mode anyway
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> nice
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> can't you just ignore all 0x0? xd
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> or are there supposed to be different ones?
23:42 < bridge> <Solly> theres spost to be none
23:43 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348425916740534393/image.png?ex=67cf6aff&is=67ce197f&hm=f8156301f63c6add0df0ab55f4433737965a01dd47ac27b6c31a900d120bd924&
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> windowed is just a window
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> windowed borderless is no decoration
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> windowed fullscreen is??
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> desktop fullscreen is i want to be fullscreen flag??
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> fullscreen is exclusive fullscreen if available??
23:44 < bridge> <Solly> my intelisense is borked for some reason as well
23:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Check pins
23:45 < bridge> <Solly> so fullscreen is the only one which is meant to have window modes
23:45 < bridge> <Solly> so fullscreen is the only one which is meant to have modes
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> ```
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> // Only collect fullscreen modes when requested, that makes sure in windowed mode no refresh rates are shown that aren't supported without
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> // fullscreen anyway (except fullscreen desktop)
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> ```
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> ```
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> Desktop fullscreen = use desktop video mode(this should normally act like fullscreen just without minimize). This is also nativly supported by SDL for easier window managment if you dont care to request video modes etc.
23:46 < bridge> <Solly> ```
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> random checks for this idk why
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348427173702406266/image.png?ex=67cf6c2a&is=67ce1aaa&hm=30cb12dfaf466e211b024cf50de870f5b10aae34e1c54080ff743667f3541d73&
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> that should never be nullptr
23:50 < bridge> <Solly> why are there 2 different things for window mode D:
23:50 < bridge> <Solly> gfx_{borderless,fullscreen}
23:52 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348428279035465811/image.png?ex=67cf6d32&is=67ce1bb2&hm=041f5abcc2b891e2af9b844cd72c199db4f7d96585e83a16c2a919f8dd970d06&
23:52 < bridge> <Solly> why is a boolean being passed to refresh rate
23:52 < bridge> <Solly> oh am blind
23:52 < bridge> <Solly> nvm
23:53 < bridge> <Solly> `// in non fullscren these are the modes that show different refresh rate, but are basically the same`
23:53 < bridge> <Solly> different refresh rates are important?
23:53 < bridge> <Solly> this is such a mess
23:54 < bridge> <Solly> ctrl-a delete?
