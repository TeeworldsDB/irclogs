02:35 < nuborn> hi
02:36 <@deen> hi
02:36 < nuborn> about the prediction of hook strength, I made it work with client only
02:36 <@deen> wow, how?
02:37 < nuborn> there is just a delay until it works, since it needs to test the hook strength the first time you hook another tee, and choose the one that fits best
02:37 < nuborn> like, 50 millisecond delay
02:37 <@deen> haha
02:37 <@deen> well, delay depends on your ping
02:37 <@deen> but yeah, you could do a heuristic like that
02:37 < nuborn> yes
02:38 <@deen> Note that it could break with new unpredicted features
02:38 <@deen> does it work with speeders for example?
02:38 < nuborn> the only thing it changes is the order the charactercores are Tick()ed in
02:39 < nuborn> so the worst case scenario is that it predicts the wrong hook strength, like today
02:42 < nuborn> Im not sure how speeders work
02:47 <@deen> ok, sounds good
02:49 < nuborn> the only thing I wonder if is the inital delay looks bad
02:54 <@deen> not worse than right now
02:55 <@deen> I like the idea
02:55 <@deen> Do you test it with high ping?
02:55 < nuborn> yes, testing at a chile server now
02:55 <@deen> ok, good
02:56 <@deen> it's great that you're working on prediction =)
03:00 <@deen> Some people really need it.
03:00 < nuborn> yes, Im just triying different things for fun :P
03:07 < nuborn> and I like the idea of being able to play on servers with higher ping
03:10 <@deen> yeah
10:50 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
10:55 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
13:12 <@deen> EastByte: I thought EUR was going down?
13:14 <@EastByte> "Dienstleistungen, die heute ablaufen: vps105155.ovh.net"
13:14 <@deen> oops, I got the date wrong
13:14 <@deen> I thought yesterday, sorry =/
13:14 <@EastByte> no problem
13:14 <@deen> I think I looked at the date somewhere in the night and forgot that date changes at midnight^^
13:15 <@EastByte> haha^
13:15 <@EastByte> I gotta eat, afk
13:15 <@deen> Some people asked already if EUR is coming back
13:15 <@deen> I told them that GER shouldn't be lagging every evening anymore (hope it's true)
13:55 <@EastByte> Learath2: does your autoupdater include curl?
14:07 <@deen> EastByte: from what I heard, yes
14:08 <@EastByte> great
14:11 <@deen> I'm working on a filter in DDNet tab by mod
14:11 <@deen> then all the other-mod-haters can just filter them out
14:11 <@deen> does this look ok to you, EastByte?: http://ddnet.tw/serverlist.json
14:17 <@EastByte> yea, I like it
14:17 <@deen> and I would make a tab out of the DDNet countries filter
14:18 <@EastByte> hm? I don't understand
14:18 <@deen> You'll see^^
14:19 <@EastByte> okay^^
16:12 <@deen> But it sounds like people want me to shut down all the non-DDNet servers anyway
16:13 <@deen> so what I'm doing now is pretty useless anyway
16:44 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/filterc.png http://ddnet.tw/filtert.png
16:45 <@deen> hm, I'll make it brighter
16:45 <@deen> or maybe not
16:46 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/l-d8ww
16:46 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8d945fe def: Exclude DDNet servery by type
17:03 < Learath2> what should we do about SSL ?
17:04 < Learath2> would be a good idea to fetch files from https 
17:04 < Learath2> but what do we trust self signed CA or free ssl cert ?
17:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/MfodCw
17:17 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 e816e2e def: Clean up menus
17:17 <@deen> Learath2: I'm very much for self signed CA
17:19 < Learath2> sry for being so darn slow 700 lines in months :/
17:19 <@deen> don't worry about it
17:19 <@heinrich5991> don't measure yourself by such metrics
17:19 <@deen> and that too^^
17:22 < Learath2> need to get some error checking and plug the ssl certs in somewhere and it should work
17:22 <@deen> and I need to create an ssl cert
17:22 <@deen> But hm
17:23 <@deen> It's still not as good as signed updates, is it?
17:23 < Learath2> ?
17:23 <@deen> If someone takes over the server they can just change the files in the autoupdater
17:24 < Learath2> securing the server seems easier :P
17:24 <@deen> no, it's impossible
17:24 < Learath2> then signed updates it is
17:24 <@deen> ^^
17:25 <@deen> hm, I just don't know how to do that
17:25 <@heinrich5991> deen: that would be with signing updates offline, or what?
17:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: exactly
17:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: I have the certificate on my local computer and sign them here, then upload the signed files and signatures
17:27 < Learath2> could sign the updates with pgp
17:28 < Learath2> s/updates/files
17:30 <@deen> yeah
17:30 <@deen> but how to verify?
17:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/C6pCmg
17:35 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 b694c86 def: Fix distance in menu
17:37 < Learath2> well we need to distribute the public key with the client
17:37 <@deen> yes, of course
17:37 <@deen> but how to verify then? would need to ship pgp, right?
17:39 < Learath2> that does sound meh
17:39 <@deen> I'd be curious how other software projects do it
17:39 <@heinrich5991> maybe look at ff or so
17:39 <@heinrich5991> or linux distributions
17:40 <@deen> linux distributions usually use pgp in my experience
17:40 <@deen> the firefox plugins just go over a regular https connection
17:41 < Learath2> could include openssl
17:41 < Learath2> use its signing capability
17:45 <@deen> doesn't libcurl already pull in openssl anyway?
17:45 <@deen> that was my hope
17:47 < Savander> deen:  what is that two fields at the bottom of screen (instead of quick search?)
17:47 < Savander> [16:44] <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/filterc.png http://ddnet.tw/filtert.png
17:48 <@deen> left is quick search, right is exclude from search
17:48 < Savander> ahm :o?
17:49 <@deen> Learath2: well, I guess regular https is good enough for now =/
17:49 <@deen> I don't have the time to find out how to do it properly
17:50 < Learath2> deen: libcurl does pull in openssl
17:51 < Learath2> libcurl pulls in some unnecessary stuff that teeworlds already has but not sure how i can make it use the zlib we compile with teeworlds
17:55 <@deen> do you pull in a finished libcurl library?
17:55 <@deen> or the source files?
17:58 < Learath2> finished libcurl library
17:58 <@deen> hm, no idea
19:06 <@deen> Learath2: will the updater be done today? I think I'd like to release new client version
19:13 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:13 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 544
19:13 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
19:13 < Savander> tournament or smth?;o
19:13 <@deen> no
19:13 < Savander> so many ppl
19:13 <@deen> unfortunately not
19:13 <@deen> sunday evening
19:13 <@deen> always has most players
19:15 < Learath2> deen: do release there are some quite weird SIGSEGVs that appear when runnning normal and disappear in gdb
19:16 <@deen> oh, weird =/

20:13 <@deen> EastByte: hm, your json isn't valid json. the python json parser doesn't like trailing commas
20:13 <@deen> hi goo
20:13 <@EastByte> yes I know
20:13 <@EastByte> but I want trailing commas
20:14 <@deen> ^^
20:14 <@deen> so, is there a python json parser that can read that?
20:14 <@deen> I understand that trailing commas are really practical
20:15 <@EastByte> hmm should be possible in some way
20:16 <@EastByte> mayby some hidden parameter?
20:16 <@EastByte> hmm had a lagg on ger
20:17 <@deen> =/
