00:06 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> @Learath2 in case you need MySQL DB, tell me
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'll aquire some sleep then i'll get an sql db and test :/
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i really hate setting up sql ðŸ˜„
00:17 <@heinrich5991> deen: indeed a lot of spam ^^
00:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> 500MB is enough?
00:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> will pm you
01:05 < necropotame> Is the Discord now acceptable ? Last time it was just a stream of insult
01:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Still is it. ðŸ˜¦
02:02 < ddnet-discord> <Welf> necropotame it depends of your tolerance about human beeings :P well i try to keep this part of the discord clean. Tell people if you dont like too much offtopic :s (we can also remove the irc bot if it is actually too much)
12:46 < grenadepro> hi
12:47 < grenadepro> guys what happen if remove "record_teamrace" of a boter player ?
12:48 < grenadepro> then what happen if type /top5team if him was there its show a blank nickname instead his name ?
12:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> just remove every record with his name
12:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> even team-ranks. They are cheated probably
13:02 < grenadepro> 1) delete from record_race where Name = 'bot';
13:02 < grenadepro> 2) delete from record_teamrace where Name = 'bot';
13:02 < grenadepro> 3) delete from record_points where Name = 'bot';
13:02 < grenadepro> is it enough ?
13:06 < grenadepro> in fact i dont know what happen if i remove his teamrace record caz i dont know what show me if i type /top5team its show his name as blank name 'nameless tee' or what ?
13:06 < grenadepro> and maybe 3) is wrong i think it must be like this 3) update record_points set Points = 0 where Name = bot';
13:23 <@deen> well, team records with 1 player should not exist
13:23 <@deen> so you should probably delete the records of everyone who played in team with the botter, but that's a pretty manual process
13:26 < grenadepro> hmm its so hard
13:27 < grenadepro> deen can i have a question in pv ?
