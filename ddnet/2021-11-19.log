08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people should stop bullshitting and just adopt ipv6
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4.294.967.296 virgin ipv4 ips vs 340.282.366.920.938.463.463.374.607.431.768.211.456 chad ipv6 ips
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's been a long time they attempted to adopt it, unsuccessfully
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats new?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> version number
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its probs for this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4360
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nothing big new, but I don't want to cherry-pick all fixes
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: you added onbgy twice to credits \:D

10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> soon we need pagination for credits
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine requiring all equipment connected to any network requiring validation and upgrading to allow class E ipv4 to be used but saying it's too much work or impossible when we ask the same thing to be done for ipv6
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This has serious america energy. Whenever a corporation needs bailout, the army needs extra cash, israel needs aid there are suddenly hundreds of billions in the treasury. When people ask for healthcare no can do no money
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u read bernie tweets? xd
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i agree

11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why muricans dont make this guy president
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hadn't yet but the guy has been saying this since all the way when he first became a politician
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess its cuz they consider him a communist
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funny thing is the entire american political compass fits neatly into the bottom right corner of a european one :P
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no single thing i would consider even slightly "left"
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on america
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because the mindset of many people is not that they are poor and should improve the situation of the poor, but that they are temporarily embarrassed millionaires.
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.temporarilyembarrassedmillionaires.org/
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."

11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > You may not realise it, but you could be a temporarily embarrassed millionaire. Do you plan to someday in the future have more money? Are you concerned that your taxes are too high, because someday you might pay too much tax. Do you ride the bus only because this year you can’t afford that luxury car you’re going to have? Do you live pay cheque to pay cheque like most people just because you haven’t had your lucky break.
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > You aren’t rich and it’s very unlikely you ever will be. The economic and power systems of this planet are not designed for you to get rich. The American dream doesn’t exist and it never did. Stop being a temporarily embarrassed millionaire and just be a person.
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i have a problem where I(player) hold D and go ./pause , and its not holding d when im in pause
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it worked before, but now its not(

11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it really mess when i play
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> you guys changed something in client?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> what i need to write in f1 to fix it
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works for me
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what is your bind to pause?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> press g say /pause
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> bind g say /pause
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> xd
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it changes anything?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try binding another key
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> this bind i have from 2009
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> k
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe your keyboard has some crosstalk where pressing one key disables another
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i also hhave vinnd ctrl+g
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> to exec gores mode(hammer on lmb and hook for rmb
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and it doesnt work anymore
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i dont think so
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ha, i can reproduce it
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> having a ctrl+g bind is causing it
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it can press all keys and work
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> interesting
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> so i need to unbind ctrl+g?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> k i try now
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bind it to something else as a temporary fix until we provide a proper one
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> okay
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> btw
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can you add request to skip all warnings whhen start client?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i have much old lowquality skkins
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and it always says likke 100 times WARNING- IT doesnt /8 or 4 and cann cause problems
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i need to press OKAY like ~100 times
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> to start playing
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, you had a few months to fix the graphics warnings
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had a setting for a while. Now we don't you'll need to fix your skins
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can send me all of them ad I can fix them
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> damn
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> @deen i unbind ctrl+g
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and it didnt fix
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> still cant hold button on pause
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird, it worked for me
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try binding g again
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> now when i unpause he goes righht like i hold
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> but when in pause-he does not
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i hold d, he goes right
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i hold d, press g(pause), he doesnt go right
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i unpause, he goes righht
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> strange
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> didnt hhelp
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try restarting client?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i did
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> didnt help
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i tried old client
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> didnt work there too
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> may be its some setting from 07 client?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we don't take settings from 07
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i played dm in 07 then go 06
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> f client there
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can try removing settings.cfg and settings_ddnet.cfg (make backups)
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> from appdata?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> amm
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> when i try to enter a server game crash
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> 2 times already
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> 3 times
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> lol game doesnt work now
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Did you try 15.7-rc1?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we fixed some  crashes
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i have updated client
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> so its 15 7 i bet
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> please try 15.7-rc1 explicitly not "15 7 i bet "
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> where i get it
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See #announcements
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> 15 6 2
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i have
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> wait i try it
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> in the 15.7-rc1 bug fixed itself?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i dont that bug anymore
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> even if i bind ctrl+g it doesnt bug anymore
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> wierd
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i need to go now
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> bb
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great, best if we fixed the bugs already 😄
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't understand how though
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupeyy: Some problems with automatic resizing I think: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/3204869541724347790/?tscn=1637281572
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> @deen has been my bug reported to github yet? The editor entity select bug? I don't have time to create a new account cuz github blocks my original.
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Also my fully translated version with some major changes.

12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks, what bug?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> @deen this
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> still not fixed on 15.7 beta
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate when someone interrupts me (e.g by calling) when im hyperfocused coding something
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly disrupts you
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mute and disable notifications
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can add some allow list for calls, or set it so it starts ringing on second call from same number
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye, its my boss who called
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL about cuids

14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turning off the last archlinux host in my computer for the last time
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coincidentally also the last systemd machine
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the last time I’ll be stuck on the shutdown screen because I didn’t hammer systemd just the right way to get it to work for my computer but it also works for all computers no setup needed btw
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um @nuborn are you around?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we might want to release 15.7 without waiting as maps with laser tiles don't display properly
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Miper 4 as an example
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bad experience with releasing without waiting
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Could we revert official servers to an older state instead?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is emerge smarter than pacman=
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc pacman si known to be very good
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to try gentoo but migrating is too bothersome
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i just fixed systemd by setting a 10 sec hard limit
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so idk
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on what you mean by smarter. It uses a full graph representation of dependencies. So it’s not really dumb like brew
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 apt is a bit stupid
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u see the ltt drama?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linus tried to install steam and it uninstalled all pop-os
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m not sure what pacman is known to be good for. It worked fairly well but it did stumble over things like self updates or long time no updates requiring some manual intervention. Same is true for emerge
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One nice thing about emerge is that like bsd ports you get a clone of the ebuild tree. So even a very old system can still install packages without having to do a full world update. Which is very useful to me. Sometimes I just want to quickly install something and not bother with upgrading my entire system
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Installing steam is pain on all distros I’ve tried :/
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m unsure what exactly is broken. Maybe if we revert servers to somewhere around 15.5.4 but we had a lot of bugfixes inbetween, don’t know if any of those were critical
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz steam needs 32bit libraries for stupid legacy games
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho i dont understand why tho
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep and it will use it’s own runtime which can cause some interesting behaviour
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam on macos is 64bit btw
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why they dont jsut update it
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on linux too
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s like a weird flatpak kinda thing
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Steam on gentoo is quite a bit of a pain ngl. Gentoo always wants to use system libs, steam absolutely hates using system libs
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Conventional wisdom says allocate 2x ram for swap. Not sure I want 64G of swap on my ssd 😄
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im learning nextjs
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man the js world may be bloated but
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have everything
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw this orm looks amazing https://www.prisma.io/
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you use their prisma language, which translates to multiple sql languages (postgres, etc)
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u have a tool to generate a "client"
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which basically has every method
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your data.
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this is what i meant
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/qw5jbv/apt_2312_released_the_solver_will_no_longer_try/
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they updated it because what happened to linus tech tips
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > APT 2.3.12 released: The solver will no longer try to remove Essential or Protected packages.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my wisdom says max 8gb and thats it
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Disk /dev/mapper/VolumeGroup-swap: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always hated the partitioning step
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lvm on luks
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will do just luks as I always do
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not lvm on luks
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like lvm
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why involve lvm when I don’t need lvm? 😛
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The main advantages of LVM are increased abstraction, flexibility, and control. Logical volumes can have meaningful names like “databases” or “root-backup”. Volumes can be resized dynamically as space requirements change and migrated between physical devices within the pool on a running system or exported easily.
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like using anything new and shiny
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also its cooler to say you use lvm on luks
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than just luks
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I won’t even have an initramfs if you could believe that
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you want faster boot?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on an ssd thats barely noticable
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That means unencrypted root
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and if you have to type the luks password
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boot time doesnt matter
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do unencrypted root, so I don’t need an initramfs
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur fbi can see ur root
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can add one to have a cool waiting screen to hide openrc’s boot output and make debugging annoying 😛
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have any gui login
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its bloat
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I could actually encrypt root and have an initramfs this time, I was looking to try dracut sometime
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes do it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont let fbi know ur root
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460782968633499651
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another example of corporations not respecting free software
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, saw this drama. Ungrateful cunts
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460783258237640706
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460783358447923200
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, decided. I’ll do one of those new age setups with a cute graphical login thing
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, maybe I’ll do btrfs on luks
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 daring arent we
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even i use btrfs
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Btrfs is growing at a fast rate, but it is still not considered stable. Until now, the ext4 seems to be a much better choice on the desktop system since it is the default file system, and it is faster than the btrfs when transferring files.May 26, 2021
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> seems like its not worth rn
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fedora uses it by default iirc
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well btrfs seems to have neat featurews
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Snapshots are the one I’d be most interested in
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Filesystem-level Compression
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heinrich uses it to store teehistorian files
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use zfs to store teehistorian files
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also use filesystem-level compression
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure what 'it' referred to
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, thought you used btrfs not zfs
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still don’t quite see a point to lvm, so I’ll stick to just luks
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lvm is good if u use ext4
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btrfs doesnt need it

17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Filesystem-level Deduplication
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a cool feature too

18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> @Learath2 here now
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> Lasers is CLight, right? Those were changed, so, yes, there might be a compatibility problem if servers run with pr #4306
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4306
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the rc fixed the issue, so it's fine
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> Ok
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait if the issue can be fixed on the server that'd be nice until we get 15.7 tested
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> Yes, for that I think reverting that one commit should be enough
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen ^^
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I can reproduce #4369 with any absolute path with unicode characters. But the only thing I found out so far is that dbg_msg seems to not work when you try to print the path of the map.
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/911333140780445696/unknown.png
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4369
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> neither of the dbg_msg "0" work, but the "1" is printed
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Robyt3 can you check for invalid utf-8?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> is there a system function for that?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, you could print out the hex
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and send it here or so
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `bytes.fromhex("61 62 63 64 65 66 0a").decode("utf-8")`
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (python)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> does indeed look invalid: 44 3A 5C D6 2E 6D 61 70
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> actual path was D:\Ö.map
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> actual path was D:\\Ö.map
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> validator says Error: Error: Invalid continuation byte
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```py
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >>> bytes.fromhex("44 3A 5C D6 2E 6D 61 70").decode("latin1")
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 'D:\\Ö.map'
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> iso 8859-1, looks like it's decoded according to the local codepage
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> also fails with relative paths if they contain unicode, was just coincidence in the issue
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> because it said that relative paths work
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> he we go adding num\_commandline\_arguments and get\_commandline\_argument to system :justatest:
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, right now ger1 is lagging
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for everyone, it seems
