00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @remakepower although it would be nice for every chat msg be a shared_ptr and have them in a queue
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can actually do most things by keeping an id in the chat msg to check if its the same one
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> selection  across multipelt hings is a bit... aggh no matter the data structure
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> context menu is pretty easy to do no matter the data structure
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> selection and/or changing the data structure would conflict with my translation thing
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there is alot of jank in the chat and generally cleaning it up would be nice
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
00:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if there is an alternative to the circular queue which doesnt come with *some* overhead, but its probably better for maintainability, grokking and modability if it was changed
00:51 < bridge> <Property of Souly> can we also add text effects in chat so your chat messages can pop out? üöÄ
00:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we arent about to get a reduced motion setting in ddnet lmao
00:53 < bridge> <Property of Souly> like, have a bold text and italics text thing, and also wiggling text too!
00:53 < bridge> <Property of Souly> 1v1 me $b{RIGHT NOW} or you $w{AUTOLOSE!}
00:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rich text is going to be hard
00:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am a fan of the $thing{} syntax i have used it before
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> less verbose than xml
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its harder to parse than something like ansii escapes
00:54 < bridge> <Property of Souly> yeah thats fair
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having actual just ansii escapes might be an idea actually
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how you would type them, maybe with wisiwig binds or something
00:55 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i was mostly being ironic anyways but i think itd be funny
00:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im in favour for rich text, but its fair that most people arent or are atleast wary due to spammers
00:55 < bridge> <Property of Souly> $p{cheval_up} for fonticons LOL
00:55 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
00:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or just $chevel_up
00:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doesnt font icons use private unicode so you could just send that character
01:01 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i mean do i rly wanna look up unicode constantly
01:03 < bridge> <oxyzo.> add in game unicode list
01:05 < bridge> <Property of Souly> good idea
03:31 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah
03:31 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm

12:30 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> I dont know it feels out of place in the selection screen
12:47 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> dyslexia hitting hard holy, I read that as "would it be nicer if it was hidden?"
12:55 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> bruh
12:55 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> I guess theres alot to learn for me about pull requests, i didnt know renaming it would make it seem deleted
12:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont worry, it happens :p
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> It shouldn't. You might have clicked something wrong
13:04 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> really? I went on Github > view all branches > three dots on the right for the branch and renamed it
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> Ah you renamed the branch, not the pr
13:04 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> yes
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I don't think you can do that without triggering the deleted thing
13:05 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> I can delete it after it merges right? I have two branches with the same thing now
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yep
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> Or if you need to rename, you can rename the branch, then also change the branch the pull request is referencing. I don't remember off the top of my head where that is changed though
13:07 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> I'll stick with the easy option then and just delete it after
14:08 < bridge> <oxyzo.> hi guys can someone make a pull request for this
14:08 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
14:16 < furo> @oxyzo. I have already created one if you look further up :)
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 does anti bot know about the clients version? I assume all player data antibot has comes from ``CAntibotRoundData`` right? So if i send a message how do i know if it should be 0.7 or 0.6
14:20 < bridge> <oxyzo.> okay thanks:deen_star:
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 nvm got it furo told me there is sixup passed on client join

15:54 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, no idea why it appears different in the menu, maybe just add debug messages and check which values are actually used and if they are similar ingame and in the menus
15:54 < bridge> <Assa> doing this works:
15:54 < bridge> <Assa> `const float TicksHead = (int)(Client()->GlobalTime() * Client()->GameTickSpeed());`
15:56 < bridge> <Assa> guess it should be `Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation((int)TicksHead);` instead
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> they still "feel" too fast, but I can't really tell at this point anymore ü§î
15:59 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I guess this was the issue
16:13 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> How to add a new file into source code? Do I only need to change CMakeLists.txt?

16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki is it not possible to make an aggregate literal with non-const elements in llvm-ir?
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```llvm
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> %a = type {i32, i8, i64}
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> define void @main(i32 %foo) {
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     %t = add i8 0, 0
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     %b = alloca %a
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     store %a {i32 10, i8 %t, i64 20}, %a* %b

16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
16:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
16:17 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, add new files in `CMakeLists.txt`, that should be enough
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm no idea, but btw do u know about undef?
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a way to init a struct without having it behind a alloca
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> using insertelement
16:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> interesting
17:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 do i need to do anything?
17:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> no, you can just join
17:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> I was asked for another league client based on t-client, which is why I deleted the prevous two repos and created three new ones with a different naming schema
17:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> I don't want to distribute closed source clients without at least a second person seeing the code. it's just a trust thing, I guess.
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> A couple people worked on tee renderers, did anyone document the values?

18:01 < bridge> <learath2> or that big üòï
18:03 < bridge> <patiga> try out `0.75 - false_eye_offset_value`
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> unsure what `false_eye_offset_value` is, nor what this new value is supposed to be?
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> unsure what `false_eye_offset_value` is, nor what this new value is supposed to be
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> TIL ``broadcast "a" b`` only prints ``a`` even tho the argument is ``r[message]`` i thought r was supposed to be raw
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> in the doc it says
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> ```
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> each eye (away from the other):
18:05 < bridge> <patiga>         x: abs(cos(dir)) * 0.01
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> ```
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> you probably used that?
18:05 < bridge> <robyt3> It's "rest" IIRC
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay even rest is wrong then 
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> instead, try
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> ```
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> each eye (away from the other):
18:05 < bridge> <patiga>         x: 0.75 - abs(cos(dir)) * 0.01
18:05 < bridge> <patiga> ```
18:05 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, no I used just 
18:05 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> eyes:
18:06 < bridge> <learath2>     0.125 up
18:06 < bridge> <learath2>     0.05 left/right
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because it can also only consume one argument if the first one is quoted
18:06 < bridge> <patiga> huh
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> is the 0.05 there meant to be something else?
18:06 < bridge> <patiga> good question
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``broadcast a "a" a`` prints ``a "a" a``
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this seems a bit inconsistent
18:07 < bridge> <patiga> Relevant twgpu code
18:07 < bridge> <patiga> ```rust
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>         let eyes_middle = Vec2::new(0.25, 0.2) * direction - Vec2::new(0., 0.1);
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>         let eye_offset = Vec2::new(0.15 - direction.x.abs() * 0.02, 0.);
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>         ...
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>         let eye_middle = eye_sprite
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>             .sprite(position + animation.body.offset + eyes_middle, skin)
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>             .scale2(eye_scale);
18:07 < bridge> <patiga>         for side in [1., -1.] {
18:08 < bridge> <patiga>             eye_middle
18:08 < bridge> <patiga>                 .offset(side * eye_offset)
18:08 < bridge> <patiga>                 .mirror_x(side.is_sign_positive())

18:08 < bridge> <patiga>         }
18:08 < bridge> <patiga> ```
18:08 < bridge> <patiga> note that in twgpu, 1 = 1 tile = 1/2 body length
18:08 < bridge> <patiga> so the values in twgpu code are 2x bigger
18:09 < bridge> <patiga> okay this looks so different
18:09 < bridge> <patiga> tbf I did fix eye rendering in twgpu like 1 month ago

18:19 < bridge> <learath2> @patiga what is `BaseSize` supposed to be?
18:20 < bridge> <patiga> honestly sizes of textures in DDNet were one of the hardest things for me to figure out, I'd just use the docs there

18:51 < bridge> <learath2> 90 degrees up
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> but I think the math is not mathing correctly because of godots coordinate system being different
18:52 < bridge> <patiga> hm
18:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No I think you're cooking, keep going
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> yeah in godot right = -90
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> actually no that doesn't sound right either
18:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> outline on the left is way bigger
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah that's because I'm not rendering the outline yet, maybe that's what makes it odd
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> but the eyes also seem further apart, no?
18:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> would be my guess
18:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be an illusion due to outline
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 watcha workin on
19:03 < bridge> <patiga> the tee on the right is also bigger relative to the image I think
19:04 < bridge> <patiga> a little context @jupeyy_keks
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cool
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet-godot
19:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the tee in nameplate preview now stares into your soul
19:13 < bridge> <learath2> mh
19:13 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353431403953389629/image.png?ex=67e1a0b8&is=67e04f38&hm=6da57cb5a48f7c13a8ff98d6efcb9179ae9ed6428aa0cccbd00b57969a62ed63&
19:14 < bridge> <patiga> they should def be higher
19:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be related to weapon position which moves the eyes in a small circle around the center?
19:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> is there something like that?
19:15 < bridge> <patiga> the weapon position does not influence the eye position afaik
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> It must be something to do with the scale somehow
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353431978384429056/image.png?ex=67e1a141&is=67e04fc1&hm=0325f4224d8ffe4bf4f9d51213d39e4684ec37a7d33c79d1387de92e6521b828&
19:16 < bridge> <patiga> well what is your scale? 1 = how much?
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> almost as if `absf(dir.x)` is just not getting as large as it's supposed to get
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> Good question, idk, I've been kinda winging it üòÑ
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> but it seems basesize is 64 for ddnet, however all my measurements are off of 96
19:18 < bridge> <patiga> ow
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> But I do not quite understand how `BaseSize` is 64 for ddnet, do we clip off parts of the skin? do we rescale it? the head part is clearly 96px
19:19 < bridge> <patiga> 64 in ddnet units = 2 tiles
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> I should stop winging it and just actually read the code tbh
19:19 < bridge> <patiga> and that is the normal size of the body sprite iirc
19:20 < bridge> <patiga> ||you could also try the docs, or did you already try that?||
19:21 < bridge> <learath2> the libtw docs?
19:22 < bridge> <patiga> yea
19:22 < bridge> <patiga> the scaling is also in there
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> That's what I used, 96px is the body size, everything is scaled according to those docs
19:23 < bridge> <patiga> but what is base_size doing then?
19:23 < bridge> <patiga> *BASE_SIZE
19:23 < bridge> <patiga> ah
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> that's the 1
19:24 < bridge> <patiga> are eye_r/eye_l attached to eyes?
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> eh, honestly just wasting my time, I can just adjust the constants to make it look good enough, not like I'm trying to remake teeworlds here
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> yep, and eyes is the origin of both
19:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I reported some time ago when I tried to make a replica of a Tee's design in Godot, that the eyes are fucked, it was in here
19:36 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, I'll actually look at the code, document this properly with a graphic
19:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> From this convo
19:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Also the eye offset from the middle (looking up and down) to the sides (looking left and right) was there since 0.5
19:37 < bridge> <Assa> I hope the eyes are at least vertically centered
19:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It is in a calculated matter, it just doesn't align it's distances properly from the middle
19:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It should have a stable distance, then the two eyes should inherit that distance and add or subtract an offset to get the right positioning
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> Okay, it was not getting high enough because I forgot the entire body is actually 6px higher
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> now to figure out why the seperation is far too high
19:42 < bridge> <Assa> can I refactor maplayers and use function pointers? üëâ üëà  üôà
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> std::function?
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mite turn less heads
19:46 < bridge> <Assa> either that or C style
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mite turn less heads
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> than c style
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> try it :D
19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk
19:46 < bridge> <Assa> I worked with both before
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> hm perhaps it's not far too high, but it is still like 2-3 pixels off üòÑ
19:48 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353440342787100722/image.png?ex=67e1a90b&is=67e0578b&hm=4de3a61fed7c37b5d998541e64947cf63c1c1b7f71e923c0fe3a38133013028f&
19:49 < bridge> <Assa> in both directions, even to the ground, maybe base size is too small?
19:50 < bridge> <Assa> ~~in both directions, even to the ground, maybe base size is too small?~~
19:50 < bridge> <Assa> the grass on the right doesn't align, what are you comparing xD
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> the eyes are almost supposed to be touching, when looking right, yeah idk, perhaps it is a scaling thing
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353441215852576879/image.png?ex=67e1a9db&is=67e0585b&hm=89f654ec0cfab5099ea6f5251a943bcafd66e2c04c526b994476fdffe1736192&
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> I'm comparing a tee rendered in godot following the scales/offsets in libtw2 docs to one rendered in the actual game
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> It's 0.01 units off it seems just by looking at it
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> rendering error
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> leftmost one has 0.01 less seperation and it looks exact
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353442478350405663/image.png?ex=67e1ab08&is=67e05988&hm=d4cdad1cb3c5a56f72c88b32020dc4b025a1eee429b189d9f678335029562872&
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> left is yours?
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> u should try comparison via onion skin instead
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> or just layer them & change opacity
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> looks accurate imo
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but the eyes may be a little high
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> the uncolored ones are mine, the leftmost one is eyeballed to match the rightmost one, the other 2 are following the calculations in ddnet/libtw2 exactly
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the gap could actually be smaller
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> ive never used godot so idk at what size they quantize for the rendering
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like you want an exact middle ground between the leftmost 2 of yours to match the screenshot on the right
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated. my work macbook supports sharing a network connection over basically every port it has, but i can't figure out how the "USB LAN" bridge works
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> the thunderbolt ports/bridges do all have a standard for network thanks to thunderbolt being a standard
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk what protocol this is using
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> here it is with 0.005 instead of 0.01 of eyeballing
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1353443276455415879/image.png?ex=67e1abc6&is=67e05a46&hm=964223ad8e6fe884845a88b40e3858572bea87b11f7c053ecf8118fa139a68e6&
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> that's totally it
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> lmao
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> but  I still do not see where this 0.005 of error is coming from üòÑ
20:01 < bridge> <Ewan> godot's supposed to be easy
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> It is very easy, getting it almost rendering properly took me like 15 minutes
20:02 < bridge> <learath2> Then I got curious about what exactly we do in teeworlds
20:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> sounds more like an off by factor of 2 error
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> been there, i have tried to implement Microsoft's fluent UI into Qt, from when win 11 was new
20:02 < bridge> <Ewan> and all the little rounding errors and stuff drove me insane
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i had to do weird rendering paths & math over the top to get it to antialias and use a gradient at the same time
20:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wait nvm I might be dumb
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> and then when i realized the font would *never* look exactly right, i stopped
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i could probably have taken over the text rendering but for what purpose
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd have to deal with COM on my app's thread at that point, which with Qt is just not worth
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> because they already CoInit the main thread & the args it uses are not public API
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> Tees are also supposed to look larger than a tile, I don't know where we do that though
20:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also wow I never noticed that tees' eyes aren't a constant distance apart
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> you never notice until you actually implement it without the variable eye distance üòÑ
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> then it suddenly looks completely off
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> template <typename T>
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> using fn_overlay_function = std::function<void(T*, int, int, float, ColorRGBA, int)>;
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> :justatest:
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> I'm scared
20:07 < bridge> <Assa> me, too
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> please don't
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> at least not without a constraint on T
20:13 < bridge> <Assa> what why would you like to constraint T?
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to make sure that T is something that won't shit the bed when taken as a pointer
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> the STL type traits probably won't help you in DDNet code but that's dangerous
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> also, are you even able to compile that?
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> templating a typedef with a std function like that
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i did similar typedefs when i wrote the original ver of the status bar that's in tclient now iirc but i didn't bake it into the std function iirc
20:15 < bridge> <Assa> that's why it's not actually a typedef
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> using and typedef have interchangeable meanings in a lot of circumstances
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but the idea is the same
20:25 < bridge> <aegisub> why shouldn't it work?
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn‚Äôt read it right
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> he‚Äôs making a template type
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> which is fune
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> which is fine
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> he‚Äôs making a type template

22:23 < bridge> <Property of Souly> XD
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> omg brak himself?
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> how has he been since his show went off the air
22:34 < bridge> <Property of Souly> Quick question, can grenades ever bounce in normal ddnet?
22:37 < bridge> <oxyzo.> pretty sure no
22:37 < bridge> <oxyzo.> only if modified
22:38 < bridge> <Property of Souly> Can gun projectiles have any influence on physics?
22:39 < bridge> <Property of Souly> im pretty sure no but just to be safe
22:40 < bridge> <Property of Souly> ohhhh
22:40 < bridge> <Property of Souly> ofcc
22:40 < bridge> <Property of Souly> im so stupid
22:40 < bridge> <Property of Souly> the bullets bounce
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym?
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ofc they have an influence on physics bcs when they hit a tee something will happen to its trajectory
22:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think they meant pistol?
22:43 < bridge> <Property of Souly> yes i meant pistol
22:43 < bridge> <Property of Souly> doesnt matter
22:43 < bridge> <Property of Souly> forgot what i said
22:43 < bridge> <Property of Souly> forget what i said
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> nades bounce in foot
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i love football
22:44 < bridge> <Property of Souly> but football not ddnet
22:44 < bridge> <Property of Souly> so im not supporting it xd
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
23:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks @Property of Souly is it public? 
23:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 5-7 hours sounds good but how do i know i can trust him not to abuse rcon ._.
23:10 < bridge> <Property of Souly> @teero777 he was meant to ping you :p
23:11 < bridge> <Property of Souly> 5-7 hours of his life

23:11 < bridge> <Property of Souly> :P
23:11 < bridge> <Property of Souly> > <ChillerDragon> thanks @Property of Souly is it public?
23:11 < bridge> <Property of Souly> chiller what are you talking about?
23:21 < bridge> <cellegenrih> how generous
23:32 < bridge> <teero777> on what maps does `BUG_GRENADE_DOUBLEEXPLOSION` happen? xd
23:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> double explosion bug?
23:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> how would that occur?
23:36 < bridge> <teero777> its an old mapbug
23:37 < bridge> <teero777> dead code xd? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8b5595ea04507a3027e7bbcdf1959f5b402bebbc/src/game/server/entities/projectile.cpp#L183

23:38 < bridge> <teero777> ah btw right it does have a use xd
23:38 < bridge> <teero777> only with tele pistol tho
23:38 < bridge> <robyt3> `Binary` according to `mapbugs.cpp`
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> and dm1?? xd
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> thx
23:39 < bridge> <robyt3> the other file
23:59 < bridge> <totar> the eyes are too far appart
23:59 < bridge> <learath2> I iterated on it a lot if you keep scrolling
23:59 < bridge> <totar> o ok
