00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ux and ui design is hard af
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody ever agrees to something
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> meh, certain resolutions things don't need to touch edge of screen
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> simple menus like esc
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we don't have css so it's too annoying for now

04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> omg
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> SOS i get 1 sec long lag spikes with full connection problems every 2mins~ on ddnet servers :( but only on ddnet servers
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> known issue?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Hm, I also have this problem but only on GER1 I think
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> yea its GER1
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> could you whitelist my vpn so i can test if its my providers connection to ddnet? because others do not seem to have that issue 139.59.215.82
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> @deen @Learath2 @heinrich5991 ^
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> thanks? or is ger1 allowing vps?
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> either way im in!
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> okay using vpn did not fix it
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> or maybe it did. Its way better with vpn the few short lags left are probably something else then
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> isn't that what favorite tab do?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> player list is important imo
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> favorite tab is out of date so easily because when a location becomes popular more servers are run, or switched to a new ip
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup, i often updates it from ddnet tab
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> Has anyone seen a bug where Cur and Prev snapshots have the same m_Tick / are the same? (it results in GameIntraTick() being "inf" and then it goes downhill from there, with the game freezing in one of the places where it loops around floats)

20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's been enough of a time for people to get used to it, should we poll around to see how much interest there is for a replacement for the old stars?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I still do not understand why the snowflakes could be used as freeze time indicator
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Could not
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Finally, yes!
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's what I'll make, big snowflakes imitating old stars and the people that can't adapt at all can use a texture which replaces the snowflake with a star
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Axaris> Hi there, we got stuck like this at race, could that be bug?
