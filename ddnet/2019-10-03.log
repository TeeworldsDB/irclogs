13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> heinrich im sure yo know how to solve this ddnet7 std::shared_ptr. Probably some cmake magic.
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> how i can port my mod of 0.6 to 0.7? there a easy soluction?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which mod?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its likley to be some effort
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @0xc000f if the modification is really feature rich and has a lot of code everywhere in the tw codebase it might be fastest to just port the protocol like ifcity did. If it is a well excluded or small mod it can be copied over to the new codebase. But both ways take time.
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> You can try contacting fanta from if city to maybe provide you a cherry-pick for the protocol or something like that.
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> is a small proyect i have a github if you wanna check
