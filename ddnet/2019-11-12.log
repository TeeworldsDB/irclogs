17:24 <+breton> hi
17:25 <+breton> can i please get my infclass server added to the "DDNet" tab in the client?
17:32 <+breton> ok bugreport then
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im still for a "trusted" servers tab or smth like that
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still for just finishing up work on http masters so we don't need stopgap measures
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> lerath fix ddos plz
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <b3z> Hey peoples. I play on a mac book air 2015 and teeworlds laggs sometimes. But it is not the internet connection it is more like the gpu is too slow...? Any advice?
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> try limiting fps
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> cl_refresh_rate 200; gfx_refresh_rate 200 for example
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <b3z> wow.fixed it thatnks
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <b3z> still happens but less fata
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <b3z> still happens but less fatal
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> try higher or lower fps than 200, also try toggling vsync or opengl if that doesnt work
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yikes air is the worst :/
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> do you guys have any documentation of the source code?
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @xy0 no. ask around if you have questions
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 we calculate it because it's supposed to be stateless until we confirm the client's IP address
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> I just wanted to get into the sourcecode and thought if there's a documentation that would come in handy, but I'll just get into it and come back with questions if they come up at some point, ty
22:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/engine is supposed to be some game-unrelated stuff, like talking to the graphics card, doing the network, etc., src/game is the game part, i.e. the actual gameplay, the menus
22:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> gamecore.cpp tick(bool) is the "gameloop"?
22:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> Tick*
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only see the `CCharacterCore::Tick` function there
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's what happens to a single tee in a tick
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> ah yes I see
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> cserver::run() is the closest thing to a gameloop
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i think
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the outermost "gameloopy" thing in the client is `CGameContext::OnTick()` in `src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp`
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> oh or that
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gamecore is mainly physics
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the server*
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the client doesn't really have a gameloop, it only has a renderloop
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that advances the world accordingly
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can find `CGameClient::OnRender()` in `src/game/client/gameclient.cpp`
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> yeah I see, thx that's really helpful
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> so server always holds the model and sends it to the clients for the view to update in the CGameClient::OnRender() ?
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "model" what do u mean by that
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the server holds the single truth
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the clients only send input
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. left, right, jump, mouse coordinates, fire
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> the server sends back snapshots that tell the client where other entities (tees, lasers etc) are
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the snapshots contain all the information that the client needs to display the current position
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all projectiles, tees, pickups, current health, what @onby said
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> I guess that would be m_Snap?
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <xy0> is it normal that if I import the git repo via the cmake that there're errors in the vs studio syntax highlighting?
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess not
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> screenshot/description?
