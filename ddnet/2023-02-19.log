03:13 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I also don't get this ratio
03:13 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Character's size is 24x24 in a 32x32 subpixel environment
03:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Character's size is 28x28 in a 32x32 subpixel environment
03:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think it's 28, having 2 pixels free space inside a 1 tile hole on both sides
03:25 < bridge> <louis> i think character's size is 29x29
03:26 < bridge> <louis> in regards to gametiles
03:26 < bridge> <louis> in regards to other tees, it's probably different
03:27 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1076691442149380096/image.png
03:27 < bridge> <louis> that's like a drawing of the 60x60 hitbox (a visualization of the wiki explanation)
03:27 < bridge> <louis> that's a drawing of the 60x60 hitbox (a visualization of the wiki explanation)
04:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Is there any confirmation of the tee's size? There was on the wiki I believe
09:48 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> look up my links from github
09:48 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> not 30 but 32 btw
09:49 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 28x28
11:39 < bridge> <Patiga> since a full tile is 32, and a tee is smaller than a tile, it can't really be 32
11:42 < bridge> <Patiga> (without looking at code) iirc within a tile, a tee has 3 positions: left, middle and right. that would suggest 29. however, that would also mean that the distance is 30.5. with your 28, the 30 would sound correct
11:43 < bridge> <Patiga> hm okay too much speculation. left, middle right would actually suggest 30 so nvm :happy:
12:01 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> bruh i have eye cancer it seems
12:01 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 28/2 + 32/2 = 30
12:01 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> that's it
13:21 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> huh, is there any use of mem_has_null
13:21 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> usecase*
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> could yall pls send me some screenshots of how this web page looks for you? https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/

13:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> On my phone it looks good
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> same
13:27 <+ChillerDragon> same?

13:30 < bridge> <justinestrada> https://t.me/isheilabilly  immediately.
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> so it looks good for you? idk who is responsible for that maybe my system font or browser idk
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> whats ur os/browser?
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> Ah nice i think i got the fix ``font-feature-settings:"liga" 0;``
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah I didn‚Äôt realize you were trying to fix the ligatures
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> I wouldn‚Äôt have expected them to exist in a monospace font
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> where are you talking from right now
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> an IRC or matrix bridge?
13:46 <+ChillerDragon> both :D
13:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's used in `io_read_all_str` to ensure that a string does not contain any null bytes except the null termination
13:47 <+ChillerDragon> i quickly switched to matrix to send a screen from ma phone
13:47 <+ChillerDragon> yea im surprised too that they exist there @Ewan it took me quite some time to even realize what kept messing up my indentation/spacing
13:48 <+ChillerDragon> i kept fixing it on my phone which broke it on my desktop xd
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah and why on earth would it happen in the first place if just f and l next to eachother
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe if it was entered as its own character, sure
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> but nothing just automatically ligatures like that
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs why we have kerning
13:49 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like a bug or localization thing
14:38 < bridge> <Patiga> ChillerDragon: your terminal map editor is looking good :p
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> ?xd
14:51 < bridge> <louis> isn't it 4 positions
14:51 < bridge> <louis> 4 position suggests 29
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://github.com/Overv/vramfs
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we need to put ddnet in vram
15:03 < bridge> <Patiga> you are right, there are 4 positions: .44 .47 .50 and .53
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez. does it already support that the GPU loads from disk directly? tho wouldnt really help us, since we have to decode pretty much all files anyway üòÑ
15:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there a player named Asko_YT ?
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i got a spam email lol, i wonder if there is a player with a similar name who was abused for that
19:37 < bridge> <cauldron> Hello friends! It‚Äôs me again‚Ä¶ I have a question. I made a bad implementation of a startup flag for the ddnet client a month ago or so. Now I had the idea to make all kinds of flags like (better to say command line argument) like for joining a specific server, thus joining the server. That could start ddnet kind of ‚Äúheadless‚Äù. Like `./ddnet ‚Äîconnect <server_ip>`. And finally I could achieve my dream of dreams to make a ‚Äúddnet launcher‚Ä
19:37 < bridge> <cauldron> So you could make a really fancy ddnet ui with css and js and after all you would have +1 electron app on your PC üôÇ
19:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> You can already pass any console command on the command line. The client also support URLs (`ddnet ddnet://localhost:8303`), map files and demo files as command line arguments.
19:46 < bridge> <cauldron> This is from last month‚Ä¶ so I once made a ‚Äúapp shortcut‚Äù for a mobile app with a big code base. It used javafx I think for asynchronous stuff and I just could ‚Äúemit‚Äù an event or something like that when my ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù or ‚Äú3d touch‚Äù or whatever was activated. And then there were subscribers. But how is it in C++. Is there a framework for asynchronous programming? And how does the init process and lifecycle of the game work? I mean 
19:48 < bridge> <cauldron> I saw that in the code (that you can pass f1 commands). But I didn‚Äôt think of a f1 command for joining a server. I always try to reinvent the wheel üòÇ
19:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> `ddnet "connect localhost:8303"` also works
19:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> There is no way to get information about events from the running client except the console output
19:50 < bridge> <cauldron> Is there a f1 command to render a demo?
19:53 < bridge> <cauldron> I found `demo_play`
19:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> There are `start_video`/`stop_video` but they don't work on client launch. `play demos/demoname.demo` can be used to play a demo, but there is no command to render a demo from the command line. Not sure what `demo_play` does and why we have `demo_play` and `play`.
19:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> Looking at the code, `demo_play` pauses/unpauses the currently playing demo
19:55 < bridge> <cauldron> What is an event here?
19:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> Whereas `play` starts the demo playback from a file
19:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> Basically whatever console output there is
19:56 < bridge> <Robyt3> For example `chat: *** 'Robyt3' entered and joined the game` when you join a server
19:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's not really designed with general purpose events that could be used to control the client externally
19:57 < bridge> <cauldron> I was once working on a mobile app and you could just emit something. It was a kind of global thing. And there were subscribers for the event you‚Äôd emit. And then they would execute their code. Is there something like this is the ddnet client code?
19:58 < bridge> <cauldron> I was once working on a mobile app and you could just emit something. It was a kind of global thing. And there were subscribers for the event you‚Äôd emit. And then they would execute their code. Is there something like this in the ddnet client code?
19:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> You can send command to the server/client with a FIFO file on unix or a Named Pipe on Windows
19:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> But the only way to get information from the server/client is to parse the console output (or read the memory, which would be very painful)
19:59 < bridge> <cauldron> I mean when I was working with the mobile app you would emit the event inside the code and somewhere else in the code subscribers would trigger.
20:01 < bridge> <Robyt3> You mean entirely inside the ddnet code? That would be a callback.
20:02 < bridge> <cauldron> I mixed it up, it‚Äôs not javafx, thats for UI. I ment RxJava
20:02 < bridge> <cauldron> https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava
20:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> There is no general purpose event system in ddnet where you can send arbitrary event objects to arbitrary subscribers
20:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> There are only various callbacks for specific things
20:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> For example a callback that gets invoked when the config file gets saved
20:05 < bridge> <Robyt3> You can chain callbacks for all config variables, so you can do additional things when a specific variable changes
20:05 < bridge> <cauldron> So starting ddnet with the coonect flag where in the app startup does it gets triggered?
20:05 < bridge> <cauldron> This.
20:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> The command line arguments are parsed by calling `ParseArguments` in the `main` function in `client.cpp`
20:08 < bridge> <cauldron> Right
20:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> But some commands are stored and only executed a bit later when `StoreCommands(false)` is called, because those commands that have `CFGFLAG_STORE` don't work immediately
20:09 < bridge> <cauldron> Ok thank you
20:10 < bridge> <cauldron> I appreciate all the help.
20:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> roby when add RXJava to ddnet?
23:44 < bridge> <cauldron> There is that https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp
