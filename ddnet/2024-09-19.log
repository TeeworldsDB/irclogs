01:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 accounts on my video platform are useless xd you need ssh access to upload files haha
01:16 < bridge> <teero777> gimme ssh access xddd
01:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> Also I need a cpu supercomputer if you have some laying around chiller
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> Would be nice uwu
02:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you often dont need a supercomputer just go afk while it computes
02:04 < bridge> <teero777> Yea I don't have a server lying around for that
02:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then use ur pc
02:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also stop botting -.-
02:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure you are computing some cheats
02:14 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
02:14 < bridge> <teero777> I'm sad I just want a perfect aip gores run
02:14 < bridge> <teero777> Takes 22hrs for me though
02:14 < bridge> <teero777> Am working through that xd
02:15 < bridge> <zhn> specs?
02:16 < bridge> <teero777> Uhm there was a fast fetch screenshot of me here earlier
02:16 < bridge> <teero777> Am on phone
02:18 < bridge> <zhn> looks like my laptop will do the same in 11 hours xd
02:18 < bridge> <teero777> I guess I'll put up my laptop you're right
02:18 < bridge> <teero777> I'll just put it into the freezer and let it cook
02:19 < bridge> <zhn> f3
02:19 < bridge> <zhn> its 3 am oh my god
02:19 < bridge> <teero777> gn :P
02:19 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
02:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes freezer is epic for gaming performance
03:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shit first time i have seen out of order udp
03:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a ddnet server just sent me snap 2/2 first then snap 1/1
03:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 1/2*
03:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah it does so consitently
03:42 < bridge> <totar> it happens on some routes quite often
04:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> china has no chat in 0.7? xd
05:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i connected with chillerbot-zx to a ddnet china server using the 0.7 ip and could not write or read the chat
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does chat work for u in 0.7? @tsfreddie 
05:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet 0.7 or just 0.7
05:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet 0.7
05:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no idea then. i haven't launched ddnet for quite a while
05:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try ddnet client
05:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh you mean 0.7 client on ddnet servers?
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still no chat 
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that worked last time i checked
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``connnect tw-0.7+udp://115.28.130.146:8298``
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg 3 n
05:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``connect tw-0.7+udp://115.28.130.146:8298``
05:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> con&nect goes wild
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let me try ddnet then
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is probably a few years ago
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oof
05:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286163294176022528/image.png?ex=66ece869&is=66eb96e9&hm=fed0568e472e65e469d37ac2bdf5d8e43bf51023182b552a1f08a651ab78a489&
05:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah not all servers are affected
05:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> works fine for me
05:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why don't i have a name tho
05:15 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> lol
05:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why server u on?
05:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i was right next to you
05:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i am
05:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indonesia firewall plus china firewall is perfect match xd

05:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so why don't i have a name
05:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how fakin old is ur client? xd
05:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just opened it on steam
05:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet client
05:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726715916.png
05:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deep packet inspection just filtered this bois skin info xd
05:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
05:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so why don't i have a name
05:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, steam name is just not there
05:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> works on 0.6
05:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see the sv_chat coming in over the network hmm
05:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea idc much about china dont wanna debug that now xd
05:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
05:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
05:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wanna play tetris
05:54 < bridge> <Ewan> the map
05:54 < bridge> <Ewan> amazing map
06:52 < bridge> <beibei1184> no
06:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you know any of the chn mods?
06:53 < bridge> <beibei1184> no
06:53 < bridge> <beibei1184> Can you add me to the group
06:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it might be difficult to setup official servers if none of us know you as you shouldn't access the server after the server is setup so there are trust involved
06:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you have a QQ account?
06:56 < bridge> <beibei1184> I know some good players in China who play well, and I also have an ID: 拉我, I think I am a loyal player of ddnet
06:56 < bridge> <beibei1184> qq: 2013855675
07:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you have ideas how to fix tw issue?
07:51 < bridge> <Ewan> already mastering corporate speak
07:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u will be the most profitable dev
08:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I fixed the problem for ddnet, it's enough for me xd
08:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286207744499646497/image.png?ex=66ed11ce&is=66ebc04e&hm=0aa8fe9b4bff37ec46aa3f176e3585b325c1e48e941daeb7f3503c13a289e5b1&
08:27 < bridge> <beluga_0609> What should I do if the game freezes at a random moment and I have to re-enter the game
08:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would have to debug it
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I can tell you what I've found
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it can be useless xd
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sorry I don’t feel like debugging it
08:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xdddd
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t care about lan discoverability enough
08:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 🥹
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s pretty sad that it broke. And teeworlds used to be a lan thing in German schools!
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can still play on one server
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I just cba there are so many bugs I already want solved and so little motivation to actually do it
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can play on all servers and find one which is not too bad actually. The only affected playerbase is probably that one IT company that hosts multiple lan servers in their internal network for gaming at work. The most common use case is one server I would assume my
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg my phone typoed an entire word at the ended
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you check the gfx wiki? Also what does freeze mean? Does windows say „ddnet.exe is not resonding“? Which client do you use?
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How can you tell if it’s two different servers xd
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> they have different ports
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok xd
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and now for some reason it shows 0.7 connect link for ddnet servers and just ip for 0.7 servers
08:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omagawd xd
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can’t wait to cheat some ranks when your lan server pr is merged and added 10 physics bugs
08:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> watafak, where is `m_Sixup` variable sets to `true`
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> grep
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> does ur lsp not find it
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> swrew
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Language Server
08:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there're these
08:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286217016197517403/image.png?ex=66ed1a71&is=66ebc8f1&hm=f42c65d4f46a6a3248f19ddb80a49492dd410421780c38a2b907d752b72580e8&
08:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It might be not the word true but some method that returns a bool
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yea looks like it's not so simple xd
08:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> OnlySixup
08:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is the one you want
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `Connect` method is not even called :pepeW:
08:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea it’s called when you connect xd
08:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s where m\_Sixup is set
08:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s what you wanted to know
08:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> For url search GotVersion6
08:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `CNetClient::Recv` gets IsSixup true
08:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8716
08:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how -.-
08:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.6 by default unless it’s explicitly 0.7
08:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess you have to set your contact client in 0.7 mode when you send out the GETINFO requests
08:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I assume you already do because it’s needed for the tokens
08:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> sometimes it's false and sometimes true
08:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah wait you have too much sixup. Ehm idk what you changed xd
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe race condition from spamming a get info request to 0.6 and 0.7 servers
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you have two connless clients for that?
08:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but how spamming requests to servers can change `m_Sixup`
09:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk maybe its uninitialized memory if u never set it
09:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> All this fucking time Sixup was passed by reference :pepeW:
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trolol
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ josspit u here?
10:22 < bridge> <avolicious> Anyone managed to build ddnet on Apple M2?
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> there are universal binaries for download on ddnet.org
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> x86 + arm binaries
10:22 < bridge> <avolicious> I'd like to build it on my own 😄
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> well
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah people have built it
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> I don’t imagine there’s a lot to it. you can also look at the CI yaml and see exactly what weird flags the runner is using if any
10:23 < bridge> <avolicious> Thanks for the quick response, I'll check
10:32 < bridge> <avolicious> Tbf, there is nothing too fancy in it
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> I hope u have fun building it
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> curious how long it takes on one of those
10:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Will update you in a sec 😄
10:40 < bridge> <avolicious> I will try on M3 then too
10:40 < bridge> <avolicious> But its quite fast
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> Nice
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> Deen was on an m2 for a bit, so I'd guess it works well
10:54 < bridge> <zhn> imagine hosting 0.7 server on lan to play :justatest:
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo is apple fanboi too axaxax
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet is fully m2 tested since quite some time
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 sos
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato u here?
11:04 < bridge> <learath2> Kinda here, whatup?
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u know fng right?
11:04 < bridge> <learath2> Sure
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you hook a team mates freeze kill into the spikes thats a steal
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am now drafting my database and i need column names for the kills you stole and the ones that were stolen from you
11:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i call them?
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, `kills_stolen_by` and `kills_stolen_from`?
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sooo long
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> Or `kills_stolen` and `kills-stolen` if you hate yourself
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> omit kills, `stolen_from`, `stolen_by`?
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmmm
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you think ``steals``  ``stolen_from`` is also acceptable
11:08 < bridge> <learath2> Sure I guess
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it reads so hard
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but maybe thats my english skill issues
11:09 < bridge> <avolicious> If you hate yourself, you create a new table with from, by & cross-reference this entries to the kills table 😄
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
11:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no way
11:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would like to use the words "self" and "other" but they are not more obvious than "by" and "from"
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Store everything in sixth normal form
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak is dat
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> A table for each column
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boi
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> Thats fast
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> but dont forget to index
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what index is
11:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ppl keep talking about it
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there has to be a good term for that ffs
11:13 < bridge> <avolicious> for what?
11:13 < bridge> <avolicious> indexing?
11:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for steals
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Indexes are like table of content for books. They give a way to quickly get to rows of interest by column values of interest
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> OKG
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oabdioawd
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did wrong repo
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhadjioajopd
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> AGAIN
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im too tried
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> Chiller do u know about like journaling filesystem
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> similar idea
11:15 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. when you have a hash index on column name, the db generates a hashtable that contains every name to row_id mapping. Now you can get to the row for a name without scan searching the entire db
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have 0 users do i need indexing?
11:16 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whats this supposed to be
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat
11:16 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Sql fng
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> All your queries are constant time. Impressive
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberfrighter its me being tired
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> next gen db
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> You can implement the db in 5 lines of C
11:16 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ok
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he meant to do it on his own repo
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you can make pull requests across branches of 1 repo
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s how releases are done a lot of the time
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gh really wants you to pr everything to the root repo
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh
11:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think i see
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> u just develop shit on ur own repo and then pr to the main thing when its done
11:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> right?
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea
11:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> cool
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i wanted to pr to my thing because i rq now
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> chiller will u use something db agnostic or not
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but gh's default sends it to the uppest stream it can find
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats db agnostic
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> any db
11:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whats a stream
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> or no db
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> xd

11:21 < bridge> <teero777> idk define CONF_PLATFORM_MACOS manually ig?
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
11:21 < bridge> <zhn> are you sure its defined?
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that should be defined by cmake
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i think ddnet cmake is really cursed
11:21 < bridge> <zhn> btw bam script was 100x simpler xd
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn idk wat u talking about xd
11:22 < bridge> <zhn> will u use something that would allow u to switch between sqlite mysql postgre or not
11:22 < bridge> <zhn> dbms agnostic code
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use ddnet @zhn so mysql and sqlite
11:22 < bridge> <zhn> ah
11:23 < bridge> <zhn> i thought ur about to reimplement this part xd
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no im as close to ddnet as possible
11:23 < bridge> <zhn> 07 pr was ddnetest pr possible :troll:
11:25 < bridge> <avolicious> But where is is set in CMakeLists?
11:25 < bridge> <Ewan> not sure. I’d search
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> may not be in cmake though, you can implement such logic just thru existing definitions & that would be a reasonable explanation for it failing here
11:26 < bridge> <teero777> its literally not in the cmakelists lol
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> whoops
11:26 < bridge> <teero777> they should be defined automatically afaik
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> is it there? I’m on phone
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> CONF_FAMILY stuff is in detects.h
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/66e8d1f726fbeb788c249fdc43320063ce740827/src/base/detect.h
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> determined at compile time
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
11:29 < bridge> <teero777> y
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> though really
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it *should* be in the cmake
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this file outdates cmake by decades xd
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this file was basically copied from the bam source code into the teeworlds source code xd
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> u may have missed my italics there
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i saw bold
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
11:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> U issue :xd:
12:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how can ci workflow build fail while it compiles for me locally -.-
12:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286277947447050305/image.png?ex=66ed5330&is=66ec01b0&hm=7ea6c4813e1fc27033a0124c2c7cb65b0909f3e49d59a6dfad76d881e773fbc0&
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> str format stuff is weitd
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> str format stuff is weird
12:55 < bridge> <teero777> Some of them are locked behind macro ifs afaik
12:57 < bridge> <robyt3> `str_format_int` is only for internal use. Use `str_format` with `"%d"` which will automatically use `str_format_int` in release build
12:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's what i did xd
12:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks
12:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to make compiler show error when I try to compile this locally?
13:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Build in debug and release mode
13:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah catto pr

16:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> 3g
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> `mount -o ro -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdxy /mnt/wherever`
