00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> someone sent me a demo that i couldnt open until i went and downloaded newest ddnet
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why is this
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bug in demo handling
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is it fixable or are new demos and old demos no longer compatible
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991 also the new ddnet demo controls are laggy (scroll to a new spot in the demo and it freezes for a second)
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ping @Learath2, I think he knows
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Learath2
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Hi there
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> not sure if this is the right section to ask about this, but
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I'd like to help out paying for Brazil's server hosting
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Are there any specific requirements that the hosting company must provide? How about hardware? Bandwidth? EtcÃ©tera
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Danke schÃ¶n
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> @deen ^
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> ðŸ¤”
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Ohhh that would be very cool
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby demos are not forwards compatible, only backwards compatible
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Learath2 someone sent me a demo made with new ddnet and i tried to open it in old ddnet and it didnt work
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, it's normal
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Old demos work fine on new ddnet, thats backwards compatibility
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ohh
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rip
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you absolutely need to patch an old client, you can skip a couple bytes after reading the header
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> thnx ill look into it
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i just prefer ddnet 10 it is always less laggy :x
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you ever do any profiling?
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i cant get callgrind etc to compile on mac and i tried a different tool but didnt get very far
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt callgrind in brew?
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet12 does get worse fps,, but that's hardly unexpected. Any new feature has overhead, especially when we have everything in the same loop
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon gnu tools dont really work well on macOS
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what new features cause overhead
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes but they dont work well
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm yea
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> program wont open
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even this llvbd what ever works better than gdb
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> valgrind in general has problems on mac
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby well, idk specifically but everything has some cost
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is there any chance that ddnet client could have an option to turn off some of these added features especially for non ddr players
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also xcode is supposed to have a decent profiler
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it was called Instruments, I used it on ios
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i tried but the app store thingy is fked up and doesnt let me download anthing
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fucking appstore is just the stupidest idea ever
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They really should have made a package manager
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> #ignored
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> #u
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I'm going to go cry in a corner
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> and cut
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt it deens decision
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @ ur question
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you need to wait for deen for yours
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> i guess so onby
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @MooYooThings I think irrespective of money it's not worth it since there are so few players in Brazil
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> oh deen
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> hi!
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Um, but players in Argentina get to join the server as well
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> thing is, for some very mysterious reason
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but average number of players was very low
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> a lot of internet traffic that is meant to go across Latin American countries passes through Florida, USA
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> it's insane
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I think it has to do with the United States trying to keep tabs on us (I'm in the US but I'm originally from Venezuela)
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> ah okay
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> well, I have already spoken with some Brazilian players and friends of mine
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not so mysterious, the internet connections between south american countries are known to be horrible
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but they all have a good connection to the US, so it's easier to go through the US
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> so that they can help me investigate cheaper and reliable options that we could look at
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> damn, but still
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> isn't it better latency wise to just route packets between each other?
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> sorry, I'm not a developer, nor programmer, nor engineer
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but for websites it doesn't matter much
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> but I have a small grasp on what we're talking about, I think
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for fast-paced online games like DDNet it matters a lot
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> you can always feel free to correct me
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> right, deen
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> exactly
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> that's why I'd like to help them out
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Brazil is huge
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> there are a lot of potential players there
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> then there's Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Bolivia (although they might get better ping over in Chile)
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> it's a sizeable population
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> basically what we need is a virtual server with 1 CPU core, 1 GB RAM, 20 GB disk space, 200 GB bandwidth
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Argentina is the 2nd most populous Spanish speaking country in the world if I'm not mistaken
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> okay deen, thanks!
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> that will be really helpful in finding something
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> population size doesn't really help since DDNet players are not distributed uniformly around the world ðŸ˜„
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> do you care wether it's KVM or OpenVZ virtualization?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> whether*
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> right, deen
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I prefer KVM
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> that makes sense
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> okay
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> so, either KVM or bare metal, correct?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bare metal is way too expensive, don't get that
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> correct
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> it usually is way too expensive
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also make sure the server is actually hosted in Brazil, many Brazilian hosters still host in the US
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> alrighty!
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> will DEFINITELY make sure of that as well
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I'm sure you are still considering it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> won't pressure you at all into accepting maintaining yet another server
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you really want it, we can give it another try
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> that's yet more work to do
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> sure thing!
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> should we do our own testing first?
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> to make sure that we've picked a good host?
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> as in, my friends and I
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> in Brazil? and elsewhere around it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nah, I don't think that's necessary. Just tell me the hoster when you have it and I'd buy it
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> basically, are there any other requirements and evidences we should provide so we can get it green-lighted by you?
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> okay deen
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> also
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I was thinking
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, good luck with the search
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> sorry, lost my train of thought
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> thanks!
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> ah yes!
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I'm thinking of helping out monetarily
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> is there a minimum amount of time that you'd require me to keep paying for?
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> might have worded that wrongly but I hope I got my point across
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> and who/how should I send the money? would you need me to transfer the total amount of money that you'd need me to pay for hosting for a minimum set amount of time?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can just donate later, as you wish
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> oh, I see, deen
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> I'll be keeping that in mind as well. Thanks for providing all this info and for answering my questions
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> Guten Tag
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MooYooThings> xD
