12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justapentest:
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> merged and released in new version :heartw:
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it could maybe get a https://docs.rs/fixed/latest/fixed/traits/trait.ToFixed.html, but that would be yet another fallible conversion. It definitely would make it easier to use, but would hide the inner workings more, I'd be fine with it :)
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh nice
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> @heinrich5991 how do the tw dissector detects if the package is from a teeworlds/ddnet server?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> @heinrich5991 how do the tw dissector detects if the package is from a teeworlds/ddnet server or just a random udp packet?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> @heinrich5991 how do the tw dissector detects if the packet is from a teeworlds/ddnet server or just a random udp packet?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> cmake x)
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> there are makefile and dockerfile too
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i had this 4 years ago ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> It does a prefilter based on port i think @Miguilim
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> script kiddies starter pack

16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you once asked me for this pic without ddnet and gores players
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here it is
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm i may have an error
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is this counting fng2 and fng2+ together?
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> testddnet is not ddnet axaxax
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats the error
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If i remove png another mod goes to 60
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So idk i have to investigate xd
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fng*
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ¤”
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> can someone changed the README.md in github 
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> from:
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> -DMYSQL=[ON|OFF]
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> Whether to enable MySQL/MariaDB support for server. Requires at least MySQL 8.0 or MariaDB 10.2. Setting to ON requires the libmariadbclient-dev library installed, which are also provided as bundled libraries for the common platforms. Default value is OFF.
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> 
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> to: 
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> -DMYSQL=[ON|OFF]
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> Whether to enable MySQL/MariaDB support for server. Requires at least MySQL 8.0 or MariaDB 10.2. Setting to ON requires the libmariadb-dev library installed, which are also provided as bundled libraries for the common platforms. Default value is OFF.
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> the difference is libmariadbclient-dev replaced with libmariadb-dev
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> because libmariadbclient-dev  is not in the repo after debian8 
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> if you using debian > 9 u need to install libmariadb-dev
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> but i think you already knew and i forgot something
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Uh libmariadbclient-dev is still available?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> uh
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1039205033956347954/image.png
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah nvm looks like it was in oldstable on debian 10
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but got removed on 11
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah nvm
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> libmariadb-dev is also available at deb 9, even in 8
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libmariadb-dev
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes ik, I mean @KDaniel u could pull request
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> `libmariadbclient-dev` just has been removed completely as it become obsolete by libmariadb
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> yea like i said above 9 its not available anymore and this is why i think it could be updated in the README.md
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> because libmariadbclient-dev  is not in the repo after debian9
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> if you using debian > 9 u need to install libmariadb-dev
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Correct, but in this case, the apt pm is smart enough to tell you the correct packages ðŸ˜„
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: check out my protocol description json: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/5f07c47f71acb943aaa8aa4a6d693980db6a15d9/gamenet/generate/spec/ddnet-16.2.json#L1200-L1209

17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok idk probs not bugged
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice ruby client ðŸ˜®
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing is if a server has lot of players in 1 minute only it can make the upper bound of the whole graph sucky
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if a group of servers*
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sampling every 10 mins
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1039214366018519122/unknown.png
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently somewhere are is a max 55 players
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i cant see it
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid bugs
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently somewhere there is a max 55 players
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it tries to decode it as a TW packet and if it doesn't have any weirdness, it just decides that it's TW
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/5f07c47f71acb943aaa8aa4a6d693980db6a15d9/wireshark-dissector/src/tw.rs#L75-L104
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you find a problem with that heuristic? what are you doing with the dissector? ðŸ™‚
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> O.o
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> I'm actually trying to use it with a custom server but its identifying just as default udp
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> the client is the default ddnet client, but the sending packets is also "udp"
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> if I try to use it on a default server, it runs well
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can force it with "decode conversation as..." â†’ TW
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it has some problems identifying ddnet correctly ^^
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could give me the pcap if you want
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or report a bug with it
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that I remember to fix it
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> ohhh didn't know about that, I will try. Thanks :432271829231730689:
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> ok, I'll open a issue in the repo
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> "often used to share hacking tips"
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thats called #developer
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> not even #developer
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> btw their email is misspelled
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> created the issue
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks! I already got an email
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's detailed, thank you for that
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also from the email I got that you're srdante?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> yes, my github nick
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> <a:lab_nuncaNemVi:518148873492103168>
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your TW nick?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> Miguilim
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cause I didn't recognize Miguilim but did recognize srdante ^^
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're building a custom server in python?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> noooo, its top secret ðŸ¤« (for now)
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Miguilim> I created this script to reproduce the problem
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see ðŸ™‚
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool that you're building something
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm interested in case you ever want to talk about it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Running a server on Debian, freshly downloaded DDNet version for Linux 64 bit. Having random crashes with nothing fishy in the server log even with trace on. Funniest behavior is that there is a particular map that instantly crashes the server when it loads. Server log doesn't say anything weird when the map loads except Segmentation Fault. Any ideas?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> If you can, compile with AddressSanitizer. Also share the map.
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Aight I will try compiling it myself. Is there a known issue with addresses on the compiled download?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1039260639400575076/Skill_Issue.map
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> None that I'm aware of. Maybe it's somehow specific to Debian.
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Compiling with AddressSanitizer should give more useful error messages beyond "Segmentation Fault"
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Ok, thanks!
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could an admin please update the twmap-tools binaries for the ddnet discordbot?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I need a document for how to do that, I keep forgetting on each update ðŸ˜„
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks!
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I released a new version of twmap, twmap-tools, twmap-py and twmap-blender ( @Ryozuki, @gerdoe, @k2d222, ChillerDragon )
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `twmap`: 0.9.0 contained a rather big bug where the `Layer::shape` function had x and y mixed up. that is fixed, alongside its uses (somehow I managed to use it the correct wrong way multiple times).
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> apart from the fixes there should not be any breaking changes with 0.9.1, but some nice additions from @Ryozuki
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `twmap-tools`: `twmap-edit` wasn't working properly because of the mentioned bug, everything should work again
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `twmap-py`: the `to_mesh` method on tiles layers now works again, it was broken for a while (also the release was necessary to fix the mentioned bug)
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `twmap-blender`: the add-on now automatically downloads the twmap python module with pip, if it isn't installed (release: https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-blender/-/releases/v0.3.0)
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:taigaclap:621889454944157716>
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cd ~/twmap/twmap-tools && git pull && cargo install --path=. twmap-tools && ls -lha ~/.cargo/bin/twmap*`
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, now i gotta try to build ddnet with the rust thing on my outdated windows ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tell me if you encounter problems
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, im gonna sleep right now, so probably this weekend
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Not outdated. Dead
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what windows are we talking about?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 7
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should work
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust only dropped support for xp
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> @deen 
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> ddnet can support dns srv records ?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet has nothing to do with how u configure ur dns records
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet usually doesn't connect via DNS, so it's unliekly that you need SRV records for ddnet
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your use case of SRV records for ddnet?
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> i want to convert ports to subdomain
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> 
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> like that 
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> 
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> 8305.teecorp.ir
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think ddnet will get support for that if you don't implement that yourself
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à§³ iDiN Ï„> Im not that type of guy :D
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it probably won't get implemented
