08:55 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> has anybody made web version of demo viewer?
11:42 <+bridge> <Сeeper> can you advise me a card for a laser, which is single
11:43 <+bridge> <Сeeper> can you advise me a card for a laser, which is single or dummy
12:23 <+bridge> <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks FPS on M1 Max is about the same as on M1 Pro, I guess we are not GPU-bound
12:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah I think so. But sadly molten VK is buggy or bad. And the opengl wrapper is also not very fast.
12:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Guess I'll have to wait until the Linux port gets around 80% perf of what's possible. If they even reach that point
12:57 <+bridge> <Freezy> heyo guys, what's up? :D
12:57 <+bridge> <Freezy> I've been playing on an older client version for long now and I kind of don't want to update it rn because of the freeze bar and spec animation.
12:57 <+bridge> <Freezy> I was wondering if that can't simply be made an optional setting since it probably doesn't match all of the player's vibe and style.
12:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have u at least tried it for 2 weeks
13:02 <+bridge> <Freezy> no, why would I if everything is fine for me with an older client
13:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say, so your brain gets used to it and we don't have extra work because of a single unhappy person
13:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wont be added 99%
13:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so u gotta adapt
13:10 <+bridge> <Freezy> why would I go through that process in the first place if everything is fine in an older client verion..? xD
13:10 <+bridge> <Freezy> Idk if you just make this up but I've heard plenty of negative opionions on this, so I kind of don't know what to say to this.
13:10 <+bridge> <Freezy> Anyway, this was just a suggestion since I'm good on my current client, just for you to take note and perhaps even consider adding it
13:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then use old client
13:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if you ask my opinion, u can stay on ur older client, we take no responsability on bugs, security issues, or the game not being compatible in the future
13:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats my take xd
13:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> time to find RCEs kek
13:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe in future we have a new client, that fixes this issue in a different way, we will see
13:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But rn just use old client if it's so horrible
13:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i was also against it, but after playing a bit u get used
13:13 <+bridge> <Freezy> I just don't understand why you'd force this kind of animation setting after tw has existed with these settings for ~15 years
13:14 <+bridge> <Freezy> if it could just be optional
13:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How is it forced? Old clients are still useable
13:14 <+bridge> <Cipy29> It is optional, game is open source
13:15 <+bridge> <Freezy> yeah, I lack the programming knowledge to do so, that's why I'm suggesting it here
13:15 <+bridge> <Freezy> obviously it's forced in the newer client versions
13:18 <+bridge> <Patiga> Because we are open to change. If we see a way to improve the game, then we evaluate if it is worth to add an option.
13:18 <+bridge> <Patiga> However it is really frustrating to accommodate users who are not even willing to try it out.
13:18 <+bridge> <Patiga> I think the quote "Not every change is an improvement but every improvement is a change" is really fitting. If you are not open to try change out, you are also dismissing improvement, which is not a healthy mindset for developing a game.
13:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm the only dev that is remotely interested in adding this option and maintaining it and I'm way too busy to work on that. So unless you convince another dev, it's unlikely this will be added
13:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can convince me that the sitting animation looks too bad if that makes u happy xd
13:22 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> tbh I use ghost skin so I don't see the animations 😉
13:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Tho it is quite funny that some people just refuse to even give it a try. This would be an interesting psych study
13:26 <+bridge> <Freezy> I can understand your point for sure. It's definitely nice to see you guys making changes and trying to improve the game!
13:26 <+bridge> <Freezy> Anyway, I'm not so sure if it's the right way you're taking for tw since it's a rather traditional game for most of the players and is based on its old player base.
13:26 <+bridge> <Freezy> Hence, forcing such graphics settings just mustn't be, well at least in my opinion
13:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw we have almost equal amounts of old and new players nowadays since the release in china
13:26 <+bridge> <Freezy> there you got a start @Learath2 :D
13:27 <+bridge> <Freezy> yeah, I took that into account but at least for the other 50 % it's that type of game
13:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> He is not convinced enough to actually code it for you. Convince more
13:28 <+bridge> <gotroyb> For the record, I've used the new freeze bars for a long time and I still think that the stars could be validly more prefereable than the freeze bar: freeze bars only give percentage, whereas stars give exactly seconds. As far as maintanability is concered, I'd say that the old star-way is automatically enabled on fng servers? This makes it even weirder why there is no manual setting for it. (it makes sense also on dfng for example)
13:29 <+bridge> <Learath2> And of that 50% there just isn't a significant amount of players complaining. If there were we'd also be questioning the decision ourselves
13:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> The stars are server sided. So fng just sends them, we don't do anything special
13:31 <+bridge> <gotroyb> Well, ok this makes sense now, thanks.
13:31 <+bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, one day I'll give y'all stars back. Just need to finish uni first
13:33 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mentioned this earlier but I myself heard much of complains about those things.
13:33 <+bridge> <Freezy> Anyway, as Patiga said earlier:
13:33 <+bridge> <Freezy> ```Because we are open to change. If we see a way to improve the game, then we evaluate if it is worth to add an option.```
13:33 <+bridge> <Freezy> So if that is the case, maybe a poll on that topic could be justified?
13:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's very hard to poll these things. A poll on discord would exclude the entirety of the chinese community and the people who play the game but aren't in the discord. Not only that people who aren't happy with the status quo are more likely to turn out to vote in the first place
13:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> We can do a poll if you want but it'd be more to gauge about how many people are unhappy with it, rather than to make a decision
13:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's hard to even find a good poll question without being leading. Polls are just hard to conduct in a proper manner
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mean you just said that the issue was that there wasn't a significant amount of people unhappy with the change.
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> You'd figure that out by making a poll. People who like the bars and spec animation won't be affected since it'd just be an option added.
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> However, you'd still find out how many people are unhappy.
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> ```And of that 50% there just isn't a significant amount of players complaining. If there were we'd also be questioning the decision ourselves```
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> Obviously I understand that you guys are not getting paid and do it because of fun. But I still think a poll would do its job.
13:44 <+bridge> <Freezy> But as I said already, I'm just making suggestions since I'm perfectly fine on an older client version... :D
13:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> The only problem with a poll is how it'll be perceived. I'd treat it as a headcount of people who don't like it. The people who voted however will say "f3 > f4, remov freezbar"
13:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> If we do make one, we should make it very clear we are just looking to see how many people have issues with it
13:53 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mean obviously those are the only votes that are interesting since it's only the option to add both which is in question.
13:53 <+bridge> <Freezy> The current animations stay either way, so there is not really something to lose for the players who like it this way or is there?
13:57 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> afaik this is the main reason "maintainability"
13:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yep
13:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> every option added increses complexity, before u had 1 path, now 2, and if they mix together, its exponential
13:59 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think the main issue is still that there is no developer here that wants to work on it, whether there is a poll or not. The only point of a poll would be to motivate some developer to work on this and keep maintaining it
14:00 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mean it's worth a try
14:00 <+bridge> <Freezy> why not
14:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> Just 10 boolean options would be 1024 different combinations of options to test. Obviously some are obviously unrelated, but still goes to illustrate the issue
14:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this may sound absurd but, on a open source game, if you want a change more often than not you gotta lead it, become a dev, be the change
14:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or quit like lynn kek
14:02 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mean if that's literally the ideology you're standing up for then you'll probably lead ddnet into its dead
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its the ideology of open source
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no devs? dead game indeed
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> you are the entitled one here
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> asking for work for freew
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if nobody wants to do it, they not at fault
14:03 <+bridge> <Freezy> it's the same if there'd be no players
14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont see the relation here
14:03 <+bridge> <Freezy> u told me to quit if I don't learn to code
14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well money also can get you many things
14:03 <+bridge> <Learath2> But one is scarce the other isn't. There is like 1 active dev per 400 players 😛
14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my price in this case would be 500€ i wouldnt bother for less
14:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
14:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> But it is sadly the truth indeed. You need to motivate people to make changes for you somehow
14:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> It could be a shared goal, it could be money, it could be positive reception by a large number of users
14:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i told u it wont be done 99% unless u do it urself
14:04 <+bridge> <Freezy> I mean if that's literally the ideology you're standing up for then you'll probably lead ddnet into its death
14:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whether u decide to quit its ur decision
14:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm actually already motivated to do it, so that hurdle is cleared technically. You just need to wait until I have the time for it
14:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there u have
14:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just wait 1 year
14:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth xd
14:07 <+bridge> <Freezy> I'm sorry to say that but I really don't see a point in having a whole discussion with you now since I think your argumentation is odd and I've already discussed it with Learath. @Ryozuki
14:07 <+bridge> <Devinci> can someone explain this to me? (I don't care about the change or not, just don't understand this).
14:07 <+bridge> <Devinci> Isn't it just a simple if-else statement? Use old animation or new? (a bit more complex but you got my point)
14:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
14:07 <+bridge> <Freezy> I think a poll would make a fair amount of sense based on the earlier discussion
14:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> Until june or so I have a metric ton of studying. After that I'll have a much lighter load till september, I guess I could sneak it in there
14:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well this is a public chat so ill keep talking
14:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the mute option is there
14:08 <+bridge> <Freezy> I don't stop u from talking ofc
14:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just want to point out that u are dismissing a valid and realistic argument, and calling it odd
14:09 <+bridge> <Freezy> But please note that all I made were suggestions and that I already said that I lack the programming knowledge to do so. I don't want to repeat myself too often actually
14:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> The problem is the testing, these old options that aren't default and aren't used by many go neglected and over time that if statement ends up in another. Then another, then it gets split in two. Someone makes a logic error while negating some branch and you end up with very annoying bugs in deeply nested code
14:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity
14:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> check this
14:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the theory
14:11 <+bridge> <Devinci> Oh yeah okay, so the real issue here is the testing part /getting sure there are no conflicts. not really the programming one, right?
14:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> In this specific case I'm okay with adding some complexity to make people happy as I have an idea that will be relatively low maintainance
14:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> testing and making sure nothing breaks is programming
14:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, it's an ongoing maintainance issue, not a we cant program this its too hard issue
14:12 <+bridge> <Devinci> okay yeah thanks ^^
14:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> most of the burden in dev is maintenance
14:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> best code is no code
14:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Jeff Atwood: “the best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options.”
14:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
14:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Robert Galanakis: “The fastest code is the code which does not run. The code easiest to maintain is the code that was never written.”
14:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> #mood #lifestyle
14:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
14:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> Honestly, yes. A set of well polished core features is much bettet than dozens of features with untested interactions. I honestly believe this level of customization should be left to forks
14:14 <+bridge> <Devinci> delete ddnet code :greenthing:
14:15 <+bridge> <cauldron> @deen is there public read access to the database?
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> "an advisor's most important job is to guide you on what you should not do or attempt."
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> you can download a daily dump
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.org/stats/
14:16 <+bridge> <cauldron> Yes I know
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> go here and scroll to bottom
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but there is no public
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> exposing the database server means exposing it to ddos
14:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so its a nono
14:16 <+bridge> <cauldron> I shouldn‘t bother, I‘m just curious
14:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there could be a api, which would also be exposed to ddos, and thus needs to be ratelimited, which can be circunvented by a botnet, which means more ddos
14:17 <+bridge> <cauldron> Ok, I understand tjats the reason
14:18 <+bridge> <cauldron> Couldn‘t harmful people just get the db ip in the code? Or by tracking the network traffic? Or isnt the ip enough to ddos?
14:19 <+bridge> <cauldron> Anyway, thanks.
14:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the ip isnt on the code
14:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its obtained from config files
14:22 <+bridge> <Patiga> -> and those config files are only on the game servers, which the clients have no access to
14:22 <+bridge> <cauldron> So there is some kind of gatewayserver? (Sry i have no clue)
14:24 <+bridge> <cauldron> I mean couldnt you put on wireshark and see where the client sends data?
14:25 <+bridge> <Patiga> you connect to the game servers, which are rented by ddnet all around the world
14:25 <+bridge> <Patiga> your client can't access the server more than just 'let me play the game in the server'
14:25 <+bridge> <Patiga> those are the only server that your client knows
14:25 <+bridge> <Patiga> your client has no idea what those servers are doing in the background, you can't spy on someones network traffic by knowing their ip
14:25 <+bridge> <Patiga> the ddnet server do have the config files with the ip of the database servers
14:26 <+bridge> <cauldron> Anyway… I am just curious, it‘s not needed, nor I demand it.
14:26 <+bridge> <Patiga> your client never directly interacts with the database servers
14:27 <+bridge> <Patiga> 👍 you don't have to excuse yourself for being curious :)
14:27 <+bridge> <cauldron> Aha okay. I didn‘t know the server does everything. I thought meybe the client sends directly data somewhere. Thanks 🙂
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think an api with a ratelimit would be cute. We could also service the api from a mirror of the db server just in case
14:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i could make that
14:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with rust
14:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tell me some functionality u may want
14:31 <+bridge> <Learath2> Never a bad time to use rust 😛
14:31 <+bridge> <cauldron> I am asking it, because I am still thinking about starting a project for a (native) mobile ddnet rank app. But it‘s just a thought, and from experience I am not really productive, so I only would ask for sonething like an api as soon as I had a nice app, that works well wirh the database dump.
14:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it just happens that im making some apis for other stuff so i have it fresh in mind
14:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> one of my side projects: (ffxiv related) https://market.xivhub.org/
14:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> made with rust, psql, svelte
14:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk how it looks on mobile tho
14:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fck mobile
14:33 <+bridge> <cauldron> Ok haha
14:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what do u need from the api?
14:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a replica?
14:37 <+bridge> <cauldron> If you mean me, I‘d just need the stats like on the rank page, and url of map images
14:47 <+bridge> <cauldron> Ryozuki are you doing web development too? I think I saw the unique clan page as a project on github or your site or somewehere.
14:48 <+bridge> <cauldron> Ryozuki are you doing web development too? I think I saw the unique clan page as a project on github or your site or somewhere.
14:57 < bridge_> <cauldron> Anyway, I‘m just doing this mobile app as a side project to get into mobile dev. It‘s not that I want to have it used by the community, but since there is the data and user base, I think it‘s a great opportunity for a mobile app, that people might actually use.

16:25 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> golang is a joke
16:30 < bridge_> <deen> I respect the go people for experimenting with going into extremes, like plan9's everything-is-a-file
16:43 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> i used to be kinda a go fan until i met rust
16:43 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> rust fills my needs way better
16:43 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> and golang hides complexity in the name of simplicity, which then comes for ur ass with bugs
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What does it hide exactly? I never really used it
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But it uses GC doesn't it ? Xd
16:44 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> ye gc
16:44 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> sec
16:45 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride
16:45 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks read
16:47 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> `filepath.Ext(".foo")` returns .foo
16:47 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> so a file .foo has a extension of .foo
16:47 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> which is wrong xd
16:47 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> lots of things
16:48 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> its not a well thought lang
16:48 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> in the name of simplicity
16:48 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> `Path::new(".foo").extension())`
16:48 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> returns None
16:48 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> in rust
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
17:18 < bridge_> <Patiga> just remembered this message. this is not an error in twmap if that is what you mean. if you want I can write you a python script that finds those maps ^^
17:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes it's no error. No need anymore I already told that guy in pm to write a python script thanks ^^
17:20 < bridge_> <Patiga> 👍
18:40 < bridge_> <Learath2> I hate that one guy in the comments. I don't know him at all but just that one comment tells me that I could never get along with him ever.

20:20 < bridge_> <Faulty> @Robyt3 @Learath2 Could you please take a look at the PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6292 when you have a time, I did it on your recommendation and I need at least a little feedback, is that how you imagined it?
20:25 < bridge_> <Robyt3> I'd prefer https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6293. We have to do some benchmarks of `std::bitset` with our use case to be sure.
20:27 < bridge_> <Faulty> Ah, yes, wronk link
20:27 < bridge_> <Faulty> @Robyt3 @Learath2 Could you please take a look at the PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6293 when you have a time, I did it on your recommendation and I need at least a little feedback, is that how you imagined it?
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what do we want to benchmark
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> std::bitset is static sized isnt it
20:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> I think I like 6293 too, the only thing I'm thinking about is whether to make it a wrapper rather than a typedef and move it into base. Something like `base/tl/bitmask.h` where we can add convenience masks and stuff like `static constexpr all/none;` + a `typedef bitmask<MAX_CLIENTS> CClientMask;` but in principle I think 6293 is mergeable
20:34 < bridge_> <Learath2> I guess we just want to make sure there isn't a marked regression
20:35 < bridge_> <Learath2> `Mask & (1<<5)` becoming O(CLIENT_MAX) would not be funny at all 😄
20:45 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> did u know std::bitset::to_ullong can throw
20:45 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> i think that slows it
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> isnt it optimized for 2^x
20:46 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> > You cannot just bitshift because std::bitset::to_ullong throws when any higher-order bits are nonzero)
20:49 < bridge_> <Matodor> client dont resend GameMsgClientShowDistance when resolution changed
20:53 < bridge_> <Robyt3> I did some benchmarks where every second bit gets set and then the number of bits is counted. bitset seems to be faster than int64_t for 64 bits. For 128 bits, using int16_t is the fastest. https://quick-bench.com/q/M1r5uzGV16B--Gh_J-qtBASTT84, https://quick-bench.com/q/H-oMtGrvbPDob7TU8A1nVwBKvVU
21:09 < bridge_> <Learath2> The second one is quite interesting
21:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i find it more interesting that bitset is so highly optimized for 64bit
21:16 < bridge_> <Chairn> -fno-exceptions 🙂
21:23 < bridge_> <Learath2> fwiw technically `std::bitset::count` exists, that should be even faster
21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> btw gcc wins with 128 gibts

21:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> equal
21:26 < bridge_> <Learath2> @Jupeyy_Keks can you try the count member function? that should lead to a `POPCNT`
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067179907987296316/image.png
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ups used Os
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but probs doesnt matter anyway xD
21:32 < bridge_> <Learath2> Did it emit a POPCNT?
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have no idea bra
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lets view asm
21:32 < bridge_> <Learath2> The assembly tab is right there 😛
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```asm
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 0.45%  callq  404560 <__popcountdi2@plt>
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>        mov    0x8(%rsp),%rdi
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>        movslq %eax,%rbx
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 0.10%  callq  404560 <__popcountdi2@plt>
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>        cltq
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
21:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> How on earth did that end up indirect?
21:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> Even with Os that makes no sense?
21:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> Oh maybe it's a wrapper that directs to popcnt if it is available
21:34 < bridge_> <Chairn> @Danielkempf
21:34 < bridge_> <Chairn> ah nice discord, replacing missed @ with random people
21:34 < bridge_> <Chairn> any idea who danielkempf is?
21:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tater
21:34 < bridge_> <Chairn> @Tater you here?
21:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it also did it with ofast
21:35 < bridge_> <Tater> uh oh what did I do
21:35 < bridge_> <Chairn> i believe you wanna keep your branch?
21:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but no idea what 
21:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> `
21:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>     benchmark::DoNotOptimize(a.count());` is @Learath2 if that changes smth xd
21:35 < bridge_> <Tater> wdym?
21:35 < bridge_> <Chairn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6298>
21:36 < bridge_> <Chairn> <https://github.com/danielkempf/TaterClient-ddnet/tree/betterIndikator4Fail>
21:36 < bridge_> <Chairn> @ danielkempf
21:36 < bridge_> <Tater> idk surely you don't want to merge my branch into main ddnet that sounds like a bad idea
21:37 < bridge_> <Robyt3> I think the `benchmark::DoNotOptimize` makes it so the given argument is not optimized away when it's not used otherwise. I think it should work like you have it
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so we switch to bitset bcs its not only the better solution, but also faster
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> epic dev moment
21:37 < bridge_> <Tater> I stopped playing ddnet for now so kdaniel is maintaining my client idk what the PR is for
21:38 < bridge_> <Chairn> yes, that's why i suggested to reset the branch state to master+a single commit
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lol its not u?
21:38 < bridge_> <Tater> no
21:38 < bridge_> <Chairn> if you want to keep the branch,  just checkout to it, create new branch, and then reset original branch
21:38 < bridge_> <Tater> I'm not the one who made the pr
21:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do u have his discord?
21:39 < bridge_> <Tater> @KDaniel
21:40 < bridge_> <KDaniel> yea
21:40 < bridge_> <KDaniel> can we not just delete the pr
21:40 < bridge_> <Chairn> no, github forbids that
21:40 < bridge_> <KDaniel> damn
21:41 < bridge_> <KDaniel> like a quick missclick and such a problem :d
21:41 < bridge_> <Chairn> you wanna keep the branch?
21:41 < bridge_> <Chairn> then https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1067181575147626546
21:41 < bridge_> <Tater> I think he is saying he miss clicked the PR upstream button
21:41 < bridge_> <Chairn> ye i know
21:49 < bridge_> <KDaniel> naah i already merge it into my other branche i could delete it
21:50 < bridge_> <Chairn> nah, dont
21:50 < bridge_> <Chairn> just reset it to ddnet/master
21:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why dont u do it chairn
21:50 < bridge_> <Chairn> i cant?
21:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he said he already merged it anyway
21:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> usually ddnet maintainers can
21:51 < bridge_> <Chairn> uh how?
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> checkout his repo and the branch
21:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and force push
21:51 < bridge_> <Chairn> i don't have right to force push someone else branch, im pretty sure
21:51 < bridge_> <Chairn> that owuld be great security issue
21:52 < bridge_> <KDaniel> ahh you want me to force commit to the latest commit of ddnet/ddnet
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> git reset --hard upstream/master 
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> git push --force
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no, he forbids it
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but usually u can
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ofc only for open PRs
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not for all branches xD
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> i just stopped studying and my head is a bit on fire right now. 
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> 
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> 
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> gimme 5min i will do it 🙂
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> 
21:53 < bridge_> <KDaniel> thanks for the commands but i knew how to do
21:56 < bridge_> <KDaniel> done. 🙂
21:57 < bridge_> <KDaniel> There was my first pull request and i didnt want it and fucked it up. GG WP. whole teeworlds career is now over
21:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
21:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chairn just has weird tools
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> his name is chai = tea, rn = right now. so he is calm af
21:59 < bridge_> <KDaniel> xD
22:00 < bridge_> <Chairn> :heartw:
22:00 < bridge_> <Chairn> @ChillerDragon.* take note for <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5438>
22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> yea its kinda fucked up like

22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> and upupstream/master is ddnet/ddnet 
22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> like a fork of a fork thing
22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> yea its kinda fucked up like 
22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> ```
22:01 < bridge_> <KDaniel> origin/master is danielkempf/Tater-Client

23:51 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 have u ever met a crazed cloud "dev"?
23:51 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> like they dont even consider having a server that is not a container node
23:52 < bridge_> <Learath2> Ofc, someone suggested lambda to me when I was implementing thumbnail grabbing from videos
23:52 < bridge_> <Learath2> Serverless people, cloud people, container people, all weirdos
23:52 < bridge_> <Learath2> "wym you don't use terraform for infra"
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> this weirdo is calling me weirdo tho
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> for suggesting nixos for servers
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> "derpy package manager"
23:53 < bridge_> <Learath2> well he is right, us sane people are now in the minority
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> "well sure but I still don't think you should be installing packages on nodes anyway, that's what you build a new image for"
23:53 < bridge_> <Learath2> it's docker container in docker container in docker container now
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> i never said i use "nodes"
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> idk what ever that means lmfao
23:53 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> insane
23:54 < bridge_> <Learath2> though ever since I started using podman a bit, I've grown to enjoy some light containers
23:57 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think i cant get well with sysadmins devops
23:57 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> i dont like all the fancy container stuff
23:57 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> it seems like overhead
23:57 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> im sure this guy has 100 daily users
23:57 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> and is web scaling like google
23:57 < bridge_> <Learath2> well containers are preeetty light, so not much to worry about tbf
23:58 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> but its kinda added complexity on ur setup
23:59 < bridge_> <Learath2> that is true, idk, I'm still on the fence about it but I'm less annoyed with them after working with podman
23:59 < bridge_> <Learath2> less corpo garbage, more open source
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> most use docker tho
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> and kubernets is propietary?
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> also its all a fuss so u use AWS or google cloud
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> corpo bullshit
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> i dont believe in clouds
23:59 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> change my mind
