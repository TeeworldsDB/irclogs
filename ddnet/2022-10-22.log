00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> sql question: If i'm getting it right.. you put PRIMARY KEY as a constraint so you can't do another column with the same name?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> so "name TEXT PRIMARY KEY" would say "you can't add another column named "name" in the table" ?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, not at all.
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it means that two rows in the table can't have the same value for "name"
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> OH so you can't have "Meekrioz" more than once in the table?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 that would be `unique`
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it should be `name text, primary key (name)` and the primary key is the set of columns that identifies a row uniquely
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so if you just have one column as your primary key set, then all rows in that column are unique
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row.
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> that is what my note says
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> correct
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for ddnet's record_race we have (Name, Time, Timestamp) as the primary key. So a rank needs to have unique combination of Name, Time and Timestamp
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you try to insert a rank twice, you get an error because there already is one with this primary key
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> aaaah i see
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> do you have an example for UNIQUE?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Also indexes are if I remember used to improve query performance if used properly
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It just says that each row needs to have a different value in this column
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Kallemy if u are interested in learning a bit more of the basic theory
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but isn't PRIMARY KEY the same thing then?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Kallemy > Primary key will not accept NULL values whereas Unique key can accept NULL values. A table can have only one primary key whereas there can be multiple unique key on a table.
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for example, a user id would be a good candidate for primary key
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and their email a unique key
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Ohhh so a PRIMARY KEY has to have an input but UNIQUE doesnt give a fuck what it has? NULL or email (for your example)
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it depends on how you define the column
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making a column nullable or not is up to you
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but you can't make a column that is a primary key nullable
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whereas you can specify a column that has the unique contraint nullable
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (email TEXT NULL UNIQUE)
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or (email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE)
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Kallemy you see, often you want a id that never changes, to referenciate it from other tables
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a unique column that is not a primary key could have its value changed
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea a customer ID for example
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> losing that ability
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> AAAAAAA
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> I SEE
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you don't wanna change a customer ID but you want to change an email address for example
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this does not mean u cant change a primary key
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you can probably UPDATE it right?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> aaaaah i see! thank you
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> depends after but you might need to cascade it
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> depends of how your db is made
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the norm is to generally not update primary keys
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rarely need to
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well if you have a fk
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> got it, thanks
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sql :justatest:
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> What's wrong with SQL?
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait are u learning python and sql same time
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> are u interested in data analytics
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Maybe :justatest:
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> I'm just tryna see what suits me best, and rn sql is kinda cool
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Read few articles that NoSQL dbs are better
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Probably depends on your experience and tasks, but by description it sounds much better
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just stick to traditionam rdbms, you can mess around with nosql later when you know what you are doing
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> I assume doing this in SendPacket() would be bad ``SecurityToken = htonl(SecurityToken);``
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 9/10 if you think you need a database you are looking for a rdbms
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> So stick to SQL for now? That's what Im getting
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Y
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> üëç
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> plain wrong
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most nosql are not even ACID compliant
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and most data is relational
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> must watch

16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Is there a quicker way of doing it instead of 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```UPDATE friends
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SET email = 'storm@codecademy.com'
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> WHERE id = 1;``` 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> For every ID in my table?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most flavours of sql will do all rows if you dont have a WHERE clause at all
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some will force to use a WHERE clause, then you can do something like `WHERE 1=1` or `WHERE id = id` or `WHERE id > 0`
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember which one requires the trick, maybe postgres
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> id = id worked
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Postgres doesnt iirc

18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2 moderna, 1 pfizer
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I couldnt choose
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> did pfizer hurt
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i only got 2 sinopharm so my social credit score is through the roof
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So far not hurting
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I got pfizer today
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'd say worst reason (but  i guess your comment was sarcastic)
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> There may or may not be a chance that your arm will hurt a lot tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Ryozuki send link pls
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If u dont leak
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And a possible temperature
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> That happened with moderna
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why would i?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just sayin xd
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Btw make sure to extract the 5G chip they put in you before it turns your brain into a soup

18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, I was serious. It's a joy to be able to afford the things you want even if you can't justify it. It's the neoliberal dream

18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, are you going over the new years?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes told u
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> From 24 dec to 2 jan
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you were just thinking about it
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I got all paid
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill do scale at frankfurt germany
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 week is really tight, plan well
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cant do more cuz work xd
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent 2 and still didn't get to see everything I wanted to see
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i just don't get it, especially if you don't have a need for it
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2/3 of the trip are paid by my sister :BASED:
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got the exact opposite. 2 pfizer 1 moderna
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how much is your sister making per month ryo?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well do you never indulge in things you don't absolutely need? The richer you are the more you can indulge
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 10k or so $
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yep
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know a guy that just takes a vacation whenever he feels bad
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i do sometimes learath, but not on things that are worth more than few tens of euros
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (asking libk for a furfriend)
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> taking vacation is different
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's not material if you stay at home instead of going to work
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's because you just aren't rich enough. Cost is really a relative thing
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Or maybe you are and you are budget concious idk)
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> who says im not rich enough?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> at some point of income you do not care what you buy, you don't even look at the price tag, you just go in the store, pick what you want and buy it.
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly. I know so many people like this around me.
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't look prices when im grocery shopping, isn't that nice enough?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now bump it to the next level
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, i have a conscious
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i only look at discount products because they are tagged with a red shield, other than that, same. i buy what i crave and want.
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you know that little voice in the head?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> when it comes to grocery shopping, sadly i am not that rich that i can just do that in a dealership for cars

18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nasa i.e
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk. There is just sth very pleasing about getting something just out of pure desire

18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are unicorn companies that prob pay more than google btw
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but working at google itself is a stamp on your CV
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a permanent gold diploma that gets u most work
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i agree, as long as you don't do that everyday and still try to limit your carbon footprint
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i mean you can buy used things and minimize your carbon footprint
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i mean you can buy used things everyday and minimize your carbon footprint
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like your gt3rs?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea, i could buy that second hand
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> in the future, ofc
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally don't believe in the concept of individual carbon footprint. Just by existing in europe I produce an insane amount more than an african village. Whatever I do at a personal level won't change shit. We'll get to me running my heater 10 minutes less when china turns off their coal plants
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i probably have to because in 2023 or 2024 most german car factures won't build brand new combustion engines
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> asking ppl to do less is a bit dumb
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the gov gotta force the companies

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heavy industry gets to pollute 50 times more than me while I have to watch the amount of meat I eat and the lights I keep on in my house. I'm sorry but fuck that
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> meat is defs smth on a personal scale
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they can force new taxes for carbon-expensive things so ppl will make less footprint
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> other than electricity
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> bottom up (me) versus top down (you)
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but ofc government need to move their asses...
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mean for people but not for companies
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about we bottom up go tell the govt and industry they need to get their shit in order? I'd be 100% with you on that
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do u think theyll do anything with gigantic fabrics just to get shit done kekw

19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> recent guillotine seen last week in my city during manifestation for better pay

19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tf
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we make one in wood working class obviously üòÑ
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> going at the center of Grenoble sux
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't even recognize the place
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://twitter.com/IndoPac_Info/status/1583794671129485312
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw. I don't just increase my carbon footprint for the lulz. I still do the "right thing" if it's not too inconvenient. But I just refuse to live below a certain standard
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Chairn dunno too, would have said close to Victor Hugo
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i thought too, but the tram tracks and buildings do not match
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what went wrong. Did he dare talk badly about premier xi?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, he was other faction
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Hu Jintao was the only one who tried hard to prevent XiJinping from being re-elected.
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and xi wants to be reelected for the 3rd time
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is out of the norm
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u only can do 2
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China is seriously concerning :/
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually xi made it legal to do more a year or two ago
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ofc
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like putin
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just make it legal 4head
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Putin swapping places with medvedev before it became legal was probably the biggest farce on earth
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you'll spend your time in tokyo, try to sneak in Afuri. Very interesting ramen. Cured me of death
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yeah tell me good places
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was literally suffering. One sip of the soup and I was cured
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to have any fancy food, book ahead. Good omakase places get booked almost a month in advance
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will check
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> can someone explain to me "AND" and "OR"?? AND takes ALL conditions and OR only the selected?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> can someone explain to me "AND" and "OR"?? AND takes all conditions and OR only the selected?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it's just logic stuff
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> AND need both right hand side and left hand side to be true
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> OR accepts any side to be true
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AND is true if both are true
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> OR is true if atleast one is true

19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> use parenthesis to group stuff and overrides operator precedency
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i feel dumb
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ``` SELECT name, year
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> BETWEEN 1990 AND 1996
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> FROM movies;```
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> should give me the movies etc. that were made between 1990 and 1996
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but it only shows ALL movies with 1 and 0 as true/false
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i want it to show me ONLY movies that are true and with the year :WEIRD:
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> select name, year from movies where year between 1990 and 1996;
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SELECT name, year
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> BETWEEN 1990 AND 1996
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> FROM movies;```
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> selecting ‚Äûyear between 1990 and 1996‚Äú means you want to have a column in your output that says if this movie is from this range of years
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ahh okay
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i see now, thank you
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> You can try to get some data from the ddnet db
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> why does 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ``` 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SELECT name, imdb_rating
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> from movies
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ORDER BY imdb_rating ASC ```
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> works 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but 
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ```
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> SELECT name, imdb_rating
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> from movies
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> ORDER BY imdb_rating > 4.5 ASC ```
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> doesnt?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> it shows me all the right movies, but not in ascending order
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> order doesnt filter
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use where imdb_rating > 4.5 ORDER BY imdb_rating ASC
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use ` where imdb_rating > 4.5 ORDER BY imdb_rating ASC`
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> got it
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> im surprised how good i am on the sql tests on code academy
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> even tho im a complete pepega when it comes to coding <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> anyone has list of protocol messages with GUIDs?

20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well sql simple stuff is quite easy
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hard things are when u have  multiple tables, joining them etc
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some sql queries in ddnet are quite big xd
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Ok why do you have to make it bad? :WEIRD:

20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> im learning sql for 2 days now, i'm not gonna be a pro in like those days :weirdL:
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Kallemy no worries im not a pro either
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the sql pro here is deen
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> partitions are a tough thing to figure out
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Yea but let me have my achievements :ANGERY:
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> can't wait for it....
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> when you guys say "tough thing to figure out" for me that's like "yea you will never understand it" <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most of the time u dont need to do complex queries though
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can, it just takes a bit to click
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u do a crud app
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> inner join outer join blah blah
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> groups and partitions are probably the hardest part of sql to begin with
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you learn to design some tables and do simple queries u are good to go most of the time
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> shouldn't the big query be split across multiple queries for easier comprehension?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and as for design i recommend learning the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form>
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> search a tutorial or smth
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its good pratices
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> practices*
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to avoid data duplication etc
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> first of all, i have to finish my course
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true true
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i'm at 15% WTF
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> Oh lord have mercy on my soul
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> :Prayge:

20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are you in a hurry?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not BCNF? Sounds like something you'd enjoy üòõ

20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A 6NF also exists, but its purpose is not to remove redundancy and it is therefore only adopted by a few data warehouses, where it can be useful to make tables irreducible.
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at 4
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its when fun starts
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> relational stuff shows when you have more than 1 table

20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you mean it?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> is it actually fun?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean its where the meat is at
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i personally enjoy coding so its fun for me
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i see, looking forward to it

21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen fuzzing for databases?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not coverage-guided, just a random generator
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why don't people split those mega queries?
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it for performance reason?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because the bug might happen as a consequence of combining 10 weird features no one ever used together
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And even if it's just a subset, faster to combine more in one query
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when RustSQL @Ryozuki ?

22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compressing images before adding them to maps does absolutely nothing
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your map will be the same size no matter whether you compress the image before adding or not
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> compressed images are not displayed even in the editor
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "compressing"
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://compresspng.com/ ü•∫
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> editor supports only PNG-24?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> game supports only PNG-24?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/ded871091bb984f0419cac605b85ecf438c6fbcd/gamenet/generate/spec/ddnet-16.2.json this should contain the actual UUIDs as well
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the map format doesn't support PNGs at all. it first takes the PNG and decompresses it. then it applies its own compression. the ddnet client could theoretically load any PNG but we disabled that for compatibility with older clients
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you doing with the UUIDs? üôÇ
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> doing server side support for DDNET.
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> In my C# server mode
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, nice üôÇ
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could theoretically generate the game messages from the JSON I maintain, if you wanted to
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I was able to get the cursor position, thanks to CNetMsg_Cl_ShowDistance, thanks to whoever did this ‚ù§Ô∏è
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use it for the wireshark dissector
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I was able to get the cursor position (with zoom), thanks to CNetMsg_Cl_ShowDistance, thanks to whoever did this ‚ù§Ô∏è

23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean that the JSON also has all the fields
