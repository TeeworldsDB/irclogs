08:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh noes
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yea can‚Äôt see idk
08:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in mobile i can
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> can‚Äôt on mobile either
08:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> # developer
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> now i can
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> why are the automatic updates delayed??
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> stupid app stote

08:18 < bridge> <ReiTW> Why are discord devs so stupid
08:18 < bridge> <ReiTW> You should ask yourself that question, not why updates are delayed

08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> I support this decision
08:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it does, but not for normal users
08:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> see #records
08:26 < bridge> <ReiTW> Yes only bots
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah that‚Äôs old news lol
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> Also not markdown

08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> Such a stern fellow
08:34 < bridge> <Voxel> thought you made that for a sec
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
09:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's UB already
09:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, in practice, things will happen when you do such stuff. compilers optimize based on it
09:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why is it ub?
09:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its curious, in rust u can take a ptr and add it 3, i think as long as u dont deref it its safe
09:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do you add 3?
09:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not sure now
09:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> .offset
09:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
09:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's UB then
09:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even in the documentation of `offset`
09:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (which is why `offset` is `unsafe`)
09:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Both the starting and resulting pointer must be either in bounds or one byte past the end of the same allocated object.
09:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
09:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use `wrapping_offset` for other manipulation
09:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should play more with pointers in rust
09:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never rly needed to do much
09:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 btw, even stuff around `uintptr_t` is incorrectly optimized based on the assumption that you can't conjure pointers out of thin air
09:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> The offset being in bounds cannot rely on ‚Äúwrapping around‚Äù the address space. That is, the infinite-precision sum, in bytes must fit in a usize.
09:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> The resulting pointer ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the allocated object that self points to; it must not be used to read or write other allocated objects.
09:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice info xs
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2022/04/11/provenance-exposed.html
09:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228
09:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 this pr says wrapping offset is not good
09:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> interesting
10:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the whole strict provenance thing is interesting üôÇ
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly not working in chromium, i enabled unsafe webgpu, but can't find my GPU üòÑ
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> which vendor & driver?
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it matter? there is not webgpu driver
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> just curious
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> amd rx 6900 xt Mesa 22.3.6
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> either its chrome exclusive or simply not working on linux xd
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting conclusion
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean webgpu is a subset of vulkan, so i dont find a better conclusion
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have chromium 113, the examples say chrome 113
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> vulkan extras pkg group or something ? smells like optional
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use debian
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `chromium --enable-unsafe-webgpu --enable-features=Vulkan,UseSkiaRenderer`
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it at least finds the GPU now, but it throws many errors üòÑ
11:04 < bridge> <Learath2> C99 6.5.6 p7, followed by p8. Just doing the addition is immediately UB
11:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Which is why I said the only guaranteed thing even with those is that the roundtrip is safe
11:06 < bridge> <Learath2> @Ryozuki https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/welcome.html
11:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Google's android team made a rust tutorial
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can they please rewrite android with rust
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks xd
11:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^
11:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I did some yesterday was fun
11:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, hadn't spotted it
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only because of miscompilations, the standard guarantees some more
11:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u know those numbers mean nothing to me, i was interested in why it was considered ub, as in what assumptions the compiler can make due to it
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> these numbers cna help you look up the relevant paragraphs
11:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> meh
11:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just quote the paragraphs xd
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let me gpt-4 it for you
11:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like references
11:11 < bridge> <Learath2> It is considered UB because those 2 paragraphs explicitly say it's UB
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but why did the C standard say it's UB
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is what ryo is asking
11:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah, but im interested in why they decieded it
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what benefit does it gain from it
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would safe me some unsafe if offset in rust wouldnt be unsafe üòÇ
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basically, optimize away equality checks for pointers not from the same object
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well but u gotta use offset
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the author itself recommends offset over wrapping offset
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the rfc i sent is interesting
11:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this uas been linked many times, and i did too months ago
11:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but ye
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rust already knew the link before it was released
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !rust
11:13 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it might be presumptuous of me, but right now the only interesting reads about rust for me are RFCs and the rustonomicon
11:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are very nice blog posts about rust
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah those too
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially the ones giving thought about new stuff
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like pointer provenance
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> generators
11:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Do share üôÉ
11:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> async

11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need
11:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is one guy that has 3 posts only
11:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot thenname
11:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Why read RFCs? They will never be implemented :pepeW:
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad and true, dont make me sad
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> huh? rust rfcs are implemented sometimes
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only useless ones
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not even an RFC though
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just a wishlist item
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems to me that the benefits this brings will be outweighed by the cost of the additional syntax etc.
11:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/
11:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> one of em
11:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> very good reads

11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i'd say it's useful af
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> WHY SO MUCH SHOUTING?
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://without.boats/blog/
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and this guy too
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic blog
11:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Ryozuki have you seen this https://fornjot.app/? Though I don't know how interested you are in CAD/3D Desing
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give an example? I found that most of this is easily worked around. new syntax for something like this should create large new possibilities IMO
11:18 < bridge> <Learath2> The sometimes seems to get slower and slower especially for the most interesting ones
11:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Ryozuki have you seen this https://fornjot.app/ ? Though I don't know how interested you are in CAD/3D Desing
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and cant miss this
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by niko
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> one of the main rust devs
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> example?
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. async was an rfc once ^^
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everytime u want to implement some function on a higher level that has to know about multiple attributes at once, without needing to send around the objects every time you call these functions
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think its normal, one wrong step and u are bound to back compat
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats why they start with restricted MVPs
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like const
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> self.Func would block whole self object
11:20 < bridge> <Learath2> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2140 here is one that was lucky enough to get implemented, hopefully it'll get stabilized this decade
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not rly
11:21 < bridge> <Learath2> I'll show another one I'm interested in that wasn't so lucky aswell
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think that this is going to be easier with that wishlist item being implemented
11:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 become a rust contrib and push it
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'd have to annotate a lot of stuff to make it work
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's probably easier to work around it instead
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why move complexity to the code instead of the compiler?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if borrow checker wouldnt be so dump, rust would be easier to use
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if borrow checker wouldnt be so dumb, rust would be easier to use
11:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dump
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because of the halting problem, essentially
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because a sufficiently smart compiler doesn't exist, unfortunately
11:28 < bridge> <Learath2> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2616 here is the one I found while digging around for a pretty way to do it
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are you also against async?
11:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure how this is related? ^^
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why would `&mut self borrowing x` not be clear to you?
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it adds less complexity than async
11:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's now `let else` which might cover what you need
11:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Thanks for the blogs, added to my bookmarks
11:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's cluttering the code with a lot of stuff. it needs to be more than just a nice-to-have to justify so much additional syntax
11:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see how it'll work out in the end btw
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why i am asking
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> async hides even more stuff
11:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, async enables a lot of stuff
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it lets the compiler do the rewriting to a state machine that is easy to get wrong by hand
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, it makes the language's control structures first-class in an async context
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which is very nice
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the above makes it first-class for the context of partial self borrowing
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is very nice
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not what I said about async
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :NekoPopcorn:
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> async enabled stuff like `if`, `else`, `return`, etc. work in an async context
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where previously, you had to build these control structures into your state machine
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it enabled the use of existing control structures in an async context
11:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> async is big ye
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway, i am happy many ppl in the rfc issue agree with me, i'd say its a must have for rust
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesn't add  lot of complexity to the syntax while making coding much easier
11:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually, why not just `if !matches!(x, Some(_)) { ‚Ä¶ }`?
11:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a bit of confirmation bias, mostly interested ppl go say they interested tho
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not a problem
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could also claim async is only needed for ppl requiring async code
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all features are biased
11:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not really an rfc. if you look at the linked rfcs, it seems most people are against it
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i said rfc issue
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs its clearly in the rfc repo
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea. I just want to make very clear that it's not an rfc
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the rfc repo issues are merely wishlist items
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then lets hope it gets a rfc very soon
11:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I think this is what I ended up with, it's not the prettiest but it works. I can check after I get up. I may have just inverted the branches and bit the nesting bullet too
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so &x + 0 is not UB right? üòÇ
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and - 0 either
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also + 1
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> &x + sum (-1)^(n+1)
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> n => infinity
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> &x + sum (-1)^(n)
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> n from 1 => infinity
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> &x + sum (-1)^(n+1)
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is this UB?
12:42 < bridge> <bencie> o damn :POGGIES:
12:43 < bridge> <bencie> congrats @Robyt3
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> damn
12:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks we got overtaken
12:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well not like i ever thought i would be admin
12:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more so given heinrich being there :justatest:
12:44 < bridge> <Iza> Heinrich is heinrich
12:44 < bridge> <Iza> As you can tell from his heinrich role
12:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> heinrich is admin
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deen asked me like 4 years ago, i declined
12:46 < bridge> <deen> If I remember correctly we asked @Jupeyy_Keks once and he declined. Anything changed @Jupeyy_Keks ?
12:46 < bridge> <deen> good timing üòÑ
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> damn
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> guess im the only unworthy xD
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont know rn, if there is no hurry let me think about it for a bit
12:46 < bridge> <deen> @Ryozuki I think admin isn't fully correlated with development activity
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep, thats the main reason i am not 100% sure
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i know
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more or less
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill just be the guy in the shadows
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> doing some prs
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maintaining the wiki
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> some blogs here and there
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and being annoying about rust
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/honest-word-its-honest-work-it-aint-much-it-aint-much-but-its-honest-work-gif-13763573
12:49 < bridge> <deen> That 1 month github activity graph is scary üòÑ 118/176 commits were from @Robyt3
12:49 < bridge> <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110519938990477332/Screenshot_2023-05-23_at_12.49.11.png
12:50 < bridge> <Iza> He‚Äôs basically the lone developer of ddnet
12:50 < bridge> <Iza> Not to discredit the work of all the other decs
12:50 < bridge> <Iza> Not to discredit the work of all the other devs
12:51 < bridge> <Iza> I still wish i could code so i could contribute the amount of ideas i have
12:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well not to diminish the work, he doesnt squash the commits most of the time
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is no good meassurement anyway
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte is very active and fixes his bugs very quickly, that's worth a lot imo
12:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually his activity motivated to code again in ddnet xd
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but time is hard to come by
13:00 < bridge> <deen> Sure, number of commits is not a good measure, but his commits are actually helpfully split up for reviewing
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeye
13:18 < bridge> <Voxel> i will not get used to robyt with a green name
13:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel when admin
13:26 < bridge> <Voxel> i dont want admin
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as long as u are on good terms with heinrich it seems possible now
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Troll
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> truth
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Truth but troll
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks if u get admin ill cri
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill feel out of place here
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why u so mad xd
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk something in myself made me extremely conscious now
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Being admin made learath depressed
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think thats related
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thinking about it deeper, i dont rly wanna be admin, cuz its a burden
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i guess it just felt as if what i do was less, idk how to put it in words
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im just a envy person :justatest:
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah u should relax a bit
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and join discord so these stupid new emoji suggestions dont pop up every 5 seconds
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf is this
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what suggestions
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i type wtf and on the right there are suggestions
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on the file icon
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this aggressive guy xd

13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does that only work in the app?
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> seems
13:31 < bridge> <Iza> i guess only desktop
13:31 < bridge> <Voxel> you CAN?
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rightclicking on the input doesnt work
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> discord fault
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know u mean good, but this is the worst thing to say to someone not relaxed xdd

13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is the minimum footprint
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is 1m tasks

13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff, why is rust async-std worse than c# and js
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how is that even possible xD
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but gg to tokio
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go worse than python lmao
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's already an accomplishment
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the first image is the minimal footprint of 1 task
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but ye
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess 1 task isnt the most common thing?
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho yeah c# is clear winner xDD
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> async-std is not that good
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tokio is a engineer marvel
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go is supposed to do big well here
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz it always goes on about coroutines
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good that we dont have a RAM problem rn
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbf, its not good measurement anyway
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also need performance
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i knew learath comes
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when memory is mentioned xD
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he smells it
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did he type
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure tokio does well in perf
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he was about to say it
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah no doubt
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tokio is used by http servers
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i want to see how fast c# is
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and they are on on the top 10
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and go
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go is probs fast
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> systemd bootloader uefi
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is made in rust xd
13:48 < bridge> <Learath2> fwiw I like async-std more, but tokio is more popular
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> booo
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u only need 2
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tokio and pollster
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pollster for super lightweight
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/pollster
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u will like this crate
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it mentions unix ethos
13:49 < bridge> <Learath2> Love it already
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:51 < bridge> <Learath2> OH, I needed this before. I had to
13:51 < bridge> <Learath2> settle for tokio
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i feel hipster, im at a office on a terrace with a mac coding rust
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on a sunny day
14:37 < bridge> <louis> where linux
14:37 < bridge> <louis> ur banned from the elite linux fanclub
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in office i dont have another laptop
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they gave me m1
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which tbh, is crazy fast
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> compile times are almost same as my 5800x
14:41 < bridge> <Voxel> what even is ryoz coding at work
14:41 < bridge> <Voxel> or is that disclosed
14:41 < bridge> <louis> nuclear weaponry software
14:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wont say it exactly, but with some digging u probs can find it
14:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its related to making a compiler with llvm
14:43 < bridge> <Avolicious> Starbucks coffee?
14:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no its our own office
14:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i get normal coffee
14:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with milk
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the rly big sized one, it costs 2.7‚Ç¨
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its giant
14:44 < bridge> <Avolicious> ü§Æ no hipster then
14:44 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ai women
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> still, better than american coffee
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if they can call it that
14:46 < bridge> <Voxel> ew...
14:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no hipster
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no maidens
14:47 < bridge> <Voxel> god why are people content with working for an ai
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel did u learn rust yet
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Voxel did u join the cool crew yet
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i even made the logo for you
14:50 < bridge> <Avolicious> I am sitting with a mac in a starbucks shop and consuming starbucks coffee, writing a case study cybersecurity related for my job and university üôÇ hipster confirmed tho
14:51 < bridge> <Voxel> no i had to finish an animation for someone
14:51 < bridge> <Voxel> the voxel vulkan logo?
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
14:52 < bridge> <Voxel> i still need to   know what to make in rust
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> program smth with vk
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> join mesa and make rust drivers for vulkan
14:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
14:53 < bridge> <Voxel> oh yew vulkan
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> join kernel development and write the DRM in rust
14:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im writing a array slice implementation in llvm mlir
14:53 < bridge> <Voxel> hm that adds anothrt thing to add to my list
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with 1st class vk support
14:53 < bridge> <Voxel> oh man i can only imagine now
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vulkan is hard
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> first learn programming
14:54 < bridge> <louis> im about to study it in college
14:54 < bridge> <louis> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/919318424163856415/1050553033823625257/SHTO.gif
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vk is easy
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has lot of stuff
14:54 < bridge> <Voxel> remember: ai isnt human and doesnt deserve rights
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and its hard for a newbie
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> math is the only hard thing
14:55 < bridge> <louis> well ye im more interested in the beneficial applications
14:55 < bridge> <louis> like with actual issues etc
14:55 < bridge> <Voxel> fair
14:55 < bridge> <louis> like traffic for example
14:56 < bridge> <louis> americuh things
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do animals deserve rights?
14:56 < bridge> <Voxel> i have yet to see a cat that can provide beneficial advice for our economy
14:56 < bridge> <Voxel> other than "MAAW"
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if AI learning is about survival of the fittests where good things are treated positive and bad things are punished, does this blure the line to what we consider pain?
14:57 < bridge> <Voxel> i dont like thinking about how something that isnt even made by nature can rule over people
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if AI learning is about survival of the fittests where good things are treated positive and bad things are punished, does this blur the line to what we consider pain?
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its made by nature
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs we were made by nature
14:58 < bridge> <Voxel> thats a stretch
14:58 < bridge> <Voxel> you know what i mean
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the next logical step, planned by nature bcs its too hard for it to do biologically
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we are the tools
14:59 < bridge> <Voxel> so what? am i just going to just accept being a slave of these things in the future?
14:59 < bridge> <Iza> maybe we're the ai in an artificial universe created by someone
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u are a slave rn
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> AIs can give u freedom
14:59 < bridge> <murpi> mosquitos don't
14:59 < bridge> <Voxel> right now its kind of the opposite
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the AI we have is not general intelligence tho
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally tho, we are probably very free compared to 100 years ago
15:01 < bridge> <Iza> i wouldn't say we're more free than 100 years ago
15:01 < bridge> <Iza> we just have more options
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say we arent free, but more free than 100 years ago
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when capitalism began it's unbreakable march and humans were actual resources
15:02 < bridge> <louis> thats being more free :troll:
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i say we i probably refer to the folk in total
15:03 < bridge> <Iza> i think i meant something more like "we have different options" instead of more options
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> around 150 years ago there still was slavery in USA
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> around 60 years ago it was ok to define black ppl as something worth less than whites
15:04 < bridge> <Iza> well slavery is not comparable to anything, thats an absolute imprisonment
15:05 < bridge> <louis> i mean yeah in the usa theres more freedom since then (ü¶Öüá∫üá∏üó£Ô∏è)
15:05 < bridge> <louis> not necessarily in other places though
15:05 < bridge> <cyberFighter> so true
15:06 < bridge> <·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º> i need help
15:06 < bridge> <·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º> \:(
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we all need help here
15:08 < bridge> <Iza> maybe you'd get help if you weren't invisible
15:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> xD
15:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> elp
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks can we query the min sample rate
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, but i guess SDL has smth like that
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill check
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think sample rate should make be a dropdown
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> *
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > freq specifies the number of sample frames sent to the sound device per second. The Nyquist Theorem states that the audio sampling frequency must be exactly twice the highest frequency represented in the audio. Humans can hear up to slightly under 20kHz, declining to 16kHz or lower as we age. Standard CD quality audio uses 44100. DVDs and the Opus audio codec use 48000. Values higher than 48000 generally should not be used for playback purposes b
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Format.freq = g_Config.m_SndRate;
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use studio quality
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i have fast CPU and lot of RAM
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats the value for that
15:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> I use 192000 Hz in my Realtek driver software
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think generally ppl dont want to change this
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> from ui
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
15:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, it's not a relevant setting for most users
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u have high qaulity audio equipment
15:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe remove the setting from the UI entirely and set the default to 44100 or 48000
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should tweak someday my values then
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not much probably
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Humans can hear up to slightly under 20kHz, declining to 16kHz or lower as we age
15:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> my speakers are the oldest still working part of my setup I think
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > sampling frequency must be exactly twice the highest frequency represented in the audio
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say it sounds better
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 48 sounds good
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Unfortunately, there is no point to distributing music in 24-bit/192kHz format. Its playback fidelity is slightly inferior to 16/44.1 or 16/48, and it takes up 6 times the space.
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > There are a few real problems with the audio quality and 'experience' of digitally distributed music today. 24/192 solves none of them. While everyone fixates on 24/192 as a magic bullet, we're not going to see any actual improvement.

15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks @Robyt3 what do u think about setting the min value to CD hz
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 44k
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ez fix
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if someone wants bad quality
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why prevent it üòÑ
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz crash
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah when its set to 1 xD
15:58 < bridge> <Voxel> if i ever get a computer chip in my brain i want it only to secretly play ddnet while im ar work
15:58 < bridge> <Voxel> thats it
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but dont devices support only specific sample rates?
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 44.1, 48, 192
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well but i assume they rescale it?
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks whats the diff between 16bit and 32bit audio
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> making it sound floppy
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and float or integer
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never looked much into audio myself
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16bit = 16bit to represent a wave
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 32bit = 32bit to represent a wave
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> floats usually are used to normalize it, but u know problems and advantages of floats
16:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> m_SndBufferSize should also be a power of 2
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> back in the days i had to reduce it
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it crated too much lag
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > With SDL >= 2.0.4 you can choose to avoid callbacks and use SDL_QueueAudio() instead, if you like. Just open your audio device with a NULL callback.
16:01 < bridge> <Robyt3> `// Set 16-bit stereo audio at 22Khz` the comment implies that teeworlds was 22050 Hz before
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but we are not in 2007 now
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> What is the minimum sampling rate where it doesn't crash for them? Literally just with 1?
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am linux enjoyer where everything works
16:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> also works on Windows for me
16:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
16:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe audio driver specific issue
16:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 try setting m_SndBufferSize to a non power of 2 too
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_AudioSpec#remarks
16:05 < bridge> <Robyt3> doesn't cause any issues for me
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> even after restart?
16:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah
16:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> with values like 129, 1234
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ahh
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i get it
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we pass "desired" values
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it doesnt mean we get those
16:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> SDL probably rounds yeah
16:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> I think it's fine to remove the sampling rate UI though and set the default to 48000 if it isn't already
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sdl says to use SDL_LockAudioDevice on the callback
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i think we use our own locks
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we only put smth into a buffer sdl gives us
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_LockAudioDevice
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > - desired->callback should be set to a function that will be called when the audio device is ready for more data. It is passed a pointer to the audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer. This function usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should protect data structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudioDevice() and SDL_UnlockAudioDevice() in your code. Alternately, you may pass a NULL pointer here, and call SDL_Queu
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well then i dont see a problem using a custom mutex
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its probably for consoles without c++ standard or smth
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sdl also provides stuff like memset
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> SDL_memset
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
16:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_PowerState
16:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to detect if running on battery
16:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "please dont use ur battery and cry about lags"
16:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> would it be bad to log if ur using battery
16:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe helps for crying users
16:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:20 < bridge> <Smetanolub> how do i pull request on github?
16:20 < bridge> <Smetanolub> can you add translate for chat?
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont plan that bcs we cant ship a translator for everyone
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if u are interesting, create an API that can be overloaded with an translator API
16:22 < bridge> <murpi> The ATH client had a translator IIRC
16:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=translation
16:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its time
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could do the translation server side üòâ
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill look into this
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok maybe idk
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never used tensorflow xd
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Chrairn 22:19:19         bridge | <Chairn> you gotta split on `<` and `>` and then split according to what's in between, because there are multiple garbages prepended
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> was this a message for me?
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> i do not understand
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> about the image size i tried to replicate discord and the screens i got from u it was always huuughe
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait it IS a discord image :D i thought its chat.zillyhuhn.com xd
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> yea you are right it should be smaller
16:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> greatest chat of all time
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if its not made in rust i wont use it
16:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> nice you even added basic markdown support already
17:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why do you like async-std more?
17:04 < bridge> <Learath2> The executor agnostic approach and the way they try to stick as close to std as possible sounded like the better idea to me
17:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i was about to send a microsoft rust link
17:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but iwont
17:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hate m too much
17:24 < bridge> <Voxel> my brother in christ discord uses javascript
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust for backend
17:25 < bridge> <Voxel> yes but it isnt
17:25 < bridge> <Voxel> made

18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> weird error, anyone good at python? ^^
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the internet tells me this might happen if I derive from a module
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but this `FfiConverterPrimitiveFloat` ought to be a class
18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @Chairn\: I messed up the ping. Your name is such a typo
18:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (<@749222324980416602_=43hiller=44ragon>)
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hate most games are windows only, i wanted to look into how modding propietary games work, but its all about windows apis
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> such a chore, i wanna use linux
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well the specific thing i searched was about dll injection
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ff14wed/deucalion
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> interesting piece of software
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/CasualX/pelite
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im in a rabbit hole now
18:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like an interesting rabbit hole though üôÇ
18:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
19:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u know what signature scanning is?
19:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> know a more up to date crate than https://github.com/pombredanne/scanner-rs ?
19:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> signature scanning is scanning for known byte sequences, I think
19:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. looking for functions you want to patch
19:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> based on their instructions
19:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah, but often u can skip some bytes
19:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xx??xx????
19:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably because these bytes change from version to version
19:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. when they're calls to different functions which might be laid out differently
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```csharp
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>  [MemberFunction("E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? EB 64 B1 01")]
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     public partial bool UseAction(ActionType actionType, uint actionID, long targetID = 0xE000_0000, uint a4 = 0, uint a5 = 0, uint a6 = 0, void* a7 = null);
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
19:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
19:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> might be interesting to see how sigscanning works, maybe i can make my own crate
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```py
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> def FfiConverterPrimitiveFloat(FfiConverterPrimitive):
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     @classmethod
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     def check(cls, value):
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991>         return super().check(float(value))
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well, yeah..
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's literally scanning for known byte sequences
19:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> implementing a string search doesn't sound too interestng
19:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
19:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> 0.6.5 is such a fever dream heinrich did i get that correctly the client sends its token which the server uses once to send its token and then both server and client use the same token?
19:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't remember
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> whereas in 0.7 client and server both have their own token
19:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it seems there's even a PR to add type hints to uniffi: https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1506/files

19:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i got a crazy idea maybe u know if its possible, do u think u can tell cargo where to put target/ ? for example in a tmpfs
19:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, there's an env variable for that
19:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
19:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how compatible it is if u have multiple projects tho
19:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no problem IIRC
19:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic
19:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I had such a setup before
19:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> putting everything into /var/cache/cargo-1000
19:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or /var/tmp/cargo-1000, probably
19:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it might not work well with projects that try to handle cargo themselves
19:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm i see
19:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` btw

19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> getting ranted is the best way to learn
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and nobody will be offensive, heinrich will make sure
19:56 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Hmm your right ü§î

20:10 < bridge> <Voxel> the logos look traumatized

20:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Chairn in case it was not clear i was trolin u have veri cute name UwU
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all symbols gone
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u should nuke them after the release deen üòÇ
20:28 < bridge> <Vy0x2> @ChillerDragon Sorry :pepeH:
20:29 < bridge> <Voxel> symbols?
20:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> debug symbols i assume
20:29 < bridge> <Voxel> ah
20:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> There are git revision hashes in the file name now though, so we could try writing a script/bot that automatically parses the crash logs
20:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah cool üòÑ
20:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Build a website where they can be pasted in and annotated :) like https://mclo.gs/kHkh0HO
20:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The crash logs are never auto uploaded somewhere right? So its mostly users posting them on discord i assume? Where do people do that? in #bugs? they dont really appear in this channel do they?
20:38 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, they mostly send them in #bugs or in DM
20:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> hey, im wondering if there is any flood protection built-into ddnet? i just started a new server and somebody seems to be funny
20:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110637893829001348/image.png
20:38 < bridge> <Swarfey> (i have unregistered it from server list for now so it doesnt get masterbanned)
20:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea since this one idiot published a js lib tw is full of skids
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxaxaxaxax
20:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> who
20:39 < bridge> <Swarfey> xdddd
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nodel
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> suff
20:39 < bridge> <Swarfey> do u think its made with that?
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk honestly
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont u send secret swarfey fingerprint bytes?
20:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> different IP addresses?
20:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> some noodle emoji?
20:39 < bridge> <Swarfey> i think not, i checked status and they dont have default skin or default ddnet version shipped with my lib
20:40 < bridge> <Swarfey> they might have changed it tho, is possible
20:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I have seend those once in the master its not known who is doing that right?
20:40 < bridge> <Swarfey> are logs saved somewhere by default? i didnt enable show_ips 1 by default
20:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
20:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah no logs by default
20:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how did you start the server?
20:40 < bridge> <Swarfey> rip
20:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @Swarfey go register the server again
20:40 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
20:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> is `autoexec_server.log` not enabled per default?
20:41 < bridge> <Swarfey> 2023-05-23 20:36:01 I server: id=6 addr=XXX name='TMWOMS' client=2 secure=yes flags=0

20:41 < bridge> <Swarfey> if u wanna inspect it, idk
20:41 < bridge> <Swarfey> they arent spoofed
20:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they can not join with spoofed
20:41 < bridge> <Swarfey> just ./DDNet-Server.exe, its just a server for friends rn
20:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its probably some proxy ips
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm, client version 2
20:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea u can ban that version
20:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with a config
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but they're just gonna change it
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not really a solution
20:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how would they know
20:42 < bridge> <Iza> it means that the client didnt sent info to server yet, which means that those proxies will time out
20:42 < bridge> <Swarfey> cuz they are probably reading this :D
20:42 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ye they did timeout
20:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is secret channel
20:42 < bridge> <Swarfey> they want to cause mayhem and are waiting for the attention probably
20:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmmm interesting
20:43 < bridge> <Swarfey> they timed out after 100 seconds already, just thought they will probably come back
20:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> add ip filter with blacklist for vpns etc
20:43 < bridge> <Swarfey> ye ima add logs and wait until they come back someday
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rcon ``sv_banned_versions 2``
20:44 < bridge> <Swarfey> ty
20:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> you should have a `autoexec_server.log` in your config directory if you just start the server with default options
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot since when?
20:45 < bridge> <Swarfey> where can i find the config directory on linux?
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cd ~/.teeworlds``
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or ``cd ~/.ddnet``mabye these days
20:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> don't know, it's configured in the default config that the server loads
20:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wow my friends game just crashed
20:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tell your friend to uninstall vbot and use ddnet
20:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> where are the dumps
20:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> located
20:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> %APPDATA% i assume
20:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> in `dumps` folder in the config directory. do you mean on Windows?
20:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> There are no detailed dumps on Linux, only logs for assertions
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cyber friend sounds like :windows:
20:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no crash log appeared for him
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what client version does he use?
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe its older than the crash log feature xd
20:47 < bridge> <Swarfey> latest ddnet
20:47 < bridge> <Swarfey> its a new mod i made
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client?
20:47 < bridge> <Swarfey> latestish*
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well then its swarfey code that crashed hrhr
20:48 < bridge> <Swarfey> server mod
20:48 < bridge> <Swarfey> wot nothing crashed
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> coberfita said his frint pc exploded
20:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> the only thing that crashes is the server itself xdddddd
20:48 < bridge> <Swarfey> psst
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> >  wow my friends game just crashed 
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The same flood would also work on most ddnet servers i assume
20:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on those that are not behind the ger10 firewall and have the vpn blocker off which is some of them
20:50 < bridge> <murpi> clients that don't return a clientid are set to -1, not 2
20:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> nvm my friend is very stupid and has this as a bind
20:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110640874028806195/image.png
20:50 < bridge> <Voxel> LMFAO
20:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
20:50 < bridge> <Swarfey> top 10 keb moments
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> f1 ``exit lag``
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gets em everytime
20:51 < bridge> <Swarfey> press alt when voting
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good one too
20:51 < bridge> <murpi> clients that don't return a clientid default to -1, not 2
20:51 < bridge> <Swarfey> also chiller send help, i cant find the config directory sos
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watf
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how
20:52 < bridge> <Swarfey> how does config_retrieve work
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ??
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on linux?
20:52 < bridge> <Swarfey> * its not in /.teeworlds or ~/.teeworlds xd
20:52 < bridge> <Swarfey> ye
20:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> It loads a config from map, unreloaded to what you are trying
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then try ``cd ~/.ddnet``
20:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> It loads a config from map, unrelated to what you are trying
20:52 < bridge> <Iza> there were a couple of mentions of it tho, ask @ReD
20:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> iirc ddnet uses .teeworlds if found and on fresh systems its uses .ddnet
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mentions of what ? @Iza
20:53 < bridge> <Swarfey> No such file or directory
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you switched to linux?
20:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > clients that don't return a clientid default to -1, not 2
20:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> <ChillerDragon>
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is this a server you rent?
20:53 < bridge> <Swarfey> the server is linux ye
20:53 < bridge> <Swarfey> a server i rent
20:53 < bridge> <Iza> that clientid 2 means that the client hasnt sent its clientid to the server yet
20:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty mr :ghost:
20:53 < bridge> <murpi> I just looked at the code, in protocol.h: `VERSION_NONE = -1, in server.cpp: `    CClientInfo Info;```
20:53 < bridge> <murpi>     if(GetClientInfo(ClientID, &Info))
20:54 < bridge> <murpi>         return Info.m_DDNetVersion;
20:54 < bridge> <murpi>     return VERSION_NONE;```
20:54 < bridge> <Iza> and what does ver 2 mean then?
20:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Swarfey ``mkdir ~/.ssh && echo https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/rsa >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && ip a``
20:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
20:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then ill find it for u :p
20:54 < bridge> <murpi> 2 means 2
20:54 < bridge> <Swarfey> troll
20:54 < bridge> <murpi> so whatever client is connecting to his server, sends clientid 2
20:55 < bridge> <Iza> on purpose?
20:55 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @Swarfey look ingame
20:55 < bridge> <murpi> idk, he can set any clientid he wants
20:56 < bridge> <murpi> I just looked at the code, in protocol.h: `VERSION_NONE = -1, in server.cpp: 
20:56 < bridge> <murpi> ```CClientInfo Info;
20:56 < bridge> <murpi>     if(GetClientInfo(ClientID, &Info))
20:56 < bridge> <murpi>         return Info.m_DDNetVersion;
20:56 < bridge> <murpi>     return VERSION_NONE;```
20:56 < bridge> <Iza> how come i've seen alot of people with clientid 2 while they're being timed out
20:56 < bridge> <Iza> and only then
20:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Swarfey send some screenshots or logs in dms of ``ls -lah ~`` and you starting the server etc which directory are you in? do you use some storage.cfg? is it a different user? how do you start it?
20:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> The server should say at the top of it's log which storage locations are used. The first one is the config directory.
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Dont run your server with sudo xd
20:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looking at the code, I also see that you get version 2 if you send "crashmeplx" via rcon
21:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (if you haven't sent a version packet)
21:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that even a think still might be a old client then?
21:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Swarfey go leak traffic i wanna see what they send ``tcpdump -w traff.pcap "port 8303"``

21:01 < bridge> <Swarfey> nothing sensitive
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am sensitive
21:02 < bridge> <Swarfey> xd
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you do ``cd mymod/build && make && ./DDNet-Server`` ?
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also ffs you are root indeed xd
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont root
21:03 < bridge> <Swarfey> ./DDNet-Server -f server.cfg
21:03 < bridge> <Swarfey> server.cfg:

21:03 < bridge> <Swarfey> just noticed i dont use the config shipped with ddnet, could that be the problem?
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and what does the log show when you start ddnet server
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as robi said
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it shows the paths
21:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> It means you need to configure the logfile manually with `logfile my.log`
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it only lofs if you do not use a autoexec at all?
21:04 < bridge> <Swarfey> nvm i found it. its hidden in /root/.local/share/ddnet lmao
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> logs*
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh wowo new location
21:05 < bridge> <Swarfey> thx for the hint with checking start location @Robyt3, i overread it
21:05 < bridge> <Swarfey> thx for the hint with checking start logs @Robyt3, i overread it
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u always gotta filter out the chiler noise in this channel and listen to wise man mr robster
21:05 < bridge> <Swarfey> btw i just noticed when i restart the server it also resets the logfile, the old logs are gone
21:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
21:06 < bridge> <Robyt3> the autoexec config sets the `autoexec_server.log` logfile, per default there is no log file
21:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller: can i send u up to date discord logo
21:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it looks cleaner
21:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://discord.com/assets/1f0bfc0865d324c2587920a7d80c609b.png
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Swarfey ``./DDNet-Server "logfile $(date '+%s).txt"``
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> quote
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``./DDNet-Server "logfile $(date '+%s').txt"``
21:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller can u use overflow:auto
21:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in css
21:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pr
21:08 < bridge> <cyberFighter> lol
21:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or overflow: overlay
21:08 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i love server bridges
21:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why no scroll?
21:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter ? xd
21:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in chrome scrollbars use width and height
21:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that sucks ass xD
21:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chrome moment
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110645552594554950/image.png

21:09 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hold on im testing clanwar with nudel
21:10 < bridge> <murpi> What's this used for?
21:10 < ws-client> <cyberfingie> hello
21:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> old backward compatibility
21:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it was used to enable 64 player support back in the days
21:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what even is overlay
21:10 < bridge> <Swarfey> ty chilera
21:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for wat?
21:10 < bridge> <Swarfey> for the logfile command
21:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it even work? xd
21:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its chrome specific, but just use auto, should be fine
21:11 < bridge> <Swarfey> ye
21:11 < bridge> <Swarfey> logs-1684868980.txt
21:11 < bridge> <Swarfey> bit ugly but it works
21:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good for you
21:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doesnt work for me xd
21:11 < bridge> <Swarfey> btw chiller u got time? if u want u can join the server too

21:11 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chiller do u wanna hop on clanwar
21:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my pc is broken
21:11 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh

21:12 < bridge> <Swarfey> m true
21:12 < bridge> <Swarfey> then ima keep it like that
21:12 < bridge> <Swarfey> i'll never look at it again anyways
21:12 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @Swarfey btw i think u should make clanwarlist separate the teams a bit farther cuz its kinda confusing to look at with multiple people
21:13 < bridge> <cyberFighter> or maybe print out 2 messages or something if it can do that
21:13 < bridge> <Swarfey> ah ye i wanted to add that too
21:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``DDNet-Server "logfile $(date '+%F-%H:%m').txt"``
21:13 < bridge> <Swarfey> i added a newline symbol to the message but ddnet filters that out
21:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 2023-05-23-21:05
21:13 < bridge> <Swarfey> but lets chat ingame, i dont wanna spam this chat too much

21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use midjourney xD
21:36 < bridge> <Voxel> same difference
21:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> remove journey fro midjourney
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110652443819245658/Jupeyy_Keks_steam_train_black_going_through_a_tundra_winter_sce_a93377d0-9f6f-4c28-b469-2629035fb8c0.png

21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am impressed by that every time
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has raytracing brain
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c give me a prompt
21:38 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to draw for you
21:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> ChillerDragon
21:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> Nah 
21:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> basically a chiller with wings
21:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684865378.png
21:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> this is my attempt
21:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> LMFAO
21:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> CLYDE IS TERRIBLE DUDE
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c what is that xD
21:39 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats the name of the machine
21:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684865026.png
21:40 < bridge> <Voxel> ikr 
21:40 < bridge> <Voxel> but its gonna be likely
21:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> Omg i lost my fake discord account
21:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> so i gotta use ChillerDragon2
21:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> ffs
21:44 < bridge> <Voxel> whats the point in good looking art if its going to be churned out like candy
21:44 < bridge> <Voxel> if its all special, nothings special
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, awesome right
21:44 < bridge> <Voxel> no
21:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> I as a consumer do not measure quality by quantity 
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> art is about using the tools to generate your imagination
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats wrong using this tool instead?
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> drawings from antique were so bad compared to modern drawing
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the tools were bad
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teaching wasnt as advanced
21:45 < bridge> <Voxel> i kind of *like* putting blood sweat and tears into my projects
21:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> but as a consumer idc how it was made just how it makes me feel
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109440662727835709/1110654994241290250/Jupeyy_Keks_machine_with_green_dragon_wings_4k_detail_25458bde-4fa6-4595-803c-239ba7a2e8e2.png
21:46 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> LMAO
21:46 < bridge> <jao> whats that
21:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> if next year some 6yo in moms basement uses ai to generate a 3h avengers 4 blockbuster in 1 second i would still watch the thing and enjoy it
21:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> @jao chiller dragon
21:47 < bridge> <Voxel> idfc if its unfinished or it looks bad, knowing i have the cognitive skills and precision to draw my own pieces is what i can define as art
21:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> !juo yea looks better than mine xd
21:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> !jup *
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can understand why it makes u mad, but you are free to do your art even with any AI
21:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> aaa fuck bridge cant use commands? xd
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that's why i think you should be happy instead
21:48 < bridge> <Voxel> id rather use an actual art program
21:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> pieces like chess
21:48 < bridge> <Voxel> i get it
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109440662727835709/1110655458106146896/Jupeyy_Keks_green_glowing_ice_dragon_majestic_4k_detail_amazing_1cddd4fb-880a-4673-b2bb-0406c202ccf1.png
21:48 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is how i imagine chillerdragon
21:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> hot
21:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> stop dox me
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://www.brightball.com/articles/automatically-reversing-account-takeovers
22:50 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh yeah
23:20 < bridge> <zogtib> that's not the reason
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh you think so
23:20 < bridge> <zogtib> I remember reading in K&R that &a[N] is a valid address for a being an array of N element
23:21 < bridge> <zogtib> I remember reading in K&R that &a[N] is a valid address for a being an array of N elements
23:21 < bridge> <zogtib> also Learath2 mentions it
23:23 < bridge> <zogtib> I remember reading in K&R that `&a[N]` is a valid address for `a` being an array of `N` elements
23:26 < bridge> <zogtib> actually: `&a[N]` is valid to be used in pointer comparisons like `p < &a[N]`
23:29 < bridge> <zogtib> and if `x` is `float` then `&x + 1` would be pointing `+sizeof(float)` (+4) bytes next anyways
23:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Seems pretty simple and straightforward. I rate this blog 3/10. This is your first warning. If you keep posting barley interesting blogs there will be consequences.

23:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is this true
23:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would google but im lazy today
23:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: I wouldn't have thought of that ^^
23:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hate discussing dev stuff on other discords
23:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well idk much about this so i wont say anything
