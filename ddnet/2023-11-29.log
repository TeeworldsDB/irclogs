01:00 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wow!
01:01 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, truly no reason to support 0.7, the only reason I don't just remove it is because it makes chiller happy
01:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
01:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOL
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove
08:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why u want chiller to be sad :feelsbadman:

09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is sad isnt it
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7515
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> just read this
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> the feature is nice, but i agree with heinrich, no numerical ids, and no reimplementing 0.7 protocol in ddnet please
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should in fact, remove sixup and all 0.7 hacks
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also against this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7500
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> more bloat
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> now this started me a interesting thought
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is driven by prs right, and someone doing a PR unnanounced drives ddnet towards a position, even if unwanted, which is what chiller kinda does with his 0.7 prs, so if i were to make a PR removing the 0.7 code, what would happen?
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a bit unfair, because my pr removing it would be seen as destructive, but we got no way to stop adding 0.7 if we dont want
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can be interesting to make that pr, maybe it will stir some discussion xd
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well, we could do it like other projects. allow other versions of the game.
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This as some pros and cons:
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pro:
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - ppl like Tater can advertise their changes more easy.
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - ppl can decide what they like more
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cons:
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - ppl like Tater would take supoprt and maintaining more serious
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - it might split the community at least partially
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i mean other versions hosted by ddnet.. so basically have a launcher and allow to switch to other versions
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks the truth is, you and me cant decide
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it always feels like its heinrich ultimate word
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would go towards a standalone ddnet
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> no teeworlds support
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> and heinrich gives in a bit from time to time to chiller adding this stuff
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but maybe we can convince him to allow smth like i wrote above
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he always says he wants more openness.. we should also profit from this openness
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> by other versions of the game u mean 0.7?
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or another client
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel ddnet already allows other versions if not bots
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes other clients + servers even
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the end what must fit is the ranks in the data base
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> physics must match or ranks must be split (that's a matter of taste of teh community)
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> my point is, 0.7 support should not be a goal of ddnet/ddnet, it should be done by someone out of tree as a fork
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and we should focus on the core of ddnet
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> adding easier moddability is a nice goal too
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i obviously agree. but that's why i'd say the only real solution to this is split the client. else we always have these discussions.
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean move client and  server to different repos?
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> purely objective we make a game for the majority of the community. and the majority would probably benefit from removing 0.7, and go into a more ddnet controlled version, so we can fix weaknesses of the current game
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes for example. in the end in steam i'd still use a launcher to select which version you want to test
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc just removing 0.7 won't convince anybody...
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in trade cleanup the network stack, make connecting faster. at least partially more ddos proof. whatever advatnages there could be could result in the community to like one way more
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i personally simply cannot imagine there is a huge interest in 0.7
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all 0.7 mods basically also exist in 0.6
10:41 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki but some features like the 0.7 skin system could atleast be ported. I think it's very neat
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not directly the point
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we'll have to support both. 0.6 and 0.7
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that will be a mess
10:42 < bridge> <teero777> yes.
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> KISS
10:43 < bridge> <teero777> 0.7 can join 0.6 servers right? But not the other way around
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i begin to be a @ryozuki üò¨
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, but it also only works like 95%
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there were some bugs, dunno if they fixed
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and always needs 0.7 maps hosted too
10:44 < bridge> <teero777> It should be Allgemeinwissen xd
10:45 < bridge> <teero777> It should be common knowledge xd
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the amount of backends we support is also a problem. that increased complexity too much
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i was young, naive
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont disagree to porting "ideas" from 0.7 to ddnet using the proper ddnet clean protocol, not using sixup hacks or 0.7 shit
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes,  but that will be harder to remove
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should support only vulkan, and maybe opengl 4
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> or 3.3
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> you know dota 2?
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> it removed opengl support
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> you can only use vulkan
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are so based at valve
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's simply because it's annoying to maintain such different APIs
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> opengl users should use a layer or smth
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can understand it
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan to ogl xd
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or vulkan software renderer
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 60fps are enough
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> true, more if ur gpu is trash it cant support vulkan
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would make development much easier üòÑ
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> we limited by: backcompat, 0.7, teeworlds, old hardware, chiller
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> XDDDDDDDD
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and heinrich
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> it would also be easier to support only linux
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats another
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> discussion
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè *
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should also support kernel 6+
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and use modern kernel features
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and default compile using x86_64_v3
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's something where i could imagine learath having fun with even xdd
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179360020136198154/image.png?ex=65797f9c&is=65670a9c&hm=5dfc52e6ce45588aea8903dd2baf2cdb8c50de96bfe46c80a451079bb5287154&
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from you i expect nothing less than a nasm version that does not use any libc calls
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> libc is bloat
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i believe libc could be more efficient if not limited by backcompat too
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway what we need is a good stable syscall interface
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> not defined by C
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> kernels define their functionality with syscalls but they dont make em stable, only linux
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> they provide a stable interface through unholy C
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep. IMHO we could easily write emulators for old software to be compatible.
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't really like this aggressive backward compability thinking.
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can understand that a kernel should not change every other month.
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but after 30 years. stuff simply changes
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if the emulated software looses 15% pref, that would be negated by CPU hardware improvements
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think a kernel could update its functionality by providing a kind of translation layer for some updates
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> giving time to update to ppl
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then remove the layer
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and so on
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> or deprecation notices
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently linux did that very rarely even
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks the system V call convention is also not the most optimal nowadays iirc
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> System V AMD64 ABI
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what that is
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CPU feature?
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its how u make function calls at assembly level
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> how it expects the arguments
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> and return values
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> and stack
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok, for 64-bit i assume then?
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> in x32 it used the stack cuz not many registers
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> in x64 it passes some parameters with registers
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, i only know 32-bit  intel syntax
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never worked with 64-bit asm
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust itself
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt follow system v for calls between rust methos
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is why u need extern "C"
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85641
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> when interfacing with C
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i take that 1% more perf üòé
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> more here
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> > One calling sequence, defined by Microsoft, is used on Windows; the other calling sequence, specified in the AMD64 System V ABI, is used by Unix-like systems and, with some changes, by OpenVMS. As x86-64 has more general-purpose registers than does 16-bit x86, both conventions pass some arguments in registers.
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://llvmweekly.org/issue/517
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> my blog post is on the llvm weekly
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice even with your real name as notice xd
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> well my web has the real name
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> mornin fellas
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> what time is it
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u sleep
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> No
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i have to do the flip flop
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> woke up at 5 pm
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u doing
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice, got into a llvm newsletter
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i bought the cosmic crisp apples
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> these ones even look pretty shitty and a little brown like they've been sitting for a while
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but they still taste better than all other kinds of apple
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but they are expensive
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not fan of apples
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> like $5.50 for 3 lbs
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> they are a good snack
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> if the alternative is something shitty that will leave u feeling shitty
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess i just dont snack
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> weird
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont eat meals like i should
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i eat quite conscious
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> that would require a routine past get up -> go to computer -> get brothers from school -> go to computer -> take dog out -> go to sleep
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes i eat nuts with whipped cheese, the one thats 0%
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> whipped cheese
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if its nuts
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> like cream cheese ? or wat
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> whipped cheese = queso batido?
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk the word
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> what's batido
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> it just got proteins
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and no fat
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> batido is like steered?
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179381595543699486/00118395000047____3__325x325.png?ex=657993b4&is=65671eb4&hm=675245463cc6a2a69fc0b69b2b1b2d3946b7fe9778fec106da6a79f340880ef1&
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> literally this
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> + nuts
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> does it taste like cheese
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> nuts have the healthy type of fat
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye, but its almost neutral flavour
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it sounds like a regional delicacy
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> as in it doesnt taste much
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i am imagining cheese yogurt
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the nuts give it enough taste  for me to be edible
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like yogurt yes
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not quite
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> lol i see
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i like nuts
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> but they are very expensive
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> are american nuts as healthy tho
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> in spain its rly common
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> are they not the same nuts...
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179382134327218227/142278_00_1.png?ex=65799434&is=65671f34&hm=9db618cb6233eead9d3d776d4c48c9ec05e97eb32c9872ab7376de571bebaf71&
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> walnuts
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3.7‚Ç¨
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> according to google
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> you put the least flavorful nut in your whipped cheese
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> 30g
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> 350g
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> the most healthy
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not by a wide margin
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> though i like walnuts
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i like a mixed nuts more tho
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> almonds cashews walnuts
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe peanuts but not usually. i dont like peanuts themselves
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> they taste chalky
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like walnuts at this point
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> also the cheese fills you easy
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a high protien food
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> gotta get the muscle
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> the most sustaining macro nutrient
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> each protien is like 9 calories or something
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> based on my recollection of freshman year biology
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not necessarily about muscle
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk yeah
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> its for sure more healthy than having pizza
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> for breakfast
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i read this today on a whatsapp group
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yes you need lots of protien to build muscle but you need to eat lots of protein even in a deficit or when trying to stay the same bcs otherwise you just lose muscle
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> also why it's counterproductive to eat empty carbs/sugars and fats, and expect to keep muscle while gaining weight
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> bulking as u might call it
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta balance your diet .....
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why u want high protein low calorie
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> im no expert
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on what your goal is
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> based on my understanding
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> high protien low calorie = lose fat, sustain and build muscle
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> high protien high calorie = gain weight, sustain and build muscle
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just think it would be hard to do on merica
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> or more expensive
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> they give u giant sized portions
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> they use bad oil
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> corn and seed oils are by far the most popular
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> or butter
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> don't knock butter it's awesome in moderation
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> unlike shitty seed oils which serve no purpose other than to be cheaper than a good oil like avocado or olive or whatever
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only buy good oil
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> luckily i live in the country that exports the best oil
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> same but there is no guarantee for other things we buy at the store
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use extra virgin olive oil
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> they are usually made with Shittiest oil
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> us too
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well i try to not use too much
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> non stick pans best
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> no way
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as you're gentle to them they are fine
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> a well seasoned cast iron or stainless steal skillet will let u use the same amount of oil + have the same nonstick properties as a teflon pan
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they are just harder to maintain
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> u sound like a expert
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they have superior heat retention
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> so ur food heats more evenly
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just have my pan ok
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got it for 30‚Ç¨ i think
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> also much safer to ingest a flake of polymerized food oil than a flake of teflon once your coating goes bad

12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i own many pans
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> prob 45lbs of cast iron in my cabinets
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> give some
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> they so expensive
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i only got 2
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> not hard to find at second hand stores but expect to do some restoration
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> we got some caraway pans a few months ago which are nonstick but they are also not teflon
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> better for the environment and safer to ingest
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> good in a pinch
12:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> started recently living alone tho i guess thats why
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i will have to get rid of a lot of my possessions when i move out
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> trying to make a windirstat ish app

12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> ms fluent guidelines rly do make it hard to make space-efficient UIs
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the original app has tables with a bunch of columns that are all totally visible at a reasonable size
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179388197302706186/image.png?ex=657999da&is=656724da&hm=e1a8b5e3a684dc821446fe3e8b62dc95260650c340101d1753285d7efc2d4cab&
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but if i busted out a table that complied with the fluent guidelines i would just get 2 chars per column and then ... xd
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> imagine using windows
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> make it with gtk

12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> this just the windows frontend
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i have 8tb across all disks
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> windirstat reading is weird
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they are ssd?
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> or m2
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> 3 m.2 which total 1.5TB
12:52 < bridge> <Ewan> then i have 2.5 tb of sata ssd
12:52 < bridge> <Ewan> 4tb hdd
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 2.5tb m2
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> and 2tb ssd
12:53 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
12:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i lied
12:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i have 2.5tb in m.2 and 1.5 in sata ssd

14:24 < bridge> <Ewan> like i said this is just the windows frontend

15:09 < bridge> <teero777> managing ddnet spaghetti code is hard i know but....
15:09 < bridge> <teero777> XD
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> today im playing with gdb at work
15:11 < bridge> <teero777> you mean gdb will play with you
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> finding a bug in a shared library made with mlir

15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> gdb with gef is niceee
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> never heard of gef until now
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> looks nice
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i heard about it from heinrich
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use it daily
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft ur a audio pro
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got my 100‚Ç¨ bose speakers but
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel i can get more quality
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u recommend some good
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> good bass, and maybe good with music that sounds like synthwave? xd
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> up to 200‚Ç¨
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> > You should always try to control the volume at the last part of the chain, which in this case, would be your speakers. Set the DAC and computer volume to max. If your speakers can't handle it(some speakers can't handle high input), then turn down the DAC volume a little bit.
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i havent been doing this
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> well ppl don‚Äôt often make quality oriented computer speakers that aren‚Äôt monitors
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> you can get some bookshelf speakers and they will sound good but you‚Äôll probably have to wire it up
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft i have a dac/amp fiio
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> also if your room is very small or you are close to the speakers then that will suck
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the speakers i have are active
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> so they also have a internal amp
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> should i get passive speakers?
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on what your amp can do
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> the room with pc is not small
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a bit close to the speakers i think
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i wouldn‚Äôt go much bigger
16:02 < bridge> <Ewan> do you want accurate audio or a ‚Äòfun‚Äô listening profile
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if accurate means good
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> changing the dac to full and adjusting volume at the speaker seems better now
16:02 < breton> KEF Q150 and a subwoofer
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also put the speakers a bit further
16:03 < bridge> <Ewan> Q150 expensive
16:04 < bridge> <Ewan> also concerned bookshelf speakers will provide a bad experience if he is rly close to them
16:04 < breton> or Q100
16:05 < bridge> <Ewan> firstly what outputs does ur amp have
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> fiio k3
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

16:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ewan u gotta put a computer image in there so this doesnt get deleted
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> uhhh
16:23 < bridge> <Ewan> flpflpflpf
16:24 < bridge> <coke1465> isn't it better to get a soundsystem with a built in power amplifier?
16:24 < bridge> <Ewan> no
16:24 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe for a tv or something
16:24 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo ur amp doesn't have any kind of raw out
16:24 < bridge> <coke1465> there are rly good cheap ones
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i suppose you could split your line out but idk most of what you'd want would take RCA, 1/4 or raw speaker wire
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> you could check out some monitors
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> with smaller drivers if you're close to it and the room is small/medium
16:26 < bridge> <Ewan> presonus eris 3.5-5.25 (the number is the diameter of the driver in inches)
16:26 < bridge> <Ewan> that would be about your budget
16:28 < bridge> <Ewan> you ought to look up a review since i dont buy new audio equipment
16:29 < bridge> <Ewan> im also not sure your amp would power any passive speakers
16:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it‚Äôs a headphone amp
16:30 < bridge> <Ewan> good news is most monitors are active
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do u meantion split
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> mi fiio has 2 outputs
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> the one at front, for headset
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> the line out at back
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> for my speakers
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> or does a passive speaker needs 2 inputs?
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> wat
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> im confused
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk most of what u said xd
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is raw out
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do i need it
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> speaker wire output for hooking up speakers that don't have other connectors
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> which is most
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it can look a bunch of different ways
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have my speakers on the line out at back
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it looks like a jack
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> small i think
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it is 3.5mm jack
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> just a headphone jack
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> its bad right
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> that will not power active speakers
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but my bose speakers got a amp im sure
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> that will not power passive speakers
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> xdd
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can adjust volume there
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are powered to current
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> too
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but i thought u were trying to get new speakers
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> which usually aren't powered
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, if they are better tho
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> they rely on the amp/receiver to power them
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> unless they are monitors which are designed to be used at a computer
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> which expect to be hooked up to an audio interface but the dac you have will work just as well
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like following unix philosphy with this
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> just need an adapter
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its standalone its usually better
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1 thing but good
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> monitor with speakers doesnt sound like that
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on use case
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> sry by monitor i mean
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> studio monitors
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> they are speakers that aim to produce accurate sound for producers/engineers and purists
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> not like ur screen xd
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a consumer
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> basically look up some reviews
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> a reddit thread or something for ppl in ur situation
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually turning the dac to max and controllign volume on speaker kinda sounds better
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> good
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had the dac near min xd
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u put my speakers at max i will blow off the neighbour ear
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yea u should take all the steps u can to make sure ur own sound is still good
16:39 < bridge> <Ewan> what sample rate does ur pipewire run at
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was at 48khz but i changed it now to 
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki>     default.clock.rate          = 192000
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki>     default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 192000 96000 48000 44100 ]
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to restart
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> brb
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> wait
16:40 < bridge> <Ewan> 192 is tryhard sample rate
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> what should i use
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 96?
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> sample rates higher than 48k are really only good for audio analysis that like, isn't done by your ears
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> before both options only had 48000
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> so what do i put
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> depends
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179447087620956201/image.png?ex=6579d0b2&is=65675bb2&hm=0ac6a4f86ea1b192e45f29b6effeb35a91413d940bfeb971e59e4931ac2d2dcd&
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> 48?
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> anything other than 48k or 44.1k will require resampling which is an inherently inaccurate process and can produce artifacts in itself. you can choose your resampler to remedy this but you should probably only have a high sample rate if you listen to music which is distributed at this rate
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> like listening to a 44.1 cd rip or youtube video or something on a 96k system will just stretch those 44.1 thousand samples and interpolate the rest the best it can
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it will not be as good as listening to a recording with 96 thousand samples per second. which is rare to find
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> so unless u have like lossless rips or something then i would stick with 48
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> but allowed rates means if a source has that rate it will use it?
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> and not resample?
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yea let it do whatever it wants there
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> so default is for what then
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> all that should matter is the one that your audio system actually runs at
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> default should be 48 imo
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> pro audio is actually a huge scam
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1179447561279516743/image.png?ex=6579d123&is=65675c23&hm=280cc5b198f1a0cc90cbd442bae5eaecf5af88105e04fb178852bfb1642bc9d5&
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> so this is good
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is quantum
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> listening quality gains are usually not found on the software side
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea what quantum is
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u suggest other values than default
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> idk i spent weeks ricing out my pulseaudio configs and then it all fell out of my head
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> its related to buffering and latency
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> turn it down then
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> if u want lower latency

16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't matter much 1024 seems high by default
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> if u have a good cpu then u can probably turn it down to 256 or lower... below that you will see minimal gains but probably popping from buffer underruns
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> depending on how high ur cpu utilization is
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont do any latency sensitive task
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill leave it as is xd
16:49 < bridge> <Ewan> smart
16:49 < bridge> <Ewan> defaults are usually good
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> not in linux kernel
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux kernel uses defaults for ancient computers
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had to raise my ulimits for sane stuff
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> they are most well rounded for the industry

17:08 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
17:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> > "We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem," he said. "If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's s

17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> still, steam service as a whole is more than owning a game
17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> friends, library, proton, etc
17:38 < bridge> <louis> most people pirate for pricing reasons in my experience lmao
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @louis.place look at it like this
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> netflix is a service
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also pirate movies
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> there will always be ppl who pirate
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it provides a comfortable service for the generic population
17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> most end up getting netflix
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> xbox game pass is so popular cuz this too
17:40 < bridge> <louis> that's still a pricing issue and i don't think that relates to ur quote
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not a pricing issue
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can pirate the series, but u choose the comfort of having it at 1 click
17:41 < bridge> <louis> not if i'm broke
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur broke u wouldnt buy it anyways
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur not the target
17:41 < bridge> <louis> if im broke i'd pirate it correct
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> there will always be pirates
17:41 < bridge> <louis> if i rly wanted to watch it
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> the point is putting stuff anti piracy is bad
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> because real customers will have worse experience
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> u make those customers with money thinking about it convinced with a good service
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> spotify
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> pirating music will never be as easy as using spotify
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> this is why i have over 3 months of listening this year
17:42 < bridge> <louis> i mean i agree with that
17:43 < bridge> <louis> i think urq uote has nothing to do with that though
17:43 < bridge> <louis> he makes it seem like the issue of piracy is with region locks or unavailability of products which is just not true most of the time
17:45 < bridge> <louis> true but i'd say thats different
17:45 < bridge> <louis> caues spotify can be a free service too and i'm pretty sure u can block ads anyways

18:08 < bridge> <teero777> Spotify
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> Uses
18:08 < bridge> <Ewan> Spotify is not electron
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> Electron
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> It is
18:08 < bridge> <Ewan> It isn‚Äôt
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> It is
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> It quite literally is not
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it use >100MB ram?
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's electron
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> No
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs CEF
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> and the devs have brains
18:09 < bridge> <teero777> Chromium

18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's web based
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and web based is always JS runtime

18:18 < bridge> <teero777> Ddr5?
18:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> u use a new cpu bro
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc ur ram is expensive
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> its also 5600mhz
18:18 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
18:18 < bridge> <Ewan> naw it's 6000 üòÉ

18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> that's just the clock
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u talking about urs or mine
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> mi ne
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> The Crock
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur cpu supports  6000mhz then be it
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> well yea
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> just saying they call it an overclock
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> even tho it applies the expo preset by default
18:20 < bridge> <yekrm> In my first oc I burned my cpu

18:25 < bridge> <teero777> troll
18:25 < bridge> <yekrm> :owo:
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @yekrm so how much RAM do you actually have
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
18:26 < bridge> <yekrm> 8
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and your GPU?
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how much VRAM
18:26 < bridge> <yekrm> 4
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also have double the RAM than VRAM
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 32 vs 16
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
18:30 < bridge> <yekrm> But now I will reinstall windows, I modified the system so much that it became unstable
18:30 < bridge> <yekrm> :waaaa_pb:
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> Linux ftw
18:31 < bridge> <yekrm> Doesn't run some programs
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> what do you need?
18:31 < bridge> <yekrm> Raidrive
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's all?
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet there are 1000000 alternatives to that xd
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> https://rclone.org/
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> first one i found
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> opensource and free
18:33 < bridge> <yekrm> Doesn't work well with emby
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> raidrive is just an FTP client no?
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then don't use emby üò¨
18:34 < bridge> <yekrm> SFTP and mount a directory as local
18:34 < bridge> <teero777> i hope you dont have emby on a windows server :justatest:
18:35 < bridge> <yekrm> In windows emby doesn't use resources because it's direct transmission

18:37 < bridge> <teero777> all excuses:kek:
18:37 < bridge> <yekrm> In linux makes conversion of multimedia = cpu 100%

18:38 < bridge> <teero777> huh?
18:38 < bridge> <yekrm> Transcoding
18:39 < bridge> <teero777> what gpu do you have?
18:40 < bridge> <yekrm> RX 5500 XT
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need vaapi drivers
19:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i read that as enby and almost smiled
19:15 < bridge> <Ewan> why would it make you smile
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> today was the day where using 0xbeef as a value helped me debug

19:23 < bridge> <yekrm> :nobyisthebiggesttroll:
19:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.7 can join ddnet servers that have the bridge active. But only because ddnet added support for that
19:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs not about interest. It‚Äôs avoiding the hard fork and uniting the playerbase again
19:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .\_.
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is no playerbase to unite
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0.7 is chiller itself
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> also we shouldnt avoid a hard fork
19:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I play 0.6
19:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should have clean ddnet, and if others want clean 0.7ddnetorwhathever
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> more reason u give xd
19:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I wanna play ctf with the squad
19:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Vanilla squad
19:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Using ddnet client
19:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not mouse bugged vanilla client

20:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.7 is no bloat when 0.6 is removed
20:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich does not want to remove 0.6 to keep back compat
20:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ryo and jopsti want to break back compat to cleanup protocol
20:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But let‚Äôs be real neither ryo nor jopsti are working on ddnet so who would even break the protocol by actually implementing the changes. And what changes even?
20:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think if we break back compat we would be able to have more flexibility with features
20:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like what
20:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What‚Äôs limiting right now?
20:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> well for one the killfeed code is mega jank
20:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> we could very easily squish it if we didnt need to have 0.7 packets
20:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is it?
20:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs not a matter of breaking 0.6 compat that‚Äôs a matter of adding 0.7
20:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Show me mega jank code and how clean it could be?
20:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im sure it would also be clean if we didn‚Äôt need to have 0.6 packets and only had 0.7

21:33 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :poggers2: :Poggers: :pepesmash:
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no idea wtf that is but: epic
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> dude
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should read TWIR
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> every week
21:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the oficial newsletter
21:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> of rust
21:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> look the repo group
21:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust-lanh
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can there be news if all good features stay in nightly

21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks its one of my sources
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> for links i share here
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> and for ffr
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was about to say: which is tomorrow, but then i realized it's only the day after tomorrow :/
22:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im back
22:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> anyways what im saying is do we REALLY need 3 packets for the killfeed? like the only reason why i added one (and furo added one) is that we cant touch the og killfeed code
22:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or else that breaks back compat
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> voxel4president
22:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> id be a shit president
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you are in the average
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's already a skill if you are not a very shit president
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:33 < bridge> <learath2> I'm fairly sure 0.7 is chiller and his 15 bots
23:34 < bridge> <learath2> I'm confused, why would we only use the packets of a dead fork that breaks half our mod by moving stuff out of the snap? Elaborate
