00:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn rip ddnet.tw
00:34 < bridge> <totar> rip
00:34 < bridge> <totar> it still redirects to ddnet.org currently?
00:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
00:35 < bridge> <louis> what happened 😭
00:35 < bridge> <louis> how did it get botched
00:36 < bridge> <peter0x44> Is it not possible to just edit the strings in the binaries for the domain?
00:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not trivially
00:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because the new domain is one character longer
00:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> The new registrar claimed that the transfer is succeeding for weeks, but it was actually failing because they were missing documents which they didn't request.
00:37 < bridge> <chairn> > Status
00:37 < bridge> <chairn> > clientTransferProhibited
00:37 < bridge> <chairn> that sounds like a lie
00:37 < bridge> <louis> who grabbed the domain? or is that secret info
00:37 < bridge> <chairn> or maybe it failed because it really was prohibited ?

00:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> rip
00:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> older clients should be disallowed on ddnet servers immediately

00:46 < bridge> <chairn> french tech always living up to the expectations

00:56 < bridge> <chairn> Strasbourg data center i guess
00:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> @learath2 now if i wanted to use an old client for whatever sakes reason, i cannot do that without spoofing the clientId now?
00:56 < bridge> <chairn> burnt few years ago
00:56 < bridge> <reitw> yea where Bombay server is currently located at
00:56 < bridge> <reitw> when I was :KekStressed: cuz I didn't have any db backup so I was hoping the server didn't turn into a barbecue
00:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can talk about solutions to that in the next couple of days, for now, no. and perhaps don't try to do it for these couple of days
00:57 < bridge> <alw5> never trust ovh
00:58 < bridge> <alw5> if u get ddosed they will just give up
00:58 < bridge> <avolicious> We had our main database there too

01:02 < bridge> <totar> it should be possible to recompile old binaries with the new url right?
01:03 < bridge> <syrinok> He's scottish

01:04 < bridge> <murpi> More like <5% of the community
01:04 < bridge> <avolicious> Why? Most people are using latest versions anways. It should be quite normal to update software regularly. Not just for the sake of features, but also security
01:04 < bridge> <reitw> @heinrich5991 You did try to contact ovh's support after the transfer failed ?
01:04 < bridge> <alw5> true
01:04 < bridge> <syrinok> Getting mad about the sitting animation is funny
01:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, they were useless **and** demanded and got money for it AFAIK
01:06 < bridge> <learath2> If we were making millions off of this, I'm fairly certain there would be an angle where we could sue OVH for this
01:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> For starters I couldn't log into their support site, phone support was not available because I don't pay enough. At some point they admitted that the transfer had already failed (it was still shown as succeeding in their UI) and they refunded me the money, but nothing they can do about the lost domain.
01:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> (email support not possible either)
01:07 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, you would legally go against the registrar to give you the domain back 😄 And then sue OVH for a possible revenue loss
01:07 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, OVH support is crap
01:07 < bridge> <avolicious> They still send me e-mails everyday about possible hacked servers, where a stupid kid just runs spoofed dns queries against
01:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> The original registrar was not at fault, I let the domain expire because I initiated the transfer 2 months earlier.
01:07 < bridge> <learath2> Since we don't make any money, the registrar is probably registered in the cayman islands or some shit, and twnic is in taiwan. It's safe to say we aren't getting jack shit 😄
01:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> And twnic doesn't care since we have no trademark in taiwan etc.
01:08 < bridge> <avolicious> All registrars have to follow ICANN policies
01:08 < bridge> <avolicious> But yes, we are too small
01:08 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure they have to reply within 5 to 365 days after being notified by pidgeon mail on the filing of a court case with the international criminal court
01:09 < bridge> <viperatra> trying newest version now, still getting stutters :(
01:09 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, no. ICANN is pretty strict about domain hijacking. The problem is local law
01:09 < bridge> <reitw> damn rip :/
01:09 < bridge> <totar> which graphics backend are you using? Vulkan?
01:10 < bridge> <viperatra> how do i check
01:10 < bridge> <totar> in graphics settings
01:10 < bridge> <totar> you can just screenshot
01:10 < bridge> <viperatra> yeah defualt
01:10 < bridge> <viperatra> vulkan 1.1.0
01:10 < bridge> <totar> can you try with opengl
01:10 < bridge> <totar> whatever the highest version is
01:12 < bridge> <avolicious> Anyways, it happend and we now have to deal with this situation. Sadly there are a lot of bad actors that still try to destroy this game out of pure joy.
01:12 < bridge> <viperatra> seems less so far but i'd have to play for a while to make sure
01:12 < bridge> <totar> did you use vulkan as well in your 16.1 version?
01:13 < bridge> <avolicious> Thanks for the fix & communication @heinrich5991 & @learath2 !
01:13 < bridge> <viperatra> yeah if it's default
01:13 < bridge> <learath2> A bit of a shame that it ended this way. I wished we could take the domain back
01:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Maybe at one day, but I am glad that they havent taken over ddnet.org
01:14 < bridge> <avolicious> That would be a mess now
01:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
01:14 < bridge> <avolicious> No backup master servers or anything on an alt-domain 😄
01:17 < bridge> <viperatra> what's the time that this happened? and could it have affected users without them knowing? what can people do to check?
01:24 < bridge> <learath2> The domain was lost a month or so ago. It has just redirected to ddnet.org for the longest time, until about a week ago when the certificate expired. During that period there was no malicious activity with the domain. Currently it redirects some of our services to their own replacements which should only allow them to show you weird skins or maps.
01:24 < bridge> <learath2> 
01:24 < bridge> <learath2> The update server has been dead for a long while for these versions and the person who got the domain didn't revive it. So I'd say there really is no risk
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> of having been infected so far.
01:26 < bridge> <cur.ie> As a registrar, having dealt with stolen domains etc.. it's not fun.
01:28 < bridge> <viperatra> thanks for the detailed reply :)
01:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> can i ask what services
01:53 < bridge> <learath2> `maps.ddnet.tw` and `skins.ddnet.tw`
01:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ah
01:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ddnet.tw/skins doesnt, lmao
01:54 < bridge> <teero777> He's gonna make them download 8k skins
01:55 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> no its just
01:55 < bridge> <teero777> Or the entire Shrek movie in pngs
01:55 < bridge> <learath2> I'm expecting all the tees to turn into nazi flags
01:55 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Nah i doubt
01:55 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think he just puts random shit that got declined from submissions
01:56 < bridge> <teero777> is there any info on who it is?
01:56 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> sp someone
01:56 < bridge> <teero777> nah xd
01:56 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> it is
01:56 < bridge> <teero777> really?
01:56 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> yes
01:56 < bridge> <teero777> How do you know?
01:56 < bridge> <teero777> cyberfighter is not a trustworthy source
01:56 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> cuz his discord server has smth going on with that skin database
01:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> and its a sp someone thing to do
01:58 < bridge> <louis> ddnet.tw ip is now same as tee.world ip
01:58 < bridge> <louis> which was owned by sp someone
01:58 < bridge> <louis> + whois points to scotland which matches up

08:55 < bridge> <bomab> i dont know
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it works for me 
08:56 < bridge> <bomab> ok then its just that he didnt notice your pr
08:56 < bridge> <bomab> probably
08:59 < bridge> <bomab> crisis averted 🤯
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is a opportunity to drop backwards compatiblity support for any pre 16.4 client
09:53 < bridge> <bomab> indeed
10:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Too bad there is no redirect to other IPs feature in yet -.-
10:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes let’s give it some time and see how people hack handle it. So far the outrage is huge. But if everyone manages to update we could actually drop the old stuff. Looking at you 0.6 protocol hehe
10:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes let’s give it some time and see how people can handle it. So far the outrage is huge. But if everyone manages to update we could actually drop the old stuff. Looking at you 0.6 protocol hehe
10:03 < bridge> <totar> Seems less huge than expected tbh
10:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s still early. Let’s wait a bit. At least in my bubble I got two ppl complaining on matrix.

14:33 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> idk wat u do
14:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's `CVariableInt::Pack` function
14:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> hee some test cases if you need some: https://github.com/teeworlds-go/varint/blob/master/varint_test.go
14:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> here some test cases if you need some: https://github.com/teeworlds-go/varint/blob/master/varint_test.go
14:56 < bridge> <ppopcat8151> Where a write a code on ddnet map?
15:18 < bridge> <remakepower> I met a problem
15:19 < bridge> <remakepower> I create a Teeworlds Client AI, it can talk with others, and play InfClass mod.
15:19 < bridge> <zhn> but im hosting his servers smh
15:19 < bridge> <remakepower> But when i let her join a DDNet server
15:19 < bridge> <remakepower> Server says "This version of the client is compromised..."
15:20 < bridge> <0xdeen> Is the client based on an old DDNet client version?
15:20 < bridge> <remakepower> I just use a chat only client by headshot as base
15:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> your client is too old
15:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> @headshotnoby Can you update that base?
15:21 < bridge> <remakepower> He is working on a PVZ project
15:22 < bridge> <remakepower> I have seen some days ago
15:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/1287179183205781575
15:23 < bridge> <remakepower> @0xdeen in fact, this chat only client doesn't send any things of ddnet version
15:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> it probably does when connecting to the server
15:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe a 0
15:24 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm... I think this problem is because the client (modified by me) send rcon command "crashmeplx".
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> nah it does
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> if ur using swarfey's framework ig it does send 14xxx
15:25 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> or whatever
15:25 < bridge> <remakepower> I see that also
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> thats why swarfeys discord bridge died
15:26 < bridge> <zhn> @swarfey btw
15:26 < bridge> <zhn> ah wait
15:26 < bridge> <zhn> im nobo
15:26 < bridge> <zhn> maybe its not xd
15:27 < bridge> <swarfey> xd
15:27 < bridge> <swarfey> its sending 16.something i think
15:33 < bridge> <remakepower> May we should not seen "crashmeplx" client as VERSION_DDNET_OLD
15:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> Do you see that in the official ddnet server code?
15:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9007
15:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> that is the pr for kicking compromised clients
15:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> or banning
15:41 < bridge> <remakepower> Yea i see it
15:42 < bridge> <remakepower> But my code is 100% safe, because it's not download anything from ddnet.tw
15:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Also it get banned just because server seen "crashmeplx" as DDNET_OLD
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower just send a new client version then
15:47 < bridge> <remakepower> I will try
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> should be super straightforward idk how your codebase looks like is it open source ? @remakepower 
15:49 < bridge> <remakepower> do you mean chat only client?
15:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean your project you have problems with
15:50 < bridge> <remakepower> No
15:50 < bridge> <remakepower> It's not open source
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is it based on?
15:51 < bridge> <remakepower> The network part with Teeworlds based on Headshot2017's chat only client
15:51 < bridge> <remakepower> But i modify it a lot
15:51 < bridge> <remakepower> (On snapshot)
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/headshot2017/tw-chatonly/blob/91827291e0f56ef48bf77d2d9c88cf394c34fb8d/src/client.cpp#L433
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here is the version
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> put ``16040`` there
15:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm that doesnt work @remakepower xd
15:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh, i remove it in my version
15:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Thanks
15:57 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm.
15:57 < bridge> <remakepower> Client is kicked before we send this msg
15:58 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> Hi guys, who can say, how to do my own fng server?
15:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> "A minimal DDNet 9.3.1 client in a command-line."
15:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zxc_pidoras2015 do you know how to compile the code?
15:58 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> No(
15:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zxc_pidoras2015 what do you want the fng server for?
15:59 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah
15:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower ye my suggestion was wrong. Thats the legacy ddnet version. You need to either claim to be a vanilla 0.6 client or send the new uuid ddnet version
15:59 < bridge> <remakepower> I try to be a vanilla client
15:59 < bridge> <remakepower> still kicked
16:00 < bridge> <remakepower> maybe problem in network.cpp
16:00 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> For me and my friends
16:00 < bridge> <remakepower> it's ddrace version
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower yea im too tired now i go rq xd sorry i thought it was just a version bump this seems to need further debugging
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zxc_pidoras2015 you want to host it on your machine? windows? do you know how to open your ports?
16:01 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh okay
16:01 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> Yes
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are looking for a fng_server.exe?
16:02 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> Yea, i have windows, about ports i can see at internet
16:02 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> I think yes
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> try with a ddnet server first i can organise you a fng_server.exe in the meantime xd
16:03 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> Thanks bro)
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> There is nothing about `crashmeplx` in there. Currently the only workaround is sending a version recent enough
16:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i can connect with vanilla 0.6
16:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client he is using has no ddnet uuid messages yet so its only sending the legacy is ddnet message 
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> @murpi just overwrite the old url, the ban message is hardcoded
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Are you sure? Maybe the server you are connecting to hasn't restarted yet?
16:12 < bridge> <0xdeen> I think vanilla client sends no version at all
16:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 same server i get kicked from with ddnet
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah just tested it, vanilla 0.6 does get banned
16:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> WTF?
16:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what client did i test with? xd
16:12 < bridge> <_nrx> Maybe u check 2 diff clients
16:12 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9013 this should fix it ^
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gimme a server ip
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ill connect with 0.6 xd

16:15 < bridge> <learath2> Wtf
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> What client did I test
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.6 always worked
16:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we need a canijointwserver.io service xd
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> How does it even get past the `m_GotDDNetVersionPacket` check even?
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i didnt investigate i just tested
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> Does vanilla 0.6 not send `NETMSG_INFO`?
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> That's absurd, it can't join without that
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> 😄
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zxc_pidoras2015 https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/ddnet-windows-latest.zip here you go this says DDNet-Server.exe but in rcon you can do ``sv_gametype fng;reload`` then you have fng
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> have fun
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and enjoy bitcoin miner axaxax
16:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> servers magically restarting in the background
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> So something is marking `m_GotDDNetVersionPacket` for vanilla clients?
16:17 < bridge> <zhn> why don't u enable github actions chiller
16:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> adding deen's prs?
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where @zhn ?
16:17 < bridge> <zhn> on ddnet insta
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have?
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wdym
16:17 < bridge> <zhn> why zillyhuhn url then
16:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> where the releases
16:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> tag a friggin version bruh
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn a person who cant compile probably also has no github account xd
16:18 < bridge> <zhn> u dont need to have gh account in order to download artifact
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he needs FNG NOW @jxsl13 i will do a release after the gctf tournament finished
16:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> release beta version
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn last  time i checked that was the case
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when did that change @zhn ?
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 beta is on zillyhuhn.com/tmp xd
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> Guess this is not needed, vanilla 0.6 somehow magically gets past that check
16:19 < bridge> <zhn> never
16:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> you don't need a gh account tondownload artifacts, never needed one
16:19 < bridge> <zhn> because u always could download artifact with no gh account
16:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not a bug its a feature @learath2 
16:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> *takes ci/cd guru badge away from chiller*

16:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727014821.png
16:20 < bridge> <learath2> A very curious feature. I should investigate it, sounds like a bug in the code
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's a different url or am I blind?
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> lol
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> yeah seems no artifacts to download with no gh account
16:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @reitw bombay 0.6 works
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> but releases
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> chiller is right
16:21 < bridge> <_nrx> So we gonna wait... half of the year?
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> lol
16:21 < bridge> <zhn> still no reason to not have releases though
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have to download and upload it manually
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i only do that on certain milestones takes me quite some time
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> *kicks in chillers door, tags a new release*
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i recommend building from source if you need something new
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or get a github account xd
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> which milestones?
16:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> is there one already D:?
16:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for ddnet-insta so far it has been tournaments xd
16:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is the most random release cycle xd
16:23 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-releases

16:32 < bridge> <zxc_pidoras2015> Thank you so much bro
16:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur welcome bro
16:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> see he likes the zillyhuhn.com exe xd
16:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'd like to host stable versions
16:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see yes you can do that after the tournament i will do a stable release
16:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then you can stable away debian style for 2 years in that version xd
16:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe Inwill just stop hosting ._.
16:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> I will
16:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :c because of missing releases? xd
16:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably
16:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> interesteting. Yea feel free to ping me for a new release if i even continue working on it. After the next release became old.
16:39 < bridge> <zhn> but tournament will end in... Wednesday, February 12, 2025, eh?
16:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i assume ddnet with all of its custom anti spoof and what not confuses the poor little 0.6 client so hard that it never really understood how it ended up being in game xd
16:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then it forgets to send its info xd
16:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :p @zhn 
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> but then it can't get to the next state 😄
16:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea idk im going to bed ping me when you figured it out i wanna know
16:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> For me it would be enough to get some info about: there some new feature in gctf that is worth an update.
16:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> I can build it myself but I cannot look through all of your commits which might be unrelated to gctf and check if there is stuff for gctf in there
16:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the next big thing are stats i dont think after that there will be much
16:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i started the commiting style with the colons a bit you might be able to do a ``git log --grep 'gcctf: '`` 
16:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> didn't you have a discord server :0?
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> btw, our CI seems to have gotten rather long, maybe we should look into it, see if there is anything we can optimize
16:45 < bridge> <zhn> *pssst* gigsel, it's time to fork it
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 yes pls
16:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm not gonna fork nothing xD
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone said he doesnt care if the CI is slow but im also very annoyed by it
16:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> I just want convenience :c
16:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> gimme an anouncement
16:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will @jxsl13 where?

16:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> in the worst case
16:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> xd
16:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 you can watch a github repo for releases
16:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if there is something release worthy i do a release
16:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> I watch it for everything
16:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats spam xd
16:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's dedication
16:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sure xd
16:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think the only repo i watch for everything is libtw2
16:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> watching ddnet repo for everything is spam :0
16:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> which I also do nowadays
16:49 < bridge> <zhn> how to disable this inter-layer pick with ctrl+rmb in editor?
16:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn select layer from the tile you clicked on? Cant be disabled
16:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn you can patch it away here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/97a84f9cbdad1c47e1c9c7f17841281b2425ec2a/src/game/editor/layer_selector.cpp#L14
16:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do I look like a person who writes tests? XD
16:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> you look pretty white and liquidy to me
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> writes his own language without tests
16:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> gigachad
16:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> cannot say if you write tests
16:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> but what I meant was
16:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have tests for the language
16:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> look at the numbers in my tests
16:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But not for program im writing in a language
16:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But not for program im writing in the language
16:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> and if you put those in your implementation and get the right number if bytes back, then it might be correct
16:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> number of bytes
16:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I tested on one number
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
16:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Im sure it's correct :clueless:
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> well. I gave you a few numbers more :p
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> the relevant ones
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> hope your language provides a test suite out of the box ;0
16:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is there assert function in C stdlib?
16:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> teeworlds assert
16:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> trap ._.
17:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh wow
17:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> he wasn't lying then huh
17:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287428471470948472/image.png?ex=66f182b2&is=66f03132&hm=7a4f5e912962df0781b829f7e4c0e7b0656e987446319760c661171c3a37ff82&
17:01 < bridge> <headshotnoby> will it still be necessary
17:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> drama
17:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, it's real
17:02 < bridge> <learath2> Would still be nice if you did
17:02 < bridge> <0xdeen> The fear was that he *could* do something malicious, but to our knowledge he never did
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao sp someone
17:02 < bridge> <Peakies> 😄
17:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i was chatting with him for a while - he didnt really have any malicious intend with it it seemed
17:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> Way better than a domain squatter who distributes malware and demands 10k€ from us
17:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> double edged sword
17:03 < bridge> <urg_> has that actually happend?
17:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> good that it ended well
17:03 < bridge> <zhn> why was it even addeed
17:03 < bridge> <zhn> added
17:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> but could have ended badly
17:03 < bridge> <learath2> It's not a risk I was willing to take. Someone controlling a domain from which our client unquestioningly downloads a binary and runs is not something worth taking risks with
17:03 < bridge> <headshotnoby> he showed the ddnet 3DS client on the old news page
17:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> That was the worst case scenario in my mind
17:04 < bridge> <avolicious> Now we will start signing every file so update fails if not signed xD
17:04 < bridge> <urg_> ah so just a theoretical
17:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> obviously ^^ - glad it was returned
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should
17:04 < bridge> <learath2> The next updater will definitely have signed updates
17:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> that would be good
17:04 < bridge> <learath2> I'm planning it as a separate binary too, the self-replacing executables was an awful idea
17:05 < bridge> <avolicious> We should, we could - but we havent done
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> In my defense I was like 16 or 17 when I implemented them, it sounded very cool 😄
17:06 < bridge> <robyt3> That would be great, maybe that also prevents the Windows Defender false positives we always seem to get with new versions. I think the auto-updater functions look the most suspicious to behavioral detection.
17:07 < bridge> <learath2> My current plan is a completely transparent `DDNetLauncher`, which we can add stuff to later if we want, but it's main purpose will be to update the client
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> well im a gentoo user who uses ddnet ebuilds without self update so i was safen:gigachad:
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> For the steam build it will just directly launch the game
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> launcher in rust right?
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> write it in go!
17:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to move servers away from ovh :justatest:
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> Aye, I was thinking go but I don't want to add one more language to the ddnet project
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ew go
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> im anti go
17:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> should've been done years ago - ovh's customer support is as bad as you can imagine
17:08 < bridge> <robyt3> We could still later use the launcher as a crashpad, or can we integrate crash logs with Steam directly?
17:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> we've been having problems with OVH for years on blockworlds now
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> what should the launcher/updater do?
17:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> launch and update :P
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> Sure, idk how crashpads usually intercept crashes but we can set it up
17:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> I was sent a pastebin where ovh randomly decided to downgrade bandwidth from 1gibps tob250mibps. OVH pretty much sucks 🙂
17:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> Even tho Go is great, don't introduce more languages 😄
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> I'm thinking it does everything related to updating, no more update code in the client. When you click the update button in the client it sends a signal back (whatever it is, a signal, an exit code, some ipc). Then the updater downloads, verifies and installs the update
17:11 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :troll:
17:11 < bridge> <robyt3> The client could just write a file or signal some other way when it successfully closed. When the launcher detects that the client process has died without the file being written then it died abnormally. Presence of crash log files on Windows could also be detected.
17:12 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> sp someone got scared of deen
17:12 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> real
17:12 < bridge> <urg_> crazy to see a bunch of devs just geeking out over random things XD
17:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> pid files
17:12 < bridge> <robyt3> It could also allow adjusting graphics settings, i.e. select OpenGL/Vulkan
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> 👍 I was already planning the launcher to not exit but stay alive to monitor the child as a parent, it should be easy enough to integrate there
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill do a POC in rust tomorrow so i can add more rust to ddnet
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> This is also within my plans, some very simple winapi/xlib prompt you can get to by holding alt where you can set some emergency settings if you broke stuff
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> im taking notes
17:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> c++ easier than rust ._.
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> nein
17:13 < bridge> <urg_> it cant be that bad
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> Don't rush into it, I also want to rethink the update server side
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok its for fun
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> im wont cry if it doesnt end up being used
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont cry if it doesnt end up being used
17:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> *takes screenshot*
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill just make it yet another alt launcher
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> I think this time I want the files available by hash on the update server, and have a signed hashes file we can produce
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think prism launcher is a nice teg
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ref
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u think about a version selector too?
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, nice idea. I'll take a look at that too
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly why I want to have the files available by hash. The current updater only really allows you to get to the very latest version
17:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> imagine the implications
17:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> and the hellhole of backwards compatibility support
17:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._.
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure jupstar will hate it
17:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> two last major versions supported (cough Go)
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> also a prerelease opt in
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a bug report button
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a mini page with wiki linis
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe a signed manifest file for each release
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> links
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> bloat!?!?
17:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> merch shop integration
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> I don't want any ui for it to start with tbf
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> Also now that I think about it, how will the updater self-update? :Hmm:
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> I'll check how stuff like rustup updates itself
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> They should have come up with something robust enough
17:21 < bridge> <robyt3> It needs a small `updaterupdater` executable the replaces the current updater exe with the new one
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> How will we update the `updaterupdater` 😄
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> `updaterupdaterupdater`
17:21 < bridge> <robyt3> The normal updater can do that
17:21 < bridge> <robyt3> The normal updater just can't update its own exe
17:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> launcher updating ddnet + itself at the same time?
17:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Launcher first updates itself if possible, then DDNet
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah always launcher update first
17:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> so ddnet releases might bundle the launcher as well as the game itself
17:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> into a single release
17:24 < bridge> <0xdeen> Maybe don't put too much effort into the autoupdater. I feel like most people are using Steam nowadays, we could even not have an autoupdater instead
17:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure how this would work for standalone downloads. Users could just launch the DDNet exe directly. Maybe it should check if the launcher was started and also launch that instead?
17:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> might make sense
17:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> to check who's my parent process
17:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> but
17:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> doesn't really matter
17:26 < bridge> <avolicious> But signing should be good tho
17:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> if they do start ddnet.exe, it's their problem
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> I was thinking a non saved config option `cl_launched_by` which the launcher sets. If not set it exits
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> Well if there is no autoupdater there is nothing to sign in that aspect
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> We should however start signing the website release packages imo
17:27 < bridge> <avolicious> Signing a binary isnt that bad
17:27 < bridge> <avolicious> Even if there is an auto updater or whatever
17:27 < bridge> <avolicious> As long as you dont lose the private key, its should be safe
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> We'd just sign the entire zip if we only want to sign the releases
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> We'd just sign the entire archive if we only want to sign the releases
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I'm just thinking out loud
17:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> how would hotfixing releases work?
17:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> is there a need for something like that?
17:30 < bridge> <avolicious> Like a normal release?
17:31 < bridge> <avolicious> just bump the z from x.y.z scheme
17:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> yeah, a release that passed through all stages and is now available for normal users
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Rustup seems to replace itself
17:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> ok, so just releasing a new patch version
17:46 < bridge> <patiga> https://ddnet.org/olddomain/ should probably be updated to reflect todays news
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> @murpi if you are not too busy this would be nice. I'm about to leave the house
18:12 < bridge> <murpi> Ok
18:18 < bridge> <murpi> Done
18:18 < bridge> <murpi> Just copied deens message
18:24 < bridge> <learath2> ah, but is it still failing to deploy?
18:25 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, no idea how to fix that
18:25 < bridge> <murpi> I did the changes manually for now
18:25 < bridge> <murpi> I did the changes on the production server manually for now
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> On ddnet.tw, as root, go to `/var/ddnet-web/` do `git fetch origin; git checkout origin/master; jekyll build;`
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> On ddnet.tw, as root, go to `/var/ddnet-web/` do `git fetch origin; git checkout origin/master; cd www; jekyll build;`
18:26 < bridge> <murpi> ddnet.tw not found 404
18:26 < bridge> <murpi> :D
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> 😄
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> I mean the main server, idk what to call it
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> in my hosts file it's ddmain
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> After the `jekyll build`, there is a rsync command in the history that I don't remember, do that
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> Oh the checkout might fail because it's dirty, just remove the olddomain folder in that case
19:13 < bridge> <murpi> https://tenor.com/view/annoyed-fuck-frustrated-gif-13611303
19:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do you suggest we manage the keys btw?
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> I was thinking admins get keys, 2 keys sign each release
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> or idk if there is some magic crypto algorithm that allows us to have one release key but all of us use it in a safe way
19:56 < bridge> <zhn> is there a way to obtain change_map restriction to get maps only from maps/?
19:57 < bridge> <zhn> because `/map` uses it and if u have sorted directories instead of just maps/ it doesnt find any
19:58 < bridge> <zhn> is there a way to somehow get workaround of change_map restriction to get maps only from maps/?
20:21 < bridge> <furo> I guess, you could add more directories with `storage.cfg`. See https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/blob/master/storage.cfg for example.
20:35 < bridge> <zhn> @animepdf
20:36 < bridge> <zhn> you can disconnect these from ur main db and use sqlite only
20:36 < bridge> <zhn> so people will not be able to use /map at all :troll:
20:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but then their records won't count
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> I don't store maps like that, I have 
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> ```
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> maps/
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> ├─ anime/
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> │  ├─ dummy1.map
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> ├─ other/
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> │  ├─ somemap.map
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> ├─ souly/
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> │  ├─ somemap2.map
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> ```
20:54 < bridge> <animepdf> And it searches for `maps/` folder in each of these folders
21:01 < bridge> <zhn> how does it work on ddnet block servers?
21:02 < bridge> <zhn> you can reorganize them then
21:03 < bridge> <animepdf> don't feel like doing that :greenthing:
21:03 < bridge> <zhn> i can do it for u
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks do you have somewhere new design for ddnet website? iirc you showed it before
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> hes not home
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fock
21:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> checkout terraform vault, might give some interesting ideas
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> yo, does the client know if global tiles are placed on a map?
22:01 < bridge> <teero777> i mean obviously it knows because of the map data. but is there some kind of state or config variable that gets changed based on them?
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> they are loaded once and not changed
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what varible you would want
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i think you could check the size of the game layer or something to determine if the map has been loaded but i dont know what you'r looking for beyond that
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i also don't know if that's possible cuz it may just be uninitialized before map load
22:30 < bridge> <totar> Yeah dude, break all the things
22:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :santatrollet:
22:38 < bridge> <avolicious> this PR would gone insane
22:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Back to vanilla
22:39 < bridge> <louis> lgtm

23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i did not schedule these runs
23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> smth is making them for a week out each time it fails
23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> and it continues to fail
23:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe you (or someone) scheduled them weekly
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> cant fathom when or why i would have done that
23:38 < bridge> <louis> i have smth similar when i fork ddnet
23:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah

23:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check out .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yaml
23:40 < bridge> <Ewan> you mean look at it or update it
23:40 < bridge> <Ewan> lemme see
23:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's caused by that
23:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> fuc
23:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what if like
23:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ddnet.org/donate existed or something
23:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> to redirect to funding
23:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> cuz thats what i tried typing in first
