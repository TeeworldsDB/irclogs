00:00 < bridge> <Teero> Good thing I rewrote all of it to not need to mess with this :kek:
00:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you have to do deal with it
00:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unless your map data isnt a one to one with how its stored
00:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can hide alot of unused data in the map format
00:01 < bridge> <Teero> What? What exactly do you mean
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in the map format theres blocks of data which are indexed, and then each layer has flags saying what type it is and an index into this data for each type that it could be
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> m_Flags
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> m_Data
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> m_Tele
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> m_Switch
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ....
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> setting m_Flags to multiple types doesnt work
00:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its absolutley cursed
00:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (sized blocks of data)
00:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (which are not verified at load time)
00:02 < bridge> <Teero> I honestly have no idea what you are talking about even though I did rewrite the map loader
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (whose size are not verified at load time, which is very annoying)
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well it may be quirks of how the ddnet map loader works
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im just assuming what the map format is from how the structs are
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im just infering what the map format is from how the structs are
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be incredibly dumb if the map format is simpler than i see it here
00:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it would be nice that it could be refactored to not be ... like that
00:03 < bridge> <Teero> https://github.com/Teero888/ddnet_maploader_c99/blob/master/ddnet_map_loader.h
00:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so much cleaner
00:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `void *get_data(datafile_t *data_file, int index) {` you have the index block sizes here
00:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `void *get_data(datafile_t *data_file, int index) {` you have the data blocks here
00:04 < bridge> <Teero> I do store the map differently in memory than ddnet because of cache stuff
00:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `void *get_data(datafile_t *data_file, int index) {` and `int get_item_size(datafile_t *data_file, int index) ` you have the data blocks here
00:04 < bridge> <Teero> But thats a minor change
00:05 < bridge> <Teero> Ah that's what you mean xd
00:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i lied you do it the exact same lmao
00:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how u have no clue what im talking abt xd
00:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i lied you do it the exact same lmao (i just didnt see it cuz the .h doesnt contain map data struct)
00:06 < bridge> <Teero> I wrote this a while ago xdd
00:08 < bridge> <Teero> maybe 7 months ago I knew what I was doing.
00:11 < bridge> <Teero> okay I sleep gn
02:00 < bridge> <Teero> @ryozuki for your os/kernel please implement in-process memory isolation to be able to sandbox dynamically loaded libraries without losing computational speed.
02:04 < bridge> <Teero> for example if I wanted to make a client side server mod plugin manager so you can for example download a plugin for custom prediction, it is very hard to ensure that that plugin doesn't have access to the network or filesystem. Of course you can use wasm for example. That's what  ddnet-rs does but you lose up to 20% speed which is very annoying.
02:04 < bridge> <Teero> Currently there isn't a single solution that works cross-platform and doesn't sacrifice performance
02:05 < bridge> <Teero> I read this. But you need a patched kernel and an Intel CPU for this to work.
02:05 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416937978101501992/1801.06822v3.pdf?ex=68c8a9d3&is=68c75853&hm=ad5a8a13e29edd2902609d4fa1de2325427176509d875999377a9b515950bd5a&
02:06 < bridge> <Teero> So wasm is basically the only option. But I don't wanna sacrifice speed. On the other hand I don't want malicious plugins to be distributed.
02:06 < bridge> <Teero> So wasm is basically the only option but I don't wanna sacrifice speed. On the other hand I don't want malicious plugins to be distributed.
02:08 < bridge> <Teero> And you can completely forget about windows lmao.
02:09 < bridge> <Teero> The other possibility is to create a child process for the plugin but communicating between the main and the child would again be slow asf
02:16 < bridge> <Teero> Intel cpus have memory protection keys since 2015 starting with the Skylake models, amd since 2020 with zen3. Not sure about any others. the paper is from 2018 so the amd MPK wasn't out yet
02:16 < bridge> <Teero> I read this. But you need a patched kernel and linux for this to work.
02:16 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416937978101501992/1801.06822v3.pdf?ex=68c8a9d3&is=68c75853&hm=ad5a8a13e29edd2902609d4fa1de2325427176509d875999377a9b515950bd5a&
02:19 < bridge> <Teero> Proper user space memory protection key support for windows isn't out yet afaik so i can't use this for cross platform
02:20 < bridge> <Teero> And I have no idea how the situation is on mac
02:24 < bridge> <Teero> I read this. But you need a patched kernel and linux for this to work.

02:28 < bridge> <Teero> Okay I'm stupid. Without patching your kernel it is basically impossible to block syscalls of only part of the program (dynamically loaded plugin).
02:29 < bridge> <Teero> @ryozuki for your os/kernel please implement in-process memory and syscall isolation to be able to sandbox dynamically loaded libraries without losing computational speed.
02:29 < bridge> <Teero> This is so annoying why has nobody ever thought about fixing this. Why do kernels not support this
02:30 < bridge> <Teero> I should make a pr
02:30 < bridge> <Teero> well I can't really make a pr to the windows kernel
02:30 < bridge> <Teero> I would have to get a job there
02:30 < bridge> <Teero> so much effort

09:17 < bridge> <Assa> @blazulite can you show your target switch sounds here in the channel after you finished? :owo:
09:17 < bridge> <blazulite> Yea!
09:17 < bridge> <blazulite> In fact I was actually about to talk about that lol
09:20 < bridge> <blazulite> I have different ideas for it:
09:20 < bridge> <blazulite> - Switch sound (Like a light switch)
09:20 < bridge> <blazulite> - Something similar to `sfx_hit_weak-03` but lighter 
09:20 < bridge> <blazulite> - Something similar to  `sfx_msg-highlight`
09:21 < bridge> <Assa> go ahead, the light switch idea was already around. I want you to do this unbiased first 🙂

11:10 < bridge> <Assa> I believe because my approval is of "no value" anyway ._.

12:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> guys did i cook
12:56 < bridge> <totar> std::conditional_t :justatest:
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> this looks a lot like my raw function for rendering
12:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it dont work x-x
12:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want it to return the the right type so i dont have to
12:57 < bridge> <totar> what's the goal of all the genericness
12:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sunk cost fallacy
12:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i could just cast at the call site
12:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but thats cringe
12:58 < bridge> <totar> I would blindly assume all the layers are the same size
12:59 < bridge> <totar> because they are
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they arent
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6dc8032694e2411ce575201711658cca8101338c/src/game/map/render_layer.cpp#L813
12:59 < bridge> <totar> they arent?
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CTeleTile is bigger
12:59 < bridge> <totar> what
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im desperatley tryignt o make the tele tile code look the same as the other 2
12:59 < bridge> <totar> you can teleporters outside the gametile grid?
12:59 < bridge> <totar> you can have teleporters outside the gametile grid?
13:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CTile is 4 unsigned chars
13:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CTeleTile is 2unsigned chars
13:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CTeleTile is 2 unsigned chars
13:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk what padding has to say about that
13:00 < bridge> <totar> oh you mean stride size is different
13:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it doesnt work if i blindly assume they are the same
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> but this means, CTeleTile is smaller and not bigger, because 2 < 4
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sorry
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes u r right
13:01 < bridge> <totar> I would just make a function that handles the stride differences
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats what ptr types do
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i want it to return a different type dpeending on which index i request
13:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is generics which is not yet supported by cpp
13:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `VerifyLayer<&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data>(GameClient()->Layers()->GameLayer());` this isnt valid syntax
13:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> id have to fall back to macros
13:02 < bridge> <totar> I'm still not fully understanding the motivation behind this
13:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it checks the size and returns the right type so i can index into it without worrying about size
13:02 < bridge> <totar> right
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `VerifyLayer<&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data>(GameClient()->Layers()->GameLayer());`
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `VerifyLayer<&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data>(GameClient()->Layers()->FrontLayer());`
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `VerifyLayer<&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data>(GameClient()->Layers()->TeleLayer());`
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `VerifyLayer<&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Tele>(GameClient()->Layers()->TeleLayer());`
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> those are what i want the calls to look like
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and for it to return CTIle* for all but the last
13:03 < bridge> <totar> why not just hard code the size and pass it around from where you define every type of outline.
13:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because thats cringe when types are meant to do that
13:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its what im gonna have to do
13:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or atleast pass in the size
13:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and cast outside
13:04 < bridge> <Assa> the render layers solve this by polymorphism 🤷‍♂️
13:05 < bridge> <robyt3> This is very unreadable
13:05 < bridge> <totar> you want like, reflection I guess right?
13:05 < bridge> <totar> that would make this easy
13:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mm if i could put the paramaters into templaets it would work
13:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would prefer constexpr ifs but both dont work anyway
13:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would prefer constexpr ifs but both dont work either
13:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Start by describing the problem instead of your solution
13:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want to get CTile* or CTeleTile* from Layers()->* checking the size and returning the data ptr
13:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait
13:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if i return an std::function to get x, y -> index that works too
13:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no generics required
13:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ermm
13:09 < bridge> <robyt3> That, and checking the size when returning the pointer is the wrong approach
13:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why, i dont want everything to be rwapped in checks
13:09 < bridge> <robyt3> The map should only have to be validated once when loading
13:09 < bridge> <robyt3> After that, you don't need validation anymore
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well everywhere else its used its validated
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eg collision
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(m_pLayers->TeleLayer())
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     unsigned int Size = m_pLayers->Map()->GetDataSize(m_pLayers->TeleLayer()->m_Tele);
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(Size >= (size_t)m_Width * m_Height * sizeof(CTeleTile))
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         m_pTele = static_cast<CTeleTile *>(m_pLayers->Map()->GetData(m_pLayers->TeleLayer()->m_Tele));
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
13:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
13:10 < bridge> <totar> you could add the size as part of the type itself right?
13:10 < bridge> <totar> ``constexpr m_Size = sizeof(CTeleTile);``
13:11 < bridge> <robyt3> That's how the code ended up being written. Doesn't really make it the correct approach if the problem you are trying to solve is "add proper map validation".
13:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im sunk cost fallacying whilst rewriting outlines in tclient
13:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but yes i would rather i didnt have to do validation
13:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I wouldn't waste effort trying to reduce duplicated code and logic if it makes it very unreadable instead. Looks like `CCollision` already validates its members, so you could use those instead of `CLayers`.
13:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a bit wack
13:14 < bridge> <totar> that's a good idea
13:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2v1 okay xd
13:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but dependning on collision is weird
13:15 < bridge> <totar> ok maybe
13:15 < bridge> <totar> but there's not any non collision layers we want to outline atm?
13:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> non
13:16 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if you could do outlines with a shader :p hrr
13:16 < bridge> <robyt3> A slightly cleaner would be to move the validation from `CCollision` to `CLayers`, because the former also depends on the latter.
13:16 < bridge> <robyt3> A slightly cleaner approach would be to move the validation from `CCollision` to `CLayers`, because the former also depends on the latter.
13:16 < bridge> <totar> yes, you could
13:17 < bridge> <totar> which isn't to say that we should
13:17 < bridge> <Assa> nono, I mean if **you** could :p
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the old collision code requires the data and tele index of the tele layer which collision doesnt which is slightly confusing
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the old outline code requires the data and tele index of the tele layer which collision doesnt which is slightly confusing
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe it was magic that somehow worked the same as collision does now
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and ive been tryign to accomodate it despite it not being required
13:18 < bridge> <totar> I'm pretty sure it's just doing an existence check
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> TeleLayer()->m_Data and m_Tele are used
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh its all private in collsion
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> aduh
13:19 < bridge> <totar> I think it was to distinguish between tele in and tele out
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess collision desont care about tele out
13:22 < bridge> <totar> I would be surprised if collision is completely unaware of teleout
13:23 < bridge> <pluskz> Lol kaizo network feature being ported to ddnet
13:24 < bridge> <totar> ok maybe you're right
13:27 < bridge> <totar> it doesn't provide a way to distinguish them other than just using the tele layer directly
14:27 < bridge> <Assa> hmm ivec3 distance already breaks at ivec3(431, 431, 431)  🤔
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> hmm the PR list doesn't look too bad tbh, we have many PRs ready just waiting for other mainteiners to review or simply press merge
15:16 < bridge> <kebscs> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10529
15:16 < bridge> <kebscs> this would be nice to have a review
15:17 < bridge> <kebscs> most likely is ready
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> I'll give it another look 🙂
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs what is
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> NetEventEx("TargetHit:Common", "targethit@netevent.ddnet.org", [
15:20 < bridge> <Assa>         NetBool("m_Weakly"),
15:20 < bridge> <Assa>     ]),
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> 
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> for?
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> if you say "sound", can you guess what's missing?
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> if you say "sound" or "particles", can you guess what's missing?
15:23 < bridge> <kebscs> havent seen it, must be newly added by louis
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u like intrusive lists as a ' enjoyer right
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill have to use then for my ready queue since having allocs in scheduler at irq is bad
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u like intrusive lists as a C enjoyer right
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, embrace intrusiveness
15:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: why is the linter not in bash? :feelsbadman:
15:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat I almost wrote parts of it in bash just to trigger heinrich xd
15:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but then i had so much fun with C already
15:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also C has better bindings for libclang than bash lel
15:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: it's time to fix it
15:59 < bridge> <Assa> chiller should I compile a list of PRs you may merge for you?
15:59 < bridge> <Assa> chiller should I compile a list of PRs you may merge for you? (excluding my own)
16:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea no joke i thought about writing a minimal cli in C for libclang wrap and the rest in bash xd @milkeeycat but nonono
16:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa i think i am kinda aware of all open prs 
16:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not a single one of them is a free merge for me. Execept of course 20 of my epic prs.
16:02 < bridge> <Assa> all 90
16:03 < bridge> <Assa> Excuse me, 87 ofc
16:05 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon what about 10824 ?
16:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hm idk
16:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 how do i overwrite all the skin information at once, the old way of just setting g_Config now segfaults
16:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> trying to do it via command is not atomic
16:47 < bridge> <Teero> well its a start at least xD

16:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero how do you render?
16:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is it pure C rewrite?
16:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** SDL?
17:00 < bridge> <Teero> yes, C+vulkan+glfw
17:00 < bridge> <Teero> and imgui for UI
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet-c

17:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> WE NEED /DANCE
17:45 < bridge> <Teero> xD
17:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that would be fucking epic
17:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sadly its fun and ddnet would reject
17:50 < bridge> <manikoo> :poggers2:
17:52 < bridge> <Teero> im so fucking confused rn
17:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Extra epic: allow arbitrary emote animations dictated by the client, so clients can add their own
17:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think someone did ip/tcp thru emotes

18:01 < chillerbot12> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: review target sounds
18:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero ur gigachad ngl. I wish the legit stuff would be open source. And i actually quite dislike that you work on tas ._. imo it devalues clips farmed by real humans and is basically cheating.
18:28 < bridge> <louis> idk bout dat if its done nicely
18:28 < bridge> <louis> extension on emote wheel to start an animation would be sick
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if we have the full int for emotes
18:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or if the server clamps them
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> so far I like this one the most, the click is neat, can you make the click louder?
20:01 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> Is there any command that can send the necessary rcon command to all my servers?
20:02 < bridge> <themsxr> Hi how to change Time to Score only on server side I changed every m_Score in player.cpp and removed all Time stuff and it's still showing Time not Score. I know that in DM, CTF, TDM it's showing SCORE but I need to leave DDRace game type.
20:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @themsxr what are you working on?
20:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @rehoboamrulit you can use econ or fifo for that plus a small script
20:19 < bridge> <themsxr> Just own gamemode new block mode but can't still change this time omg so my level showing as time like 00:01 lmao
20:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @themsxr i see, any reason your not using any of the available block modes?
20:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @themsxr also this is the line you want to remove https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cdddec731c25baa17cde6b9aa2042bbaa08b9ee1/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L615
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
20:23 < bridge> <themsxr> Thanks ChillerDragon 😄 I prefer to make my own for fun and learn something new
20:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i have a Déjà vu
20:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why is it ppl create block modes for fun but nobody creates ddrace for fun xd
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mentality
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think asking how to disable timescore flag happend more often than asking about the wiki
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think chilerbot needs this
20:27 < bridge> <themsxr> There's something to make in classic DDRace? I think people prefer to play offical game type not modifed one 😄 It would be better if we could change things from client side and add new cool things 😄
20:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @themsxr i mean if you reinvent the wheel to learn you could also rewrite the ddrace mod thats what i mean
20:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** change what from the client side?
20:29 < bridge> <themsxr> Idk I think many people have some ideas to add something new that could be cool to use in Races
20:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like what
20:31 < bridge> <themsxr> I can't answer on that. That was just a answer on your question why people don't edit classic DDRace 😄
20:31 < bridge> <themsxr> I guess that's the point why
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you lost me xd
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont mean edit
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i mean rewrite
20:31 < bridge> <themsxr> Ah
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** take vanilla teeworlds source
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and implement ddrace
20:32 < bridge> <themsxr> ah yeah that would be cool thing to do, right 😮
20:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk i dont think so xd
20:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i also wouldnt rewrite a block mode today
20:32 < bridge> <themsxr> Why
20:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont think coding is fun and i dont want to learn
20:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i only care about results
20:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** different mindset i guess
20:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if i wanted a block mod i would just download F-DDrace and start gaming xd
20:35 < bridge> <melon> TiL me and chiller are entire opposites
20:35 < bridge> <melon> i'd rewrite my entire system if i had the time
20:35 < bridge> <themsxr> Oh, yeah. Coding is my hobbysince I was kid and I hope that it's my future work soon, trying so hard. That's why I'm making own stuff for fun here
20:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
20:36 < bridge> <themsxr> Yeah melon sometimes that's the problem, people want to do a lot but time is a barrier
20:37 < bridge> <melon> i have so.. many projects i want to do but then my wife drags me out of my room to enjoy that thing called "life"
20:37 < bridge> <melon> i'm still unsure what it is but the people playing that game are mean
20:40 < bridge> <pilonpl> no matter what you do you only have 24 hours in a day
20:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> that's why collaborating exists
20:41 < bridge> <themsxr> hahahaah pilonpl some people have only 2-4 hours a day 😄
20:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> just think about it, collectively all people on earth have 192 billion hours every day
20:44 < bridge> <themsxr> Maybe when you don't have a job, wife and a child 😄
20:45 < bridge> <melon> I got my hands on a cool rust PDF and I've been reading it for 2 hours, I wanted to finish a project in c++
20:45 < bridge> <melon> What am I doing with my life
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ikr, get a wife and kids
20:45 < bridge> <melon> now wait a minute

20:51 < bridge> <louis> i love linked lists
20:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rip assa who probably had a reminder in chilerbot xd
20:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ez restarted
20:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how can i has fng score in my blox copy love block server in the tab???????
20:59 < chillerbot> to show points instead of time in the scoreboard remove this line https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a9c316055f5d2579f6166152ec20c4241e0da456/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L600

21:05 < bridge> <Assa> :pepeRage:
21:12 < bridge> <Teero> Be happy it will all be open source once it's finished, since I've recently decided idgaf about the accuracy towards the ddnet physics which was the fact that was holding back performance the most, I can actually fix all the physics bugs and make the physics finally performant enough for thousands of players. That also means those physics and the tas tool that goes along with it can't be used by botters at all since it's not compatible with the defau
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 which light sword color suits you the most?
21:18 < bridge> <melon> Yellow for sure
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> what? like a katana? what is a light sword color
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> ohh
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> i light saber
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> a light saber
21:21 < bridge> <Teero> i would choose blue
21:21 < bridge> <Teero> or white
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a jedi knight
21:21 < bridge> <Assa> i'd say 2 blue and 2 green ones would suit him
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is he a cyborg?
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> yes :deen_star:

21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when are floats good?
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when they small
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fix your caller side
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> ?
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u multiply fucking 30k x 40k
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc that sucks
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> even long longs would break for ivec4, as I tried to explain
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dont need 4d math
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> even long longs would break for ivec3, as I tried to explain
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> typo
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> because the dot function overflows with values bigger than `(datatype::max())^(1/3)/2`
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> because the dot function overflows with values bigger than `(datatype::max())^(1/3)/3`
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then stop calculating these stupid numbers
21:34 < bridge> <Teero> @essigautomat is this needed anywhere? xd
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he uses it with quads probs
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but he can just /1024 them
21:34 < bridge> <Assa> currently not, that's why I am trying to fix it. I see a usecase for them (where I just implemented distance myself basically)
21:34 < bridge> <Teero> @jupeyy_keks can you help me with my shader? xd
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but i am probs not better than gpt5
