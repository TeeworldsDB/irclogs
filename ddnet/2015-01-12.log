09:45 < eeeee> some skins like blacktee shouldn't be allowed in vanilla team gametypes
14:18 < CookieMichal> Hello
14:18 < CookieMichal> deen, there's a problem :D
14:19 < CookieMichal> People, who use ddnet client on windows can hear windows error sound instead of normal message sound.
14:19 < CookieMichal> It only happens when message contains "•".
14:24 <@EastByte> wut
14:24 < CookieMichal> JavaScript says that "•" char code is 8226, but some site says it's 2022.
14:25 < CookieMichal> \u2022 aka bullet
14:25 < CookieMichal> nvm
14:25 <@EastByte> since when do we have console notification sounds?
14:25 < CookieMichal> 8226 (Decimal), 2022 (Hexadecimal)
14:26 < CookieMichal> EastByte, no idea
14:26 < CookieMichal> I found it yesterday with CookieAlex :D
14:26 <@EastByte> the sound is caused by random utf8 stuff?
14:27 < CookieMichal> Only this • does it, so far
14:29 < CookieMichal> Tested some more chars like ¾∧≈ŁŁ˝¨°˘ and none of them does it
14:29 < CookieMichal> only •
14:33 < o_be_one> hellow
15:01 < CookieMichal> hello
15:47 < CookieMichal> Fumm, •
15:54  * CookieMichal slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
15:54 < CookieMichal> wake up
15:54  * CookieMichal slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
15:54  * CookieMichal slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
15:54  * CookieMichal slaps EastByte around a bit with a large fishbot
15:54 < CookieMichal> oop

19:25 <@deen> ochristi: maybe you have a file with the same name but other capitalization?

19:49 < Learath2> back
19:49 < Learath2> deen && eeeee do you think getting CFetcher to use CJob would even be worth it considering they do the exact same thng
19:50 < eeeee> having less code would be better in the long run
19:52 < eeeee> and i think it matters more for you personally than it does for teeworlds
19:52 < eeeee> in a real srs bsns company you'd be expected to reuse shit instead of writing your own every time
19:53 < eeeee> so doing this case is a good way to get experience on how to notice things that might be reusable, understand the author's intent on how they ought to be used and adapting your own stuff to the same concepts

20:30 <@deen> eeeee: now i remember why i link statically, so it works on Windows^^
20:31 <@deen> or maybe i just need another library
20:53 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
20:54 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
21:05 < eeeee> yeah whatever, i'll just pullreq the OptTestCompileC stuff a bit later
21:06 < eeeee> soon bam config would look more like a proper configure with hundreds of checks :D
21:25 <@heinrich5991> :)
21:49 <@deen> heinrich5991: your unicode windows console patch caused the problem
21:50 <@deen> everyone was crying all day because • makes a beep on windows
21:57 < ochristi> deen: Fly to the moon now has Moon in cap, you got it, stupid windows...
21:58 <@deen> ochristi: with ddnet client?
21:58 <@deen> because I think I fixed this
21:58 < ochristi> I still got old version, I did not come around to compile it
21:59 <@deen> would be interesting if it's fixed
22:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you know what causes it?
22:00 < ochristi> wanted to try cross compiling on linux, was not able to figure it out yet :p
22:19 <@deen> heinrich5991: i guess something goes wrong and a \a gets printed
22:19 <@deen> ochristi: why cross compile?
22:20 <@heinrich5991> cause convenience
22:21 < ochristi> I do that stuff usually on linux, and currently do not want set that mingw up again
