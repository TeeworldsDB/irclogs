02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon `ls -A` instead of `-a`!
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @heinrich5991 -1 better
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 if i set Send = true here, the dummy hammer works. Weird: This is not there in ddnet in any way: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-Client/blob/F-Client/src/game/client/components/controls.cpp#L232
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i compared both functions, should all be the same
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you help?
22:05 <@Learath2> I can take a look tomorrow, you could try seeing what Send = true does
22:10 <@Learath2> @fokkonaut u mean hammerfly or dummy hammer?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hammerfly
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which is dummy hammer
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> i have a great idea
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> when someone goes spec, you would see his ghost, of where he went spec
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> like if he were in freeze, but like 40% opacity
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> +1 to that idea @Boci
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or we could create different skin (like just dotted border of actual tee), in the way x_ninja is used for freeze
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> yes!
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> but still lower opacity for sure
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Control opacity
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/685983717461983234/unknown.png
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> `x_spec` or so
