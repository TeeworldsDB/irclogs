00:07 < bridge> <stnwtr> yes true, stupid me
00:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i know i hate it
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> no way it’s worse than webOS
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> they all use last gen SOCs because they’re cheaper and ‘more mature’
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but mostly because they’re cheaper im sure
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> and they don’t put nearly enough consideration into the software
00:17 < bridge> <learath2> With how shit they are I’d bet they are like 6 generations behind of current socs
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yea

00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> What rpi entertainment thing?
00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> I use yt-dlp and mpv, didn't know there was a thing
00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> yt-dlp -f "bestvideo[height<=1080][fps<=30]+bestaudio/best" -o - "$YOUTUBE_URL" | mpv --audio-device='alsa/sysdefault:CARD=b1' --fullscreen -

07:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> fail2ban is just fancy script that went out of hand imo, j3s saying the same tho xd
08:32 < bridge> <reitw> That's one good post tho, + was always saying u don't need f2b as long as u disable password auth
09:00 < bridge> <learath2> There is no “thing”, I use ssh, sshfs, a set of scripts and plex
09:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didnt you see the video? After 6 hours of brain melting gameplay his muscle memory tried to join a dummy when a friend joined. Which killed his run.
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where do you generate your passwords? On bitwarden.com? axaxaxa
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo using websites is fine. Just make sure you inspect the network traffic of the site first then use an incognito browser to not store any cookies. Load the js turn off the internet geneate tw pw and close the site.
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ideally you should do the same with your local tools. When using a pwgen cli you should monitor that in wireshark. And maybe also check for file writes. And then turn off the internet if you do not fully trust the tool yet and then generate the pw.
09:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Saying website is insecure and local tool is secure without checking either of then for phoining home is not helpful imo. Also super troll that you swear on cloud password services while not recomending cloud pw generators
09:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> s/tw/the bro i have gotten really good at writing without autocomplete
09:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U do so much to generate a password. All i do i press big ass button with text "GENERATE PASSWORD"
10:04 < bridge> <headshotnoby> generate the password, copy and close site, open notepad, paste it there and change a few characters in it
10:04 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :brain2:
10:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or that ye
10:16 < bridge> <louis> just use google chrome generate password autofill :greenthing:
10:16 < bridge> <reitw> I use bitwarden tho, works perfectly, even if yes you have to trust them
10:16 < bridge> <reitw> + to auth on my acc u need my yubikey
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> does plex have ads
10:23 < bridge> <learath2> Not on content you host yourself
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to try the open source alternative on my stupid samsung tv
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it required me to enter dev mode on it and install the app
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt do it cuz the software to put the app requires winshit or a ubuntu deb
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> also idk what virus will that have xd
10:24 < bridge> <learath2> The only reason I used plex is that it has a decent client on xbox and sometimes I cba to ssh into the pi
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a ps4
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its better than the tv software
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://jellyfin.org/
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> its this
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> There are no good media players on xbox somehow. The VLC port keeps randomly stopping decodinh video. The microsoft one can't handle subtitles. There are 5 paid options that I heard are all shit
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> all sucks
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its better to get a rpi and connect via hdmi xd
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's fascinating that such a popular device has no media options
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hardest challenge in development:
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Name your stuff in a elegant, yet clear way.
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I user MyManager and MyRender and MyStructImpl/MyStructInner way too often, when I'm out of ideas xd
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks lately i try rocks or minerals
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> Really shows you how everyone just streams everything now and no one has anything downloaded
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hardest challenge in development:
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Name your stuff in a elegant, yet clear way.
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I use MyManager and MyRender and MyStructImpl/MyStructInner way too often, when I'm out of ideas xd
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and also a good strategy is to search the name in japanese
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example Rock is Rokku
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> rokku sounds nice
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good idea
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> a turboweeb would name their software after waifus
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent reached that lvl yet
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Me doing it rn
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent figured out yet why when i port forward it simply doesnt work
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i rly wanna host stuff on my home server with 32gb ram
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a gpu
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so weird
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did you try to disable ipv6 support? Helped for me
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> my isp doesnt have ipv6
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> only one in spain that has it is orange
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well internally i have ipv6 ofc
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if that matters
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ever watch archer
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use a vps as proxy?
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> how? xd
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your home server could actively ping it to keep connections open or smth xD
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe that's too hard.. Like a peer to peer between them xD
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> router has some feature called DMZ
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> does that help
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> demilitarized zone
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> don’t give wireless access to this area
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its off
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Does it have a own firewall?
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> stupid isp routers
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do u even use them
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> this router comes with the fibre thing builtin
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't you have router freedom thanks to some EU laws
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess i can put it as a bridge or smth
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i just wanna open ports
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> dw its a local ip
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191676454405156964/image.png?ex=65a64e2f&is=6593d92f&hm=f0bd135fe544814dce5b93124b4ba3eb9c138d35d9eae95f153d5dec2ba3630a&
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk that that ALG shit is
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok the isp website tells u how to open ports on the router
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it should be doable
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have u tried non standard port now?
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 8080?
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u mean a higher one
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah above 10k
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is the lan IP really correct? Xd
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i have it even statically mapped
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i connect to it via ssh too
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> locally that ip shows my nginx
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh ok
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im behind a cgnat rip
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use this later
11:08 < bridge> <vappy19> Cute icon
11:09 < ChillerDragon> sos i need help with my 0.7 pr. Ideally from ppl who have problems with me chosing the wrong design decision @heinrich5991 @robyt3
11:10 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 moved the player hook sound into some snap obj flag while in 0.6 it was a net game msg sound world
11:11 < ChillerDragon> now i am currently in the engine context where i translate the snapshot from 0.7 to 0.6 and i can not bake it into a 0.6 version because 0.6 wont play that sound from the snap
11:12 < ChillerDragon> so my idea was to play the sound in place during the translation. But since the gameclient stuff is not linked into the engine playing a sound wont compile
11:17 < ChillerDragon> my other idea was to return a net message from translate snapshot and the client then passes that to GameClient()->OnMessage() problem it that it now expects a 0.7 message and tries to translate the 0.6 sound message and brekas
11:18 < ChillerDragon> possible solutions for that are moving the translation further up and let GameClient()->OnMessage() only expect the already translated 0.6 messages. Problem with that is its gonna be messy and i think even require repacking and mixes all responsibilties from engine and gameclient
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> Playing the sound during translation sounds illegal, don’t do that one
11:25 < ChillerDragon> yea it would be nicer if the message actually arrives in the 0.6 code
11:25 < ChillerDragon> but the way i understand it everything else requires restructuring ._.
11:25 < ChillerDragon> and idk how to even structure it
11:32 < ChillerDragon> lerato wat u think about creating some gamemessage out of thin air and randomly calling OnMesssage in client.cpp? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/We
11:33 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704191612.png
11:33 < ChillerDragon> kill me
11:36 < ChillerDragon> ok i made it compile and work but not sure if the code is ok like that
11:36 < ChillerDragon> also its super cring to test sound code in a cafe with ppl xd
11:37 < ChillerDragon> i added a arg to gameclient OnMessage to not translate
11:37 < ChillerDragon> what a mess
11:41 < ChillerDragon> lmao now one italian lady said "oh he is playing mario"
11:41 < ChillerDragon> i know the kirby comparison but mario is new xd
11:41 < ChillerDragon> ofc the italians axaxax
12:03 < ChillerDragon> omg im stoopid
12:03 < ChillerDragon> ignore all text i sent
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
12:03 < ChillerDragon> its also in snap in 0.6 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
12:04 < ChillerDragon> omg 
12:04 < ChillerDragon> wat a detour
12:05 < ChillerDragon> 0.6 protocol is the trollest
12:05 < ChillerDragon> it has sound world, sound global and a game msg and a snap item
12:48 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 lerato is half of the 0.7 dmg ind unset or am i blind? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/caeebaf4a0e08b96336ef9ac52e6a2dac2011359/src/game/server/eventhandler.cpp#L76-L89
12:48 < ChillerDragon> i See m_X, m_Y, and m_HealthAmount being set
12:49 < ChillerDragon> wat about m_ClientID, m_Amgle, m_Self, m_ArmorAmount? is that uninitialized memory or coming from somewhere else?
12:49 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/snap_items.html#event_damage
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, maybe those did not exist when I was making that nasty hack
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> I distinctly remember 0.7 version of damageind being a neutered version of the 0.6 one
