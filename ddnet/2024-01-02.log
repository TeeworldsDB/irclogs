00:07 < bridge> <stnwtr> yes true, stupid me
00:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i know i hate it
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> no way it’s worse than webOS
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> they all use last gen SOCs because they’re cheaper and ‘more mature’
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but mostly because they’re cheaper im sure
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> and they don’t put nearly enough consideration into the software
00:17 < bridge> <learath2> With how shit they are I’d bet they are like 6 generations behind of current socs
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yea

00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> What rpi entertainment thing?
00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> I use yt-dlp and mpv, didn't know there was a thing
00:40 < bridge> <cipy29> yt-dlp -f "bestvideo[height<=1080][fps<=30]+bestaudio/best" -o - "$YOUTUBE_URL" | mpv --audio-device='alsa/sysdefault:CARD=b1' --fullscreen -

07:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> fail2ban is just fancy script that went out of hand imo, j3s saying the same tho xd
08:32 < bridge> <reitw> That's one good post tho, + was always saying u don't need f2b as long as u disable password auth
09:00 < bridge> <learath2> There is no “thing”, I use ssh, sshfs, a set of scripts and plex
09:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didnt you see the video? After 6 hours of brain melting gameplay his muscle memory tried to join a dummy when a friend joined. Which killed his run.
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where do you generate your passwords? On bitwarden.com? axaxaxa
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo using websites is fine. Just make sure you inspect the network traffic of the site first then use an incognito browser to not store any cookies. Load the js turn off the internet geneate tw pw and close the site.
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ideally you should do the same with your local tools. When using a pwgen cli you should monitor that in wireshark. And maybe also check for file writes. And then turn off the internet if you do not fully trust the tool yet and then generate the pw.
09:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Saying website is insecure and local tool is secure without checking either of then for phoining home is not helpful imo. Also super troll that you swear on cloud password services while not recomending cloud pw generators
09:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> s/tw/the bro i have gotten really good at writing without autocomplete
09:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U do so much to generate a password. All i do i press big ass button with text "GENERATE PASSWORD"
10:04 < bridge> <headshotnoby> generate the password, copy and close site, open notepad, paste it there and change a few characters in it
10:04 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :brain2:
10:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or that ye
10:16 < bridge> <louis> just use google chrome generate password autofill :greenthing:
10:16 < bridge> <reitw> I use bitwarden tho, works perfectly, even if yes you have to trust them
10:16 < bridge> <reitw> + to auth on my acc u need my yubikey
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> does plex have ads
10:23 < bridge> <learath2> Not on content you host yourself
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to try the open source alternative on my stupid samsung tv
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it required me to enter dev mode on it and install the app
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt do it cuz the software to put the app requires winshit or a ubuntu deb
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> also idk what virus will that have xd
10:24 < bridge> <learath2> The only reason I used plex is that it has a decent client on xbox and sometimes I cba to ssh into the pi
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a ps4
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its better than the tv software
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://jellyfin.org/
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> its this
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> There are no good media players on xbox somehow. The VLC port keeps randomly stopping decodinh video. The microsoft one can't handle subtitles. There are 5 paid options that I heard are all shit
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> all sucks
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its better to get a rpi and connect via hdmi xd
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's fascinating that such a popular device has no media options
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hardest challenge in development:
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Name your stuff in a elegant, yet clear way.
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I user MyManager and MyRender and MyStructImpl/MyStructInner way too often, when I'm out of ideas xd
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks lately i try rocks or minerals
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> Really shows you how everyone just streams everything now and no one has anything downloaded
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hardest challenge in development:
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Name your stuff in a elegant, yet clear way.
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I use MyManager and MyRender and MyStructImpl/MyStructInner way too often, when I'm out of ideas xd
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and also a good strategy is to search the name in japanese
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example Rock is Rokku
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> rokku sounds nice
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good idea
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> a turboweeb would name their software after waifus
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent reached that lvl yet
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Me doing it rn
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent figured out yet why when i port forward it simply doesnt work
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i rly wanna host stuff on my home server with 32gb ram
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a gpu
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so weird
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did you try to disable ipv6 support? Helped for me
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> my isp doesnt have ipv6
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> only one in spain that has it is orange
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well internally i have ipv6 ofc
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if that matters
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ever watch archer
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use a vps as proxy?
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> how? xd
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your home server could actively ping it to keep connections open or smth xD
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe that's too hard.. Like a peer to peer between them xD
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> router has some feature called DMZ
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> does that help
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> demilitarized zone
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> don’t give wireless access to this area
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its off
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Does it have a own firewall?
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> stupid isp routers
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do u even use them
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> this router comes with the fibre thing builtin
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't you have router freedom thanks to some EU laws
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess i can put it as a bridge or smth
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i just wanna open ports
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> dw its a local ip
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191676454405156964/image.png?ex=65a64e2f&is=6593d92f&hm=f0bd135fe544814dce5b93124b4ba3eb9c138d35d9eae95f153d5dec2ba3630a&
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk that that ALG shit is
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok the isp website tells u how to open ports on the router
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it should be doable
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have u tried non standard port now?
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 8080?
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u mean a higher one
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah above 10k
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is the lan IP really correct? Xd
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i have it even statically mapped
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i connect to it via ssh too
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> locally that ip shows my nginx
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh ok
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im behind a cgnat rip
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use this later
11:08 < bridge> <vappy19> Cute icon
11:09 < ChillerDragon> sos i need help with my 0.7 pr. Ideally from ppl who have problems with me chosing the wrong design decision @heinrich5991 @robyt3
11:10 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 moved the player hook sound into some snap obj flag while in 0.6 it was a net game msg sound world
11:11 < ChillerDragon> now i am currently in the engine context where i translate the snapshot from 0.7 to 0.6 and i can not bake it into a 0.6 version because 0.6 wont play that sound from the snap
11:12 < ChillerDragon> so my idea was to play the sound in place during the translation. But since the gameclient stuff is not linked into the engine playing a sound wont compile
11:17 < ChillerDragon> my other idea was to return a net message from translate snapshot and the client then passes that to GameClient()->OnMessage() problem it that it now expects a 0.7 message and tries to translate the 0.6 sound message and brekas
11:18 < ChillerDragon> possible solutions for that are moving the translation further up and let GameClient()->OnMessage() only expect the already translated 0.6 messages. Problem with that is its gonna be messy and i think even require repacking and mixes all responsibilties from engine and gameclient
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> Playing the sound during translation sounds illegal, don’t do that one
11:25 < ChillerDragon> yea it would be nicer if the message actually arrives in the 0.6 code
11:25 < ChillerDragon> but the way i understand it everything else requires restructuring ._.
11:25 < ChillerDragon> and idk how to even structure it
11:32 < ChillerDragon> lerato wat u think about creating some gamemessage out of thin air and randomly calling OnMesssage in client.cpp? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/We
11:33 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704191612.png
11:33 < ChillerDragon> kill me
11:36 < ChillerDragon> ok i made it compile and work but not sure if the code is ok like that
11:36 < ChillerDragon> also its super cring to test sound code in a cafe with ppl xd
11:37 < ChillerDragon> i added a arg to gameclient OnMessage to not translate
11:37 < ChillerDragon> what a mess
11:41 < ChillerDragon> lmao now one italian lady said "oh he is playing mario"
11:41 < ChillerDragon> i know the kirby comparison but mario is new xd
11:41 < ChillerDragon> ofc the italians axaxax
12:03 < ChillerDragon> omg im stoopid
12:03 < ChillerDragon> ignore all text i sent
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
12:03 < ChillerDragon> its also in snap in 0.6 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
12:04 < ChillerDragon> omg 
12:04 < ChillerDragon> wat a detour
12:05 < ChillerDragon> 0.6 protocol is the trollest
12:05 < ChillerDragon> it has sound world, sound global and a game msg and a snap item
12:48 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 lerato is half of the 0.7 dmg ind unset or am i blind? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/caeebaf4a0e08b96336ef9ac52e6a2dac2011359/src/game/server/eventhandler.cpp#L76-L89
12:48 < ChillerDragon> i See m_X, m_Y, and m_HealthAmount being set
12:49 < ChillerDragon> wat about m_ClientID, m_Amgle, m_Self, m_ArmorAmount? is that uninitialized memory or coming from somewhere else?
12:49 < ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/snap_items.html#event_damage
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, maybe those did not exist when I was making that nasty hack
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> I distinctly remember 0.7 version of damageind being a neutered version of the 0.6 one
13:01 < ChillerDragon> oh true thats brand new shit
13:01 < ChillerDragon> from 6yrs ago
13:02 < ChillerDragon> it seems to work anyways xd
13:03 < ChillerDragon> watafak its marked as unused in tw code!? 
13:03 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blame/a1911c8f7d8458fb4076ef8e7651e8ef5e91ab3e/datasrc/network.py#L252
13:03 < bridge> <learath2> If they added something new in it, idk what do. We can't send a bigger object to old 0.7
13:03 < ChillerDragon> so if they are really unset i do not understand why the code does not break
13:03 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:04 < ChillerDragon> because ddnet code already has these fields 
13:04 < ChillerDragon> and its using sizeof() the class
13:05 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/caeebaf4a0e08b96336ef9ac52e6a2dac2011359/datasrc/seven/network.py#L239-L245
13:06 < ChillerDragon> ``protocol7::CNetEvent_Damage *pEvent7 = (protocol7::CNetEvent_Damage *)s_aEventStore;``
13:06 < ChillerDragon> ``*pSize = sizeof(*pEvent7);``
13:06 < ChillerDragon> i patched in the additional field m_ClientID and it did send it just fine :)
13:07 < ChillerDragon> is the c++ struct maybe doing some smart defaults and sets everything to 0 so non intialized fields dont matter
13:07 < ChillerDragon> hm but its just casting not creating it
13:07 < ChillerDragon> yea idk
13:07 < ChillerDragon> code looks broken to me
13:07 < bridge> <sedonya> Is it possible to add a button to a Discord activity?
13:08 < ChillerDragon> i think no
13:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> changing passwords feels so scary :justatest:
13:08 < ChillerDragon> someone answered that already
13:18 < ChillerDragon> well idk someone asked about some custom button somewhere in discord already iirc either way idk what a activitiy is 
13:25 < ChillerDragon> @
13:25 < ChillerDragon> a
13:25 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:25 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat still doing pw stuff? 
13:25 < ChillerDragon> did you use some fancy base64 image encoding now? :D
13:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: im changing all my passwords :justatest:
13:26 < ChillerDragon> wowo
13:26 < ChillerDragon> security
13:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont need base64 thing
13:26 < ChillerDragon> imagine not rotating passwords via a daily cronjob
13:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> security? idk what is that i just have 1 passwords for all the websites
13:26 < ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD
13:27 < ChillerDragon> and now u rotate that 1 password to one new password? :D
13:27 < ChillerDragon> epic
13:27 < ChillerDragon> u got hacked?
13:27 < ChillerDragon> was your old pw ilikecats69?
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so i dont need base64 encoder, i can use .png image as file required to open password database
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i never got hacked
13:27 < ChillerDragon> sure sure
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nobody gives a fuck about me xd
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im noone
13:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> not even rich
13:28 < ChillerDragon> mood
13:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im preparing to be rich and successful xd
13:28 < ChillerDragon> nice
13:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 93 websites left :justatest:
13:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont even know those websites i use like 5 which require account :\
13:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ive never been hacked but i lost my steam account when someone sent scam steam link in this server xd
13:42 < ChillerDragon> xxxxD
13:42 < ChillerDragon> F
13:43 < ChillerDragon> did you enter your password there or wat happend @milkeeycat
13:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think i logged in somewhere and i think it was actually real steam and there was fukcing text like "if u enter ur password others can do with ur account whatever they want" but i was too blind when i saw "free" xd
13:47 < ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
13:47 < ChillerDragon> > im preparing to be rich and successful
13:47 < ChillerDragon> > but i was too blind when i saw "free"
13:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im not rich yet, so when i see "for free" i go full monke mode
13:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im not rich yet, so when i see "for free" i go full cave man mode
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just generated a password changed it on website and just realized i didnt save it in keepass -.-
13:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> hey milkey
13:49 < ChillerDragon> cyberfig
13:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> do you want ddnet client for fere
13:50 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
13:50 < ChillerDragon> sends amogus.zip
13:50 < bridge> <cyberfighter> its on my old laptop
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 2 e 😠
13:50 < ChillerDragon> oh tru cyber actually has a amogus client
13:51 < bridge> <cyberfighter> wtf does that do again i forgot
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk it too old doesnt compile anymore
13:54 < ChillerDragon> fred
13:54 < ChillerDragon> how to ping fred
13:54 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie sos explain code
13:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hi
13:55 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/7316077bd131e48e9b66e8ad747ef79638511974#diff-7e0a2abd9e284b400b03e461e21bd5b789b83afa10478be5d01d222a7af2daa4R58-R65
13:55 < ChillerDragon> u fast amazing
13:55 < ChillerDragon> wat dis code branch do
13:55 < ChillerDragon> why it there
13:55 < ChillerDragon> who triggers it
13:55 < ChillerDragon> i did not manage to trigger it
13:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make a fng style timer with damage indicator
13:55 < ChillerDragon> u got a srv with it up?
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
13:56 < ChillerDragon> sadge
13:56 < ChillerDragon> wat i need to send?
13:56 < ChillerDragon> i tried ClientID -9 or 80
13:56 < ChillerDragon> neither survived 
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk what you want
13:56 < ChillerDragon> both snap items randomly disappeared
13:56 < ChillerDragon> i want to ensure that ddnet 0.7 client properly supports this branch
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ic
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so why client ID -9 or 80
13:57 < ChillerDragon> because -9 is smaller than 0
13:57 < ChillerDragon> and 80 is bigger than 64
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh line 58
13:58 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is possible that it didn't make into release
13:58 < ChillerDragon> that line is there in teeworlds master branch
13:58 < ChillerDragon> but somehow i can not trigger it
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> isn't this still in 0.7.6 purgatory
13:58 < ChillerDragon> might be 
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did you compile a master branch version?
13:58 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:59 < ChillerDragon> and i added shit ton of dbg msgs
13:59 < ChillerDragon> in snapshot newitem() i get the dmg ind
13:59 < ChillerDragon> but when i later iterate on snap items to add effect it gone
13:59 < ChillerDragon> idk who deletes it
13:59 < ChillerDragon> but somehow dmg inds with clientids outside of that range do not stay in the snap
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> weird
13:59 < ChillerDragon> im clearly doing something wrong
14:00 < ChillerDragon> thats why ur server would help
14:00 < ChillerDragon> u got the code public?
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> master server supports it no?
14:00 < ChillerDragon> vanilla tw server does never send a client id outside of the range
14:00 < ChillerDragon> i tried with ddnet server
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ic
14:00 < ChillerDragon> i assume vanilla server would have the same result of not showing it
14:00 < ChillerDragon> do u remember which clientid u used?
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> -1
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably
14:01 < ChillerDragon> ok lemme try on a vani server with -1
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> have you not tho
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think vanilla server has any reason to trim netevent based on clientid tho
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it isn't snapshot. and netevent may or may not have clientid, there shouldn't be a code path that checks netevent's clientid's validity
14:03 < ChillerDragon> i hardcodet all dmg ind clientids to -1
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> has it worked
14:03 < ChillerDragon> vani client does not show indicators anymore
14:03 < ChillerDragon> and my ddnet 0.7 client does
14:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> master client or vanilla client
14:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> master client or vanilla release client
14:04 < ChillerDragon> vanilla master + dbg info 
14:04 < ChillerDragon> lemme try some apt tw client
14:04 < ChillerDragon> also shows nothing
14:04 < ChillerDragon> did u ever get ur timer to work?
14:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought i did
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's been a while
14:05 < ChillerDragon> i do not understand what vani does
14:05 < ChillerDragon> and why it doesnt fakin render
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it wasn't in release so i probably didn't bother make any server with that feature
14:05 < ChillerDragon> wat u suggest then
14:05 < ChillerDragon> for ddnet 0.7 client
14:05 < ChillerDragon> also dont render it?
14:05 < ChillerDragon> or render it
14:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually what message did you sent
14:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> pos, 1, 0, -1?
14:07 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/w9
14:07 < ChillerDragon> my latest test is this
14:08 < ChillerDragon> i rly do not understand how the vanilla client does not show it while reading the code
14:08 < ChillerDragon> the whole snap item disappears

14:09 < ChillerDragon> this is never hit
14:09 < ChillerDragon> oh yea this probably clamps it away
14:09 < ChillerDragon> i forgot where the code for that gets applied but that must be it
14:10 < ChillerDragon> so then the code you added is unreachable
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191730175575081022/image.png?ex=65a68037&is=65940b37&hm=5e44ea08eee91c084297c547c6ed6e7f7a1e91c14d3b1d44f328edd31a3293e6&
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yep
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i did
14:10 < ChillerDragon> and ddnet 0.7 does not validate strictly enough yet
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my bad
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:10 < ChillerDragon> troll
14:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly i just wanted to fix fng timer being wonky
14:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which would always send clientid in range
14:11 < ChillerDragon> i think ill just delete the code in ddnet 0.7
14:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe delete the dead code in teeworlds master as well
14:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:11 < ChillerDragon> yea
14:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if that is still a thing
14:11 < ChillerDragon> time to open another stale pr
14:12 < ChillerDragon> no its not a thing
14:12 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:12 < ChillerDragon> but i might do it anyways
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chiller moment

14:12 < ChillerDragon> thanks for explaining :)
14:12 < ChillerDragon> u helped a lot!
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly never checked protocol
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably because codegen is not that obvious to read
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oops almost commented with my alt github account

14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> github copilot wrote the whole thing. i'm not writting frontend stuff just to get a quick tool
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why does he have so much to say about tw
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is he. i thought he was french for some reason
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think magnus gave him the powers
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Dune is french
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe i was confused
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why did chiller change chat client tho

14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok don't wait
14:39 < ChillerDragon> i wait
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is not the right time
14:39 < ChillerDragon> omg
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to use this item
14:39 < ChillerDragon> dont leave me haning
14:39 < ChillerDragon> im on the edge of ma seat
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just contact matricks and kindly ask him about the future of tw or smth
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i trust in you
14:40 < ChillerDragon> thats not a philophical question
14:40 < bridge> <louis> i wonder what an extremely efficient captcha solve's hourly rate is
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
14:40 < ChillerDragon> jopsit!
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well who knows? maybe it is? maybe i implemented some meta question in it?
14:40 < ChillerDragon> fuck
14:40 < ChillerDragon> fr
14:40 < ChillerDragon> say it
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah it was bullshit xD
14:41 < ChillerDragon> omg
14:41 < ChillerDragon> ur not getting out of this
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> human? too low. machine? probably okay
14:41 < ChillerDragon> if u dont want public write it in #off-topic here https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just thought about the CSS hacking thing, but then i realized that this was just stupid xD
14:41 < ChillerDragon> u say it now
14:41 < ChillerDragon> or riot
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wowow chill
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chill the dragon in you
14:42 < ChillerDragon> im super nervous
14:42 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:42 < ChillerDragon> say it
14:42 < ChillerDragon> say it
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i was just thinking about if hacking and turing complete battle each other out
14:43 < ChillerDragon> ????xd
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like even if css is turing complete, without some kind of API for internet access, it's not really a hacker language.
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or in other words, if u can use CSS to hack, you can also use JSON to hack xD
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i told you it's bullshit
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you wanted to know so hard
14:43 < ChillerDragon> yes
14:43 < ChillerDragon> thank
14:44 < ChillerDragon> do you think sending magnus an email actually makes sense?
14:44 < ChillerDragon> he'll say "talk to oy"
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno. expressing your feelings sometimes help.. and sometimes it does the opposite
14:44 < ChillerDragon> u think sad images of cute kittens help?
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i guess only trying out will find out if it works out
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends
14:45 < ChillerDragon> yea im not in the state of mind to compose such an email rn
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fair enough
14:45 < ChillerDragon> im doing the Dune move
14:45 < ChillerDragon> who procrastinated 6 months to ping Oy
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i also rq, don't ping me pls
14:46 < ChillerDragon> ok
14:46 < ChillerDragon> jopstibobsti
14:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just used 3rd time in my life twitter and its so dogwater :pepeW:
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i cant change password coz im suspended and i need to verify but i cant verify because im suspended
14:51 < ChillerDragon> since elon took over its much more chill i feel
14:51 < ChillerDragon> i got banned from twitter and when i sent an email to support after elon took over they said "sorry uwu we unbanned u"
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> Not surprising you enjoy it more given how edgy you get sometimes
17:00 < ChillerDragon> i am brand safe
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks @learath2 @heinrich5991 do you think a thing like the borrow checker can be achieved without explicit lifetimes?
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean most code u write in rust is without explicit isn't it? If that amount of code is turning complete xd
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> a struct holding a ref to anything already has explicit lifetimes
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But u don't need that
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want a world without lifetimes obviously if it makes it easier
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why i asked
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if its possible
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> without perf drawbacks
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> structs needing explicit lifetimes was just added because people found it surprising to have lifetimes on structs without them specifying it
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It will work but is even more restrictive than rust I guess
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "can't the compiler just figure out the types" usually boils down to the halting problem
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. impossible in generality
17:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> another thing that changes when you add more type inference is that you'll get worse error message
17:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> another thing that changes when you add more type inference is that you'll get worse error messages
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> what about
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> a LLM based type inference and error message maker
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> just put AI at the problem kek
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> it would need to be a deterministic one tho
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> does current AI answer same if u ask same thing 2 times?
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's usually a toggle
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
17:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "heat" or so
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Some also allow to set the seed
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So you can control the "randomness"
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki u working on structs with lifetimes currently or what

17:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> must be >10 years old ^^
17:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i finally finished changing those focking passwords :pepeW:
17:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to upload it 😬
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it also work without "localhost" now or what did i miss xd
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't think so
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> someone linux network pro?
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure, maybe
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since my latest debian update broadcast messages don't work anymore for me
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chatgpt too stupid
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> my company is gonna make its own language
18:00 < bridge> <teero777> i only tried on localhost but i never noticed that feature. i always manuall reloaded
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ill be a founder dev on this project
18:00 < bridge> <teero777> was it in a recent update?
18:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> will it be open source :poggers2:

18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to be precise, broadcast to other PCs work

18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or LAN tab in ddnet not working
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you don't receive them?
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks hard. have you checked whether they appear in wireshark?
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nope
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> Another Cpp question:
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> ```cpp
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> struct A {
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr>     int *test;
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr>     [[nodiscard]] virtual int value() const = 0;
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr>     A(): test(new int{10}){}
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr>     virtual ~A() {};
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> };
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> 
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> struct B : public A {
18:04 < bridge> <stnwtr>     [[nodiscard]] int value() const override {
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>         return *test;
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>     }
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>     ~B() override {
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>         delete test;
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>     }
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> };
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> 
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> int main() {
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr>     B b;
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> }
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> ```
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> 
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> This would work, but is it somehow possible to leak memory? If somehow only `A::~A()` is called?
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> 
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> `virtual ~A() = 0` sadly does not work. And if I delete `test` inside `A::~A()` I'll double free `test`....
18:05 < bridge> <stnwtr> What is the best practice in this situation?
18:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you should probably only delete it in A, not in B
18:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then it'll happen in B automatically, too
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (also, using `std::unique_ptr` frees you from thinking about this at all)
18:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> someone have an archive of anime pictures? :justatest:
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ML people probably have large archives of that
18:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wanted to put many pictures and hide my passwords file there but am i a pussy to hide that. ill just make a repo with one file :justatest:
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> using a picture as a password is probably not a useful idea
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just use a diceware password
18:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have a password but also a file
18:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> not just a picture
18:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i feel like this shit should be good enough but still feels scary to upload it :justatest:
18:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> personally, I think you should do away with the file
18:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hm>

18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so apparently it's firewalld, disabling it fixes it
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i dont understand why it's blocking lan packages
18:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/anime :justatest:
18:42 < bridge> <furo321> Thanks for the passwords!
18:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all my passwords are there, good luck getting them -.-
18:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I hope you **generated** a secure master password
18:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i generated it, yeah
18:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> idk if 30chars is enough tho
18:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i will see :justatest:
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki did u already test:
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> written in rust
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 do you know what happens if you press cancel in windows firewall popup, e.g. for ddnet-server?
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> will it block all traffic for that port or does it still work for localhost / lan? xd
18:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oof, dunno
18:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's blocked
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i remember they have this weird "Private"/"Public" concept. but dunno if that is important for this popup
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> plugging in LAN cable was always automatically Private
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> WiFi you had to choose xd
18:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it is important for the concept
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i understand their idea behind it
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i wonder if that also affects firewall for "private"
18:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well anyway, this defs a downer for linux
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> KDE showed that no firewall was active
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i trusted it xd
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also didnt activate firewalld myself, so the update apparently added it
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it blocks LAN packages, i am using lan cable.
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so "normal" users would have a hard time
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i am using unstable debian.. so maybe it will be fixed xd
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or improved
19:06 < bridge> <robyt3> It adds a new "Block" rule to the firewall for that executable if you cancel the popup. Connecting to localhost and LAN address (locally) still works though.
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks
19:10 < bridge> <stnwtr> Ah, sounds good, thanks.
19:10 < bridge> <stnwtr> How would I do this using `std::unique_ptr`? I am pretty new to Cpp 😅
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the LAN tab also shows the server?
19:11 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would only be the question of other LAN devices see the server too
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or if windows simply sends a broadcast msg to itself
19:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Shouldn't work for other LAN devices or the firewall would be useless I guess
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well possible, but then windows is pretty smart about broadcast msgs
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well "smart"
19:28 < bridge> <teero777> 😭😭😭
