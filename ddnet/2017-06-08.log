11:43 < grenadepro> hey guys , as always i found a bug i think . i made a tile for admins (TILE_ADMIN) if you haven't admin rank you will die if you move on this tile .
11:45 < grenadepro> so when you vote to change map on new map (i have this tile too) while you are admin but you will die if you move on this tile.
11:47 < grenadepro> about stay on "Rcon" i think somthing wrong with map change .
11:48 <+Socialdarwinist> Your second sentence does not make sense, and the third is crippled.
11:48 < grenadepro> i downloaded the latest ddnet source from deen repo.
11:48 <+Socialdarwinist> Pix or it didn’t happen
11:49 < grenadepro> its clear.
11:49 < grenadepro> want
11:49 <+Socialdarwinist> No, nobody does understand what you have found or made.
11:49 < grenadepro> show you in server ?
11:49 <+Socialdarwinist> I do not even know what you want to show.
11:54 < grenadepro> 151.244.77.108:8303
11:54 < grenadepro> come here
11:55 < grenadepro> ill show you what i mean
11:58 < grenadepro> Socialdarwinist: are you there ?
11:58 <+Socialdarwinist> I am here
11:58 < grenadepro> come 151.244.77.108:8303
12:06 <+Socialdarwinist> We are getting into it
12:07 <+Socialdarwinist> So he has made a tile which only admins can use to go somewhere, but other tees die when they go into the tile. After map change the tile does not work anymore for the admin, he dies too. Only after logout and login it works as supposed.
12:08 <+Socialdarwinist> The bug does not happen with DDNet servers of version 10.6.1, but already of version 10.6.2
12:20 < grenadepro> sorry i got timeout
12:20 < grenadepro> Socialdarwinist: are u there ?
12:27 <+Socialdarwinist> Yes
12:28 < grenadepro> i found the bug
12:29 < grenadepro> come here 151.244.77.108:830
12:29 < grenadepro> oops
12:29 < grenadepro> 151.244.77.108:8303
12:31 < grenadepro> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L948
12:32 < grenadepro> :D its bool that return to m_Authed cant save your state as it was.
12:33 < grenadepro> must be revert to "m_apPlayers[ClientID]->m_Authed = ((CServer*)Server())->m_aClients[ClientID].m_Authed;"
12:42 < grenadepro> Socialdarwinist: right ?
12:42 <+Socialdarwinist> I don’t know, I am not a programmer.
