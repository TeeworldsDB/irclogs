00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes i know
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Soreu another victim
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757365106374869023/unknown.png
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to ping deen, looks like some other buffer overflow @deen
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well this is still the unofficial release
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the one from my pr?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but I guess this bug is in the official as well
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie got a settings_ddnet.cfg?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'll pm u @deen
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and does it happen all the time or just randomly?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah just this time
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but soreu had this bug before so I guess it's not that rare
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the only suspicious thing I see is that skin prefix is activated. @Soreu you have it on too?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he had it off i think
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757276230272811089/unknown.png
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no prefix rendered atleast
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> his skin names disappeared, mine were replaced with gibberish
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah almost looks like a static localize again xD
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering if the PNG might be loaded in an unexpected format? We write into Info.m_pData (skins.cpp) before checking the image format
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I just tried loading all skins from skin db locally, and valgrind is not complaining
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well libpng warned about some broken/old chunks, i dunno if pnglite can fail with it, but this isnt the problem here anyway
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> his skin top left should be in the selection too
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Psychowolfe
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, so you guess it's rather a bug in the skin menu, not the skins themselves
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, I see some static s_paSkinList
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because skins used to be static, but now they are not anymore...
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when we download more get added
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are quite a few people with custom skins on the server, could it be caused by something like one skin having a different bit depth or os?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are quite a few people with custom skins on the server, could it be caused by something like one skin having a different bit depth or so?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie @Soreu if the problem happens again, it probably disappears after toggling "Vanilla skins only" twice
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think it disappears after doing anything that refreshes the skin list
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that confirms my suspicion
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> I also had this weird bug, I guess I reported first
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> easy to fix, great that we found it
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> static (some regular expression to find localize) ;
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or was it the last xd
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nono, it wasn't localize
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ but before fixing it I still want to understand it better
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> s_paSkinList is static which is wrong there, but why do we access outside of it?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> btw a neat trick I found, not sure if this is intended: you can grab any skin from the database by using `player_skin` in f1
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i know, seems ok to me
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I use that all the time for testing üòÑ
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe it could be made into an actual feature so people don't have to download from the database and manually move the file
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would need to be a bit more fancy to get a list of all available skins
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean it's enough to look at it in the browser I guess
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's just faster to grab it ingame
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a text field wouldn't be hard, yeah
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> perhaps a link to the database
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ha, I got the bug
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> locally, with valgrind running
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757373455397027920/screenshot-20200921005129.png
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757373513274228896/skinvalgrind.txt
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> funny how only one got a custom color
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> What is valgrind?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the most useful tool for memory debugging
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ you understand the issue?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh not 100%
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same üòÑ
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π something you can use for finding undefined behavior in C
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand why LoadSkin is freeing m_pData, seemingly always
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and yet we mostly access it fine
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I'm not so familiar with the graphics stuff
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Will check again tomorrow morning, good night
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stale pointer to an array that grew?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> good idea actually
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> +1 for @Learath2
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen the static init uses the pointer of CSkin
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is later increased by downloaded skins
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cskin array is the dynamic list
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I updated client since i can bind Ctrl shift q again thx acqwerty
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> does it work in menu
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie ^
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> try to remember what u did if u find bugs
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> helps for reproducing later üòÑ
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757460136829649026/unknown.png
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @murpi could you send me the map (background) aswell? üòÑ
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> glad you guys solved the issue with skins :p
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the custom map BG in menu is already in 15.0.4 or latest beta needed?
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah, i just tested the pull request
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @abcqwerty no, only F-binds work in menu
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ‚ú™ If you manage to add to DDNet the same renderer that Vanilla 0.7+ uses, dilate would no longer be needed, right?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ddnet renderer should be better
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Let's make console renderer
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 any ideas about mac input problems? https://steamcommunity.com/id/parriseinstein/recommended/412220/
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then differently asked: can we get rid of the damn dilate at some point soon? xd
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need to switch workspaces once after launch and the dock goes away and everything works
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That sounds unintuitive, any way we can fix that in code?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not much we can do about any of the issues as SDL support on macOS is shit
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't debug it at all
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are welcome to try if you want
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it's the same problem with other SDL2 apps?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have any other SDL2 app to check actually. Let me find one
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we just need to grab focus more agressively?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also noticed once on Windows it wasn't focussed
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I had to click in the window
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me see the current state when I launch from steam, see if it regressed
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hum, my steam library isn't loading at all on mac
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that I think about it, this guy seems to be lying, how did he join a server to see that chat is blocked when no buttons even responded
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe mouse worked a bit?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The current state is that you need to switch workspaces and it starts working, before that mouse clicks don't seem to be caught
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sometimes pressing F1 twice works too
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do we regrab the mouse after f1?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we can do that when the game is fully launched
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Input()->MouseModeRelative(); I think
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which does:
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_TRUE);
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     Graphics()->SetWindowGrab(true);
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So let's just add another SetWindowGrab(true) after the initialization of window is done?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This seems to be some race condition somewhere. Sometimes I can see the OS cursor too, at that point I can't grab the mouse with just double f1
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah we can try a grab after the initialization
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we don't have to set relative mouse mode again
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw can we let the mouse escape the window if esc is pressed too?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we could, not sureif we want to
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the mouse sensitivity feels a bit different then
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and might have muscle memory and accidentally click the wrong button
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, since we get the os cursor. Yeah not the greatest idea
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u got factorio,made with sdl2
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well not open source tho
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh the github artifact crashes instantly
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also other versions or my change makes it crash?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can build you a nightly or you can build yourself?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's just my bug that sdl still hasn't merged the fix for
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just build it myself, with my own sdl
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, there is a different grabbing issue when I launch it
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me try to replace the steam one and launch from steam
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I build it myself I get a completely different grabbing issue
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The cursor starts at the very top left, seems it grabbed fine, when you go to click something it clicks the apple logo at the top bar instead
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen would be nice if you could build a nightly so I can test that
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Number of skins of DDNet Skin Database is reducing, may I know why? I'm just curious
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF Soreu, Ravie, louis are cleaning it up to remove non-teeish and ugly skins
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Nice
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since they are auto-downloaded now quality is more important
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Talking about skin auto-download, is this resource working right now? I mean, is ddnet-skins package not needed anymore?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was a bug with it so we disabled it, but it should work in the next patch again
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we didn't disable it
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, then it sort of works right now, it will work much better next patch üòÑ
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen why add_unsorted?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because the original array is sorted already, so if we just filter out elements we don't need to resort
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, makes sense
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there is still a bug here, you better compare the filter properly, or use a flag
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, nvm. This should work
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 can you try https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-osx.dmg ?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, the same thing happens with this build too
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The current one on steam doesn't behave like this, do you remember what commit we built that from?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nightly on steam or regular?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's tagged in git
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> regular on steam
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> c2f388a52ba1458b5dd10557826c42e1b89f351b
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the regular, clicks just won't work until I double f1 or switch workspaces
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the new builds it does the top left corner thing
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I wonder if it's the bundled SDL the steam version links to
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, it's SDL 2.0.13
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll bisect for it in SDL later. #2897 doesn't help sadly @deen
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2897
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> How do I download skin? Didn't find a "Download skin option.
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @RafaelFF it downloads automatically
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well for other people
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can set your own skin to something you don't have with `player_skin xyz` in f1 for now
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF settings -> skins -> download skins
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there some padding before chunks?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what chunks?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know the decompression works fine because I can see the token at the end, but the chunk header being all 0s makes no sense
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Net chunks
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no idea, sorry
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does a net chunk with 00 00 header make sense to anyone?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> maybe name it "auto-download skins"?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Thanks @deen
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah a chunk header with 00 00 makes no sense, I'm using the wrong offset
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu is auto dilate not enough?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yes and no
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> new dilate makes the image file size bigger
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> with 0.7 dilate is not needed and so the map can weight less
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> info from @mind though
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, but 0.7 converts images on runtime.. That's the trade
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But idc. Somebody can add ofc
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757581507345907893/Screenshot_2020-09-21-14-38-15-929_com.discord.jpg
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mind hope you don't **_mind_** sharing part of our conversation
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Strange in my pm he gave green light, seems like he is not happy
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Because we both are, but due to the different rendering ways in DDNet & Vanilla, one could have same file without dilate being lighter
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and that's the annoying part
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> not your fault tho
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean the file size thing can be easily removed. It's only a few KB tho
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> whoever cares more, always tires to reduce map size as much as possible
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or lowered
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah BTW, maybe dilate has less aggressive PNG options than gimp or what u use.. I'll look into this later
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> No idea what mind is using, Ravie uses Inkscape & Gimp, Louis uses Gimp too I think, and I'm stuck on Photoshop and one lil crap that is pretty much advanced paint (depending on the needs ^^')
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> feel free to ping when you need any info
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i use inkscape and paint.net kek
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe i should learn gimp
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if its more about drawing than editing for you, then you could maybe check out https://krita.org/en/
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> <3 gimp too tho
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and https://vectr.com/ ^^
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Actually, maybe I'd switch from ocassionally launching AI to full-time using Vectr... :tee_thinking:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Patiga Krita looks far better then the software I have used long time ago for ~this kind of stuff üëç
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome :)
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ArtRage, reminded myself the name xd
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I can relate to the second part of its name
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent an hour debugging because matricks got the bit shifting the wrong way around...
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If anyone else wants to chop up teeworlds packets, it's not size_seq, it's seq_size, which makes it a PITA to read in wireshark because it's not contiguous
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> flags_size seq_size
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/packet.md
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this info here?
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, should have checked that instead of relying on ancient documentation in comments
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Q: How many projectiles and/or powerups I cand give within one snapshot before it will cause troubles?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *with
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *within? :panic: :send_help:
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should ask that to @fokkonaut
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is a serverside limit only which can be increased to your wishes iirc
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But a snapshot is still have to fit into a UDP packet? or not?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or is it getting split/reassembled by a game proto?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so... it's never a problem, right?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A packet can't be larger than NET_MAX_PAYLOAD
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A chunk can't be split
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I knew that! It should fit into IP packet.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But what it is a chunk? Snapshot is being sends in chunks so it reassembles on arrival by a client?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if you only manage to fit one snapshot within the packet, you'll have NET_MAX_PAYLOAD - <packet header size> - <chunk header size> - <message header>
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Did window focus options change between 15.0.1 and 15.0.4?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> because after launch I can't move mouse unless I click first
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But there is a problem there, compression helps this a bit, so you can't really know if it fit or not
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> By a compression you mean delta?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Both delta and huffman compression will help there
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> all that "full snapshots" vs "delta snapshots" thing?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > So if you only manage to fit one snapshot within the packet
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So my real question is do I have to fit everything in one packet?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And what will happen when my snapshot will get larger than 1392 bytes including headers etc after all compression applied.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, it's not happening all the times, weird
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck packets will get dropped, you'll have a bad time
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have some weird sporadic lags in my mod after addition of some new pickups icons.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh... so it must be it.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you can safely ignore the effects of delta compression, as being unable to send full snapshots will break it anyway
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Shouldn't a server complain about this in server logs or somewhere else?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck it does
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu hasn't changed, but we want to fix it in next release
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `dbg_msg("netserver", "packet payload too big. %d. dropping packet", pChunk->m_DataSize);`
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, weird then because I haven't had that problem before xD
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> idk, anyway got more weird problem with server
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Soreu my DDNet client started to freeze on close for 5 seconds ~2 weeks ago after an update. Very annoying.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Everyone is telling that it's just me.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> if I launch server from its own exe, it launches `autoexec_server.cfg` which then loads `myServerconfig.cfg` pointing to & loading `server\config.cfg`
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but... if I launch server via client, with the Start Server button, it doesn't load `myServerconfig.cfg` because settings in `server\config.cfg` are not applied at all
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> how the hell is that possible?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL europe is trying to make processors? https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu/
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pure_luck Can't relate with your problem, sorry :justatest:
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh lol, found what was causing the difference... kid of
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> changing from
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> `exec server/config.cfg`
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> to
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> `exec server\config.cfg`
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> made it execute the command properly regardless of whether server was started directly or via client ._.
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> whatever
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Ryozuki I wonder what will they do now when NVidia bought ARM.
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> They will use RISC perhaps. Anyway I don't think we will see those processors any soon.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or that hey will be interesting for regular consumers like us.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> We have Elbrus processor in Russia. And nobody can buy it except military.
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I know closing server on client close was requested, but is there option to disable this feature? . . .
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu nope, just run it outside of client
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's a bit ugly because then the original client process can't quit
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we have too many options already, guarantees that there are combinations of those options that have bugs when used together
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yea, k
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that's not a big problem
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this is good enough to release for now
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757597854092099629/Screenshot_2020-09-21_at_16.43.04.png
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It currently only does 0.6 and ddnet because I kinda nuked the 0.7 part when the stupid chunk size kept being wrong
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Such amazing work
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is this dissector available already?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I want to finally look into teeworlds traffic to finally understand what's going on üòÑ
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and to estimate snapshot entities sizes and limit too
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've spend a week relocating my server from Moscow to Frankfurt then back and then to Amsterdam to finally get today that it's related to a small addition of an extra pickup in a snapshot.
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will put it up today, but just because @heinrich5991 asked to take a look, it's not ready yet
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No haste ofc.
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It still needs decoding of the actual chunks and wrapping up the conversation tracking feature so I can dissect 0.7 traffic too
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is it in C++ or a python?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wireshark only allows C or lua dissectors
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't want to port the huffman code to lua, so C it is
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and I kinda love C so it's a perfect fit) üòÑ
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> idk if u answered me already @Learath2 but are you planning to get it into official wireshark?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It needs much work before it's ready for that, but sure
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> sure and nice
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw, I like how wireshark has memory pools, it's a cool idea
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You allocate memory in specific pools that has specific lifetimes, so it's ghetto garbage collection
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I know that opinion will not be popular here, but I hope one day every language will have a GC
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GC costs waaay too much
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's unacceptable for high performance applications
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There are many high-performance applicatoins in Java and C#.
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Java keeps it's entire memory pool hot, so the kernel can't swap it away, ever, even if you rarely ever use the data. So it can have decent performance, at the cost of horrible memory usage
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But didn't meant to start a holywar. Just it's hard to get from interpreted languages like Ruby or GC ones like C# to C++ and get all kinds of obscure and hard to detect/track and debug memory corruption and access errors.
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It also throws off prefetch
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I can write application in ruby that will preallocate a memory that will be reused but never GC. Just I rarely need it.
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only implementation of GC that I like is in go-lang
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yeah, and golang.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has great performance, without much extra overhead
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's just I never know why my app will segfault next time. And when it does sometimes there is nothing useful in coredump.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've learned about ASAN but still it's hard. So much troubles on memory management.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There is teesharp which is performant enough. I would love to use sharp. Machine resources are cheaper than my time.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck there are ways of achieving memory sanity without any performance penalty
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ofc, it's just have a steep learning curve.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wiresharks pool approach is really cute imho
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've started to make Unity project with grown very big and never hard any memory-related problems.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Last month I am just debugging them and learn about yet another way a memory could get corrupted without being noticed in C++.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Memory can't get corrupted in C or C++ unless you touch the memory
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One of the beauties of C/C++/Rust is that they don't do things behind your back
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will learn everything eventually ofc, smart pointers and such. But for now language is getting on my way.
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yeah, I wish that memory management patterns would get to my programmers subconcious already to this moment.
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This is my first C++ project, so I get all problems a noob could get in an old enough C++ project.
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In infCroya there are no smart pointers, not even nullptr. Just integers.
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will rewrite this as soon I will grasp this. Just with things could be easier for me.
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Being a C++ programmer for me always was a macho dream üòÑ
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's just too lowlevel for leisure.
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was looking into redoing teeworlds with smart pointers, but who owns what isnt really easy to figure out
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Leisure is subjective
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ofc, it's depends on your goals too.
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how everything is predictable in these low level languages
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If you want to make an experience and framework and language are just tools then you could complain if they're having a steep learning curve.
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If your goal to challenge yourself into learning something hard then it's a leisure already and small result and imrovements are nice.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Don't mind me. I will get used to it or will just switch to something more rewarding in time.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> At least C++ syntax wasn't hard. Just memory management side effects are.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's a chad language after all üòÑ
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If your goal is to make an experience then framework and language are just tools and you could complain if they're having a steep learning curve.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If one's goal is to make an experience then framework and language are just tools and one could complain if they're having a steep learning curve.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ah, I am editing my messages here again on reflexes. Time to leave, thanks
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 too large snapshots aren't a problem due to the thing you specified
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they get broken up into more packets
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Jupstar ‚ú™  @Soreu  My dilemma was if I should predilate the images or not, since a lot of people are still mapping with old client versions (so predilate is usefull) while on the other hand there actually is a 0.7 mapping scene and the filesize would be up to 40% bigger for them. Removing dilate for newer versions won't solve this at all. In the end I decided to just predilate the images and I'm super happy with the new autodilate.
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 see SNAP, SNAPSINGLE, SNAPEMPTY net messages
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is there a command line utility to see if map is compatible with 0.6/ddnet BTW?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I keep accidentally overwriting my 0.6 maps with 0.7 editor. Would love to have this check in my deployment pipeline
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> or finally add 0.7 map support to ddnet
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.7 map incompatibility is my fault, sorry
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and retrospectively, not even for a good reason üò¶
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> fix it then :p
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can never fix it, will always have to support the new format üò¶
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats what i ment support the new stuff in ddnet is a fix for me
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> problem solved
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> We have convert to 07 utility. Just convert to 06 and which_version tools are missing.
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> We have convert to 07 utility. Just convert_to_06 and which_version tools are missing.
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Does 0.7 map format have something new that ddnet doesn't have or just or just 0.7 strips some compatibility data blocks?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has my awesome compression
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Any simple ways of knowing if the map 0.6 compatible?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Like some keyword or a header flag?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> checking rn
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 really? I thought snaps needed to fit into chunks too and we can't split chunks
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> snaps get split into multiple chunks
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *can get split into multiple chunks
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yep, didn't know that
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess no limit
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Can a snapshot of individual entity within a server snapshot be split too?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> snaps have an inherent limit though
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or there are no big entities and they cannot grow?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 64KiB I think
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is it to limit bandwidth and guarantee a rate?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Update rate
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also if snapshot splits then I suppose the client has to wait before it could reassemble
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, for all packets that contain the snap
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If a client will get a packet with a chunk for a newer snapshot while it is aggregating older one's chunk to assemble will those chunk be just discarded?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean older ones
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That would lean to ordering problem in UDP
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess the old chunks will be discarded
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'd have to read the source to be sure
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, discards all old partial data if new data arrives
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So when snapshot grows there are more chances it will have some sort of error... racing condition
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No... that it will have higher chances of not to finish assuming when getting newer snapshot packet out of order
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, out of order
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Up does not guarantee order of packets
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we wait 50ms between two snapshots
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> packets don't delay randomly, they usually take the same route, and usually even arrive in the same order AFAIK
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So older snapshot could consist of so many packets that server will start generating and sending a newer snapshot before client will assemble old one
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really, to my understanding
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, mostly they will be in order ofc
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean the packet would have to get delayed by 50ms to get a chance to be interleaved with the next snapshot
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or have a lag spike for 50 ms + have multiparty routing anywhere on its way, right?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *multipart
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Multipath
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Which is common for the internet
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it common that packets take different paths?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK no
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Anyway it works surprisingly well irl
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a citation for that (don't have one for my gut feeling)?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I worked in ISP, channels get aggregated all the time
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. that packets send in time proximity routinely take different paths
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Could take yes
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym could take?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they don't actually routinely take different paths, then there's no issue, no?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Depends on channel aggregation algo
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Sometimes its just every consequent packet gets a new route
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But some try to maintain a route
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> For a stream (ip src+dest combination)
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.openmymind.net/How-Unreliable-Is-UDP/
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Otherwise you would get into troubles with up sooner I guess
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently quite bad about the ordering
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check table # of ordered packets
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, but irl for internet backbone router it is cheaper to emulate streams of ip packets
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's why situation is not that horrible for us
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also 50 ms delay helps a lot
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But the more congested the bandwidth for a server or a client the worse situation will get anyway
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe thats why there is magic 64 kb limit
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I could emulate out of order delivery with some network tools and test if u curious
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> 64k is just the size of the buffer, which is used for building the snapshots. What the server sends is usually way less, thanks to delta snaps and compression.
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Ordering isn't a problem. Chunks within one tick are numbered. And chunks for older ticks are just dropped.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So it's just all chunks should arrive in a 50ms time window.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Yeah. Otherwise the client will just use the next one
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/teedissect/blob/master/packet-teeworlds.c
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So it means that server will get problems with internet bandwidth of 10 Mbps if 64KB will be sent every 50ms
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's quite messy right now, but I need  to take a break. Might aswell leave it as is for now
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I assume it's not gets full in general
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Sending 64kb raw UDP data every 50ms to all clients isn't the best idea :D
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Java keeps it's entire memory pool hot, so the kernel can't swap it away, ever, even if you rarely ever use the data. So it can have decent performance, at the cost of horrible memory usage
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think linux works around this with overcommit iirc
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My server sends that easily with a lot of custom entities
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But it's a sum for all players
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Don't think so. The server only sends what the tee can see. And it only sends what changed since last tick
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Debug mode has a field that shows the transfer rate I think
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> A lot of thing could change in my mod. I have circles drawn via particles moving in circles
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And they update their position every snapshot
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though it was never a problem
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think I have a lot of headroom yet
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Still... Delta snaps, int pack and Huffman can reduce that a lot
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But would like to check it
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki overcommit helps with reducing the usage of memory, it doesn't help with the memory never being able to get swapped out. So you still need a lot of ram
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Delta cannot pack anything if every entity have different coordinates I think
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Delta can only help if an object hasn't changed
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But yes, it's not causing problems yet
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Well before adding 20+ more entities
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> But it compares the old entity with the new one and only sends the difference.
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Using int pack and Huffman makes that rather small
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Projectiles essentially have nothing but a vel and pos which are not constant in sfx particles
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I update them every snapshot to format a circle
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And it looks nice
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> To form
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And circle is rotating, I will show you how it look later
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Still the coordinates don't change that much. It only sends the difference since last snap and not the absolute coordinates
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Then compressions will help ofc
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am curious now to see actual size of my snap )
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Most of the time int pack can reduce each of these integer values to one byte, since the difference since last snap is kinda small
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It can bee seen in a debug hud, right?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Not the actual size of the snap but the average send rate I think
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Server tick is 1/50 right?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I can just divide it by 5o and get snapshot size.
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Yeah but by default it only sends 25 times per second
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hmm... TIL
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok  thanks
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> You have a server running?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Protocol issues were a nightmare for such amateur modder as I am
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just I am not at PC atm
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> BTW if I am sending a projectile 1 snapshot but not on consequent, will it be removed by a client or will it be handled by a prediction?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I want to switch from pickup free taxi indicator to temporary projectile ones
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> projectiles don't even have prediction
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hmm... but they have curves? Or are they server-side only?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> and the client only predicts what is included in the last snapshot
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the curve is calculated based on the tick and the start pos+vel
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> has the advantage that the snaps do not change
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hm... so proj snap have start tick and start vel and pos and it does not change in later snapshots?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I see why it is compressed nicely
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That means that client calculate ballistic isn't it?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (Server too to get hits)
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/hkd0ze/question_about_what_to_do_when_malloc_fails/ interesting threas
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thread
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Pure_luck infNext? with 2 rotating circles and a few tees on screen it's ~14 kB/s for me
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> You are also sending lasers and projectiles when there is nothing on my screen
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> the table in debug mode shows what is updated in the snaps
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, I don't know why it sends every reserved entity every tick
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thats a good find I've thought that wa normal in tw )
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for testing
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 14 kBps on almost empty server would become much larger when special weapons will be used
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But thanks for the starting point
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will investigate it further
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> When I add katana pickup above character head as a sign of activated taxi function it starts to lag... sometimes on 10+ players
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I was thinking I am getting some limits
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe I still get them, I'll check it
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks gods I have now chillerbot pentest tools so I can reproduce a load locally and not to wait for players
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ChillerDragon thanks
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hover seems broken for the clear buttons of the filter lines
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be fixed
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember reporting it on a pr
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it prob isnt merged yet
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2880#issuecomment-695760260>
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u update ur fork
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I was on a branch
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-next-month/
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> YAY we finally did it boys, the ceo of racism is dead
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lola topkek
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Existing repositories that have "master" set as the default branch will be left as is.
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill change my new repos to use master
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fuck the system
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they should just donate to blm charities instead of changing stuff that's been like that for forever
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if they want to help
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its sjw public relations
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sjw? xd
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha look a corporation cares about my rights haha
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill now proceed to love it
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis sjw means social justice warrior
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i know
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> social warrior of justice
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what github is doing is purely Virtue signalling
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love this word
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like it
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> master sounds stupid xd
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> BLM isnt against racism, its literal a racist movement
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> White sjws like nouis dont check that
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> trollsti
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what github is oding is like twitter people changing their pfp to the french flag when a terror attack happens
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Virtue signalling
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think main sounds better than master as well but i heard it messed some things up?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most cringy ppl
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok konsti send evidence as to why blm is racist then maybe i'll listen to u
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/10458
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > hello, as a man of non-white background (a mix of brown, black, and white), the removal of "slave" and "blacklist" from the source code itself feels racist.
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :kek:
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me its not about racism or smth, master just sounds like the wrong word
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it normal
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno main branch sounds more fitting imo
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-team-approves-new-terminology-bans-terms-like-blacklist-and-slave/
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2020
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a lovely year
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean whats wrong with it, they rename stuff, bcs the words are stupid anyway
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah lets use requester/responder
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of master/slave
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "director/performer"
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we are in a circus
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but master slave is better? XD
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Agree with @Jupstar ‚ú™ , it seems a bit like fanboys and haters. I guess it's easier to care about such small things as naming than the more important things
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange argument
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> master slave feels normal
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes u are used to it
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can give any word a bad meaning
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> primary/secondary
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds logical for me
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> master/slave too sounds logical
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well idc about naming, aslong its intuitive üòÑ
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like they pretend bits and bytes have feelings or something
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Considering that "git" means idiot, all the other weird names fit in well üòÑ
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in what language does it mean that?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> english
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ironical, bcs without git, our software projects were handled by gits xd
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which means "unpleasant person" in British English slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[24][25] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker

19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> gitos
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you have 8 gits, do you have 1 gyte?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu btw have u tested the new editor
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need ppl to test, if i broke smth
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> what new editor, what am I missing again lately? xD
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no not new editor sry, just the new rendering in it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2894
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the game layer looks funny
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so clear xd
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you think there are still ppl with 0.6 vanilla playing on ddnet servers?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a few, yes
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, bcs today we had the debate with dilate again
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.7 uses premultiplied alpha colors
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that saves a bit file size
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a few KB probably don't matter that much
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, thats also why i added dilate to the editor
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so nobody has to care
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, skin creators, game skin creators still have to care
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut have u tried #2874 btw?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2874
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> have you noticed that the game is about twice longer stays at pos 0,0 when you connect the server for the first time (seems like initialization stuff going on). Comparing to 14.7.1
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it takes almost a second for me. Probably we should show loading screen litle bit longer
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " that the game is about twice longer"
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does this mean
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there a loading bar for connecting to server?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> have you noticed that the game stays at pos 0,0 twice longer after you connected to the server for the first time (seems like initialization stuff going on). Comparing to 14.7.1
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or what do u mean by loading screen
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or just uses more ticks before rendering
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757655442313838592/unknown.png
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that takes longer is probs bcs its building the map when onmapload is called
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> When I connect to the server my camera shows game at position 0.0 for a second
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah so after the loading screen?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u tried on older ddnet servers? maybe its not client side
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but it is "so slow" only for the first connect. When I reconnect to the server everything is fine
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes I tried 14.7.1
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the same but for 14.7.1 it shows about for a 0.3 sec
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah nvm thought server side, buts its only once, so nvm
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yeah I need to reload the game to reproduce
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yeah I need to restart the game to reproduce
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ‚ú™ not yet, but from the code i read on the train i think its good
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will try it rn
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ty
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does anyone have png exports of all ddnet client-shipped skins
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/data/skins
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like, rendered
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> what
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ‚ú™ works, thanks
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alright
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @abcqwerty like how it would look ingame
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> you could download client and just look at skin list
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @louis
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757668185242599434/Jdb19W87FXI5dbU2krgFgC1lZSH5t0CwEOCre1tbwFQW0l5aN4tADwk2Nre9hYAtZWUhb9H8gYspttRcY1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like this?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if yes: https://ddnet.tw/skins/
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that page uses the skin aseembler iirc
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its somewhere open src i believe
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757668382190600352/Zn8sAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> actually pretty nice to use as "emojis" in discord
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh neat
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> but then you have to find which ones in the skin database are in ddnet client
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> if they are shipped with DDNet client by default, they are in database too
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757671420229582968/PsychoWolfe.png
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ye but it also includes extra
22:43 <+SnowFox> Jupstar: Your theory-patch worked. Thanks. :)
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice üòÑ
22:52 <+SnowFox> Jupstar: The patch fixes 1.1.0 internally, but it uses a 3.0 context. Should it use more features or did it not really anyway?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think sdl just defaults to EGL 3.0 or smth, and ddnet just shows it as opengl 3.0
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or did u not change the config?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it just creates EGL 3.0 with compability
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that should be fine too, internally the patch should only call 1.0 functions
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that should be fine too, internally the patch should only call 1.1 functions
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see a month passed :monkalaugh:
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> joke xD
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we just need the skin fix, thats why xd
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen want the screen config in? on kog there was another person complaining bcs he didnt find the setting
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen want the home screen config in? on kog there was another person complaining bcs he didnt find the setting
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki it's supposed to be a bug fix release, i don't think the big changes you talked about made it in
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And I didn't see any super-high-risk changes, so I didn't want to branch off
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/15.0.4...master>
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure what you guys meant by "not rushing". I can also delay the bugfix release if that makes the community happy
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> honestly most ppl dont even notice when on steam
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its always 10 ppl complaining
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I considered not doing the bugfix release since the skin bug is not too bad
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe a bug fix can be merged fast, but big features should definitly be tested more i guess
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might crash, but haven't heard anyone say so
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the best would be to have someone with a old pc able to test too tho
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki even with testing edge cases arent always seen easliy
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the skin download bug
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it being static
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. for the skinprefix it had to exceed a specific length
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was it rly that hidden?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say not very intuitive
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could have found it sure
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki let's see how many bugs the release candidates will find in the future
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hard to predict and depends on how many people participate and how thoroughly they search
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> okay
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will definitly try to test
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for example if jupstar makes a graphic change we should definitly get someone with a old pc to test it
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ... i tried
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but most ppl prefer not to answer
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only this brazilian guy did
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then it was quickly fixed
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant simulate a old pc right?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forcing openg 1 would not be the same
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant simulate broken drivers, no xD
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, most players are 12-16 year old kids, so it's no surprise they are not the best bug reporters üòÑ
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2894/files> this definitly looks like a big change that may need to be tested xd
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i valgrind and test few cases always
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and tried all opengl contexts
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not in the release
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i know
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i just got a weird error starting client
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757717317604999268/message.txt
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i what version
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, rebuilding client fixed it. Maybe I just mixed some old client version with new shaders
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nevermind then
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah makes sense
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use the shader for opengl 3.3 now too
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this x has never been centered right? xD

23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw i added text render flags for such things
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_X_BEARING = 1<<0,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_Y_BEARING = 1<<1,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_ONLY_ADVANCE_WIDTH = 1<<2,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_PIXEL_ALIGMENT = 1<<3,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_KERNING = 1<<4,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_OVERSIZE = 1<<5,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_FIRST_CHARACTER_X_BEARING = 1<<6,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     TEXT_RENDER_FLAG_NO_LAST_CHARACTER_ADVANCE = 1<<7,
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can basically enable almost all
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it should be centered more
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok noit the first two xd
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and maybe also not the 4th xd
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but they can controll things for single characters
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i added them for the gui icon font
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always when i set fsaa to 16 and restart it resets to 8
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not related to this release tho
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs ur driver doesnt allow more
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mine just completly ignores it for some reason
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ is multisampling enabled?
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u mean in shaders?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4262:        SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_MULTISAMPLESAMPLES, FsaaSamples);
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4267:        SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_MULTISAMPLESAMPLES, 0);
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this really fsaa?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks to me like its MSAA
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should we have a separate channel for reporting bugs (for the release candidate)?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont know much about this
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah why not
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think MSAA is just one possibility
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can also do super sampling
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. for the ffmpeg it might be nice to have framebuffers at higher resolution, so we can export in any format
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Most modern GPUs support 2√ó, 4√ó, and 8√ó MSAA samples.
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the 8 cap makes sense
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put it under #developer
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the only problem i see is, that announcements will be flooded by releases, while its more for actual announcements
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can create another category, "development" which can have 3 channels, announcements, discussion, bugs, if u do that u should move this channel and rename it to discussion i guess, to keep the webhook
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe its not needed
