00:03 < Savander> so deen, could you add information to zcatch about looking for moderators?. Mods don't have that much, we can test them.
00:04 <@deen> Savander: not sure how to "add information"
00:04 <@deen> prepare something for me and i'll apply it :P
00:04 < Savander> t
00:04 < Savander> in config
00:04 < Savander> command
00:04 < Savander> add_info "message"
00:04 < Savander> like others
00:05 <@deen> i removed the other info messages
00:05 <@deen> they were annoying
00:05 <@deen> and what should i write?
00:09 < Savander> something like, DDNet looking for moderators on zCatch. Send application on forum in thread called "zCatch looking for moderators" in official servers. 
00:09 < Savander> btw. i have to go.
00:09 <@deen> ok, bye
00:09 < Savander> add_info "message" "delay" ?
00:09 < Savander> don't remember this second value

16:17 < o_be_one> hi all
16:17 < o_be_one> deen, yes i have
16:17 < o_be_one> oh serious 
16:17 < o_be_one> about tune 
16:18 < o_be_one> ok just seen you already did a tune_reset
16:19 < o_be_one> it's my fault, ive forget to tune_reset yesterday (sometime when we are less than 20, i do a "fun moment" for some minutes, i was doing that when i was hosting blmapv3royal, and cause many players ask that i do this again, i offer this but prevent all annoying)
20:22 < Nazar> deen?
20:22  * Nazar slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
20:22  * Nazar slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
20:22 <@deen> Nazar: you want something every few hours now?
20:22 < Nazar> Sure, why not all 5 minits?
20:23 < Nazar> Than not :)
20:52 <@EastByte> hmm, no idea what mouse sense I should use
20:55 < o_be_one> hard to find ^^
20:57 <@deen> 100?
20:57 <@deen> but then i never tried changing it :P
21:12 <@EastByte> I played with 130 most of my time
21:13 <@EastByte> and now I tried 80
21:13 <@EastByte> I'll try 100 now
21:29 <@deen> Nim 0.11 should be released soon, then I can release my NES emulator
21:30 <@deen> But the most important question remains: Should it be called NimES or NimNES?
21:31 < laxa> EastByte: if you have a mouse that allows you to change the DPI
21:31 < laxa> you should use 100 in teeworlds
21:31 < laxa> and change the DPI of your mouse
21:31 < laxa> less calculation on the mouse sensibility is considered the best in games
21:32 < laxa> that's my 2 cents, as an old hardcore gamer, I searched some informations to optimize my settings
21:35 <@EastByte> yea, my mouse has a dpi up/down key
21:35 <@EastByte> but only 4 modes and the gap is too large
21:35 < laxa> what's your mouse ?
21:35 <@EastByte> RAT3
21:35 < laxa> wtf
21:35 < laxa> shjould have a software to access those DPI settings
21:35 <@EastByte> on linux? :P
21:35 < laxa> well
21:36 < laxa> those settings are supposed to be stored in the mouse
21:36 < laxa> so, maybe you need a windows to configure it nicely
21:36 < laxa> than you are down
21:36 <@EastByte> I would need to check the settings on a windows machine then
21:36 < laxa> Maybe
21:36 < laxa> I use 2400 DPI on my mouse I think
21:36 < laxa> I keep it in every game
21:36 < laxa> FPS / moba / RTS
21:37 < laxa> all cs:go pro players use 400 or 800 DPI and adjust the ingame sensitivity
21:37 < laxa> with a raw_input thing
