12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 do you know what the `m_aTexcoords[4]` from the `CQuad`  struct are for?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> struct CQuad
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> {
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     CPoint m_aPoints[5];
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     CColor m_aColors[4];
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     CPoint m_aTexcoords[4];
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     int m_PosEnv;
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     int m_PosEnvOffset;
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     int m_ColorEnv;
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     int m_ColorEnvOffset;
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> };
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess for UV mapping
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> whats UV?
12:39 <@Learath2> U and V are the X and Y in the coordinate space of the texture
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The quads are rendered with wrapping, so whatever image you have is repeated infinitely in every direction, the first instance of which is at (u_0, v_0) = (0.0f, 0.0f)
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> by changing the texture coordinates you can render a smaller part of the image, or multiple instances of the image
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> first is usually what's done by mappers, second is what we do to render the checker pattern in the background of the editor
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (x and y are in the quads coordinate space btw, not the maps)
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all this network compatibility stuff is so ugly ðŸ˜¦
13:40 <@Learath2> I'm seriously about to go mental, why won't cmake use SDL2.dylib even when I delete the damn bundled version
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro can you give me a hand in getting 0.7 working when you are around?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what do you need?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seem to have gotten something wrong with snapping the player, the camera isn't on the client
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't locked on the tee*
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can control the tee just fine though ðŸ˜›
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> while paused or generally?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> generally
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you need to set the team correctly i guess
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does the client know its NOT spectator?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now that i think about it
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you probably forgot the m_Local = 1 for yourself
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the playerinfo no longer includes m_Local
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> NewClientInfoMsg.m_Local = 1;
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in gamecontext.cpp::OnClientEnter
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L699
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 while adding 0.7 support for ddnet, please return true for the Translate stuff, just like for DDNet clients, so that 0.7 gets correct client ids, not the faked ones. This would break 0.7 dummies
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_Local does seem to be set just fine
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you have your code available somewhere?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can push it
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it possible for me to tempt you into doing the compatibility code?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aah that makes sense with the texture coordinates, i think i did it once on accident in the editor
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thats the stretching you can do by pressing shift and pulling on a quad
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks :)
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 in addition to all the usual crap about me not finishing projects (do you see the showall fix/http masters anywhere?), I'm also a bit ambivalent about the compatibility code
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/tree/dd_pr_07 well here is what I have
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works but it'll take a lot of further patching
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> however it's not pretty
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is what I'll pr and no I couldn't get it any prettier, I spent like 10 hours and did `git reset --hard HEAD`Â like 20 times
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> How does one become a contributer to ddnet repo?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1) Code something
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2) Create a pull request
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3) Profit?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Thank you ðŸ™‚
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Anyone know how to list client versions in rcon cli?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `status` I think
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know how netobjtypes work?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you want to know?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are they translated somehow? they seem to have moved around a bit but things still seem to work
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> translated where?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to translate them for compatibility
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Thank you @heinrich5991 I used it before but I was blind
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (unless nothing changed between 0.6/0.7, I don't know)
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess what I was wondering is whether the snaps carry some mapping inside them, like between the types in the snap and all the types
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not for non-extended snap objects
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Has anyone here built DDNet-Server on windows using CMake with MYSQL ON
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doubt it
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it doesn't work?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was one guy trying to get it working but I think he gave up
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> xD
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Thought it's just me
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. we do ship mysql libraries for windows though
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Weird thing is it finds the mysql livbraries but throws weird error, thanks will see if I can get it working
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should add it to CI if we want to support it
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Cl?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> continuous integration, the tests we run on each pull request
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we use github actions currently
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Oh nice !
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> build currently failing on macOS due to broken toolchain
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> normallyâ„¢, we don't have that ðŸ˜›
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the system headers should be passed with -isystem, I couldn't check that because I've been doing 3 other prs
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Are you all currently building and compiling on linux then cross compiling to windows?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think yes
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but there are some developers that develop on Windows and compile on Windows as well
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ImJustANobody i think the mysql lib we ship is broken
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try downloading a new one
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you build with VS or mingw btw?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Thank you, CMake says it's using a bundled version
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> VS, will try mingw
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would try replacing the mysql libraries in ddnet-libs directory
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe that fixes it already
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Is the bundled version the one you shipping?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how should we handle teehistorian for 0.7 clients?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not all messages are compatible
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 if you can, record the messages before translation
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So just record them as is? I guess the internal structure of the message doesn't really concern teehistorian
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a coding dilemma, I want to handle some sixup messages in `CGameContext::OnMessage` I don't want to limit myself to doing only simple translations but I don't want to duplicate the handling in `OnMessage` either
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even tried template specialization (doesnt look too good)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no one?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I'll just do it in a dirty way, but if one of you complains when I make a PR, they can fix it themselves
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look, riot are using a kernel driver anticheat that runs on ring-0
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its a shitshow
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, what an insane concept
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why a majority CCP owned company would want a rootkit in millions of computers
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky i dont play shit riot games
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota for life
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should play a round some time
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve VAC is software
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its pretty famous
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "EAC pulls it off with a service, VAC pulls it off with software integration. PunkBuster relied on a service (in earlier versions*1) There is no need for a kernel driver. This makes me think of things like SafeDisc."
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do kinda understand wanting a kernel driver, because the cheaters actually do put their cheats aaaalll the way up in ring 0
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found this
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/699371404180717718/EVf0uD2VAAc1fym.png
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also when you uninstall the game, the anticheat is not uninstalled
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc not, why would you uninstall a rootkit willingly?
