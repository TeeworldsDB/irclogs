00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How can I start multiple servers with a single config file, I mean I somehow have to add different ports
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Can I do something like ./DDNet-Server -f autoexec_server.cfg -port 8304
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and in the config file it says
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> sv_port {port}
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> You are trying to run two servers with the same ip address but with different ports?
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @Sinisa3games I tried with 0.6.5 and 0.7.2 and other clients
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I'm not saying it's a ddnet problem, it's a teeworlds problem
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Why shouldnt I? Works fine
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I mean
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It's gonna eat RAM
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and shit
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> you know
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> What would it change with different Ip, its still on the same Server
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I wont have ram problems
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It may or may not be possible to run two servers with the same ip but different port
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> What are you talking about
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what are you talking about
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Of cause it works, I can run 100 servers without a problem on the same ip with different ports
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> DDnet runs like 10 servers on the same ip
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> with high trafficv
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> with high traffic
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Alright then
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @NeXus `./DDNet-Server -f config.cfg "sv_port 1234"`
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @qshar I'm currently not developing ðŸ˜¦
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @qshar profile and and show me what causes more CPU usage
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @heinrich5991 thanks!
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Jupstar âœª profile?
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I'm sure that our players are not the only one with such problems and most likely you already discussed it with developers earlier.
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @qshar i only know, that deen reversed the SDL since it had laggs
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so >11.6.1 should be fine, did you use that to test if you got laggs?  :)
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i asked you to monitor the CPU usage of the current client and the version you sad, so i can see where(what functions) the CPU stucks longest in, best in release with debug information
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @qshar i only know, that deen reversed the latest SDL version since it had laggs
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so >11.6.1 should be fine, did you use that to test if you got laggs?  :)
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i asked you to monitor the CPU usage of the current client and the version you sad, so i can see where(what functions) the CPU stucks longest in, best in release with debug information
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @qshar i only know, that deen reversed the latest SDL version since it had laggs
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so >11.6.1 should be fine, did you use that to test if you got laggs?  :)
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i asked you to monitor the CPU usage of the current client and the version you said, so i can see where(what functions) the CPU stucks longest in, best in release with debug information
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Thats gonna take some time until I can run these tests.
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> At least today we can check the latest version of the client and see it the problem is solved there. Thanks!
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ive seen this more often but i think names arent alligned in the middle of the tee
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/531153861457608716/screenshot_2019-01-05_17-54-40.png
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> you didnt pay the names so they decided to no allign
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> you didnt pay the names so they decided to not allign
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum i guess you're right
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but i'm not sure why, the code looks correct
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Wait, is it that important? Only autist lik corneum notice:troll:
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @heinrich5991 @deen okay so I know why i cant play teeworlds
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> its not ddnet
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> its because my integrated graphics card is damaged and when my dad removed the graphics card I started getting random blue screens
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but I'm getting a new pc in like 5 days
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But I don't know why I still cannot access https://ddnet.tw
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I can't access it with my phone too so it might be the ISP
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know which part fails? DNS lookup? tcp connection?
