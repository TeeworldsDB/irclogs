00:23 < bridge> <reitw> @heinrich5991 classic bash is the best for me, but heard alot about zsh, only thing is it looks slow af
00:23 < bridge> <reitw> with all the shitty stuff it comes with
00:23 < bridge> <reitw> (with also o-my-zsh)
00:23 < bridge> <reitw> (with also oh-my-zsh)
00:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah I donâ€™t love zsh
01:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fish is almost bash with good defaults ðŸ™‚ try it some time
01:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> use the rust-lldb took
01:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> tool

17:45 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> today out of nowhere my fps went again up to 600 fps
17:45 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :feelsgoodman:
17:57 < bridge> <teero777> why isnt it possible ;((

18:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because tee collision physics are not deterministic as far as I tested it. Maybe itâ€™s floating magic or some networking delay. But it seems that when tees collide random things happen.
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> I'd guess some networking randomness
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's the order in which the characters get updated
19:10 < bridge> <learath2> oh true, these are bounces afterall
19:12 < bridge> <chairn> tee collision are deterministic
19:13 < bridge> <chairn> only the network is not deterministic in ddnet
20:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea that also crossed my mind. But would that mean that if a bounce is recreated with the same clientIDs itâ€™s always gonna bounce the same?
20:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im honestly curious but too lazy to test. @teero777 do you get the very same outcome if you redo the move with the same tees? Possibly without killing not sure what affects the physics order.
20:53 < bridge> <teero777> Tw physics are 96% deterministic
20:54 < bridge> <teero777> Only random thing is the tele
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> not anymore
20:54 < bridge> <teero777> Or networking thingies
20:55 < bridge> <teero777> Did taters PR get merged?
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ddnet uses PRNG
20:55 < bridge> <chairn> what's the seed?
20:55 < bridge> <chairn> server start time?
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk xd
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just heard this from hein
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> I am 100% sure it doesn't have anything to do with client ids. Else my whole TAS thing wouldn't work
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> Btw there shouldn't be an order at all right?
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> That would be stupid
21:13 < bridge> <teero777> Every new tick for an entity should be based on the previous tick and without having to rely on order
21:13 < bridge> <teero777> Hmm
21:13 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe I should fix that
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Random bits from platform dependent entropy source
21:14 < bridge> <teero777> So it's pretty much random
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> The seed is then recorded in teehistorian files so that things can be reproduced
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> tw physics is very much order dependent, it's the cause of weak and strong
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> Entity order that is, not client id order
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> yea
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> not cool
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> should be like
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> 1. make a copy of the world
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> 2. tick all entities in the copy independently based on the  original world
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> 3. copy the copy to the original
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe I'll implement that and check what diffrences will occur
23:49 < bridge> <nuborn> to make interactions between those two tees completely symmetrical in all cases I think you need both order independent physics (which is really hard to achieve for bounce) and fixed point math
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> and those things would surely affect the trout population
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> + existing map physics
23:52 < bridge> <nuborn> yes, doing all that without breaking any maps and tricks is an even harder problem
