00:11 <+o_be_two> Woaw did you do something for your 1'000'000 map finishes ???
00:12 <+o_be_two> DoNe is no longer in team oO ?
00:18 <+o_be_two> deen: why choose mariadb ?
00:50 <@deen> o_be_two: nope, they missed it
00:50 <@deen> o_be_two: yes, hi_leute, east and DoNe left. aaa & Soreu are leaving, rest are inactive
00:50 <@deen> mariadb because i don't trust oracle
00:58 <@deen> and postgres needs more memory and doesn't have the replication possibilities I believe
01:19 <+o_be_two> oh ok thanks for answers
01:25 <+o_be_two> well cause im working on infra update for my TW servers for r0x.TW
01:25 <+o_be_two> so i'm looking on how DDNet is organised to anhance my systems, it's nice to see how it works
01:26 <+o_be_two> i'll dont do all this work, but it's really interesting and amazing on how ddnet works
01:32 <+o_be_two> idk what i'll use for website =(
01:33 <@deen> static html!
01:33 <+o_be_two> yes i was thinking for this + nosql
01:33 <+o_be_two> but i'm not a dev so i can't do all the work you did
01:34 <+o_be_two> and cause i'll just do a blocker community, to begin i just need a forum i think
01:35 <+o_be_two> why you didnt asked for ssl for forum.ddnet.tw ,
01:36 <+o_be_two> ? and btw i was looking on how you integrated phpbb in the website
01:36 <+o_be_two> i think its not just an iframe :/
01:36 <@deen> o_be_two: we have ssl for forum.ddnet.tw
01:36 <@deen> o_be_two: right, i adapted the design to match our regular website design
01:36 <+o_be_two> oh, right, there is no auto redirection ok
01:37 <@deen> i made an auto-redirection, and then noticed that Let'sEncrypt doesn't work on WinXP
01:37 <+o_be_two> :o
01:37 <@deen> and many of our visitors still use WinXP, especially since TW is so low-requirements that many people with really old computers play it
01:38 <+o_be_two> oh yes, i understand, so you no longer force SSL, ok, its good to know
01:38 <@deen> the problem is, google directs everyone to https, so winxp people can't google for ddnet anymore...
01:38 <+o_be_two> -_- oh
01:38 <@deen> everyone else with let's encrypt should have the same problem
01:39 <+o_be_two> sure i'll have too
01:39 <+o_be_two> he's your TS often used ?
01:40 <+o_be_two> is your*
01:40 <@deen> yeah, i think there are a few regulars on it every day
01:40 <@deen> it's shown on http://ddnet.tw/status/
01:41 <@deen> the CHN cpu usage is funny btw, it doesn't show up in htop
01:42 <+o_be_two> Oo
01:43 <+o_be_two> you know mac users you got on TS ?
01:43 <+o_be_two> oh well i'll ask for NPL no problem
01:44 <+o_be_two> i like the way you manage configs
01:44 <+o_be_two> i'll do something like this, for sure
01:44 <+o_be_two> with a sync script to be able to up every servers every where
01:46 <@deen> mac should work on tls, but no idea
01:47 <+o_be_two> ok
01:48 <+o_be_two> ddnet.tw status is high :o
01:48 <@deen> that's normal, it creates the static /ranks/ sites every 20 min :P
01:49 <@deen> oh, and i just ran something^^
01:50 <+o_be_two> ahah ok ^^
01:50 <+o_be_two> you know deen r0x.fr costs for 2015 1569 $CAD ...
01:51 <+o_be_two> sorry, will cost for 2016. In 2015 it costs 1209$ CAD, including donations : 968$ cAD
01:51 <+o_be_two> yes, from my pocket
01:53 <@deen> ouch
01:54 <+o_be_two> not a real problem, i'm happy to do this project and i can do it, but i was surprised with this cost, for sure
01:54 <@deen> i guess ddnet will not cost anything next year :P
01:55 <+o_be_two> donation works well + server sponsoring helps a lot ^^
01:55 <@deen> no, i mean because ddnet will probably be shut down by 2016
01:55 <+o_be_two> oO really ? why ?
01:56 <@deen> don't see much of a future, in active administration, fights in the community, no activity
01:57 <+o_be_two> well you leaved but you seems to be back, so what you need to continue ?
01:58 <@deen> don't understand the question
01:59 <+o_be_two> well you wrote a news telling that ddnet will close, but east took it back, and now you seems to be back in ddnet too and involved again. So what you need to continue DDNet in 2016 ?
02:01 <@deen> i'm not back in ddnet
02:01 <+o_be_two> but you work on it ..
02:01 <@deen> no
02:01 <@deen> i repaired broken stuff because no one else was available
02:02 <+o_be_two> DDRace is one of the best TW gameplays .. It's sad to know that it could stop :/. DDNet is not alone, i mean there's other people like me to help ddnet
02:03 <+o_be_two> there's always bad players, everywhere, its a game, thats normal, and many of TW players are kids
02:04 <+o_be_two> but yes its really boring to see some players doing their best to destroy all, and after ? its just like 2% of players, not mutch !
02:16 <+o_be_two> deen: 
02:17 <+o_be_two> what are these : sv_reset_file sv_input_fifo
02:17 <@deen> sv_reset_file: when you change a map, that file is executed
02:18 <@deen> sv_input_fifo: it's a fifo file that you can write into, used for automating ddnet servers
02:18 <@deen> you can write the commands from rcon into it
02:21 <@deen> used for tournaments, or when a map is released, to refresh the votes list
02:21 <@deen> and worldwide broadcasts, automatic server restarts
02:50 <+o_be_two> oO
02:50 <+o_be_two> but i dont understand how it works, deen 
02:50 <+o_be_two> if i put a command in the file, its immediately excuted ingame ?
02:50 <@deen> yes
02:50 <+o_be_two> and it erase the command line after ?
02:50 <@deen> yes
02:50 <+o_be_two> oh really awesome !
02:51 <@deen> it just looks like a file, but when you write into it, it's directly sent to the server
02:51 <+o_be_two> definitively, thank you
15:27 < Nimda> Grandpa by Fňokurka oo7 just released on Brutal at 2015-12-12 15:19
21:49 <@deen> o_be_one: problem still persists
21:51 <@deen> o_be_one: on GER2, no one can see the servers
22:07 <+o_be_one> hello
22:07 <+o_be_one> thank you deen for opensource ddnet, i've a lot of fun doing r0x.TW
22:07 <+o_be_one> oh, ger2
22:07 <+o_be_one> mmh
22:07 <+o_be_one> thats really weird
22:07 <@deen> you're welcome
22:08 <+o_be_one> i'm coding script to start my servers, inspired by what you did for ddnet
22:08 <+o_be_one> ok i have to check for GER2, i'll try to up my own server on the same configuration to see
22:17 <+o_be_one> i cant reproduce this on my own server
22:17 <+o_be_one> ive the same vps ive gave to DDNet for Ger2, on the same host, and my server appears ...
22:18 <+o_be_one> theres nos rule on firewall network
22:19 <+o_be_one> deen, you can restart when ill disable firewall to try ?
22:19 < EastByte> o_be_one: server addr/port?
22:19 <+o_be_one> EastByte, ?
22:20 < EastByte> of your tw server
22:20 <+o_be_one> oh, let me start it again
22:21 <@deen> o_be_one: how can you test it on your own server? the problem only occurs for people who didn't ssh into the server before
22:27 <+o_be_one> oh
22:27 <+o_be_one> ok
22:27 <+o_be_one> i'm on VPN actually, ive just to switch to other vpn to try
22:29 <+o_be_one> i'm copying all my new stuffs to the vps to try
22:39 < nobody> your shitty ddnet zcatch servers are being flooded, mind one of those admins come online and ban that server msg spamming person
22:44 <+o_be_one> !twp o_tee_one
22:45 < Nimda> o_tee_one is currently playing blmapPepe on server : [r0x.TW - Blockers Community] #1 64 slots.
22:45 <+o_be_one> EastByte, 51.254.92.225 8301
22:49 < nobody> hm interesting, not only are there only incompetent admins, but the flooder is bypassing the ip ban protection due to his network stressing with ease
23:12 <+o_be_one> ok i cant see the server too
23:26 <+o_be_one> idk on how it could happen
23:30 < WolfAlex> <WolfAlex> o_be_one: "GAME restriction will be activated. UDP traffic will be authorised on defined rules only."
23:30 < WolfAlex> <WolfAlex> this is why you need the other rule OR disabled GAME-Firewall
23:32 <+o_be_one> WolfAlex, but game firewall is disabled
23:34 < WolfAlex> hm
23:36 <@deen> o_be_one: some firewall is enabled
23:36 <@deen> at least it says so in the traceroute
23:42 <+o_be_one> well what is the rangeport to open in game firewall
23:42 <+o_be_one> oh ive found something
23:46 <@deen> 8000-9000 should be fine
23:46 <+o_be_one> !fr-en La restriction GAME est maintenant désactivée, le trafic UDP vers les ports non définis est autorisé mais les règles définies restent appliquées
23:46 < Nimda> Translation: GAME restriction is now disabled, UDP traffic to undefined ports is allowed but the rules are defined applied
23:46 <+o_be_one> so maybe you can try, deen 
23:49 <@deen> o_be_one: seems to work now
23:50 <+o_be_one> good
23:50 <+o_be_one> well what you prefer, firewall game enabled with udp ports open or firewall game disabled ?
23:50 <@deen> no idea, you're the expert :P
23:52 <@deen> thanks
23:52 <+o_be_one> ahah i havent tried game servers for TW so idont know what will happend x) just get information from EastByte about some dropped user
23:52 <@deen> then don'T enable that please
23:52 <@deen> dropped players on ddnet are terrible
23:53 <+o_be_one> since i dont get ddos its ok for me
23:54 <+o_be_one> i like my new start script for TW ^^
