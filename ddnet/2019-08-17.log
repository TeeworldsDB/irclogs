00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, which cast
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> either of "0xFFFFFF26" directly in that macro or in "static CIntVariableData Data = { this, &g_Config.m_##Name, Min, Max, Def };"
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> whereever that value is set
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks!
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It still cant compile
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> same error?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i added (int) in front of every hexadecimal
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it doesnt accept that cast now?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not really sure, but i dont think so
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well let me look into c++11 standard maybe its prohibed
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the error only occurs on linux
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else u need to convert all values to actual inteegers xD
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on windows it works fine
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, u can ofc disable that warning
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it creates an error
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cannot compile
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> -Wno-narrowing in the cpp flags
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27844971/warning-narrowing-conversion-c11
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i cant really read that a cast should not be allowed, but idk
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah u can also just implement a constructor
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have no idea what to do xd
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can implement a constructor for CIntVariableData
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut just go into cmakelists.txt
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> search for "add_c_compiler_flag_if_supported(OUR_FLAGS -fstack-protector-strong)"
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and add "add_c_compiler_flag_if_supported(OUR_FLAGS -Wno-narrowing)"
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> under it
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But it wont stop it from not compiling or does iz
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can I also work this error out?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you have any suggestions for that?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i gave u all my suggestions
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that did not work or I did it wrong
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The error was still there
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> either cast properly, use a constructor or replace all hexa numbers with integer values üòÑ
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Alright thanks :)
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats the last thing left for me running a 0.7 server :D
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have manually copied DDNet to the 0.7 codebase
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It was a lot of work but it works just fine
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also I did adjustments and fixed stuff they Changed
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And on top I have added my own small 0.6 mod, I am up to date now :)
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "0xFFFFFFFFd" something like this might work aswell
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so adding a d
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> after the hex values
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs that makes the constant a integer
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think that doesnt work for hexa
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if it works somehow, but i thing for unsigned it works xD
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> better forget what i said
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> L would maybe work but that wouldn't garantuee to fit into an integer
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> int isnt defined by standard anyway
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the size of it
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if it works somehow, but i think for unsigned and bigger sizes than int it works xD
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try adding UL at the end of the hexadecimal constant
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that makes it unsigned , that is the problem xD
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The explicit (int) cast should be enough
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> inside of config_variables.h?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because I added it in front of the hexa values, e.g. (int)0xsomething
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I got the same error
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't you change the type to unsigned?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you try writing it in decimal, should be -218
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it makes no sense
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even did it before starting to use unsigned for colors
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1733/files
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at UiColor
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check dm
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> private messaging‚Ä¶
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any idea why that wouldnt work?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> casting with `(int)` to obtain an int?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the error lies elsewhere?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk for a bit
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fok
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> now do arrays work?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> char aDDPPLogs[DDPP_NUM_LOGS][DDPP_LOG_SIZE][128];
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this correct?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or should it be
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> char aDDPPLogs[128][DDPP_LOG_SIZE][DDPP_NUM_LOGS];
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or does it even matter?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was log_size lines of length 128 and DPP_NUM_LOGS types of logs
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> int sample[x][y][z]; i have x times a y array containing y times a z array right?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm i messed up my max index and then it wrote into another array üòÑ
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon saw that üëÅ
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No idea whats abiut tho
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Im 'corneum hi
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hi
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üïµ
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ü§°
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @n000b yaw its also presistet in irc and irc logs for ever xd. I just wanted to clean up this chat a bit. Sadly we have no #dev-nobos channel for stupid questions xd
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> One question it's normal stay like 3 days searching for one slot for put my server and dont get it? , i mean i stay with my server 3 days open and the same error all the time `WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds`
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> 
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/612370234636238858/unknown.png
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i try master server 3 and 4 and the same error
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if ping master1.teeworlds.com doesnt respond in cmd or terminal
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it is ur internet provider
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it is ur internet provider or something in that route to the real ip
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> 0 packets loss pinging master 2 and 1
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> master 3 -> timeout
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> 4 packet loss
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then ur port isnt open or ur ipv4 is tunneled so not public
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i give my public ip for my friends and they can join by the public ip
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> try to ping ur server with ur mobile phone
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i ping my public ip with my phone using 3g and work good
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> can i force to choose master 1 or 2 ?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Master 4 work well 0 packet loss
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is a master.cfg in the teeworlds config folder
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Yeah i change the old value of master 4 for my localhost 127.0.0.1
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> but that only force master3 i think
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i try to change this value and force to `MAX_MASTERSERVER=2` but that dont work
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> 
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/612394324784578574/unknown.png
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it only ping 2 servers then?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Yeah but the line `chose 'master2.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats` dont show, soo  i think that cant be work by the force (Sry for my english)√ß
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You dont need to change these files
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i think it automatically chooses another master if one does not work
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> My server only want to pick the master4 and dont work haha
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i stay like 3 days with the server on and the same line in loop
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are 2 options:
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1. its the master
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2. its your setup
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if the master server responds but cant keep up
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You said it also occurs with vanilla server
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so we can exclude the mod
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its unlikely it always responds up to the point the register happens
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So its most likely to be a setup problem
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe wrong port configuration
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if his friends can actually connect
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its unlikely
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i open 8303 and 8304 for test in 2 computers and with my public ip my friends can join :s
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where do u live?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Spain
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it could ofc be some local problem
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like ppl from spain can connect
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Oh but in the sourth of america can too
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> my friend try in that zone and work
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> I mean is so weird bcoz i cant do more i think and the server keep in the same stage
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it clearly fails contacting the servers already
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i dont know why my 2 servers chose all the time the master 4
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/612399096556290106/unknown.png
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs its probably the most empty server that responded
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u disabled master4 anyway didnt u? and it still didnt work üòÑ
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i enable it again, for try again 3 days, i disable the master4 for 3 days and i get nothing so i will let him another 3 days with master4 enable for try and try :s
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is your servers ip?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> the public ip?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> can i share with you privately?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its also possible the master server block ur connection on the teeworlds ports, maybe u should try pinging their servers with their specific port
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i search my ip in master-servers ban and i dont have my ip in that list, but i will try to ping the server with port too check
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt need to be a ban like u think
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> more a filter to prevent ddos or smth
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> maybe i need to install nmap or something like that to check the port m..
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> jupstar can i add you and share my public ip for test if you can join?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> @Jupstar ‚ú™  can i add you and share my public ip for test if you can join?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i dunno if that changes something i don't live close to any internet cluster, but i can try
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> @Jupstar ‚ú™  i send you the friend request :d
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i dont see them i think xd
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange normally ppl in the same server can write to me xD
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i cant :(
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well smth is broken with ur discord xD
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant write u either
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Double check your settings
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh wait, maybe its his settings
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I guess
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @0xc000f allow people from the same server to message you
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Yeah i dont see that hahaha
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> ty!
