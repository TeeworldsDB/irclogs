00:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Panic
00:02 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I am
00:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well dunno why it crashed. I'm no server admin
00:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è be panic safe
00:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To some degree
00:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think learath is out of town
00:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So gonna take a few years
00:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> xpanic
00:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 can you queue that into your to-do list after wherever you are right now^^
00:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'd be surprised if you can't turn on all strong on a per-map basis
01:58 < bridge_> <murpi> @ravie_ravie Try now
02:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> works, when fix licenses btw?
02:06 < bridge_> <murpi> let me check
02:08 < bridge_> <murpi> fixed that too
04:18 < bridge_> <totar> @heinrich5991 There seems to be some sort of regression with this commit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/296. I'm not sure I understand how it ever worked.
04:19 < bridge_> <totar> I was able to fix it by adding ``m_FlagMask | CFGFLAG_GAME`` to the FindCommand call in ExecuteLineStroked. without this it seems like FindCommand will never find commands with CFGFLAG_GAME because the client's m_FlagMask is CFGFLAG_CLIENT by default.
04:20 < bridge_> <totar> but I can't figure out how it ever worked because from what I can see even the old version of FindCommand should have filtered out all the CFGFLAG_GAME configs
04:21 < bridge_> <totar> also the client's CFGFLAG_GAME configs aren't reset between map changes so I had to add a call to ``Console()->ResetServerGameSettings();``
04:22 < bridge_> <totar> This fixes <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6774> as far as I can tell but I don't know how it got broken in the first place
04:22 < bridge_> <totar> @heinrich5991 There seems to be some sort of regression with this PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/296. I'm not sure I understand how it ever worked.
04:27 < bridge_> <totar> Did it ever work?
04:29 < bridge_> <totar> I guess we could also initialize the client's console m_FlagMask with ``CFGFLAG_GAME | CFGFLAG_CLIENT,`` instead of only``CFGFLAG_CLIENT`` because those should be all the configs it cares about.
04:29 < bridge_> <totar> I guess we could also initialize the client's console m_FlagMask with ``CFGFLAG_GAME | CFGFLAG_CLIENT,`` instead of only ``CFGFLAG_CLIENT`` because those should be all the configs it cares about.
04:34 < bridge_> <totar> I feel I must be missing some reason that it should be working
09:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `CFGFLAG_GAME` was mostly about the server when it was introduced. I think someone else tried executing the configs on the client as well later on
09:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure if it ever worked
09:32 < bridge_> <totar> But why would the client call LoadMapSettings() in CGameClient::OnConnected() if it wasn't supposed to be able to execute the configs embeded in the map?
10:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I wish obs would offer a VK plugin to tell which frame buffers it should read from. I'd find it cool to render the game without anti ping and entities for the users. While the steamer still sees the gameplay content
10:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no such thing is in the PR afaict
10:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hence "someone else tried executing the configs on the client as well later on"
10:22 < bridge_> <chairn> then be surprised
10:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this comes from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1904 apparently
10:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and trml added `CFGFLAG_CLIENT` to the relevant config
10:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so I guess your solution might be better
10:23 < bridge_> <totar> it seems actually quite easy to make the client work with CFGFLAG_GAME, is there any reason the client shouldn't keep track of those?
10:24 < bridge_> <totar> Maybe I'll just make a PR and you can judge if there's any unexpected consequences

11:34 < bridge_> <chairn> @ryozuki @jupeyy_keks im finally moving on from ubuntu 18 to ubuntu 22, trying to skip ubuntu 20 üòÑ

11:35 < bridge_> <chairn> wish me luck
11:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ITS HAPPENING
11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> epic
11:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar > now also move away from win7 xdd
11:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And then open chairn.shop so I can try this out
11:41 < bridge_> <chairn> oh nice
11:56 < bridge_> <chairn> argh, unmet dependencies everywhere 10 mins in...
12:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Hypocrite jopsti complaining about kog accounts and going strong on ddnet accounts axaxaxa
12:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chillerdragon: in my vision accounts are optional
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so if i implement it, i can make sure its true ;)
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> also i dislike how overcomplicated kog is doing it xD
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that's not attractive to new users IMO
12:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and i respect that ppl want accounts to save their progress.. I personally am not interested in that
12:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i play the game for fun and skillz
12:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> optional means that you automatically generate a key pair if the user doesn't want an account, right?
12:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (that's wat I read from your description)
12:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that's one way yes
12:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that would make it easier to "upgrade" the non account to an account
12:08 < bridge_> <chairn> any idea how to solve massive unmet dependencies ?
12:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> unmet dependencies where?
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @chairn i think last time i had this i simply used some fancy dpkg command to simply remove all annoying packages
12:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in worst case then do apt reinstall over all packages xd
12:10 < bridge_> <chairn> when upgrading from ubuntu 18 to ubuntu 22 directly
12:11 < bridge_> <chairn> it complains about gcc and mostly qt stuff
12:11 < bridge_> <learath2> Does it say why it won't pull it in?
12:11 < bridge_> <chairn> i think it's because i installed some gcc version manually or from some ppa. But i disabled ppa before upgrading
12:12 < bridge_> <chairn> `gcc-7 : Depends: libgcc-7-dev (=7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) but it is not installable)
12:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you might need to uninstall the ppa packages before updating
12:12 < bridge_> <chairn> `gcc-7 : Depends: libgcc-7-dev (=7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) but it is not installable)`
12:12 < bridge_> <chairn> i cant anymore
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> use dpkg
12:13 < bridge_> <chairn> whatever i try, it complains about unmet dependencies
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u can always force remove
12:13 < bridge_> <chairn> hmm, ill try
12:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd be wary of using "force" flags
12:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what does it tell you when you try to remove gcc-7?
12:15 < bridge_> <chairn> same thing
12:15 < bridge_> <chairn> the unmet dependencies are always the same (weird though)
12:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah within apt you probably cannot recover from this anymore easily
12:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `dpkg -r gcc-7`
12:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that doesn't work?
12:17 < bridge_> <chairn> well, i guess i have to manually remove each package following the dependency list
12:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> does gcc-7 depend on libgcc-7-dev or the other way around?
12:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if gcc-7 depends on libgcc-7-dev, then it should not be a problem to remove gcc-7 without also removing libgcc-7-dev, right?
12:20 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if it's fixable within apt you can simply do `apt install --fix-broken` it should automatically suggest which packages to remove
12:37 < bridge_> <chairn> nah, it complains about unmet dependency too
12:37 < bridge_> <chairn> dpkg -r seems to work fine, but it's all manual üòÑ
12:44 < bridge_> <chairn> okay, i reverted my sources.list and will simply do release-upgrade
12:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Lol
12:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Distro upgrades just never go well
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 thats why u use rolling
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like gentoo
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just make sure to update atleast once ever some months
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats conservatively
12:57 < bridge_> <reitw> Ubuntu sux
12:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i update every day like a maniac
13:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's why u don't updateüò¨üò¨üò¨
13:10 < bridge_> <marmare_314> @robyt3 for me the selection is still working fine in the updated version. do you have any more info on when it was inconsistent?
13:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can only move envelope points up and down when moving the mouse very fast. Previously this was an issue only with very low mouse speeds, but now it happens also with default mouse sensitivity.
13:18 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Ah I didnt notice since my mousespeed is quite high. But its probably because `MouseDeltaX()` is used and the resulting value gets stored in a fixed precision number. The only solution that comes to mind is to use the absolute mouse position instead. That would still not solve this issue for slow precision mode though.

14:01 < bridge_> <learath2> If you fail this you are in for an awful day üòÑ
14:02 < bridge_> <learath2> I once just gave up on a too old gentoo system, just reinstalled

14:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol
14:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> shit take
14:05 < bridge_> <learath2> Am I just stupid for not using gpt? I feel like it's an awful habit to get into
14:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> you're not stupid for not using gpt
14:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> other ppl are stupid for bragging about it
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> I have a feeling we are about to get a wave of gpt dependent developers
14:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm definitely not spending 20 dollars on 2.5 coffees ^^
14:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> me neither
14:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i get a coffee with milk for 1.3‚Ç¨
14:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 1.1‚Ç¨ in cheap places
14:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know xd its funny twitter post
14:13 < bridge_> <learath2> You definitely don‚Äôt live in silicon valley üòÑ
14:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> dunno, trying it out a little is probably helpful
14:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to assess whether it's useful to you
14:22 < bridge_> <learath2> It probably is useful for small stuff but I have this feeling it‚Äôd make me a worse programmer overall
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the fact u say this i think u  dont need to worry
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just see what it answers skeptically
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like anything u see on the internet
14:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> altho its diferent cuz, for me chatgpt will never be seen as a authoritive figure in any field
14:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for example if i read a blog about someone who is known to be rly good at X, i will most likely trust what he says is right
14:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but not for chatgpt
14:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> welcome to my ted talk
14:41 < bridge_> <Iza> The first stage of grief is denial :greenthing:
14:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you tried programming with gpt? what's your evaluation? üôÇ
14:45 < bridge_> <Iza> I wasn‚Äôt serious
14:45 < bridge_> <Iza> But independent of programming, the denial towards ai is a real thing
14:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd be happy if I could tell an LLM to fix my scanner driver
14:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't see that it's there though
14:49 < bridge_> <chairn> still running, but i'll have to do it twice, first to move to ubuntu 20, then to ubuntu 22...
15:05 < bridge_> <louis> i use it more like google
15:05 < bridge_> <louis> not like 'write me an algorithm to do this'
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> given a suficiently famous algorithm it will probs do it correct
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like binary search
15:06 < bridge_> <louis> ye it does get a lot of things pretty correct
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it wont do it as fast as this guy tho https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/data-structures/binary-search/
15:09 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 ohno i got firewalled mid run
15:09 < ChillerDragon> oke website fixed it
15:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Is there a reason why the font atlas is stored as part of `CFont`? Right now we seem to use two font atlases in total, one for the icon font and one for all other fonts, because there are only two `CFont` objects. Fallback fonts are currently stored as part of the `CFont` objects. Is it better to a) have less atlases to avoid the texture switching, or b) would it make more sense to have an atlas for every individual font, or c) only on
15:35 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6881
16:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @robyt3 i guess its fine to store all stuff into one font. that the icon font is seperate is probably mostly bcs it could:tm: clash with "real" unicode characters (?)
16:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar> one atlas*
16:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but you should rebuild the atlast when changing fonts ofc ^^
16:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno, its only triggered by language change in future?
16:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and while u at it, replace the std::map with std::unordered_map
16:10 < bridge_> <chairn> i think i just killed my linux laptop, it hangs at reboot on screen splash
16:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @chairn i can quickly build you a gamer pc, np
16:11 < bridge_> <chairn> uh no thx
16:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @chairn does it hang on the screen of the motherboard, or of ubuntu
16:13 < bridge_> <chairn> ubuntu, it wasn't showing password prompt for disk locker
16:13 < bridge_> <chairn> now, it seems to boot (still loading)
16:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar> still loading?
16:14 < bridge_> <chairn> and the boot is successfull

16:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> why do u even have so much problems upgrading ubuntu lmao. isnt it supposed to be stupidly easy with it
16:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> did u try the ubuntu system upgrader
16:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> instead of manually doing it
16:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well ok
16:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u already broke it fair enough
16:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> since some packages are already ubuntu 22 xD
16:37 < bridge_> <chairn> that's what do-release-upgrade made
16:37 < bridge_> <chairn> second round started
16:38 < bridge_> <chairn> but yeah, i manually installed more recent version of some packages like gcc and git for instance
16:38 < bridge_> <chairn> and i guess, it completely broke it because it couldn't remove one and install another version for some reason
16:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @chairn did u update to the immediate next update first?
16:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think updates are only tested from one ot the following
16:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> without skipping
16:50 < bridge_> <chairn> i tried skipping, it failed, so now i use the do-release-upgrade script
16:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> he went full hipster, i like

17:29 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> hi, so lately i've been more interested in unexplained videos again, people witnessing paranormal or demonic activity. i just want to ask, does anyone of you believe in supernatural, or well, maybe it is part of nature? anyways :D just wanna hear some opinions, as i myself do not really believe in ghosts and shit, but to me, there are a few events which really go unexplained. also within my personal circle
17:48 < ChillerDragon> ryo i rate dat video 1/10
17:49 < ChillerDragon> +1 for hating on religion rest is useless
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u watch it
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its phisolosophy anyway
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i bet u didnt watch it
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur attention span is too short
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> hot topic but i cant wait until someone finds an exploit in reality and proves we Are in a simulation
17:57 < ChillerDragon> i watched the whole thing
17:57 < ChillerDragon> bro is just bubbeling about universe
17:57 < ChillerDragon> not bringing any good arguments against religion
17:58 < ChillerDragon> claiming reiligion is dark and science is bright
17:58 < ChillerDragon> seems shallow to me
17:58 < ChillerDragon> also its not related to "unexplained" things fokko requested
17:59 < ChillerDragon> "universe big i know many numbers and big scale so i must be epic or right"
18:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think u only watched the first part
18:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway it doesnt matter xd
18:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chilleru  believe in ghosts?
18:15 < bridge_> <chairn> my client is full of ghosts
18:15 < bridge_> <chairn> almost everytime i play a map, i see one
18:22 < ChillerDragon> ryo i seriously watched the full video from start till end in 1x speed
18:23 < ChillerDragon> the guy uses unrelated facts as arguments for nothing and has no point
18:23 < ChillerDragon> if he wasnt a elementary school teacher but a priest instead he could flip a few words and do the exact same video pro religion
18:24 < ChillerDragon> i do not belive in ghosts
18:25 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki what do you like about the video?
18:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sry but its hard to argue when ur argument is "uses unrelated facts as arguments for nothing and has no point"
18:26 < ChillerDragon> then dont argue
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok i wont
18:26 < ChillerDragon> but tell me what you like 
18:26 < ChillerDragon> sell me the video
18:26 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then u dont get it
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its ok
18:26 < ChillerDragon> -.-
18:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> philosophy is like this
18:27 < ChillerDragon> philosophy seems like a excuse to talk nonsense and be cool
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its about how one interprets the unexplained
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the video about section
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Yes, some of the thinkers to whom I owe my mental freedom were religious, like Newton, a Christian who believed God made the Earth - but showed me why the Earth would have formed without a god's help, or Faraday, who opened all our eyes to electromagnetism - and a world of electrons that obey dice, not gods. The brilliance and physical insight of these and many other religious scientists' minds are the very things that make gods getting humans p
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Weird...
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > ....I can see what geniuses said they could not - but then even a mouse on a giant's shoulder sees further if the giant is bowed in prayer.
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
18:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > I'm not against the Creator or Creators, if they exist, if they ever existed. I'm not against the search for the Creator(s). What blows MY mind is that people think organized religion has anything to do with it at all.
18:29 < ChillerDragon> have you watched the video ryo? :p
18:30 < ChillerDragon> it doesnt include a single fact that speaks against the existance of god imo
18:31 < ChillerDragon> he just talks about the scale of the universe and says regilion uses fear while science makes you happy
18:31 < ChillerDragon> could also talk about the scale of the universe and then say religion gives you hope and purpose while science just predicts the inevidable absence of life and pure darkness
18:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > says regilion uses fear while science makes you happy
18:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think religious people were generally happier
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> here is the transcript
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://zepfanman.com/2010/11/science-saved-my-soul-transcript/
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u dont want video
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> altho the video is nice xd
18:32 < ChillerDragon> the visuals are a bit too old for me
18:32 < ChillerDragon> and the music is depressing
18:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the video is old
18:32 < ChillerDragon> im such a hater 
18:32 < ChillerDragon> i know
18:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Is there anything you like except 0.7 and shell?
18:33 < ChillerDragon> in fact bash is bloated
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Religions tell children they might go to hell and they must believe, while science tells children they came from the stars and presents reasoning they can believe. I‚Äôve told plenty of young kids about stars and atoms and galaxies and the Big Bang and I have never seen fear in their eyes‚Äîonly amazement and curiosity. They want more. Why do kids swim in it and adults drown in it? What happens to reality between our youngest years and adulthood
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > We were told long ago and for a long time that there was only the Earth‚Äîthat we were the center of everything. That turned out to be wrong. We still haven‚Äôt fully adjusted. We‚Äôre still in shock. The universe is not what we expected it to be. It‚Äôs not what they told us it would be. This cosmic understanding is all new to us. But there‚Äôs nothing to fear. We‚Äôre still special. We‚Äôre still blessed. And there might yet be a heaven, but i
18:33 < ChillerDragon> and i dont really like 0.7
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > If I have something that could be called a soul that needed saving, then science saved it‚Ä¶ from religion.
18:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Very developer topic
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like always
18:34 < ChillerDragon> lerato i like you <3
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean its chiller who pushed this
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its his fault
18:35 < bridge_> <learath2> <insert l.a. noire doubt meme>
18:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm, I feel like this is a misrepresentation of "religion"
18:35 < ChillerDragon> heinrich religion enjoyer
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean religion has no fixed interpretation
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i had a big dejavu right now lol
18:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so it's kinda bad to say "all religion is bad"
18:36 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah I feel any representation of religion is a misrepresentation for atleast one person
18:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Religions tell children they might go to hell and they must believe
18:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this is not what I know or what I heard from other people about the way protestantism is taught in germany
18:39 < bridge_> <Voxel> im not religeous nor do i believe my life revolves around science
18:39 < bridge_> <Voxel> i believe in fate
18:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Religion paints everything not of itself as unholy and sinful while it beautifies and dignifies its errors, lies, and bigotry (like a pig wearing the finest robes).
18:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that is also not true IME
18:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (for protestantism in germany)
18:40 < bridge_> <Voxel> my life is the life where i live the longest and most succesful. me in other universes arent so lucky, but me, the one who knows i am me, will be the most successful
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fate seems like some kind of religion to me
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i believe that everyy atom has a fixed set move based on all previous atoms, which determines the next state of the universe
18:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory ? xd
18:44 < bridge_> <Voxel> i mean if we're all just atoms how do we **know** that we're thinking and seeing
18:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's not the usual interpretation of quantum theory ^^
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's not the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics ^^
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats my interpretation of my logical thinking i guess
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but im interested in learning that
18:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (i mean i said this without any research, its just what makes sense to me)
18:50 < bridge_> <cipy29> :twintri:
19:10 < bridge_> <totar> You never know when you'll get when you click this channel lol
19:10 < bridge_> <totar> You never know what you'll get when you click this channel lol
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> isnt that awesome
19:10 < bridge_> <totar> Ddnet religion talk
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you don't believe in ddgod, please leave this chat
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i believe in rust
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in rust we trust
19:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in trust we rust
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> science  brought us the borrow checker
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not religion
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check mate
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur lifetime is invalid
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was is random or was it destiny that the borrow checker was invented?
19:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> .
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "You‚Äôve already made the choice. You‚Äôre here to understand why you‚Äôve made it" - The Matrix 2
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
19:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> good quote lol
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ikr
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's my favorite from that movie
19:29 < bridge_> <chairn> finally, ubuntu 22 seems to work
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
19:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i knew
19:33 < bridge_> <learath2> I believe only in eternal suffering
19:49 < bridge_> <chairn> havent tried compiling ddnet yegt
20:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you seen https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html btw?
20:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> data leakage across processes or VMs
21:17 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> was gonna say, why is it closed i found that a pretty decent idea üòÑ
21:17 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> was gonna say, why is it closed, i found it an actual valid idea üòÑ
21:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @chairn https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4850 not interested in continuing this?
21:35 < bridge_> <chairn> hmm, not really
22:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 do you want to review https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6885 or can I do a cursory review and a test and merge it?
22:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> Looks good to me, @marmare_314 will probably want to squash the commits
22:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> alright üôÇ
22:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then I'm done going through all the PRs üôÇ
22:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> #5690 should also be closed?
22:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5690
22:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I missed one üôÅ
22:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure, let me look

22:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Mhh, I really should sit down and  finish up my curl pr, it probably fixes all the problems people have with the updater
22:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> github is scolding me:

22:58 < bridge_> <yakupie> hi i want make my own client
22:58 < bridge_> <yakupie> how i need follow a roadmap
22:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here we go again
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> try compiling the existing client
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are you on windows?
22:59 < bridge_> <yakupie> yep
23:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> im still playing game at my own file of game
23:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> its not steam
23:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki windows, can't compile, no cpp knowledge üò¨
23:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> how you know im not knowledge abt cpp
23:00 < bridge_> <yakupie> ye you re right but i dont say this
23:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no no i dont mean you directly
23:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's an internal joke
23:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you downloaded microsoft visual studio?
23:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> im into programming for a 3-4 months
23:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :NekoDrink:
23:01 < bridge_> <yakupie> i know html css js php and mysql
23:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what do u want ur client to do?
23:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> automate something?
23:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> sus
23:02 < bridge_> <yakupie> i dont understand this
23:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont blow it yet chillee
23:02 < bridge_> <yakupie> srry my english re bad
23:02 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I mean I wouldn't say I want to, since its always a bit nerve wrecking, but I did üòÑ
23:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: can you re-open a PR with your change?
23:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I saw
23:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But I mobile
23:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I‚Äôll do soon
23:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can always get your old changes back (during the rebase with conflicts using `git rebase --abort`, or after the rebase with the help of `git reflog`)
23:03 < bridge_> <yakupie> i make game more cuter with my client so its not abt add new extension or something
23:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: cool
23:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Are you talking to me?
23:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
23:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: no, to @marmare_314. don't you see quotes on matrix?
23:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Not on iOS \:D
23:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> weird‚Ä¶
23:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I stopped questioning Element bugs
23:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it should be supported on ios according to their bug tracker‚Ä¶
23:08 < bridge_> <marmare_314> `reflog` is only useful if you know what youre doing in the first place
23:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> You could also create a new temporary branch before your rebase so you can hard-reset your real branch if you mess up, so you don't need to read through the reflog
23:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or use origin/branchname to reset it to the old state
23:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> before force-pushing
23:14 < bridge_> <learath2> I always like doing interactive rebases, `rebase -i` is very useful
23:14 < bridge_> <marmare_314> The most annoying part about it is that it always takes me more time and effort than I am willing to admit to do these simple things with git
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```c++
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> // Number of CFonts is low (5-10)
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> // Number of ints is high (number of unicode codepoints)
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> // sizeof(SFontSizeChar) is roughly 48
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_map<CFont *, SFontSizeChar>> m_Chars1;
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> std::unordered_map<CFont *, std::unordered_map<int, SFontSizeChar>> m_Chars2;
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> std::unordered_map<std::tuple<CFont *, int>, SFontSizeChar> m_Chars3;
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> Which one is the best?
23:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> my intuition says "the third one"
23:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or the second one
23:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but not the first one
23:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because in the first one, you'll have tons of `std::unordered_map`s lying around
23:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> true, and most of the inner maps would only contain very few entries, as most chars have only one or a few different representations in all fonts
23:26 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Road to 0 prs
23:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> @heinrich5991 How do I avoid the copy? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6874#discussion_r1272719237 First append the newline to the member variable string and then return the member variable so it can be moved?
23:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably first check whether there's a newline. if not, append one. yes. return type would need to be adjusted as well
