10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> @[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r you should create file or sql to store data otherwise you lose your vip members everytime you close your server or restart it, so after that you can add tiles for your vip or moder room to check that player have authed rank then they can cross of tile or get Die(). I think you can learn about how do this with examples in DDNet++'s ChillerDragon.

11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <barsik> ddnet peepee
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <barsik> aw
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> +
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> @Vexar  i m 50% 50% understand
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> what shoud i do
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> are you from iran ?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> whith that files in ddnet++;s
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> y
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> are you iranian too ?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> yeah
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[¯̄ ͡ ̶๖̶̶ζ͜͡ G❤✞0D_Fathૐह═─r> pv
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you don't have the new config patches from 0.7 yet on ddnet7
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont think so
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just wondering, maybe we should get it in before we drift too far from vanilla
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> feel free to do it :)
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> official ddnet7 servers run an ancient version because of crashes btw
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen any backtraces?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/issues/62
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does anyone know what this is used for in maplayers.cpp, its a check before rendering the map (ddnet only)
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `if(Size >= pTMap->m_Width*pTMap->m_Height*sizeof(CTile))`
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (also for the other layers, like speedup, tune etc)
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but for them ofc with CSpeedup or something instead of CTile
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the check is that the layer is as large as it is specified, perhaps because there are broken maps out there?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it causes issues on some maps not rendering tiles in my 0.7 client
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the layer is too small, that sounds like the maps is broken(?)
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you maybe output the width, height and size and compare it to what you see in the editor?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can try
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> same
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weird
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is size, width and height as seen in debug output?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and what is the editor's opinion on this?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> width and height are the same as in the editor
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and `size`?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what would i need to compare it to
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is the value of it? `width*height*sizeof(tile)` according to it?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is the value of it? `width*height*sizeof(tile)` according to the source
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is its value, what are the values of width, height?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?????????????
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big questionmark
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea what you eman
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea what you mean
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell me the values of size, width and height?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said you debug-printed them
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> width and height are 300, 150
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> size i dont know right now
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `300 * 150 * sizeof(tile)` is checked against `Size`, so that variable is also interesting
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can continue debugging this tomorrow, or if youd like you can do it. my clients code is available
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-Client/commits/F-Client
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-Client/commit/1a9e20ee6c6b088b3b41c4430d2225f337af8d54
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you would need to revert this commut
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> join chillerdragons ctf Server, he uses vanilla ctf map and it doesnt render tiles
