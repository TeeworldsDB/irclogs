08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> can u pls make an account system
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i dont like that people can just steal my name and finish maps for me that i wanted to finish myself
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> its so dumb
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i really like ddnet and all
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> but man
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> make a god damn account system xd
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Misse> -1
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @WAV not as easy as you might think
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uh oh
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got discussed many times already
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> time for debate #53
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/53
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> make a ddnet login system
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> everyone has their own userid
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> solved
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nice
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sounds easy, why dont u go make a pr
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @WAV what if I just register my acc before Aoe does, then steal his name?
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as an example
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> because i will do it before u
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ip, mac adress
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can change
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> and people can proof themselves
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i dont think ur mac adress changes weekly
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so many players, we cant check it for everyone
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> its just stupid that people can finish maps for me
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> idk what u people think about it
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think nobody wants to finish maps for you, you should have just chosen a more uncommon name
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DDNet warns you about that in the beginning
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i could choose the most uncommon name in the world, but that doesnt change the fact that people still can pretend to be me xd
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i didnt saw that warning tbh
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> finishing for others is good in 90% of cases, faking isnt tho
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think accounts is good but its not so simple to implement, it would need a lot of planning. also this discussion happens like every week  here
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> well these discussions dont happen without reason
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It doesnt help if we discuss the same things withe different people every time, because people dont understand that its a big act
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #43411
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #3411 *
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there is no clear goal, no one will code this. If we don't decide on the scope before someone codes it it will stay as a pr being discussed forever
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> you gotta plan something
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ik its harder than said
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> but as you can see alot of people bring up discussions about it weekly
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't plan anything myself. This is a huge feature and we don't get to change much about it after we roll it out
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It has to be perfect on the first try
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So people need to contribute to the discussion on github, where we intend to come up with a plan
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> At least the core
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At this point I mostly need devs talking but even that is hard to get
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Learath are you here for a second?
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i'd suggest to take inspiration from other game devs
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> how they solved problems like these
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @WAV thats not too easy, because we still have the problem with old players and a lot of ranks
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We cant just randomly give the old points to anybody who claims to be that guys
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are players with the same names, who just both play and get points
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> its just a random idea and idk how well it works out, but how about taking ip & mac adress "captures" from players like daily or weekly and then with that data finding out which ip adress or mac adress uses the account most frequently
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @WAV feel free to join the discussion on github and present us your plan, maybe you can bring it into a new direction :)
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> im not a github person xd
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> time to become one
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> its fun easy to use place
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> its run by evilcorp tho
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ChillerDragon: you are really cool you know that?
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> i feel offended
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ChillerDragon: troll
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ChillerDragon: cuz you chill
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm sorry
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ecriminal/Exploit-Discord-Cache-System-PoC did you see this yet? ðŸ˜›
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not very interesting, abuses the fact that discord doesn't sanitize pngs
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ehm what?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that just saying that discord doesn't re-encode PNGs?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't seem like a vulnerability to me
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it would be defense in depth to re-encode them
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> injects a payload to the end of a png, which you add to a server as emoji, then you send said emoji and the cache downloads it, triggering the AV
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it's AV being stupid
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not an actual RCE but did make me worried for about a second why there is a threat detected in my discord cache ðŸ˜›
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would truncate any PNG I host at IEND tbf
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can surely embed stuff that AV detects in the image part of a PNG
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound like a fix to me
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried disabling your AV? it lowers performance and increases your attack surface ðŸ˜‰
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess re-encoding is the only proper solution
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got a fairly trivial payload in mine, dunno which discord server I got it from
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the 'payload'?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a zip file?
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with a malicious executable?
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> http://codepad.org/IWiDTA7i
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> VBScript
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's kinda hopeless though, I don't see how he could ever get someone to run this
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could send a python file along with it, saying "xDe check out this free discord nitro hack abusing the cache <insert payload emoji>"
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just execute my payload directly already
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and someone who thinks they know a lot about computers but don't coooullld be fooled
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, overall meh attack
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only impact I can see is the AV detecting this and the user getting scared
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I can't see node js or discord being stupid enough to execute their cache
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why web browser caches never trigger such false positives
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they probably do something like encrypt it or encode it in a way that AV can't access it?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see the AV then trying to crack the encryption
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AV means anti virus?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> That stuff windows ppl use
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :think_bot:
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Another discussion about accounts :monkalaugh:
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MAC_address_spoofing
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really relevant, we could only see the MAC address from the same computer and then also see the real one
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 do you have any idea about this one? or @heinrich5991 maybe
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debug print it on the way and find out what kind of corruption occurs and where
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when returning its all fine, but when using the m_pMessage in the main function it returns invalid utf8
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the rest of the packet works (target, mode..)
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know what i should debug else, otherwise i wouldnt ask
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i checked it right before the return and directly inside of the CL_SAY part of OnMessage
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of corruption occurs? where in the string?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it couldnt have been modified
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you say it's invalid
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by invalid? what kind of corruption?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, i return it as a string and it returns (invalid utf8)
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and when sent to the client it just doesnt display anything
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> print*
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not return
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont get it, without the change it all worked, also the m_pMessage did not fail
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i really dont get it xD
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you say '(invalid utf8)', then that string needs to come from somewhere
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try grepping the source for it
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (invalid utf8) comes from the formatting
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not from the tw source
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so from src/base you mean?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will check it
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/F-DDrace/src/base/system.c#L129
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only appearance
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess that's where it comes from then
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, doesnt help me any further i think, how can it break on the way from returning to the main function
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> helping you is annoying for me
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ðŸ‘€
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you seem to assume that you know everything already, when the fact that something does not work as you think it should, suggests that you need to rethink an assumption
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debugging means "I don't understand why the code is doing what it does, so I can't be sure about my assumptions"
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "I try to find the point where my understanding is wrong"
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know where the print that causes (invalid utf8) happens, I'd suggest breaking there
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looking at what exactly is broken about the string if anything obvious
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then if it's not obvious, I'd disable threaded logging and step into the actual logger code where the string occurs, to see why it's thinking that
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (invalid utf8) seems to only exist on windows, no threaded logging there
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even easier
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we should try to reenable aio on windows
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should add a config option to disable threaded loggin
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> g
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't have one?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> look at me suggesting a config option
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, can be annoying for debugging
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah actually it's not really easy to add a config option for that ðŸ˜›
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> system.c has no idea what a config is
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> engine can do that on setup
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess we get a bootstrapping problem
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could have the client call sth like dbg_enable_treaded_log
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well @heinrich5991 i am sorry but my knowledge is far away from analyzing a character or a string like this to see what breaks
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what i know is that it shouldnt break from just returning, and nothing more, thats why i have no idea about it
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So your assumption that you are "just returning" it is wrong
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe you are returning a misaligned pointer, maybe you are accidentally returning a pointer to a pointer, maybe the memory you are returning is now out of scope
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, yeah, that might be it
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are doing the very last one...
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the whispermsg
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be so obvious if you'd just put a breakpoint on where you return from preprocessmsg
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because then you could probably observe the string changing
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as i said, i put a dbg msg right before the return
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it was all okay
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> print aWhisperMsg before the return would show you the correct string
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> print aWhisperMsg after would show you garbage
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, thats what it does; invalid utf8
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At that point I would print &aWhisperMsg
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, you are just being lazy with your debugging imo. You made the correct observation but didn't look into it's consequences
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> trust me i did everything i can, i just didnt know more
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A return indeed shouldn't be changing a string. So what does a return change? The only thing it changes is the stack frame
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i dont even know what that is
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, now you know \o/
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How would you order this:
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Linker - executable programm - Library - Objectcode - compiler - sourcecode
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> sourcecode - compiler - objectcode - linker - library - executable programm
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> not sure about lib and linker tho
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yeah idk what a linker is
13:32 <+ChillerDragon> is it static or dynamic lib?
13:32 <+ChillerDragon> it might also be lib last if its dynamic lib i guess
13:32 <+ChillerDragon> the linker links your obj files and libarary together to a executable
13:32 <+ChillerDragon> the compiler turns the code into obj files
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> is this ur homework or something? Am i supporting you to cheat a exam? please dont get me in jail
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Nah some homeschooling
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802154148866293791/unknown.png
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> source code - compiler - object code
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> ye thats what i said heinrich
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> also nice ip grabber link @NeXus
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then object code + libraries using the linker transforms to executable
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon what where
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> yea is it linker or libs first
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802154148866293791/unknown.png 
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> this
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a discord link
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> thats what i said
13:35 <+ChillerDragon> :D
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think they want to see that the linker *combines* libraries and object code to an executable
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> yes
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> get creative NeXus
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> you need more than - to seperate them :D
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> thanks
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the image shows that this is possible ChillerDragon
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> little bug, you can type x_ skins in here (in game you're just default)
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802156487245824020/unknown.png
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not really a bug
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client says to server i want to be x_spec, but server disallows it
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some servers might allow that
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the client that forbids that btw ðŸ˜‰
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it probs shows other tees faking x_spec as default
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's the client that does this replacement
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but only if the server tells the client to do that
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, we have a server flag that disables it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802161200133046272/unknown.png
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> any chance we can get a command to set view pos in ddnet? To bind camera positions in maps? Might as well ask upstream before i slap it in my fork
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That seems a bit problematic, not everyone has the zoom level. What do you want to use it for?
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> write a bind that teleports me in a specific position in the map
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> also as spectator you can quickly toggel between hotspots of a map
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> i do not see how it relates to zoom
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I assumed you want to change the view position during playing, not spectating
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clientside^
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For freeview spec sounds fine to me, even though I'm not sure it's that useful
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clientside in spec sounds okay for me
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He wants it for a custom client xd
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> i dont want it in my custom client id prefer it in ddnet
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> yea i thought about spec
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> inagme it sounds like infinite dyn bind
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> oka lets see if i can code it xd
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> then ill pr against ddnet
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> a couple of years ago i think ddnet had the feature that when you watch a player in spec you rather follow his client and not only the tee. so when he watches something in spec your camera automaticaly follows his nd if he switches dummy so does your cam... is it just a false memory or why was it removed?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> TIL spec char is a skin
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't even know this was a possibility
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802178536273870858/20210122_151041.jpg
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for me it was 10min
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was quicker googling
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> than to wait for it
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a way to get past it?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had ssh access
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plus you can get past with a live medium
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnier thing is I actually logged in, then I tried to sudo and made a typo 3 times
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So now I have a logged in tty that I can't escalate to root
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And another I can't log in on at all
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know the root pw? su might work
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no root pw
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fair
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast iirc, that's how I usually set up my linux systems
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway only need to wait an hour to update my system
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 66min might be enough to try the live medium
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, you have a logged in session and can work as usual?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then all is fine
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> wait so if i fail sudo 3 times i get timeout on ddnet?
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> scary shit
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you have access to ddnet servers? ^^
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> oops
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> i mean
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> no u troll i mean if i am connected with my tw client to a server and then on a terminal type ``sudo test`` and fail
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> will it close my session and kill my client to server connection
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is this a bug
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802182569646358558/unknown.png

15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> feature
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can assets break ninja skins too
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the katana skin could break it but i think it only uses the x_ninja skin
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> aren't katanas behind tees?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> weird
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk just make sure ur x_ninja skin is good first but it might be smth else
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> couldn't get more info out of the guy having the problem tbh
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually katanas are drawn just fine lol
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802183700108148766/unknown.png
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and it is kinda weird that the eyes are fine if ninja skin is broken
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m true
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @deen CHN1 have no vote options
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> myb perma server?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no, the vote options are empty, perma server have some vote options at least i think. and it wasn't perma i'm pretty sure
15:58 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://github.com/edg-l/shorust
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok the votes appear after manually switching to a map using /map
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185> i /map'ed every empty chn1 servers, now most of them are kobra now.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vote works now tho
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I even added sha256 support to teehistorian2demo now ðŸ™‚
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/commit/be7ff357b1567f923f9d168c59b94c872106d4d1
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> cool Ryozuki 
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> i never really felt the need for a urlshortner tho
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> do you have a running instance i can use Ryozuki ?
16:10 <+Ryozuki> i can set it up fast
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't use URL shortener please, they contribute to link rot
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> put one in readme that people can test its nice
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> link rot?
16:11 <+Ryozuki> i made it mainly to practise
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link rot = links 404ing after some time
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without a link shortener, the original site can go down
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with a link shortener, the original site *or* the link shortener can go down
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:11 <+Ryozuki> i mean
16:12 <+Ryozuki> ppl use link shortener services to track info
16:12 <+Ryozuki> xd
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, people do plenty of nasty stuff ðŸ˜‰
16:12 <+Ryozuki> but i wanted to make some quick app to learn stuff
16:12 <+Ryozuki> and i indeed learning, the error wrapping stuff
16:12 <+Ryozuki> learned*
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, I didn't want to complain about your project
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just about ChillerDragon wanting to use a link shortener
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª are CUIElements supposed to be self contained?
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich hater
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 oh, I forgot to deploy a newer version of teehistorian2demo :/
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now the newer version isn't even a downgrade in some respect ðŸ™‚
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now the newer version isn't even a downgrade in any respect ðŸ™‚
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki: not sure if intended, the db included in the git repo has some link to some youtube video ðŸ˜„
16:17 <+Ryozuki> oh
16:17 <+Ryozuki> it included the db
16:18 <+Ryozuki> didnt meant to lmao
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> .gitignore!
16:18 <+Ryozuki> yea, forgot
16:19 <+Ryozuki> ah it has a link to some 80's japanese music i found cool
16:19 <+Ryozuki> nothing to worry about xd
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: i made a url linking to ur url shortener using my url longener https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/zu
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> just to trigger heinrichs dead link concern
16:20 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i think ur paste can be predicted
16:20 <+Ryozuki> does it follow the abc?
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> no its random
16:20 <+Ryozuki> random with 2 chars?
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> yes
16:20 <+Ryozuki> not very securi iirc
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> but fast to type
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> dont hate on pstd
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> its best paste service
16:21 <+Ryozuki> (&mut rng)
16:21 <+Ryozuki>         .sample_iter(Alphanumeric)
16:21 <+Ryozuki>         .take(6)
16:21 <+Ryozuki>         .map(char::from)
16:21 <+Ryozuki>         .collect()
16:21 <+Ryozuki> rust best
16:21 <+Ryozuki> ez to make a random readable toen
16:21 <+Ryozuki> token
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> echo $RANDOM
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> shell better
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can I pay one of you to port CScrollRegion over to ddnet?
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> how much
16:22 <+Ryozuki> how much
16:22 <+Ryozuki> u can pay in gpus btw
16:22 <+Ryozuki> a 3070 is enough for me
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> id take a 3090
16:23 <+Ryozuki> thats 2kâ‚¬ sir
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you insane? I would pay at most 1/10th of a gpu for a feature already coded
16:23 <+Ryozuki> xd
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> gÃ¶nn doch
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's start the bidding at 20 euros
16:23 <+Ryozuki> not worth
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> if you pay in btc
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> i take 20
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> will be 2k when i finished coding
16:24 <+Ryozuki> kappa
16:24 <+Ryozuki> i hear its going down rn
16:24 <+Ryozuki> from 30k to 26k â‚¬
16:24 <+Ryozuki> yep
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> buy the DIP!
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll pay you the 20e and you can get bitcoin with it? ðŸ˜„
16:25 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon buy TRX
16:25 <+Ryozuki> i made a gamble that day u said
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Trx scam coin haha
16:25 <+Ryozuki> and bought 10â‚¬ worth of TRX
16:25 <+Ryozuki> https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/
16:25 <+Ryozuki> @Ama why is it a scam xd
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its not scam but it has too many coins
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And produces more every month
16:26 <+Ryozuki> https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/tether-usdt-routed-tron-ethereum/
16:26 <+Ryozuki> i wonder what this means
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> So it will never be Worth much i think i cashed out 15k 3 years ago when it went to 2000 satoshi
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll up my offer to 30e, you can get a reaaally nice bottle of gin for that
16:27 <+Ryozuki> doesnt it have a cap?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I bought at 300 satoshi
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And sold at 1800
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> At 1 point i had 1 btc with an 2k usd investment
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Too bad i didnt hold on to the btc haha
16:29 <+Ryozuki> hehe
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, we all have cryptoregrets, can we get back to the topic on hand?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I require CScrollRegion ported
16:30 <+Ryozuki> i would consider at 100â‚¬, im just in a rly lazy mod for c++ rn
16:30 <+Ryozuki> rust is too great
16:30 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon go code it
16:30 <+Ryozuki> u dont contribute since long
16:30 <+Ryozuki> nobo
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 100 is a little too rich for my blood, two entire bottles of very decent whiskey
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno what u mean
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do they render themselves?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no, they basically only a state object
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So they are more tracking of elements than actual elements?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is `m_OwnUIElements` for and what is `m_UIElements` for?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (obv `CUI::`)
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ui elements maintained by CUI class
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like, deleted
16:37 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon here the url shortener https://noby.world/
16:37 <+Ryozuki> and yes, its a domain i own xd
16:37 <+Ryozuki> https://noby.world/Wvl9MA
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does it mean for an ui element to be maintained by the CUI class?
16:39 <+Ryozuki> that it is managed by the cui?
16:39 <+Ryozuki> e.g cui says when its rendered
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice noby.world url shortner i love it
16:39 <+Ryozuki> and passes events to it
16:39 <+Ryozuki> idk
16:39 <+Ryozuki> xdd
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://noby.world/rAyPg7
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> love it
16:40 <+Ryozuki> nice
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should host a instance
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems to me if you create a CUIElement it self inserts into m_UIElements, if you get one thru GetNewUIElement it's also inserted into m_OwnUIElements
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 nothing special, it just means u dont need to deallocate it
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> and then buy facebook ads to promote it
16:40 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon see, this one is hardly predictable
16:40 <+Ryozuki> ur 2 letter id is
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> then sell out the url shortner and redirect everything to some ads and get rich
16:41 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon shh
16:41 <+Ryozuki> actually smart
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> the 2 letter is awesome
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> i can remember them and use it to share pastes across devices
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª what are some elements using this new api?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> server browser
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So this is a class that keeps track of a vector of quads(?) and uses quad containers to make sure they aren't re rendered all the time?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I know I should have asked these before merging)
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it keeps track of specific attributes the streamed functions use, e.g. color of text, the text itself
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and checks if any of them changed
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its still streamed, just cached
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it can handle only text?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ui rects
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does it decide if a ui rect changed?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how can i record all gameplay but only save when i want to
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with common attributes
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> color
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> size
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u mean demo record, there is cl_replays
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you mean actual video your gpu is much better at that then we could ever hope to be, take a look at ReLive for AMD and ShadowPlay for Nvidia
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> gpus are fast and all but i feel like recording tw demos is less overhead than an actual screen record
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> and demos can always be tunred into video aftwards
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> but i think classic corneum is here for replay bots and wants to hax some ranks xd
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no i just dont want gigabytes of demos piling up
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> so legit
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but still keep cool moments
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> ye cl_replays is ur friend
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cl_replaybot
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and turn auto demo record off?
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> :robot:
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> @noby i actually had conflicts when i tried to merge with upstread because some replay functions already existed
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> :justatest:
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :ban:
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> idk probably auto demo off give it a try or ask the math brain
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> or wait how did i use to call him
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> forgot his nickname
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Problem is recording videos or tw demos on ourside has "some" overhead while recording a video for gpus have very negligible overhead as they have hardware for this specifically
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> did u ever run fraps on windows 
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> rip framerate
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fraps is not the same as gpu accelerated recording
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> yea fair i guess
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> obs can utilize some of the hardware capabilities now, so that's a more fair comparison
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea obs performs quite well
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> still feels like more overhead than tw demos
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i read always everywhere that cpu encoding/recording has more quality always
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> i never noticed a difference when recording tw demos
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well ofc ðŸ˜„ how do you think they "accelerate" the process?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> silicon real estate is premium, can't waste too much
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuzhang_(quantum_computer)
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder about quantum computers
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china supposedly made this
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nvenc is quiiite good though, still not perfect but at that speed it's much better quality than I ever expected
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats 2.5 billion years faster than their own supercomputer
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats 2.5 billion times faster than their own supercomputer
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The Chinese team claims it to be 10 billion times faster than Google's superconductor-based Sycamore processor, and as such, becomes the second computer to attain quantum supremacy
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also claim its 10 billions time faster than google quantum computer
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> america should drop a bomb on that thing before they start to decrypt all our communications
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if quantum computers exist
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they already decrypted all
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would only assume that murica army is already using them
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is quantum proof cryptography tho
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> quantum computers exist, they just weren't strong enough yet
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cana quantukm computer run tw with 20x zoomout tho
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "post quantum cryptography" is a really interesting field
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant they uise the quantum computer to find a super good covid vaccine thanks bye
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine using science for human needs and not info warfare or wars
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we would be in another place rn
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats kumbaya
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think google with their quantum computer already demonstrated solving some insane problems
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if they have enough qubits to break rsa with any meaningful key size
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently around 6k qubits are needed to break AES-256, not even close ðŸ˜›
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and that's logical qubits not physical ones, so multiply that by 12 or so
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then makes sense
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 source? I didn't know you could break stuff like AES with quantum computers
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04965v1.pdf I found it in some guys comment in stackexchange but I closed the tab ðŸ˜›
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it doesn't give significant advantage for AES?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, it should actually, you can browse the search space more efficiently
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this stuff says you can "only" reduce the search space by sqrt()
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> means that 256bit AES is still secure, 128bit is not

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny comment
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> famous last words before the ASIO builds a quantum computer the size of jupiter to spy on australian citizens
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would you mind taking al ook at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3492 ? ðŸ™‚
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Does the client or server get weird if you run it for a long time without restarting?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> shouldn't
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it does, it's a bug
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Well maybe you can recreate it. I used cheat engine to speed hack and after 14 hours some bullets stopped moving and my grenades don't rotate. Even after reload
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (sounds plausible, these kinds of bugs)
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Do the official servers restart when empty?
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki investing in warefare is important when space invaders come and attaxx us
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> and like zombies
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon we can find any signs of life by ourselves, we wont be able to protect if they come anyway
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant*
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum yes, daily
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> well only zombies then
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe we can try out https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime or something similar to see if we can reproduce these physics problems
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> What does this do compared to speedhack?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Also, can u host servers that run on 50% speed so I can play Gores better:troll:
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's for linux instead of windows
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> You mean the hack itself caused it?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i remember long ago having a bug because trigonometry function didn't work out when input was too big
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's just an idea because you said you used speedhacks
