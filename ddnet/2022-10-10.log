01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> damn, i got hooked on the carlo wood vulkan thing, but then it turns out hes an anti vaxx and is shilling some 55 minute video about it in the description of every video
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> windows epoch starts 10000BC??
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 100ns into 64 bit counters adds up to 58k years
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this fixed it!
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Now just gotta test audio and i think i got a usable gentoo desktop
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Without systems :monkalaugh:
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Without systemsd :monkalaugh:
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Without systemd :monkalaugh:
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a futher max, FILETIME values can't be larger than 0x8000000000000000
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> lmao i just found the most cursed way to share github commits https://github.com/sirius1242/ddnet/tree-commit/e0f59cd454b5f8a6a0a16ad530a1ac918cdf7c42
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u recommend using a experimental kernel with gentoo?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I want 5.17 which has support for znver3 march when compiling
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I want 5.17 for the amd p state driver and experimental for support for znver3 march when compiling
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ryzen
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (the kernel itself)
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, the only issue with an unstable kernel is that it's not as well tested, but they usually work
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Hello
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well on arch i used thebl bleeding edge
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hi
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well give it a go, I doubt you'll have any issues
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have modern hardware and no wifi
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think ill benefit from a modern kernep
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupid Mobile
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I ran unstable for a long time on my laptop and only once had a panic
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think 6.0 is out, no?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But there was an issue with a intel driver
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It could break the intel gpus? Xd
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Anyway i dont use intel
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh it could break ur monitor lmao
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.techspot.com/news/96204-linux-kernel-51912-can-damage-intel-laptop-lcds.html
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afaik that was simply a "we can imagine it breaking a monitor in the worst case, but no one actually reported that"
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Released for most major distros this week, Linux Kernel 6.0 supports the newest hardware architectures, including Raptor Lake, Meteor Lake, Arc Alchemist, and RDNA 3. It also marks a start for the operating system's entrance into Arm by introducing support for the Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops. Furthermore, the new kernel fixes a vestigial 20-year-old workaround that slows down recent AMD processors.
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess xd
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, linux didnt have arm support before 6.0? I find thay hard to believe
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Apparently its a real thing
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> For arm laptops
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my phone is arm, it runs some linux fork
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lenovo x13
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I doubt google patched linux to support arm for my phone
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102232 ← finally, `std::hint::black_box` stabilized
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is useful in writing benchmark code to make sure constants aren't optimized out
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nice
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I always use criterion and it had one already tho
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Criterion is rly nice
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yay new fork only to disable voxelations kekw
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> everyone LOVES me
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ask russians tho
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> fr though do people hate the update THAT much
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yup
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :cammo:
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they will stay on older version only cuz they can't play with these animations
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please direct the hate at me
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe even tho i personally not against it, but did they try the latest nightly?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the heinrich5991-no-options guy
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe even tho i personally not against an option, but did they try the latest nightly?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what exactly do u mean? did they ever play with voxelations?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have to say since the update running looks better than fast walking
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, last night was an update
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> naah bro there's another thing
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should be in the current nightly
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i made it look better in nightly
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it blurs ur eye when u play on fng race or another fast going mod
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and see animations
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and like
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wtf happening
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i kind of made it less distracting with this new update, turns out making the body bounce less does wonders
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i'll ask them to try it out but i don't think that they change their minds
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they should look when u walk fast vs when u run slow
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why btw?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because options are an open-source disease
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead of providing sensible defaults, we put everything behind an option. additionally, they're maintenance overhead
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to refactor something, you have to look at every affected option to see if it still works. if you add another option, you have to make sure it plays well with all other options
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its not problem of only open-source
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its disease of snowball updating
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if u want to add new feature this feature should be incapsulated as much as it can to
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imo the problem is a bit different
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We don't provide a clean API which you can build e.g. new animations based on that could disabled by simply disabling the code path (e.g. by a modding API)
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Also look at minecraft. 100 mods works somehow together. it needs a clean code flow. What we currently do is, put everything in place which bloats the code and makes it less readable and harder to test
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and you can just say "hey guys defaults work better than custom settings, u should be careful with it"
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't work. we'll get bug reports even with custom settings
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, an API to build upon would also be nice
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so u want to give players white box and force them to play with it
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> even if they wanted black sphere
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, basically. people like you can even compile their own ddnet if it bugs them so much
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> as i can
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can even use github actions ^^
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but not majority of non-ddr players that play with ddnet client
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yooo imagine ddnet code could support actual mods
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its old problem that we had back then
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hmm what client to play with
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you can help them. or you could maybe ask the Tater guy to add an option for it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in his client
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ddnet code is not clean anyway
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you will delete another options too?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's sensible, sure
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its not that moment when you can say its pure core
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> teeworlds pure core
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> someone someday will make the code much better to handle
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah waiting for scalable rusty tw server
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or teesharp
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would do little for the client
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yup
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but then u can go along with client
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then let them stay
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody is forcing them
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we cant support old versions forever xD
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> same with old hardware it blocks all progress
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> DDNet has to conquer the world, it needs more power
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I disagree with the hardware bit ^^
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well just bcs 5 ppl would be dropped
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, five real users
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but lets face it, 15years of hardware support is stupid
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why? why should hardware be replaced if it works perfectly fine?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt work perfectly fine
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt run on vulkan
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has no shader support
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does, it just doesn't support the new fancy thing that the programmer wants
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it supports all ddnet needs
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i disagree with that
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it supports what u think ddnet needs
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with which part?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think ddnet could evolve much quicker if we wouldnt be stuck since 5 years
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes lets use c++23 pls
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need std::expect and std::option to do rust-like programming in c++
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we also use more and more multithreading, old hardware struggles with that too
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i think 3-4 years is totally fine, but yeah lets go all in
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we plan to use c++20 next year already
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes no sense to stay on outdated linux kernels
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur hardware suppoirts modern kernels
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use a modern distro
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with modern gcc
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or clang
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems we're arguing about different things
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no im just adding to the things
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one is hardware support, and one is compiler support
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are entirely different things
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can have a new compiler and still support old machines
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but related to moving out of outdated stuff
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> old hardware uses more energy for doing less
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks using python uses more energy for doing less too
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and vulkan uses less energy for doing more
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got some numbers to back that up?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the last part
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more fps = more efficient
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know why my xcursor icon changes on everything but firefox?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, then we have different opinions on what's "doing more"
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 15k fps is stupid but there's no good alternative because there's no good API to find out when the screen is changing stuff
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 15k fps is firstly lot of fps
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's clearly a waste of energy, but there's no good way to avoid it without changing the output
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the APIs aren't there
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks i have a problem with your name
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can't type it in latex 😢
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i bet my pc runs 15k fps with less energy than a gamer computer runs at 1k fps from 15 years ago
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't run at 1 k fps
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice sounds like a feature
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I run at 60 fps, and I probably don't have a "gamer pc"
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you don't want to appear in my acknowledgements 😄
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, and u are probably not taking this game serious enough that i'd consider you a "pro"
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no hate
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then most people aren't pros, I guess?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```latex
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> One last thought for the online people who helped me relax after a hard day of work. Special thanks to \textbf{deen} who maintained \href{https://ddnet.org}{DDNet} tirelessly for almost 10 years now. Thanks to the \emph{old} guys team for the games on fridays or saturdays evening: \textbf{|Ŗaþŧurę|} (you will survive), \textbf{Sir Skeleton} (where are you?), \textbf{Sir Kruksic} (who are you?), \textbf{Kasia} (Weedo is alive), \textbf{My

21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> star doesn't compile
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but there are lot of pros, and pros stay
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> additction kicks in hard
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh getting acknowledged for helping you relax
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats dope
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i havent even done anything for you xDD
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Voxel poggers the newcomer
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway @heinrich5991 i can surely understand that it sucks to drop ppl
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the question is, how long... there is always one troll staying on windows xp with his 1990 pc
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imo it's insane to support them forever, just bcs we could
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, my arch linux installation became 10 years old a month ago 🎂
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you fixed 64 bit windows version to use graphic card with vulkan
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, i think i found a replacement: \ding{74}

21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now rewrite for ryoos
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i need to fix ryoos
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it crashes sadge
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and first i would need to write a usb driver
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but usb spec is insane long
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant imagine a  gpu xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sounds annoying
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> start with GPU instead
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://helix-editor.com/
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im gonna try this
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where is mouse support
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i didnt play teeworlds for 10 years to not use my aim
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dude the video is cool, its selectable xD

21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why though?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum, looks like pdf doesn't include good character when i copy paste it
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What's this for?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Jupstar J
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why J?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it copies to J?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> |R , aþt̄ur ̨e|
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lol, utf8 is too hard, i always say that
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> rathture
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> learath hate in 3,2,1
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Freaking weird, no?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Chairn have u tried to open it in a browser?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah no
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> upstar J,
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it's just pdf format that doesn't support unicode
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like, it's letters + diacritics, not single chars
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am the most confused person anyway. we have so many formats all so different
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when i copy |R, aþ ̄tur ̨e| and its t several times, it adds diacritic over some letters
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but somehow it works most of the time xd
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> phd acknowledgements
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ohhhh
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> someday when chairn is fame, you are too
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> voxel the newcomer
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same problem here about unicode pdf <https://superuser.com/questions/92615/cannot-copy-non-latin-characters-from-pdf-document>
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs ez like that, missing fonts and stuff too annoying
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am so old, i remember the time when PDFs got fame xDD
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 219 different fonts in my document
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 50 if you merge them
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how tall is the PDF?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029116120852070440/unknown.png
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tall? or big?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why so many fonts
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 176 pages for 4.2m
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> each figures has the font duplicated i think when being included
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how many bytes
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 4.2mb

21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> almost all figures are made with LaTeX
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think i killed the convo 😄
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> wall of text
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no more
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not quite sure what you mean, but did you set a default cursor? otherwise you'll get the X
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay i  got audio working
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forgot to enable some kernel settings
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its funny but i think i compile the kernel faster than ddnet
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🤔
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the config itself is probs already slower xD
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe u build the most minimal kernel ever
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i enable only what i need
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i did that too some day
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then ntfs didnt work xD
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need to enable ntfs xd
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since then i stopped doing that
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont enable it cuz i dont use ntfs
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but i thought i enabled it, but appraently only read only mode
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the driver didnt exist yet
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> until u need it
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think a rewrite is relatively new
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and need to recompile xD
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its p fast xd
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make sure to pass -j12
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should i limit my CPU to 12 threads
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i remeber smth like 20-30 mins, but on ryzen 1800x
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well my cpu has 12 xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it defs wasnt < 10 seconds like ddnet xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know xd
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my kernel  legit compiles under 30s
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> clean compile?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never xD
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u also need amdgpu bro
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that alone probs takes like 5mins or more
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have amdgpu enabled
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its not clean
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont remember it taking long
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks does C code compile faster than c++
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu?h=v6.0
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes much faster very likely
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also much faster than rust 😛
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean its c
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah rust compiles slow but cuz it checks for way more
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like running clang-analyzer
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki see, this alone is bigger than whole ddnet project D
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki see, this alone is bigger than whole ddnet project xD
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got holidays starting from wednesday
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill have time to tweak my  gentoo
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imagine having more time and understanding all this code
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be soo cool 😄
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks there is a rust vtuber
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> asashi lina
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> she did the gpu driver for the m1 linux port
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah very pro
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/c/AsahiLina/videos
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> her voice sounds so pitched xD
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is she  japanese?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oOQ0VtBxrU
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean japanese are insane voice actors, they born with this talent xD
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> her vids are 8 or more hours long
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xd
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant stand the voice either
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i like cute anime voices
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant believe she codes in kate xD
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i did fng2 in notepad++
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do I hide a stuck tooltip on X, short of killing the offending process?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 try
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xpropr
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and click
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xprop
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xprop.1.html
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that shows me the offending process
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can I somehow get rid of the tooltip, without killing that process?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xkill :0.0
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xkill -display :0.0
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no idea if that works xd
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `xkill` kills the program corresponding to a window
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to kill the process ^^
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is it even stuck
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean if its single threaded how do u want to kill it, without killing the process?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just want to hide the window
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u playing a game and it shows some popups or what? 😄
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a tooltip, and it doesn't go away. in this particular case, it's a crashed program open in my debugger
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that tooltip obscures part of my screen
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to kill the process because I want to debug it
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the tooltip is a little annoying though
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> move  the debugger?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that works around the problem
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :D
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://fyrox.rs/blog/post/feature-highlights-0-28/
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks pog
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its funny how all these AAA game engines suddenly popup xd
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> o3de
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> godot
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 500 rust game engines xd
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust only has bevy and fyrox
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that stand out
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried to install UE5 then I tried o3de xD. none of them worked so I went back to godot
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think o3de only works with vulkan
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of o3de
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its sponsored by linux foundation
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and its from amazon xD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> 3A games big bloat 100GB+
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everyone was mad that godot wasnt sponsored instead xD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depends which xd
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they should have sponsored godot
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> baldurs gate early access is worth the 100 GByte for only arc1 xDD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe they thought godot already got sponsors
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno the reasoning, but still funny
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw ill visit frankfurt when going to tokyo
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda funny xd
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice, i'd like to visit it too some day
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> frankfurt
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^^
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not japan
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Aw, thanks 🙂

23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does it work?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029143055737032734/unknown.png
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 1 Miles = 1.60934 kilometers
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > which is approximately same to the Golden Ratio. That's the reason Fibonacci Series is used as the conversion scale of Miles to Kilometers.
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today you learnt :D
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i did too, found on twitter xd
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah 🙂
