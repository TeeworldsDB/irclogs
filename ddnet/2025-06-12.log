00:26 < bridge> <patiga> taking another look at it, it appears that $HOME expands to `/root/` for some reason, and not to `/builds/ddnet-rs/twmap-py/`
00:46 < bridge> <patiga> that part runs now 🔥
01:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ah okay
01:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> okay but imagine Hit the Targets in teeworlds
01:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> race timer finishes when u hit last target
01:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes what rossbit said. it’s an alias for source to load the environment so that rust is in the PATH. I assume I have it from some rustup docs. If the file is not there maybe you don’t need it. Unless you fixed it already I can have a look tomorrow
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> link to the mingw64 library paths

02:45 < bridge> <patiga> twmap-py *should* now support macos (chillerdragon, @avolicious)
03:09 < bridge> <patiga> @art0007i @essigautomat the windows crash is hopefully also fixed with the new version
04:15 < bridge> <vader0530_0530_64452> can some one send me the server link of kog to me?
04:45 < bridge> <louis> how do i add stuff to generated protocol.h ?
04:45 < bridge> <louis> ```cpp
04:45 < bridge> <louis> enum
04:45 < bridge> <louis> {
04:45 < bridge> <louis>     LASERTYPE_RIFLE,
04:45 < bridge> <louis>     LASERTYPE_SHOTGUN,

04:45 < bridge> <louis> };
04:45 < bridge> <louis> ```
04:45 < bridge> <louis> 
04:45 < bridge> <louis> for example i want to define
04:45 < bridge> <louis> ```cpp
04:45 < bridge> <louis> enum

04:45 < bridge> <louis> }
04:45 < bridge> <louis> ```

08:13 < bridge> <louis> might also add normal target inside gamelayer, has the cool addition of being able to intercept weapons midair without any jank wep tele (and can explode nades midair conditionally)
08:14 < bridge> <louis> if anyone has ideas to make the feature better lmk i think some cool maps can come out of this
08:17 < bridge> <Assa> I guess you're already working on this, but I'd work on the visuals for the switches
08:18 < bridge> <louis> ye i think i will make it a target / dartboard somehow
08:18 < bridge> <Assa> uh, you could and make the outline/inner color match the dartboard 😮
08:19 < bridge> <louis> are switches colored now?
08:19 < bridge> <louis> i was thinking the inner color red or green based on whether it activates or not (and both red and green for the alternating type)
08:19 < bridge> <Assa> normal on/off switches have no animation at all (unfortunately)
08:20 < bridge> <louis> ye it would be nice to have more visuals for switches tbh

11:29 < bridge> <patiga> the windows twmap-py crash on loading a map
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga hi, i think the twmap checker could add a new check.
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are quite a few maps with duplicated assets.
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. `Lockdown` has `desert_main` twice
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are more maps with this problem
11:33 < bridge> <patiga> hm, should that be in the optimizer (e.g. could be done in --remove-unused files I guess), or in the checker that throws "map errors"
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say it's an error
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are not unused in Lockdown even
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> 🥳
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> now I can load the even bigger mona lisa and render it
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> now I can load the even bigger mona lisa and render it (I could have done that before with an older version anyway)
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga Also we still have maps with invalid utf8, e.g. (but not limited to)
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Regen
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Regen 3
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Blue Fox
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The editor even shows an error for them
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dunno if your tool is also for correctness of old maps
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1382665164897390592/image.png?ex=684bfac7&is=684aa947&hm=45bfd972878493ede9356f23d860fc4b06887c4e043820b440b93543525b7219&
12:18 < bridge> <patiga> twmap logs whenever it encounters invalid utf8, but there is simply too much of it to throw an error
12:19 < bridge> <patiga> thats why it uses lossy conversions, and then potentially cuts off the end of the string if it gets too long
12:20 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks what would you like twmap to do there?
12:21 < bridge> <patiga> there is a fun envelope which has a long non-utf8 name that got copied into loots of maps
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hard to say, lossy generally sounds ok. I just wonder if this could lead to duplicated names again (Even tho this is probably a edge case).
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally it would simply be nice if we fix those map
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Instead of letting them stay invalid
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For new maps it should fail
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well then it should probs fail for all xD
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since we should fix the broken once
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/746534464984973323/806522437041782804
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> found it :D
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lool
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> I think its just too many maps
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Too many for what?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For converting them to lossy?
12:24 < bridge> <patiga> yes, we don't want to resave old maps for smaller things, as everyone needs to redownload them, then
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I doubt these old maps are played that often
12:26 < bridge> <patiga> you could try to count the amount of maps, I would bet its >300, although this is ofc just a rough estimate
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tja. I just think official maps should not contain bugs, kinda not high quality standards xD
12:27 < bridge> <patiga> e.g. run twmap-check for each with -vvv and +1 if it prints a line with "invalid utf-8"
12:29 < bridge> <patiga> imo its alright
12:30 < bridge> <patiga> I mean these names are artifacts from a time where the strings simply weren't encoded as utf-8
12:30 < bridge> <patiga> only later was that change made
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But if you load one of these maps in the editor you get an error.. I don't think that is alright
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And silencing that error is not alright either
12:32 < bridge> <patiga> then there could a be the equivalent of logging in the editor somehow
12:32 < bridge> <patiga> a popup saying "this map had invalid content and was modified on load"
12:32 < bridge> <patiga> I agree ddnet shouldn't have maps not loadable in the editor
12:33 < bridge> <patiga> kinda funny to me that ddnet is now more strict than twmap in some ways ^^
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> and then we have older maps, who actively abuse bugs :pepeW:
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Map file format bugs?
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> more like entity bugs
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> old speedup bug for example
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So gameplay bugs?
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> gameplay bugs yes. In the case of force 0 speedtiles maybe both
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, but that can at least be fun xdd
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean this is fun too, but also a bit sad
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> yeah hugging a wall until you suddenly fly to outer space sounds like a fun intuitive mechanic
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but I was not about physics related bugs here
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> These map format bugs are actually fixable
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> are you fine with the rest of my rendering PR?
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I didn't look into it yet, maybe weekend
12:44 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks because of how common it is, I believe that at least the ddnet editor should allow those maps to be opened. ddnet maps aren't the only maps out there, and rejecting such 'bugs' on load will make most of heinrich's map archive unusable
12:44 < bridge> <patiga> not 100% sure about most, but at the very least a huge chunk of it
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are not rejected, it's a popup already
12:44 < bridge> <patiga> ah
12:45 < bridge> <patiga> imo its fine as-is then
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno, error popups on official maps doesn't convince me tbh xD
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks now that I am taking a look at shaders, can you explain this bit?
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> layout(push_constant) uniform SPosBO {
12:53 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 0) uniform mat4x2 gPos;
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:53 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 32) uniform vec2 gOffset;
12:53 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 40) uniform vec2 gScale;
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> } gPosBO;
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> so SPosBO is some kind of Buffer in my understanding, and the lines below are how thie buffer is formated, the first 32 bit are the mat4x2, 8 bit for gOffset and 8 bit then for gScale?
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> how do you get 32 bit for mat4x2?
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `4*2*4`
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not bit
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bytes
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> hmm yeah that would help 🤔 😆
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> okay 4 bytes per int basically, in all of them
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> thanks
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> floats
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> oh, then floats
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> and why does the offset on the fragment shader not start at 0 here?
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> layout(push_constant) uniform SFragConstBO {
12:59 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 48) uniform vec4 gVertColor;
12:59 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 64) uniform vec4 gVertOutlineColor;
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> } gFragConst;
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> This is from tile.frag, I guess there is some data infront of it then?
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes the data you mentioned above
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A push constant is for the whole shader pipeline
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That way you can access the same push constant in vert & frag if you want
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Which in this case is not wanted
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> is there some data or padding in between? because the offsets don't match
13:04 < bridge> <Assa> the examples I gave would match, but this are different shaders
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> but this:
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> tile.vert
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> layout(push_constant) uniform SPosBO {
13:06 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 0) uniform mat4x2 gPos;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> } gPosBO;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> tile.frag
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> layout(push_constant) uniform SVertexColorBO {
13:06 < bridge> <Assa>     layout(offset = 64) uniform vec4 gVertColor;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> } gColorBO;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't.
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> We esabtlished above, that mat4x2 has 32 bytes and not 64 🤔
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think one of the tile shaders has some other stuff or smth
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also the padding does not mean we also push the padding.
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can do two push constant calls with different offsets
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> hmm okay so there is another optimization using the same data for different shaders
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> thank you for your responses, this is very helpful 👍
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not always about optimization
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Readability in code
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If all shaders have a gPos at the same position, you can push them the same everywhere for example
13:24 < bridge> <patiga> lmao twmap doesn't even log invalid utf8, because that just appears too often. it only logs if the replacement characters make the string too long so that it has to cut off the end
13:36 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks My estimate seems to be wrong. According to this script, `85/2381 maps have invalid utf-8`
13:36 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1382685105994338479/utf8-replacement.py?ex=684c0d5a&is=684abbda&hm=47bc78d1d15f87b32277a407cef9a59f5aeb8ebeab32f5def6d862b7a708c893&
13:43 < bridge> <patiga> and 44 maps have another string-related bug, where stuff is zero that shouldn't be zeroed
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> IMO img & sound are also more critical, since those asset potentially get exported. and having empty names is little weird
14:09 < bridge> <patiga> `63/2381 maps have invalid utf-8`
14:09 < bridge> <patiga> for only images and sounds
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh still so much, sick

14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can discord just add an option to disallow sending same msg in every channel
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just so stupid xD
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> you can add a bot that does that
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes please
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add ✪✪Net#6625
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Best bot confirmed
14:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> is it the bot from ddnet rs
14:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> if so then yes please i want mapres db
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Without optimizations from the 998.4 MiB (1.046.878.863) size of all ddnet maps, around 895.1 MiB (938.629.781) is the size of all resources.
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now I'll run the same script again, but with image (png) optimizations.
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's still sick that by default the image crate gives pngs that are probably not much better packed than just storing the images as plain image array and run deflate on them.
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess the conversation takes around 1.5h so cya later

14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also there is an insane amount of duplicated images with only very minor changes.
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So lot of potential to reduce map sizes is wasted by that
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So many similar stars xD

14:42 < bridge> <sans._.> compound assets when
14:44 < bridge> <patiga> I just recently wrote a python script to get the accurate size of them in maps, if that isn't what you are already doing
14:44 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1382702219815686318/image.png?ex=684c1d4a&is=684acbca&hm=8fd27baef306f2a2c369bdbe59a5e06a9e2a1f97836682f35d17d0c66224a594&
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We often talked here about storing images as real pngs inside the map files.
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And even about splitting them so maps that use the same image don't have it duplicated.
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But the reality at least for the second part is, most have minor changes to them.
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For the first part we'll see, bcs image optimizations can do a LOT. Like I expect at least 20% less in size
14:47 < bridge> <soulyvevo> having some way to do minor edits would be nice
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> I would be interested in an comparison between current vs png vs plain zstd compression
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah would be interesting for sure
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> (to generate the plots above)

14:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> using a custom dictionary for compression go brr
14:48 < bridge> <patiga> requires the `kaitaistruct` module
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sure, but very hard for images
14:49 < bridge> <patiga> custom dictionary is more useful for things like protocols afaik
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's useful where patterns are similar
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was assuming a huge amount of exactly or almost exactly duplicated images
14:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so you could put entire images in the dictionary :lol:
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^^ There are indeed a lot of duplicates.
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just a question on how big the dict should be
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But anyway, oxipng is really good, let's see how much it can improve the size
14:52 < bridge> <patiga> when the editor dilates images, does it change the image if it was previously dilated?
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only if both dilate algorithms differ
14:52 < bridge> <patiga> ah, so it resets the transparent pixels?
14:52 < bridge> <patiga> I think I missed that part in twmap 😅
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No there is a PR open for that
14:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> There was a convo years ago by me about using optimizations for PNGs that cut the sizes down significantly
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But not merged
14:52 < bridge> <patiga> ah, still makes sense
14:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Again, my recommendation was ignored
14:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> until now I guess
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh?
14:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> what did u recommend
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I haven't seen any PR from you about that
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I also recommend blake3 over anything else for it's insane SIMD perf.
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dosn't mean we realistically change to it in ddnet any time soon
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1382704678097125507/image.png?ex=684c1f94&is=684ace14&hm=d7945c1a8d8588269994640853d72de004ea983ea75473bfb3dbe19a5ed57e85&
14:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> old ass convo about this convo, it is similar to what I was getting at back then
14:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and I was an asshole back then, who knew
14:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> btw, in 2019? damn that's long ago
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We are old
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But gold
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Even worse than today? 😱 
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> jkjk <3
14:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ok, found a better convo
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/oxipng/oxipng
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > Oxipng is a multithreaded lossless PNG/APNG compression optimizer. It can be used via a command-line interface or as a library in other Rust programs.
14:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> compressing pngs could even result in even bigger filesizes in editor xd
14:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> because editor decompresses everything
14:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, but normally that's not the limitation in databases
14:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> storing the sizes are the issue, and that's where it would be useful
14:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> At least on maps
14:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> On tee skins or any HUD stuff, no.
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 385.3 MiB (404.036.132)
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Holy shit
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's a LOT more than I expected
14:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> -60% size
14:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> perhaps above
14:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> nice
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe the default image crate really just sucks at compression pngs with default settings
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So yeah if we use an optimizer, storing PNGs as PNGs in maps would probably decrease map sizes quite a bit
15:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Would free up more space in map db
15:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> question is, would deen approve of this
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It would break compat to all old clients
15:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or heinrich
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So no
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I approve
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
15:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Hmmm, maybe back then this excuse flew this idea away
15:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> now, how many years? 5? later
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Are we still going to say the same?
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This kind of optimization would not just improve the map db by more than half, but also the asset databases as well
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Including all those 4k images
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or full HD
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well the last part is up to you
15:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's worth investing to it, even if it breaks client compatibility
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nobody stops you from calling oxipng when someone uploads a png to your database
15:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Up to them you mean
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There is no compat in loading pngs realistically.
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since the map file does not store them as png.
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it's only about if the editor can load them into memory
15:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If it was up to me, I would do it.
15:04 < bridge> <patiga> I mean we shouldn't care about the db sizes imo
15:04 < bridge> <patiga> its more about how much storage spaces stuff user need to store what they need
15:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How many maps, assets and other goods you guys store?
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> why do you ask?
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> and I don't know
15:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for maps, it's over 5GBs, and for textures, I assume (based on TeeData's 25k textures being around 10GB+), around 15GBs
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> that sounds very reasonable for a db
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The download speed for maps would effectively double
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and half for downloaded maps on all clients of all users
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So technically it would be wasted not to do it
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> yes, that would be really cool
15:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> from 20GBs, cutting it down by half is kinda a big deal
15:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh yeah, cuz the filesize is also smaller, that is a good benefit
15:06 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks it would be possible to serve different maps to new clients
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
15:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> As long as the client supports the compression optimized images, it should be gucci
15:07 < bridge> <patiga> locally, you would always have the 'full' map, only during transport would you have smol maps
15:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Maybe a command line to automatically convert your maps from your data folder into a new one would be awesome
15:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Would save a lot of time for some people
15:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Maybe a command line to automatically convert your maps from your data folder into a new one (with the optimizations) would be awesome
15:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, as long as the download size is smaller that's all that matters
15:10 < bridge> <patiga> I mean like many people I have >40GB in demos, but it doesn't really matter because storage space isn't that relevant. does the storage space cost you more because you host it on some cloud provider?
15:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In some cases yeah, it can fluctuate
15:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And you always want to have a plan B, in case something fuckes up
15:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And you always want to have a plan B, in case something fucks up
15:11 < bridge> <patiga> I don't understand
15:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Again, question always will be with these convos, is whether deen or heinrich would approve of this, or at least approve of the development
15:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> would be a waste of time if they decline it whenever someone already wants this implemented
15:14 < bridge> <zhn> any issues with this solution?
15:15 < bridge> <patiga> it doesn't solve the problem entirely
15:16 < bridge> <zhn> what's getting off then?
15:16 < bridge> <zhn> looks solid to the problem it tries to solve
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In most databases, the prizing may not be stable due to conflictions with what they are dealing with in the background. In some cases prizes change where it's cheap, and where it's a fixed prize it's fuckin expensive to run.
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So you are most likely going to switch from database to database to find the best possible specs and optimal speed for whatever.
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Now on the map db, speed should be the priority. specifically download / upload speed for different regions.
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> On Asset db including skins, gameskins and other HUD assets, size matters the most.
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Since Teehistorian would be your "demo" dbs, I can say it's now both. Size and speed matters there, since there are no real ways of optimizing something that is around a decade old in collecting and using very important data. (no clue if old data is wiped or contained somewhere else.)
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Both cannot exist, since it's either the cheap (one over the other), or expensive (can be both but massive tax) option.
15:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Having a plan B should be regarded, when you cannot maintain a database that has a specific purpose, that you cannot afford to move to a more dynamic option
15:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> -# I think you mean pricing and prices
15:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> That is why I don't deal with teeworlds anymore. I would've made my own "TeeData" db if I didn't realize that maintaining one is a fucking pain in the ass
15:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh grammar teacher
15:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You should know enough about language to know that I wasn't correcting your grammar
15:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In most databases, the pricing may not be stable due to conflictions with what they are dealing with in the background. In some cases prices change where it's cheap, and where it's a fixed price it's fuckin expensive to run.
15:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So you are most likely going to switch from database to database to find the best possible specs and optimal speed for whatever.
15:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih>

15:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Then understand this: Don't interrupt a conversation if you are not involved in it.
15:19 < bridge> <zhn> the same default asset shrinked by everyone lol
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @cellegenrih how much traffic do you generate per month?
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And how much does it cost?
15:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't have a database running.
15:20 < bridge> <zhn> was a problem someday ago for me too when i didn't really know about quad clipping

15:27 < bridge> <zhn> did you combine them btw?
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Around 300k$
15:27 < bridge> <zhn> anyway, anyway. would be lovely to make autorules as requirement
15:27 < bridge> <soulyvevo> combine?
15:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hell yeah, I'll pay ddnet servers with these! :poggers2:
15:27 < bridge> <zhn> what did you change to have so many variants then :troll:
15:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ok, how about making my ko-fi to the donation pool
15:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> different contrast variants, different outline thickness variants, only filling variants and only outline variants
15:28 < bridge> <soulyvevo> also variants where the inside is white and outline is darker
15:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can be done automatically
15:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> from 0.6 to 0.7
15:29 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh and also variants that use bevel edges and rouded edges
15:29 < bridge> <soulyvevo> with different intensity
15:29 < bridge> <zhn> you can probably do various thickness variants for it on the same sheet, also the only outline, with no inner color
15:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if those assets exist even
15:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> like one asset with all of those variations
15:30 < bridge> <soulyvevo> also have some other weird variants that use the same layout

15:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the shadow body should be discarded actually, it's not useful in terms of visual presence, other than giving the Tee's legs shadow
15:30 < bridge> <zhn> bro was about to drop soulyblmap
15:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so sharp and rounded edges on tile assets
15:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Anyways, I just mentioned that my work has a small price which can be fulfilled reasonably as how a FOSS business does it
15:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm done doing it for free (cuz of teedata)
15:35 < bridge> <soulyvevo> contrast variants could be done automatically but not sure how it would work with different outline widths etc

15:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i guess since i have outline only versions ppl could combine 2 layers to make something different
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> yeah. you can even do no thickness but just smaller radius for borders with same thickness on same sheet
15:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> -# amogus
15:37 < bridge> <zhn> so they combine layers making it thick
15:38 < bridge> <zhn> or something like tigers stripes
15:38 < bridge> <zhn> zebra tiling :kek:
15:57 < bridge> <Assa> today at work I accomplished, that the monitoring system sends signed emails ... we are livin' in the future here in germany :monkalaugh:
16:32 < bridge> <murpi> @learath2 I'm a little confused, why are `ban_region` and `ban_range_region` commands hardcoded into the server client when this functionality could be handled directly via the `execute-all.sh` script? Also, I just noticed we have an `execute-chn.sh` script as well, why not use that instead?
16:33 < bridge> <murpi> It feels a bit excessive to have global ban-related code spread across 3 different places
16:35 < bridge> <learath2> So a single bans file can be shared by all servers
16:35 < bridge> <murpi> Aaaaa, okey, yeah that makes sense
16:36 < bridge> <murpi> Kinda sucks having to clear bans every day
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> The entire thing kinda sucks, I just "madeitwork" before the mod mutiny
16:44 < bridge> <murpi> Was it considered a mutiny? I recall that applying bans across all servers was something all the mods, myself included, strongly wanted back then. It was a topic that kept coming up repeatedly. 😄
16:46 < bridge> <murpi> Looking at jao’s old global ban code, I don’t understand why it didn’t work consistently, or why it was more prone to failing compared to what we have now
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> It was very strongly wanted, but no one had the time to do it properly, so I cobbled together something that worked before one of you took my head
16:58 < bridge> <Assa> move fast, break things, fix later
17:00 < bridge> <Assa> wait a second, @jupeyy_keks you want to call it `grouped`, does this work for groups of quads with the same env and same offset?
17:00 < bridge> <Assa> if yes, time to optimize even more out of it 😮
17:03 < bridge> <louis> hm?
17:04 < bridge> <louis> i always wanted to have my own collection of mapres that i think are teeish and good
17:04 < bridge> <louis> but never got around to it
17:04 < bridge> <louis> i always wanted to maintain my own collection of mapres that i think are teeish and good that ppl have made
17:05 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> mod mutiny sounds like a event
17:05 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, exactly what we need
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it works, but better dont do it in this pr
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs this optimization is MUCH harder
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now you have to decide when to batch quads vs when not etc.
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> I can do the easy case, all in the same envs same offsets :justatest:
17:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> someone said banserver: https://github.com/jxsl13/banserver
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sure, I think it's rather rare, but I also didn't write a analyze script yet
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But everytime you have animated quads you probably also want them to behave differently (e.g. rain or snow or animated text)
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Differently = have different time offset
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> I think this can be extremely useful for water tbh
18:36 < bridge> <Assa> hmm _maybe_

18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its ripperoni
18:49 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> yeah its fixable, but you dont want to replace just the adapter, but the entire cable
18:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> actually USB 2.0 A plugs are like 5€ :kek:
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but idk how to replace the cable
18:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you rip out old cable and put in new ._:
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> sure xd
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> just bought a new mouse
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> a soldering station is required obviously - but other than that
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> consumerism epyc
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :angy:
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> send me your broken one, i repair for 2€ and send back
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have a soldering station
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :cat_cracked_hehe:
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i had a house with a garage
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats my old man dream
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> a soldering station of all things
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> retire in a farm house with lot of pc components
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :kekw:
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and some chicken
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> brother wants to wake up, crack open 10 eggs and solder the entire day
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i respec tit
18:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i respect it
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol not just soldering
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would have some riscv boards
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a farm gym
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u see those african gym bros
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> with stone weights xd

19:22 < bridge> <louis> get wireless mouse
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wireless mice's battery are empty very quick xd
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> super annoying
19:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no no, just the nutrition is rough
19:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even if you're taking funny performance enhancing substances you still need to eat a ton
19:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though the very first thing that got me going hmmge was the clothing, actually
19:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like, at least try to stick with the aesthetic bro
19:26 < bridge> <louis> my g pro lasts like a month
19:26 < bridge> <louis> is there a server side dummy issue?
19:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wireless anything is bad
19:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I hate chemical batteries they're so uncool
19:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though wireless devices with wireless power delivery can be cool
19:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like graphics tablets with their wirelessly powered styluses feel like magic the first time you use them
19:28 < bridge> <louis> wireless mouse is good wdym
19:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Atomic battery powered mouse :justatest:
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you not moving it for games
19:29 < bridge> <louis> idk i use it a lot
19:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also wireless data transfer is inherently less reliable than wired
19:29 < bridge> <louis> maybe my polling rate isnt maxed
19:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like wires; they feel trustworthy
19:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can always rely on wires wiring
19:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> twisted pairs 😩 yes please
19:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> coaxial 💦
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok, never seen a mouse that holds longer than like 6-7 days at once when using it a lot
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> according to their website 60h without LEDs on
19:39 < bridge> <louis> feels just as good if u have a good wireless
19:39 < bridge> <louis> there's no cable dragging or snagging either
19:39 < bridge> <louis> easier to bring places
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for headsets yes
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for rest doesn't matter xd
19:40 < bridge> <kebscs> For headset no
19:41 < bridge> <kebscs> You still at pc
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but wireless headsets have other problems. the last i head always had a BEEP sound the whole time
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> Pc issue
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah it's the internal sound card
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> they make those tiny heat shrink tubes with low melting point solder in the middle
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you’d probably just need wire strippers and a heat gun
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i bought a wireless 8k polling rate mouse, with a dongle that moves on the desk so you can put it by your mousepad and avoid basically all interference
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ll let you know if it’s got issues
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but wireless isn’t inherently unreliable under the right circumstances
19:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I know that in practice there are plenty of wireless things that are good and reliable
19:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I've just grown to dislike it
19:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's not unreliable but if that small distance was covered by a cable it'd be *even more* reliable
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if that’s even true
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it’s a direct connection but i’m pretty sure the radiowaves can travel just as fast with the right hardware
19:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least more resistant to interference
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely
19:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's the kind of reliable I mean, I don't mean how high performance it is
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i might get cancer from the mouse
19:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> actually radio travels faster through air than signals down a cable
19:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so over long distance people sometimes use radio to shave milliseconds of latency
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but there’s overhead in transceiving
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> so it depends on the case
19:58 < bridge> <soulyvevo> xd ppl are making translation prs for this
19:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah people do it for high speed trading across continents type of beat
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i’ve heard about that
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> have u heard about datacenter latency normalization
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> so ppl can’t rent out space close to a critical server in a VPS and get a latency advantage for trading
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> like physical on premises distance
20:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like adding artificial latency for *everyone*, or is it selective extra latency?
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> all the equipment is set up to have the exact same length of cable run
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> the former
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> well idk
20:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not extra for no reason but they all have the same
20:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the stock market is game for goofy goobers
20:01 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah and they make money sometimes
20:02 < bridge> <louis> a lot of times xd
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> every so often
20:10 < bridge> <teero777> why does freeing lots of memory freeze my whole system
20:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> context?
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> im freeing a ~10gb tree. it takes a some time and my system stutters completely xD
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> even music stutters like crazy
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> So I guess you're actually doing a lot of small frees?
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not cheap
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That'd be a lot of syscalls
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> yea
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you're bullying your kernel
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you must know heap memory is rly slow to use
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> yes
20:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you had that 10GB tree in a big arena allocation or something and deallocated all that in a single call to free then it'd be real quick
20:18 < bridge> <teero777> hmm yea ig there is some space to improve
20:18 < bridge> <teero777> well either im using heap or i stack overflow. which is better
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> hm?
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not to say you shouldn’t use it
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s to say you shouldn’t expect it to be fast
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 4head?
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> what? im talking about freeing the memory causing my system to stutter. i never said anything about speed
20:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> syscalls are expensive because they have a context switch
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> yea ik syscalls are expensive but i didn't expect everything come crashing down on me because im doing a few million of them
20:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there might be other reasons for it being slow but I don't know enough
20:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> audio crackle and such I think would point to the scheduler struggling to find time for the different applications involved in that playback
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> memory paging on modern CPUs involves like at least 3 layers of recursion
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> right, I said that, and then you contest with something unrelated, and then i respond to that, and then you contest to what was even being said
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> you are so silly
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we all are :owo:
20:28 < bridge> <teero777> i interpreted **using** heap allocated memory as accessing it. not general use. so your answer/comment seemed unrelated.
