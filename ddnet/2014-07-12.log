19:30 < goo> hi deen, long time!
19:30 <@deen> hi goo
19:36 < goo> howa re you doing?
19:40 <@deen> quite fine, and you?
19:40 <@deen> i saw the SA servers became more powerful recently
19:44 < goo> im good thanks too, yes, rob added more power
19:44 < goo> i have a few question about screen
19:44 <@deen> screen?
19:44 < goo> i dont want to mess up the current ddnet servers
19:45 < goo> if the server restarts the screen is automatically remade with the servers?
19:45 <@deen> I don't know what you mean by "screen"
19:45 < goo> btw, since the change from afrihost to webafrica, the location should be updated to Capte Tow
19:45 <@deen> but yes, after a restart everything should be starting automatically
19:45 < goo> Town
19:46 <@deen> aaah, thanks
19:46 < goo> Cape Town*
19:47 < goo> how do you maintain the servers when you close your session?
19:47 < goo> if i dont use screen, when i close putty, the state is lost
19:47 <@deen> they are started with nohup &
19:48 <@deen> and therefore are detached from my process
19:48 <@deen> so they don't die
19:48 < goo> ok
19:50 <@deen> afk
19:50 < goo> once i finished setting up the openfng and zcatch, can they be added to the list? or how does nohup work?
19:50 < goo> me too, il be back later
20:11 <@deen> back
20:12 <@deen> goo: yeah, i can make an autostart script for them
23:33 < goo> hi, finished making a good config for openfng, but its run gives an error, for now i will go sleep, will upload source tomorrow, its bad of me to ask you to do it, i should learn linux to do it myself
