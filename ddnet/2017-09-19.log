01:29 <@heinrich5991> poke
01:29 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> wonderful
01:36 <@heinrich5991> discord bridge is working again, report problems to me
01:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
02:09 <+eeeee> the previous bridge had colors while new one doesn't seem to
02:09 <+eeeee> not that i care, but in the spirit of teeworlds i feel obliged to complain about change
02:10 <@heinrich5991> in the spirit of teeworlds, I think even pointing you to a bug tracker would be too much support
02:10 <@heinrich5991> but anyway: https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/issues
02:11 <+eeeee> uh if i had to continue the spirit of teeworlds i'd now have to rage and threaten to ddos your bridge.. but enough of that i guess
02:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :V
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why ppl with veyr hight time, are last on scoreboard ?
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> cause people with no time have internal score of -9999
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> don't ask
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> join with a vanilla client and see
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know that -9999 value
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, time shouldn't be positive?
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :v
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, so -4 ranks better than -400
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hm
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tset people to incredible big numbers?!
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nvm
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what is the /pause [name]
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ?
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you can pause someone else? or your dummy?
15:28 <@deen> yes, try pausing everyone else
15:28 <@deen> and see what happens :D
15:47 <+Ryozuki> ahh i see
16:15 <@heinrich5991> that was legitemately my fear when I saw the commit
17:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Any way to stop the client crashing when you save a map with ~3,500 envelopes + 53,000 env points?
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how did you even create that map?
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> unity
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> unity?
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Unity3d
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> with my animation tool
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you have a converter?
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> how did you even export that to tw maps?
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> it runs fine in tw, and i can open it in the editor, it just won't re-save if i need to make edits
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which answers neither of our questions ðŸ˜„
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> run it in a debugger and see why it crashes
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> probably some hard-coded number of envpoints/envelopers
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> *envelopes
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he mad Unity editor
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> some time ago
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3801
18:07 <+Learath2> heh brilliant stuff
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> interesting. would have thought that Learath2 would complain about "bloated maps"
18:09 <+Learath2> i would if i wasn't in awe
18:10 <@deen> @Dr. Jekyll yeah, that's some crazy stuff
18:10 <@deen> you need to compile debug client, run it in gdb or some other debugger
18:10 <@deen> and then you can see where it crashes
18:10 <@deen> or send me the map
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> yeah looks like too many items
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> dbg_assert(m_NumItems < 1024, "too many items");
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe try tu optimize unity editor ðŸ˜„
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> not possible
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> i actually have 3500 different quads doing different things
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> o.O
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I wonder whether we have an actual reason for that limit
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> because sane people dont need more than 1024
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which is not an actual reason ðŸ˜›
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> because a fixed limit is easier than a non-fixed one in C
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> need to initialise the arrays with SOME size
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not if you have proper support for variable-sized stuff, like `std::vector` or `array`
19:05 <+Learath2> might give that a look when I have time
19:05 <+Learath2> don't we have growing arrays implemented in base/tl ?
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `array`
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> see above ðŸ˜ƒ
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> ok not init arrays, my error is from the mem alloc of m_pItems
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> which is an array, so nvm
19:56 <+Ryozuki> it's sad, i have a amd r9 390, on debian 9 i can't install the newest propietary drivers 'cause it doesn't support XServer 1.19 but only 6.9 to 1.10 (which i think it's old?) and my only way was using 'apt install firmware-linux' (non-propietary i think)
19:56 <+Ryozuki> it's horrible to play tw like this
19:56 <+Ryozuki> i wanted to forget entirely about windows D:
19:57 <+Ryozuki> (idk if it also affects, but i have a 144hz screen)
19:58 <+Ryozuki> (it's horrible to play tw like this, cause the screen flickers in full screen games, also on borderless)
20:00 <+Ryozuki> hmm wrong, tw only flickers fullscreen, borderless it doesn't, but it is limited at 60hz for some reason
20:26 <+eeeee> why do you XServer though, i thought wayland is now the de-facto standard in this year of linux desktop.
20:29 <+eeeee> Learath2: can you remind me why we prefer base/tl over stl?
20:30 <@heinrich5991> not sure. IMO we could probably throw it out
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> agreed
20:31 <@heinrich5991> vectors support foreach loops :) for(auto &x : vec) {}
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> but we do not have C++11 :c
20:31 <@heinrich5991> ah right, nvm
20:32 <+eeeee> nah let's do both at the same time
20:32 <+eeeee> delet base/tl and move to c++11 :)
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> but surely we could enable it and while at it there is also thread support then
20:32 <+eeeee> what do you mean by thread support?
20:33 <@heinrich5991> atomics I think
20:33 <@heinrich5991> we currently do it with volatile variables IIRC
20:34 <+eeeee> ah, ok. i thought you wanted to replace tasks with coroutines or something
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> c++11 provides standardized way to handle threads and all stuff belonging there (atomic, mutex, condition_variable), so need for all the hassle with different platforms
20:35 <+eeeee> not dealing with macos's iMutex sounds great too
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we can't use c++11 cause ger server?
20:36 <@heinrich5991> I think that was resolved some time ago
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> then what is stoping us?
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> yes, we can use c++11
20:36 <@heinrich5991> still, activating c++11 should be done with careful thought :)
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> actually ger runs debian 9
20:37 <+Ryozuki> i guess it's lot of work
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> c++11 is backward compatible ?
20:40 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:40 <@heinrich5991> (kinda)
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then it's not proble to use features from c++1
20:41 <@heinrich5991> but code using c++11 features isn't backwards compatible to c++98
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and stay with some thing, without hurry
20:41 <+Ryozuki> ^
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea i understand
20:41 <+Ryozuki> imho updating to c++11 is a positive thing
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just stay with c++11
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, without hurry
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to refactor code
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
21:00 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: well i wouldnt use debian for my desktop
21:00 <+Learath2> i prefer it to be a little more up to date then 20 years ago
21:01 <@heinrich5991> debian currently has 0.5 year old software
21:01 <@heinrich5991> :)
21:02 <+Learath2> still too old for my taste in an age where we get display driver updates every 10 seconds
21:02 <@heinrich5991> your distro of choice?
21:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath2 OS
21:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i bet
21:02 <+Learath2> gentoo if i have the time/arch if i don't
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> written on punch cards
21:03 <@heinrich5991> I think arch has newer software, generally :)
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;D
21:03 <+Learath2> i like gentoo where i can disable most of the garbage
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is there linux which osx or windows look?
21:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which has *
21:04 <@heinrich5991> linux is different, you'll have to adapt even if the UI looks the same
21:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know
21:04 <@heinrich5991> gnome has some nice-looking UI, KDE is probably the closest to windows
21:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i used linux, but just talking about UI
21:05 <+Learath2> compiling is much better with MuQSS and BFQ, doesn't bother me anymore
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://lifehacker.com/5665765/macbuntu-makes-your-linux-desktop-look-like-mac-os-x
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;D
21:05 <@heinrich5991> do you want the exact same GUI?
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Not like i want, just curious
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> now i have Linux + win
21:06 <@heinrich5991> do you talk about having the exact same GUI?
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yeah, such like. Or at least pretty similar
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I saw a WinXP theme for gnome or KDE a while back
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> kali linux has windows theme IIRC
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> windwsxp is like 17 years old
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> windows 7 is the only windows I use nowadays
21:12 <@heinrich5991> soon it will be win10 :)
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 8 was a disappointment and 10 is bloatware
21:12 <@heinrich5991> and yet one day, win10 will be the only thing remaining
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> In my opinion, win 10 works smoother and better than win 7
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nah i'll stick to windows7 until wine runs everything
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> talking as a long term user
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> wine will never run everything
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> windows is actively developed by more people than wine
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it'll some day run everything that I care about
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> windwos has team which developing windows-linux
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> not much remains on that list, which is why i barely boot windows anymore
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> soon eveything will be windows
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> windows needs some faster file system access to run linux programs
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander i'd bet more on windows finally ditching their ancient kernel
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> windows kernel is probably fine
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> at the moment
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> linux using ext, when windows nfs
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ntfs
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in the same time
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 cheaper to use a custom version of linux kernel then to maintain an ancient potato
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> linux also has btrfs, xfs and others, zfs via modules
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/mGi3EsbJ86407
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> windows kernel also desperately needs a better interface for fs, can't possibru add a new file system, even with drivers
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what gives you the idea that the windows kernel is outdated? ^^
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> there's a fork of fuse that allows you to do the same thing for windows
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> can't be that bad
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> big companies don't do rewrites unless they have to
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> speculations
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> linux kernel doesn't do rewrite either
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i bet they've been bolting stuff onto NT for the last billion years
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> linux kernel is worse in that respect AFAIK
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4auWwMsEnY
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if someone is interested
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but the linux code is being looked at by thousands of people, god knows what bugs NT hides
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in conferences
21:18 <+eeeee> on the positive side you can probably still run some windows 95 programs in windows 10
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> actually we've seen some of them in the recent NSA leak
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> windows is much bigger target as well
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> eeeee: kernel-wise linux is fine wrt. backward-compatibility
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well one plus is that the kernel debugger is so shit it'd take major effort to find a windows kern vuln ðŸ˜„
21:19 <+eeeee> yeah it's a benefit of the OS, not the kernel
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yup
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> although the 16bit stuff doesn't work anymore since win7
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and people noticed that ^^
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i really liked the way netbsd implements backwards compatible syscalls btw
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (me included)
21:20 <+eeeee> i think it still worked in 32bit win7, was only broken in 64
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea, maybe
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it still works in wine \o/
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> point is i'd rather have old code that is sitting out in daylight then old code rotting in microsofts dank cellar
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 where i can get Learath2 OS? :)
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well, i know ubuntu has more up to date drivers for my gpu, but i don't like ubuntu
21:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> have you s eeeee n: https://grsecurity.net/passing_the_baton.php ?
21:58 <+eeeee> can you translate that from PR-talk to english?
21:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> grsecurity is no longer open source
21:59 <+eeeee> okay that sucks i guess, but there's still SELinux?
21:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> isn't that orthogonal?
22:00 <+eeeee> dunno, i thought those are alternatives 
22:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> selinux user space confinement, grsecurity for kernel security
22:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> new Gamemode in teeworlds?
22:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "BW"?
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "blockwar"?
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh... it's block
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> without fast download by eeeee
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so sad ðŸ˜¦
22:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we need http download
22:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh
22:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> weird. Don't understand
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why he changed entities, and position of tilesets
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for the same things. like hookthrough
22:04 <+eeeee> people like to reinvent the wheel
22:05 <+eeeee> i was reading the "fng2
22:05 <+eeeee> " mod code recently, it has alternative implementation of >16 players
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how does it do it?
22:05 <+eeeee> pretty much the same way as far as i can tell. but the code is different. 
22:06 <+eeeee> also missing the heuristics our code grew over the years, so probably a less seamless user experience :P
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, it's not that bad, since he's trying to understand code
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> instead of just repeating
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then it's worthless to do it again
22:07 <+eeeee> would be better if he understood ddnet code and contributed something new to ddnet instead
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't be so selfish!
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how is that selfish? ðŸ˜ƒ
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just joking
22:08 <+eeeee> fstd's openfng is also perfectly fine and open, no idea why we need fng2
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it would be better to split ddnet into modules, like core
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and ddrace
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;d
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> core with all of these features which should be everywhere
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and security fixes etc
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we should call it "teeworlds"
22:09 <+eeeee> to really modularize things we should move gamecore to lua
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or some other language
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it would be the thing
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to split ddrace features
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> into module
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> let's make teemposer
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> teemposre require ddnet/ddrace
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I would like to see teeworlds in some kind of DDD
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> this one as well. restarting
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what the, why it's red ?
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what word is teemposer based off?
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why is my chat message red?
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> now it's not red anymore
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hm
22:14 <+Savander> discord down
22:14 <+Savander> at least our localization
22:15 <@heinrich5991> it works for me again
22:15 <+Savander> nvm :D
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> red = undelivered
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> teemposer?
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> composer
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> php package manager
22:15 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> packagist.org
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Or better, tpm
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or even dpmm
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hi from wayland
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> mfw he actually switched to wayland
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hi from windows 10
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i did
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and im back to normal
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it sucks
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it has a back where changing hz doesnt work
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> bug*
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and 60hz is a no for me, after so many hours with 144hz
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wayland is going to die just like Mir did unless it stops trying to be a usergrab from windows
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> which distro did you used with and which de?#
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> which distro did you used with and which de?
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also, the screen selection in wayland sucks
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i have screens
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and it picked the secondary for teeworlds
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and changing it to the other made the game minimize
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> why do you think that wayland is going to die?
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤·
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> It's an attempt to make "this" year the year of linux that's why
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i guess ill keep W$$ for teeworlds
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> It's an attempt to make "this" year the year of linux desktop that's why
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but xorg is still shitty and wayland is atleast an alternative
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I have a friend working as IT in a major airport, they use X to deploy flight stats screens to hundreds of screens, login terminals to couple of hundred screens
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xorg doesnt seem bad to me
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wayland doesn't even recognize networks yet
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> xorg is pretty shit internally, a mess of bolted on stuff
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> compare how long x is being developed to wayland
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i just want the propietary drivers to work on xorg 1.19
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and see if it doesnt flicker
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the problem in "modern" linux is we say there is a problem, these "modern" devs come along with their shiny designs fixing a completely different problem that noone complained about
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> see Mir, see Wayland, see SystemD, see upstart
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> systemd is bad?
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> then there is the old people who refuse to get a little perspective, see consolekit, see polkit
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki imho and in thousands of other peoples opinion but heinrich5991 would disagree
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> systemd is a blob that replaces all the different parts responsible in getting a linux system up with a small black box (open source sure but who is even going to read the billion lines they have)
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> f.e. they last absorbed udev, promised everyone that they'll keep releasing udev as standalone
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> guess where udev is now (hint: systemd-udevd)
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> </rant>
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that name is meh
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u can rant a lot here https://www.devrant.io/
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> don't think that would be enough
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :)
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> every time i see systemd-sth i really feel a strong urge to put my fist through my screen
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> poor screen
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the screen is far too expensive to put fist thru, so i end up not doing it
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> my prediction is that wayland is not going to die
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if someone wants to bet against it, be my guest ðŸ˜ƒ
22:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if only i had money
22:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats what lot of ppl say
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats what lot of ppl say (learath)
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> `if somebody would say that my Rust skills are 'rusty', would that be a good thing or bad?
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ` goodo ne
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> `if somebody would say that my Rust skills are 'rusty', would that be a good thing or bad?
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ` good one
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜ƒ
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `` isn't for quotes!
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> >does this work?
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> does it?
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> ``` what would you use for quotes then ```
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not code blocks
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://img.devrant.io/devrant/rant/r_849783_MKw7F.jpg
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if they gave me a magic wand that could send me back in time only once, i'd go back and make sure â€ŽLennart Poetteringâ€Ž becomes a poet or sth
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "jurassic fork" is the best of the image
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "Anyone remember when one could login into most linux systems by hitting backspace 28 times?" i didn't know this
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what are you reading? ^^
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can we have a channel where i can rant about systemd all year long?
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> try #devuan or something
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki grub bug, really interesting
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 devrant.io xD
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i read it when im bored, e.g now)
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> read the write up on the bug, quite intriguing
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> backspace doesn't check for buffer overflow (underflow?) and then it's all like "bring your own code"
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ok this is the last
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://img.devrant.io/devrant/rant/r_850216_GFre1.jpg
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> now i go, cya! :P
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> going to bed?
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yep
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> good night
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> gn
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> too early ðŸ˜› gn8
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i have to wake up early, etc)
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> school started?
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i ensure to not sleep on friday and saturday np
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes sadly
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i generally slept at 3am and spent the first lesson sleeping in hs ðŸ˜›
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> good job :D
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> genius
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> should give it a try, first lessons are boring enough anyways
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> in subjects you don't like, you can usually still learn something ðŸ˜ƒ
23:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> definately do not apply the same logic to uni, doesn't work, tested
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> btw
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> About teeworlds now
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't you think, that bind's should be send once?
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, if you holding key
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the bind should be send once, instead of infinite
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ? D:
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't understand, can you elaborate?
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> binds aren't usually sent to the server I think
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like, kill
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> say
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> etc
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you hold key wiuth say "hay"
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it will send it all the time, even if server has
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> prtoection
23:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in my opinion, it should send once per button down
23:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh. to make spamming harder?
23:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
23:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not needed in teeworlds i guess, but hmm
23:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe autojump
23:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's not repeatedly sent
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for example
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if i press "z" what is kill
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on ddnet, after 20minutes
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i got big spam
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that i should use kill command
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, that repeatedly sent
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> say commands are as well
23:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yep
23:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it is intentional ?
23:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure
