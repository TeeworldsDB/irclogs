01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Did this get reverted?
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, why?
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ah nevermind
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also is the icons.otf file the most recent version of Font Awesome?

07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm just thinking out loud here: Do you think the demo button icons need a touch-up, or are they fine? I'm saying this because I'm in the process of merging both demo button images, and now's the chance to say anything.
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Personally, I think the key caps in the shortcut key are a bit small, but that's just me.
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009333487926530059/unknown.png
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ironically, this increases the file size of the buttons. It used to be 1.64 KB with two images, but merging them together makes it now 1.86 KB
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Bcs we ran zopfli over them. Now with libpng we can make all files much smaller even
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I think we shouldbreplace them with icon font tho. Then the icons are consistent
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean, I ran it through an online optimizer, and brought it down to 860 kb, so that's better!
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> No but u can always upgrade if u need to
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, but the icon set doesn't have everything we need.
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Whats missing
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> These
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009335596755464284/unknown.png
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> The last can simply be done by ovetlay 2 icons
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That's true. But there's no way we *don't* drastically change the look of the slice icons with the icons we have
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Closest we have are these two
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009336195744014367/unknown.png
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Left to line
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Or just bracket square
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Right from line
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Those aren't in the free pack, I don't think
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm. Maybe we could ship an extra font for custom icons?
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean maybe, but then we'd have a ton more icons that won't be touched.
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe u can combine two icons somehow
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean that's going to be a definite for the shortcuts key
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also theres no square brackets in the free pack lololololol
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009339002853273651/unknown.png
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imo (and this is sort of unrelated feedback) but i didnt really know what the middle ones did and they're also pretty low contrast)
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imo (and this is sort of unrelated feedback) but i didnt really know what the middle ones did and they're also pretty low contrast
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they crop the demo
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> very useful thing
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and actually recognizable if you trying to do everything with poke method xd
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> notice how she said **didnt**
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i see
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also good progress! i can now put a   uh
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> square where it needs to be
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009346184772587580/unknown.png
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> (Normal text works just fine! Now the hard part is.. finding the UTF-8 versions of each emote.)
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009346576193441802/unknown.png
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> btw what do you want to do?
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just uhm, put icons into separated font?
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm optomizing the program by now removing the need of two images
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm optimizing the program by now removing the need of two images
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> by adding need of new font? :D
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> It isn't new though
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> It's used here
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009347847126257684/unknown.png
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> will be glad to see new icons tbh
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye i know that now but i mean at first, didnt know what it did from the icon
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it would be interesting to see self-explanatory icons of cropping actually
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no clue how this should be done
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Only one way to find out: look through the font and find a good candidate.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ignore all the brand icons, those aren't included.
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> scissors + stripped line would be good xd
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> font awesome sux if u don't know how to get it without having to be forced to create an account
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i literally just downloaded the newest version LMFAO
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> no account
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways now the question is: How do I actually **get** the symbols?
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Example: `\xEF\x95\xBD` is U+f57d on font awesome
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ye I mean if u don't look properly they're like "create an acc", while some others will look at github
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways now the question is: How do I actually **get** the symbols?
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Example: `\xEF\x95\xBD` is U+f57d on font awesome (earth-americas)
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah that's true
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol what's the font they're using
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's cool
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the unicode for the stop symbol is `U+23f9`, but when i put it in as `\x23\xF9` in c++, for some reason it only detects the first `x23` part and renders a **#**
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does cpp handle unicode by default?
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I have no idea, I'm just trying to go with what I'm given with, which is copying the attributes from another file.
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> U need to convert to utf8
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is normal
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is there a good program online for me to do that?
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I used some online utf8 converter tool xd
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> First or second google entry
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```c
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> #include <stdio.h>
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> int main(void)
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> {
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>         char symbol[] = { 0xe2, 0x8f, 0xb9, 0x00 };
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>         printf("%s\n", symbol);
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> }
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Voxel
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I found it!
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Well, something that works accurately
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Voxel and this works too for cpp
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> #include <iostream>
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> int main(void)
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> {
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>         unsigned char symbol[] = { 0xe2, 0x8f, 0xb9, 0x00 };
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>         std::cout << symbol << std::endl;
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> }
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just annoying, but ig people uses libs like libutf8
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Great progress so far!

09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Finally replaced all the symbols! I had to do some compromises for some of the symbols, and I have yet to add in an overlay for these, but I think this is a solid PoC
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009367523176759319/unknown.png

09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Wait, should I still keep in the demo_buttons image for the datasrc/seven folder, or is that not something to worry about?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @deen Do you have anything to say about this? I removed the need for both the `demo_buttons` and `demo_buttons2` png images, and took advantage of the Icons.otf file to replace them.
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> If u done it already just pr it ^^
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> One second
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looks nice to me
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Writing the PR form right now
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i forgot to remove some of the comments. i'll take care of that tommorow if the PR needs to be edited

10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Done!
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> When "Run server" button is pressed in the main screen, what is ran?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I have ddnet packaged in Arch, have server binary installed in `/usr/bin/DDNet_Server` but I receive "Server executable not found, can't run server". I don't know how to debug this.

16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, that should be run
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I fixed it recently and it's not yet released
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can try if it works with version from git
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Ok, from git does work. Thanks.
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Having a firewall that don't open the port for the ddnet server and running a server provides no in-game feedback to the user that the server is running but the port is blocked. Result is no LAN server available.
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Maybe add feedback to the user somehow?

18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Maybe add feedback to the user somehow?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's an issue as it can be pretty much different per operating systems
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> on windows it should just ask you to accept it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Right. Not saying it is trivial. 😆
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Great progress on the touched up demo player. However there are just two problems:
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009580488110907483/unknown.png
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> One of which is that, despite me setting the outline color of this to transparent, it's still visible. I think this will be an easy fix
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> On the other note, the Close button doesn't accept unicode text for some reason. It always appears with a box.
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1009580876415385791/unknown.png
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's literally like 10 times better and it matches the font style
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Here's how the FontIcons are rendered currently
