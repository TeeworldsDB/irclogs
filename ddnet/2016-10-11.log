20:56 < Dominik> Hello, someone here???
20:58 <+Dominik> I need help at compiling teeworlds and some shit
20:58 <+Ryozuki> what u need to know?
20:58 <+Ryozuki> if compiling on windows, u need visual studio 2015 community
20:58 <+Ryozuki> then bam
20:58 <+Ryozuki> compile it with the vs 2015 console
20:59 <+Ryozuki> and then i recommend adding bam to PATH
20:59 <+Ryozuki> so you can do on your teeworlds folder
20:59 <+Ryozuki> 'bam release'
20:59 <+Dominik> i have the visual c++ 2015
20:59 <+Ryozuki> search for Developer Command prompt
20:59 <+Ryozuki> 2015 blabla
20:59 <+Ryozuki> on windows
20:59 <+Ryozuki> and go to the bam directory
21:01 <+Dominik> what do i need python for?
21:01 <+Dominik> and what teeworlds version can i download?? the 6.3? 
21:02 <+Dominik> and i need bam 0.4.0???
21:03 <+Dominik> you could do a tutorial on you youtube account! the last i found was 7 month old from fallenKN
21:04 <+Ryozuki> oh

21:04 <+Dominik> =D
21:04 <+Dominik> so, why do i need python???
21:05 <+Ryozuki> for some scripts that are used when compiling
21:05 <+Ryozuki> like compile.py xD
21:05 <+Dominik> ._.
21:05 <+Ryozuki> https://www.python.org/downloads/
