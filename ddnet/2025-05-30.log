00:13 < bridge> <Assa> that envelope improvement you did is just an insane fps improvement for me
00:23 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> can we please make damage indicators aligned?:brownbear:

00:23 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> with edited i mean that i photoshopped it
00:25 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> once i saw this i couldnt unsee it
00:25 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> pls pls
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> loop probably ends early LOL
00:58 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> it should create 10
00:58 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377783071692161076/image.png?ex=683a37fa&is=6838e67a&hm=385ae6b8395c60a7cf3e460b2d919c16ee9d464d60bd445af3e2981739aa2417&
01:08 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks when I am integrating your new PR [this](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/f7bd7330391085ac7ac29788b569c23da45ace76) into the rendering pipeline all animations get stuck like if they get stopped. I tried to debug it and I don't get why, it works on master :/
01:13 < bridge> <Assa> I think I already found it
01:13 < bridge> <Assa> what the hell
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> `const auto TickToNanoSeconds = std::chrono::nanoseconds(1s) / (int64_t)pClient->GameTickSpeed();`
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> vs
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> `const auto TickToNanoSeconds = std::chrono::nanoseconds(1) / (int64_t)pClient->GameTickSpeed();`
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> 
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> fuck that C++ magic in particular
01:16 < bridge> <kebscs> Does 1st one even compile?
01:16 < bridge> <kebscs> 1 second nanosecond
01:22 < bridge> <Assa> yes it compiles, the first one **is the correct version**
01:22 < bridge> <Assa> the `""s` is an operator overloading for nanoseconds
01:22 < bridge> <Ewan> implementation defined
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> they just evaluate to numbers
01:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wtf
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> what
01:28 < bridge> <Assa> btw, I get with the render pipeline PR and the improvement from @jupeyy_keks now 1000 FPS instead of the usual 480 in that part that I consider FPS heavy. Just 🚀
01:28 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377790701512822954/screenshot_2025-05-30_01-13-55.png?ex=683a3f15&is=6838ed95&hm=464cdea7509bf97389a3fdc666e1af83bf5c02c877bb93e4d0d4f03c2a5f73cd&
01:32 < bridge> <kebscs> What render pipeline pr?
01:33 < bridge> <Assa> the big one :pepeW:  #10153
01:33 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10153
01:36 < bridge> <kebscs> Will check
01:37 < bridge> <Assa> if you give me a good review, I'll send you a virtual cookie :§
01:38 < bridge> <kebscs> 🙂
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> Looks nice, will test tomorrow
01:47 < bridge> <chairn> wait what ? in the code excerpt you posted, there's no quote, so just `(1s)` is a c++ valid format for numeric types ?
01:51 < bridge> <kebscs> using namespace std::chrono_literals;
02:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks @bloodslain ! ^
09:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea what Ewan said. I don’t like discord tos. For example the rule about no custom clients. Or no automation for user accounts. Also they locked my account for no reason. I don’t like that it is closed source. Overall discord gives me bad vibes and it’s something I do not want to support and depend on for my communication.
09:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also I wonder why discord is not end to end encrypted yet. I am sure lots of users write confidential stuff on discord. And all the messages are stored in plaintext on the discord servers. Available to all discord employees with enough access.
09:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Same applies to irc but the users are usually more technical there. If they need a secure channel they find one and they understand the risk of their current message exposure.
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You don't have to use it, but you could open it for your issue then close it again
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet github tos aren't the yellow from the egg either
11:24 < bridge> <totar> discord voice chats and screen sharing are e2e encrypted already (probably because they don't want to moderate illegal cable sports rebroadcasting servers). 
11:24 < bridge> <totar> 
11:24 < bridge> <totar> But e2e encryption of messages would result in worse or restricted user experience in a lot of ways since you'd need to sync keys between devices, and stuff like forwarding messages from a DM to a server would be impossible. I'm pretty sure the users prefer it this way.
11:25 < bridge> <totar> also they index your chat discord in DMs for searching, which you could do locally but probably not as good UX
11:25 < bridge> <totar> also they index your chat in DMs for searching, which you could do locally but probably not as good UX
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also my DMs are a really good read, maybe you should start working for discord chiller
11:28 < bridge> <totar> I guess it would be nice to have an e2ee option with limited features, but they probably don't wanna spend time on that
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whatsapp is "e2e" although i only take their word for it
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> forwarding doesnt require it not being e2e
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can just forward the text
11:36 < bridge> <totar> true
11:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe you might want message signing
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true e2e requires an independent verify anyway. similar to what matrix does.
11:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can e2e not be zero knowledge?
11:38 < bridge> <totar> that's not the same thing
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well idk what u mean by independent verify
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> on whatsapp u can compare some numbers and if theyre the same its working
11:38 < bridge> <totar> I think he means a third party checks the source code
11:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah i see
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. whatsapp can _fake_ the other persons identity
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and send a wrong key
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (for both parties actually)
11:38 < bridge> <totar> oh I'm wrong
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And still read everything unencrypted
11:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see
11:40 < bridge> <totar> how does matrix prevent this?
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can verify the other person with a verify process that _usually_ requires you to meat
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can verify the other person with a verify process that _usually_ requires you to meet
11:41 < bridge> <totar> well
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep xD
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But let's say it like this, if you verify it over a different chat, then it's unlikely this is intercepted
11:41 < bridge> <totar> yeah
11:41 < bridge> <totar> or those third party key exchange services
11:41 < bridge> <totar> forgot the name
11:43 < bridge> <totar> this thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs when move team code out of the character into the player or even better into the projectiles it self #9446 depending on a alive tee to determine the ddrace team of a flying projectile is a design flaw
11:46 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9446
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ yea github isnt too nice either. But i did not clash with their tos too strong yet. My account automation was only blocked once when i went nuts and then they even manually approved it once i sent them a letter.
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> discord on the other hand forced me to add a phone number to get access to my account again
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also it feels less bad to be dependent on github i have most of my important stuff backed up else where anyways. If github gets too bad I could move. Moving away from a chat platform is harder.
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github has good customer relations and discord has basically none. They refuse to elaborate why the block accounts. But to be fair there was also the swarfey incident that was scary.
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If there was a github alternative that is as good as irc i would use it. I use gitlab for a few projects but their ui is sadly too ugly.
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gitea
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lez go, lez code smth together :deen_star:
11:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Accounts :santatrollet:
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u mean self host?
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for example
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also do selfhost but then without web front end
11:55 < bridge> <fushi_gg> I had this happen to myself too but I did write them a mail saying I don't have a phone or something and they actually unblocked my acc
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they also have a non self host variant
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its just i trust microsoft more with my data than i do my self
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont want to be responsible for backups and uptime
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea github has a network effect and i do somehow not feel bad depending on it
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still feel free on github, while i do not feel free on discord or fakin gmail
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but idk how to escape gmail xd
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> same xD
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also dont wanna pay for email and/or selfhost
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye pay sucks, selfhost sucks
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so far gmail was really good. I tried proton once and they totally fucked me. Deleted all my accounts and gave me no option to restore them. I had it as a the primary mail for other accounts it was a huge cluster fuck
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fushi_gg wtf no way
12:03 < bridge> <fushi_gg> I still have the mail. they did ask no questions whatsoever, but that was in 2017. idk if they still do that
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think mine was around 2020 i probably tried something similar
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eventually i gave up and handed them heinrichs phone number
12:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean i have a backup of everything i care about on github
12:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> downloaded onto my compooper
12:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and most stuff is public anyway
12:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if my private stuff gets leaked its not too bad, i just have to get some new certificates and passwords
12:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why do you feel stuck on gmail?
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can entrust me your bank details
12:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
12:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ive slowly been transfering away from my gmail address by using ****@sollybunny.xyz
12:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having a domain is pog
12:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and while i still have gmail i can just have it direct to my gmail
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow, how expensive is a xyz domain? xd
12:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its... the cheapeast
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> super cheap ackthually
12:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can get it even cheaper if your domain is a combination of 9 numbers
12:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can get it even cheaper if your domain is a combination of 9 numbers .com
12:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah sure just sent it to my email!:

12:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> solly@123456789solly.xyz

12:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well most emails are not public facing now
12:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so a random string of numbers is okay
12:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i got mine for 30 quid (gbp)
12:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for 9 years
12:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and then it was more expensive to renew by a large amount i dont remember how much
12:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dickhead company
12:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> all tld companies are dicks
12:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 👀
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.99$ is good
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i pay 12 cents(€) per month for .de
12:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wow
12:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but you get a name
12:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> right not some numbers
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why so expensive?
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see them for 0.99$ per yeaR
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see them for 0.99$ per year
12:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats only for the first year
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok

12:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ absolute scam
12:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for ~~9~~ 4 years
12:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the xyz company gets all of that price increase
12:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they determine the prices
12:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pretty much
12:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and for doing nothing its horrid
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but it's too expensive IMO.
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> .de domains are cheaper for me xd
12:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i never looked at country tlds
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xyz is not cool enough to consider it
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a `.star` would be cool
12:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> all the joke tlds get blocked alot
12:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same with .xyz
12:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having .co.uk on my domain feels... yucky
12:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377955887649394830/image.png?ex=683ad8ec&is=6839876c&hm=f99950cd9fb266be55ce732c0e671a9d825e8cd9e633963f91d005a0c4fe3b8d&
12:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hmm
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that per year?
12:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
12:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> better than .xyz
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i like porkbun they are an unevil company
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> free transfers, simple to use, fast website
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://www.spaceship.com/
12:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> compared to this
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ive done alot with my xyz domain so its a bit late to switch
12:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and again i dont like the sound of (.co).uk
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377957127116689459/image.png?ex=683ada14&is=68398894&hm=b5231fe08dfe2de31492a3d05e3961b0d0e419ddee91c256b2da173a99ba399f&
12:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought ICANN was... jusst like "ah... we've already sold the tlds... too bad"
12:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this seems like active... trying to make money for them i dont get it
12:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .org should be free for actually organizations
12:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .org should be free for actually non profit organizations
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> domains should simply only be the price of operating cost xd
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't see why ppl need to get rich for owning a tld
12:40 < bridge> <Ametic'> My ISP is blocking .xyz automatically cause of scams
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your private internet?
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Time to switch DNS server ig xdd
12:41 < bridge> <Ametic'> Nah, not local, a big big company in Poland
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean the internet in your own home
12:41 < bridge> <Ametic'> Ah, yeah
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd not rely on their DNS anyway. They can send you to wrong sites without https and stuff xd
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Some browsers have settings like this
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377960417346977812/image.png?ex=683add24&is=68398ba4&hm=dc38f0f5e7eb56dc6913664b86d0c7fcb8e309b0f9e2bb9f27e5c8494662ab55&
13:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> your operating system also has that and i would recommend using it
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if your dns traffic is public/unencrypted/anyway sniffable, they can see what domains you goto
13:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> many domains go the unidentifiable ips (hosting services) so they only get who is hosting the content, not the domain itself
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> atleast in the uk i would recommend it, anything that is public is kept on record and is used
13:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> quite scary
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i'd actually already change it in the router 😄
13:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well dont use router dns anyway
13:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess you should change ur router for security of randos
13:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but you should ur own device when you're a rando on someone elses
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the cool thing about the browser setting is that it even works on computers u don't have permissions on
13:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmm
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if i dont have permissions i normally cant change browser settings either
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least in ff it always worked for me
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its weird my school lets you run any executables, but no pwsh, and no browser settings xd
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ms edge didnt allow anything
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have a folder of utilities i bring including my own browser
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ungoogled chromium
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then use a portable firefox 😉
13:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> firefox *used* to be pretty annoying for me
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
13:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> was quite laggy on my machine
13:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to start and use
13:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> now its fine as far as i can tell
13:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but im hearing stuff about firefox adding opt out tracking which makes me uncomfortable
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ungoogled chromium is a privacy focused browser, so much so to lack basic features
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ungoogled chromium is a privacy focused browser, so much so to lack features
13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it removed google translate pages and has no option to reenable
13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it has no default search engine (which is just silly, set it to ddg or something, people will change it if they care)
13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it breaks youtube and discord by turning of settings which is undocumented
13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> last one i could fix
13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (show which settings are changed instead of changing defaults, would reduce the hunt)
13:33 < bridge> <fushi_gg> iirc google was punished for buying itself up in some places, and that is why ff is struggling since one of their biggest incomes is actually google, but that is why stuff like librewolf exits
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when will they remove the "adaptive padding" thing by default
13:36 < bridge> <fushi_gg> I'm not quite sure what you are referring to
13:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377974173984493619/image.png?ex=683ae9f4&is=68399874&hm=a5d12850761cbd4f16ebbdca4cfa460df2db695e04f0f81991cf7436ed97c4e9&
13:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a bit big... and the html isnt simple to edit with custom style
13:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a bit , big... you can remove this, and reorder everything which is cool
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can just drag it away
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377974362367463474/image.png?ex=683aea21&is=683998a1&hm=9ce4786b73dbaa25d739b472d64ea8c1d2e79f5f83bd01f9ea81af5012eed670&
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you want to theme firefox using a custom style its really annoying since the html is very complicated (lots of containers)
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah you annoyed by default k xd
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
13:38 < bridge> <fushi_gg> that's fair I don't really use themes
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just... different for no reason
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the color themes... are cool i guess
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i meant like changing the padding
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> n stuff
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres way more elements than you would think
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Never really noticed it, but now that you mentioned it, i also have to remove it xDD
13:39 < bridge> <fushi_gg> it never really bothered me
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> given its just 2 flexboxes
13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> given its just 2 flexboxes (or should be, i forgot how it was implemented)
13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it bothered my mum, and she didnt believe me that you could easily remove it
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its weird that firefox has that as customization, default is fine, just make the burger bar... sorted better
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also different default binds than chromium
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its annoying when they do that... idk if firefox has the legacy on the keybind to justify it
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but they should be the same, its the same functionality
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> woaw this is cool
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377975498159685753/image.png?ex=683aeb30&is=683999b0&hm=14a01e877203a4806f17c63923c0c42a8191ba7ae8c6bc743d56728bcccfdab7&
13:42 < bridge> <fushi_gg> I've been on ff since 3.6 so no idea about the shortcut differences
13:43 < bridge> <fushi_gg> but it's also customizable
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk where i would find that
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be nice to have a macro system like ddnet
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be nice to have a macro system like teeworlds
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be nice to have a easily editable list of keybinds
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i feel like gui is often more work and harder for me to edit than just a textbox
13:47 < bridge> <fushi_gg> can't via gui need extension if you want gui for that unfortunately
13:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmk
13:52 < bridge> <fushi_gg> if you want more hip browser with customization you could try zen browser I guess
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I cant remember was sending asserts to ddnet.org discussed already? i think yes
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, what assert u have?
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can post it here
14:02 < bridge> <soulyvevo> is it okay for those servers to be named this way?
14:02 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i feel like people might mistake them with official servers
14:02 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377980427008213062/screenshot_2025-05-30_13-59-27.png?ex=683aefc7&is=68399e47&hm=bc72026ddf2282834c2a35dacd4c811e5accf4d76840e76a75bb222eed5fb6a4&
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No it's forbidden
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then why the fuck havent they been mastersrv banned yet
14:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait i thought that multieasy map turkey was one of them
14:18 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @heinrich5991
14:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ its not for me. I complain loud and every time. Its for the users that do not post their asserts. There are so many players I am sure getting all the asserts automatically could improve stability of the client drastically.
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you could contribute to t-client for that
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think tater is open for it
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and ddnet not?
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am open for it, but you know
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i know
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also seems tricky technically
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if we are in a bad state do we really want to do something so messy like a curl http request?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd not run it from the client directly tbh
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> launcher mentioned?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that is a impl detail, could also write the issue to disk and send it some other time
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> launcher best
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was about to say that
14:28 < bridge> <kebscs> done 🙂
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> write to disk and then send on next successful boot in the background
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ we do already dump a lot of stuff to disk on windows by default right?
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never looked into that
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dump a stack trace and if assert, then also the assert log
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats epic
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (which contains the last i dunno how much console log)
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just add some giga annoying popup on boot: You have 44 crashdumps do you want to send them to ddnet.org? Yes/No
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and sp someone will send 666k reports of roblox crashes
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds great
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you play roblox?
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i heard it's the youtube for game devs xD
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like that metaphore
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think lerato had some privacy concerns but im sure we can easily ensure nothing senstive is ever sent and still get useful crash reports
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i dont play it but i know the metaphore. Its for sure a big thing.
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i look at current youtube that would mean, 99.999999% trash content
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i recently noticed that the twitch viewer count for roblox is pretty embarrasing https://www.twitch.tv/directory
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 3k viewers right now????
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even star citizen has 5k
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but minecraft also only has 13k
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea maybe twitch is irrelevant platform
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and roblox streamers go live on tiktok
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea the fact that it is such a flexible engine is epic
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's funny how a whole generation of social media just passes by for me
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are plenty of full time roblox game devs
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i really not been on tiktok more than 5 times i think
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> old man
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno, it's probably more like minigames?
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or similar to minecraft mods?
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> haven't heard of a tripple A roblox game yet XD
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is 5yo kids tripple A game audience even?
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not deep but as far as i know you can do way more than in mc without users requiring a custom client
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also its lua so thats nice!
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 💀
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1-based indexled language you mean?
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lua does a litle bit of troling
14:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> as god intended.
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its nice
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and roblox empire is also contributing to the ecosystem
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like this epic typescript to lua converter https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or react in lua https://github.com/Roblox/roact
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like you fully in the game nice
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well i am lua enjoyer
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last time i wrote hello world in lua i found roblox stuff non stop
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you know the love lua engine?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye i tried it once when i was 12 yo
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt get shit done
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the logo is epic its still pinned in my macos main task bar
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the executable does not run on modern macos anymore but it still looks good
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chichilku/chichilku4 6 years ago xd
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sick
15:05 < bridge> <chairn> TIL https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/user_literal.html
15:09 < bridge> <gorp_tw> context-free I would have assumed short
15:57 < bridge> <chairn> dijkstra finally beaten ?

17:20 < bridge> <teero777> Without a heuristic?(I didn't read it)
17:41 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 I think <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10282> wont merge because builds failed
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> CI should be fixed again, rebase on master
17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> done
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Does anyone else have issue #10203 when building with latest MSYS2?
17:50 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10203
17:55 < bridge> <0xdeen> @heroiamarelo Thanks for the donation! ^
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> merge <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10264>
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> tested and works fine
18:25 < bridge> <kebscs> can merge <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10264>
19:25 < bridge> <kebscs> @essigautomat any reason why STileVisual, SQuadVisual are struct and not class when you give them constructors and public/private anyway?
19:25 < bridge> <kebscs> @essigautomat any reason why STileVisual, STileLayerVisuals, SQuadVisual, SQuadLayerVisuals are struct and not class when you give them constructors and public/private anyway?
19:34 < bridge> <Assa> I didn't write this code, I just moved it. This is for Vulkan buffer objects , maybe @jupeyy_keks knows more
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe just leftover
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> can change to classes, since thats prefered in new code
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it contains virtual or non-pod member vars, make it a class
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wrote that code like 8 years ago xD
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as if i remember why i set S or C before the name
19:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why i wrote it liek this
19:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. fuck knows
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont even know if we have a guideline. I usually use structs for PODs
19:42 < bridge> <Assa> me too, but I don't care tbh
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> its in the guideline
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> "The usage of class should be favored over struct"
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> and 
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> "S    Structs (Use classes instead)"
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have a guideline? xdd
19:43 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon explain yourself 😬
20:11 < bridge> <Assa> I hate the part about integer boolean contexts 🥲
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> waat
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No it makes sense xd
20:12 < bridge> <Assa> Next: Getters forbidden, what about setters?
20:13 < bridge> <Assa> idk for me it feels like others are skillchecked xD
20:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I'd prefer clangd supports all these guideline stuff
20:14 < bridge> <Assa> Next: Getters 'forbidden', what about setters?
20:15 < bridge> <Assa> Why is it bad to mark Getters with Get?
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess it depends on context. but you probably don't want to write `GetClient` instead of `Client` in components
20:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> heroiamerelo donating in 2025 lol
20:40 < bridge> <Assa> why is this bad?
20:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think rossbit came up with the no structs rule. I am just the one who pushes writing it down to make reviews faster and smoother
20:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: more letters is always worse. This is why we all hate Java
20:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Harder to type without and even with auto complete. And harder to read.
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> naming conventions are impossible anyway xd
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes i'm in the `int i` mood, sometimes in `int this_variable_solves_all_world_issues_let_me_explain_why_in_the_var_name`
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's nice if reading the code automatically explains it.
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sometimes it's maybe still better to just leave a comment and not overcomplicate the code
20:48 < bridge> <Assa> but using "1s" with some magic string literals is fine :pepeW:
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's an official cpp suffix
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also it's inside a constructor of nanoseconds
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think that is intuitive enough
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> this is the way
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> ddnet-rs, given its size is super easy to navigate because you name things with what they are :pepega:
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you think so?
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often think it already requires some refactoring xD
20:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fangirl melon
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> but thats like - every code ever written no?
20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not BSD code it’s Perfect
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's perfect code
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> who let chiller in here again
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kekw:
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it doesn't run correctly
20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxaxa
21:38 < bridge> <teero777> @qxdfoxy skill issue i think xD
21:39 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> agree
21:39 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> wheres my purple name
21:39 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i want now
21:39 < bridge> <teero777> very philosophical title
21:39 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i got a total of 3 commits which are all one line changes i deserve atleast admin
21:50 < bridge> <Assa> This user has a modding issue according to chatgpt
21:56 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> fixable in 3 months of trying random shit
22:38 < bridge> <astramast> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3453#issuecomment-2812838899 what do you think
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> 128p support 🙏
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> client already supports 128p no?
23:18 < bridge> <vahemaaa> that would be great
23:20 < bridge> <vahemaaa> and ye current code isnt really made to hold extra connections
23:21 < bridge> <vahemaaa> thus; 128 player supported servers would be best option ig
23:21 < bridge> <vahemaaa> and fokko did it somehow
23:24 < bridge> <vahemaaa> aand 128 players on Multeasymap (e.g) would cause chaos
23:24 < bridge> <kebscs> i would say server 128p support is ready too
23:24 < bridge> <kebscs> just some nitpick comments in it <>
23:24 < bridge> <kebscs> just some nitpick comments in it <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9274>
23:55 < bridge> <astramast> i think that augmenting the number of players would be that good.
23:55 < bridge> <astramast> with 128p the server is still full + the maps were not created to hold 256+p
23:57 < bridge> <astramast> i think that augmenting the number of players would not be that good.
23:57 < bridge> <astramast> with 128p the server is still full + the maps were not created to hold 256+p
23:58 < bridge> <astramast> i prefer the idea of splitting too full server in smaller ones by redirecting incoming connections to a non-empty server
