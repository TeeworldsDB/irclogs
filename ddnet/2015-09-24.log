16:42 < Chairn> hello
16:42 <@EastByte> hi
16:42 < Chairn> deen: all ger2 servers are pw protected
16:42 <@EastByte> I guess he wants to shut them down
16:43 < Chairn> already?
16:49 <@deen> restart
16:49 <@deen> i told the hoster what qemu commands to use to make the CPU faster^^
16:49 <@deen> want to test it
16:49 <@EastByte> ^.^
16:51 <@EastByte> deen: what did he say about the ddos triggered unavailability?
16:52 <@deen> EastByte: that they can't do anything with mtr traceroutes and i should use WinMTR instead...
16:52 <@EastByte> oh nice ...
16:52 <@deen> doesn't run in wine, so meh
16:53 <@EastByte> why the hell would they say that? Voxility powered by windows?
16:53 <@deen> dunno
17:08 <@deen> nice, performance went up by a factor of 2-3
17:08 <@EastByte> nice
17:08 <@deen> better solution to tell hosters how to improve performance than buy more cores^^
17:09 <@deen> let's see if 200 players work without lags now
17:10 <@heinrich5991> seem to be very professional, if they can't execute their customer's VMs correctly ^^
17:10 <@deen> professional hosters have professional costs
17:11 <@heinrich5991> :D
17:11 <@heinrich5991> interesting way to say high costs
17:12 <@EastByte> oh I got a notice to "Appear in Court", and the attachment is a js document
17:12 <@deen> js document?
17:13 <@EastByte> probably some js exploit
17:15 < guenstigwerben> Oh.... I love spam :D
17:30 <@EastByte> deen: interesting, I havn't got any spam on this email address, until I registered on gametown-projects

21:05 < Creepy_Tee> hello
21:05 < Creepy_Tee> i have some connect issues to the ddnet server
21:05 < Creepy_Tee> connection problems*
21:07 < Creepy_Tee> its since the last update 9.0.2
21:07 < Creepy_Tee> pls pm if someone read it :/
21:17 <@deen> Creepy_Tee: weird, probably EastByte's fault :P
21:19 <@deen> ok, voxility's ddos protection only works for some specific protocols and nothing else. The guys at Gametown didn't know and only found out after I told them that I suspect that and they asked Voxility^^
21:20 < Creepy_Tee> can it be fixxed?
21:20 <@deen> Creepy_Tee: i don't know. what client do you use?
21:20 < Creepy_Tee> its an older version of ddnet client but modified
21:20 < Creepy_Tee> since the 9.0.2 it doesnt work
21:21 <@deen> Creepy_Tee: try a new ddnet client version, does it work then`?
21:21 <@deen> or vanilla client
21:21 <@deen> i think old ddnet client versions are not supported
21:21 < Creepy_Tee> vanilla client works 
21:21 <@deen> you should rebase your modifications to the current ddnet client
21:21 < Creepy_Tee> mh ok -.-
21:22 < Creepy_Tee> i hate it
21:22 <@deen> but first try if it works with new DDNet client
22:14 <@EastByte> oh I'm too late
22:16 <@EastByte> atleast I would like to find out what the problem is, if it occurs since 9.0.2 it probably has to do with the vital restriction
22:21 <@EastByte> deen: let's ask voxility to add the teeworlds protocol :)
23:06 <@deen> EastByte: well, i guess that's what the hoster is doing as they asked me about details about the protocol^^
23:07 <@EastByte> oh that's cool
