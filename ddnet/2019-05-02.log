07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> noooo
08:02 <@deen> no?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When will we have a Master server cache?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> blockchain peer to peer ai iot master servers when?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn what is that loop in gameworld for, from your pr?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut We're waiting for the https master server thing instead
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When will it be a thing? xd
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.8 :troll:
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no but seriously shouldnt we go with vanilla for master servers?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is opengl 4.5 widely supported?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki supported since Nvidia Volta, released in December 2017, so no
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, wait
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since GeForce 900, so September 18, 2014

12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they release for old cards too dont they?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems so
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw: @nuborn hows it going with the prediction issues?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut its for figuring out the order that the characters are inserted in the gameworld in (which is what decides strong/weak hook)
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, okay ^^
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut I figured out the freeze thing, but not the problem with super yet
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mhh
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> or the big maps
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> could you test the map with an old client? just to check if its gone there
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ok. and the other things? its always a problem, for all players?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> was it a ddnet server? or a different gametype
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> (not sure if it matters)
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a modded ddnet11.9 server with manually added ddnet network character and other required changes. the gametype is BlockDDrace if that matters (so not DDNet). I manually checked in the client using debug messages if the client  gets the network stuff, and it does. it also sets its super variable and other stuff, so that should work.
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you want to check, if i forgot something serverside (i think i didnt, as i rechecked many times), the repo is
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> http://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> thanks, I'll check it
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :)
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And whats probably related to that: On my mod the projectile didnt appear on that big map, but on smaller (normal sized maps) they would show up. But the same map on another mod (called DDNet++, so includes DDNet and probably turns on IsDDNet) works fine
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The map is in my repo in the maps folder. Name: BlmapChill
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can just Compile my mod using cmake, if you want to try that for debugging
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, I see, I will check your mod then
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> what is stable_projectile and custom_projectile btw?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Entities
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean, they are from my mod
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (yes, antiping cant predict them)
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh ok
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have custom weapons, and if antiping is on and i shoot a plasmarifle it sends a laser clientside and then the plasma bullet serverside
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because of prediction, but thats ok
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for example for plasmarifle i send rifle as activeweapon to the client, so it knows what to render, and ofc then for antiping it is bugged but as i said, unfixable and not relevant anyways
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> its fixable
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc it is, but not without Client Modifcation
