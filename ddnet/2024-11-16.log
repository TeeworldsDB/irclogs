00:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut you can iterate the game layer like this ``for (y, x, flags), tile in numpy.ndenumerate(m.game_layer().tiles):``
00:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i'm abusing client rn
00:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for setting tiles you have to reassign the tiles attribute ``m.groups[collision_group].layers[collision_layer].tiles = edited_collision``

05:31 < bridge> <Ewan> sudo apt update
05:31 < bridge> <Ewan> sudo apt upgrade
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon is it possible to implement statistics in voting?
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> For example : Your nickname: nickname
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> Status: there's like an admin player, etc
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> . Killstreak (I'll explain here later)
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> Money: (well, here's the currency)
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> Experience: (experience Like 1/10 before the upgrade)
06:22 < bridge> <woidless> Lvl: (lvl) (left until the next one)

06:37 < Voxel> The scope of my change is... I don't know. But it will remove the ability to change your gameskin, until I get everything working out.

07:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I did none of that, so I write the way I like it :lol:
07:57 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> How to make 128 or even more players on my server?
08:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless I added 128 player support for you to get it you need to switch branch so go to the build folder and do ``git pull && git checkout feature_128 && make``
08:34 < bridge> <woidless> What about this?
08:35 < bridge> <woidless> Should I change max players to 128 in the server config, then insert this command, and restart the server?
08:52 < bridge> <woidless> Everything is working thanks
08:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless I added money but I do not have enough motivation to build an entire vote menu now
08:59 < bridge> <woidless> Then how to make at least money
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> update your server
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are no configs yet
09:02 < bridge> <woidless> That is, it will immediately appear in the voting?
09:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yup
09:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You're fearless with concurrency because you write Rust, I'm fearless with concurrency because I'm overconfident.
09:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> We are not the same.
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @skibidisigma8261451 are your servers full? which ones are yours?
09:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> Is this possible to do 200 players server? We have good hosting and skilled coder
09:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yes but ddnet clients will only see 64 tees at a time. But your skilled coder can implement 200 slots on the server side.
09:11 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> Ty
09:17 < bridge> <woidless> By the way, ChillerDragon, could you give me a text to translate: when a person reaches 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 kills in a row. And also the texts when a man was killed with these killers in a row
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless next time you find the strings your self and open the issue ok? -.- https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/380
09:50 < bridge> <woidless> ok
09:58 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon  I found a bug on 128 players. Bans , kicks , mutes when I enter the CORRECT id are given to another person
09:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how did you obtain the CORRECT id?
09:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you have to use ``status``
10:01 < bridge> <woidless> –æ, –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ
10:01 < bridge> <woidless> Oh, I'm sorry.
10:02 < bridge> <woidless> But still there is 1 bug
10:02 < bridge> <woidless> After more than 63 people have entered , the player counter shows 63 and does not rise
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1731747859.png
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lgtm
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also gogo @woidless translations first

10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless i see yea i cba to look into that now. First we finish translations and 128 bugs maybe later.

10:57 < bridge> <woidless> Flying weapons
11:16 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> pls help üò≠
11:23 < bridge> <robyt3> That's how the 128 player translation represents players if there are more than 64
11:24 < bridge> <robyt3> What are you trying to do? Initiate the reload from the client or server?
11:30 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> i just tried sending a map reload from the server and my lag went away, but then the timer and player position reset. after debugging
11:30 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> I realized that there is an error in the client
11:30 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> and it fixes it by rebooting the map
11:30 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> i just tried sending a map reload from the server and my lag went away, but then the timer and player position reset. after debugging i realized that there is an error in the client and it fixes it by rebooting the map
11:31 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> @robyt3
11:31 < bridge> <woidless> How did this happen? How to fix it
11:31 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> send it to channel bags
11:32 < bridge> <gqzrbexa0_01047> send it to channel #bugs
11:32 < bridge> <robyt3> But what are you trying to achieve? To reload the map from the server you should do what the server does, search for `// load new map`
11:33 < bridge> <robyt3> It happens because you have more than 64 players and this is not fully supported yet
11:34 < bridge> <woidless> But after a couple of seconds, these weapons turn into ordinary people
11:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Old clients can only show at most 64 player at the same time, as long as 64 or less players are visible it works
12:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> :poggers2:

12:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Does ddnet Support 128 now, or is that f-ddrace?
13:08 < bridge> <robyt3> No. The "old clients" wasn't correct, I meant current clients without 128 player support in general
13:09 < bridge> <robyt3> But I guess we could already add forward compatibility for 128 players to the client
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless what is the difference between —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è and —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π?
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut I merged your ddnet pr into a ddnet++ feature branch for woidless
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 yea adding 128 player client support now without waiting for the server would be really cool
13:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't russian but I think the difference is gender?
14:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't russian but I think the difference is grammatical gender?
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so which one do i use for killing spree? -.-
14:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I'm not answering that lol
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg or is it differnt in "is on a killing spree" vs "killing spree was ended" i was hoping for reusable word for word translations
14:10 < bridge> <woidless> Sorry there was no light
14:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ahhhh
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless light? 
14:11 < bridge> <zhn> "—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–ª —Å–µ—Ä–∏—é —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤" and "—Å–µ—Ä–∏—è —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤ –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∞"
14:12 < bridge> <woidless> Electricity
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah 
14:12 < bridge> <woidless> There are invisible people on my server
14:12 < bridge> <woidless> The Miracle of DDNET
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eee @zhn now im confused
14:14 < bridge> <zhn> i don't really think you can introduce reusable translation parts for language like german or russian, they have gender xd
14:14 < bridge> <woidless> How to fix it , it 's related to 128 players
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea fuck german or russian 
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> english op
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok so is this okay @zhn ?  ``*** 'ChillerDragon' –≤ –±–ª–æ–∫–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–º –µ—Ä–∏–∏ —Å 5 —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º–∏!`` ``–£–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å–µ—Ä–∏—è 'ChillerDragon' –±—ã–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–µ—Ä–≤–∞–Ω–∞ ''ChillerDragon.*'' (7 —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤).``
14:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's a bug in my algorithm, it's not perfect :)
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut ideally it wouldnt happen to close players right?
14:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Either use it or not, or fix it and propose a fix to F-DDrace aswell
14:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> There is a bug that 1 tee can somehow gain the status of not being translated
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i saw a few
14:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If you move away from him and go back, it fixes itself
14:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> shouldnt
14:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk tho
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i think proper client support is the way to go anyways
14:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Tried Debugging this a lot, not interested anymore currently
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sad to hear :c 
14:16 < bridge> <woidless> I have people on the server, invisible for a couple of seconds. This is after I have put 128 slots
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was looking forward to 128 ddnet servers
14:16 < bridge> <zhn> xd, not really
14:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Revert it, you dont need it anyways
14:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It only makes things more complicated
14:17 < bridge> <zhn> is that an actual translation?
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn -.- why do i hire a native speaker as translator if my end result is google translate level
14:17 < bridge> <zhn> and cases*, for whatever reason i can't redact this one
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn this is what i tried to make work give then mess of a code base and what woidless sent me
14:17 < bridge> <woidless> Need
14:17 < bridge> <zhn> send original sentence chiller
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `` *** 'ChillerDragon' is on a blocking spree with 5 kills!  ``
14:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Then learn how to code and fix it xd

14:21 < bridge> <zhn> do you have a %d on this one? the last word can have different form if so
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but i say "1 kills" in english too thats fine :D
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Don't you just love how easy localization is? :P
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is it worse in russian?
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1 kill(s)
14:22 < bridge> <zhn> nah, not really
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cool thanks @zhn 
14:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> then again, I don't think 1 kill counts as a killing spree
14:22 < bridge> <zhn> ye, you can put '—É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤(–∞)', i guess
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh right its 5+ anyways lmao
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg but with that order of words I have to rewrite all the string formatting somehow
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon can you help me with something?
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no i am busy translating
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so this is perfect russian? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/49

14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> print(f"Look at me I'm using f strings! a + b = {a + b}")
14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> \`\`\`
14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```py
14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> print(f"Look at me I'm using f strings! a + b = {a + b}")
14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
14:55 < bridge> <woidless> I got it, but it doesn't change what I asked ChillerDragon about.
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You can't improve the slow motion simply by changing the tunes, you need to modify the server
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> A simple way to start would be making the server accept higher precision tunes
15:00 < bridge> <woidless> How?
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless yea no im not doing tunes
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 are there stats on the amount of mobile players? I have the feeling all those russians are playing the new android version.
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> That is why slow mo servers are so popular they make gores with touch controls accessible for beginners.
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If that is the case we should probably invest more in easy maps. To keep them entertained after they finished Linear.
15:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah to a beginner Novice contains like the entire range from doable to super hard
15:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and things that are plain easy barely exist
15:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> which does set this game apart in a nice way... if you're a bit of an elitist
15:12 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't have any stats about mobile usage
15:54 < bridge> <3x1st_> when 128 players client support?
16:10 < bridge> <3x1st_> when 128 players client-side support?
16:21 < bridge> <woidless> Is it "fake" that I use DDNetPP but I specified SlowNet in the server type?
17:20 < bridge> <zhn> ye, perfect
17:21 < bridge> <zhn> not really if you modified anything in source code, otherwise ask chiller about his attitude to this :P

18:34 < bridge> <kebscs> why this happens on master
18:34 < bridge> <kebscs> never seen it before
18:34 < bridge> <kebscs> crashes when joining server
18:53 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/KebsCS/ddnet/commit/1b6e5a9295787f831339262a64bd7f805e966819>
18:53 < bridge> <kebscs> this commit causes it, packer buffer is too big
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> if(Direction.x < 0)
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny>                         Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(-pi / 2 - State.GetAttach()->m_Angle * pi * 2);
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny>                     else
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny>                         Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(-pi / 2 + State.GetAttach()->m_Angle * pi * 2);
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> in all the code that determines the hammer rotation
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> this is all that is needed
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> the rest is dead code
19:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> bruh
19:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> (first and foremost)
19:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> and secondly
19:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> (and secondly bruh (a second time))
19:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont know how the bashing animation is done but its not here
19:46 < bridge> <louis> probably spawns a particle effect on hit
20:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> ew
20:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> no but it works with my rotate thing
20:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> ie the bash happens at the custom angle
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> mem_zero(m_aapKeyBindings, sizeof(m_aapKeyBindings));
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
20:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> lmao no way
20:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait what
20:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> what the heck are special binds?
20:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> it looks unusd
20:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> it looks unused
20:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fun fact, it's possible to make a tree sitter grammar which will eat all of your ram :pepeW:
20:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> fun fact:
20:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> rm -rf /*
20:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> will remove any french language pack installed on your system
20:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> AND

20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> lmao
20:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Will system crash if it runs out of memory or there's something that will kill some processes? 0_o
20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> linux will kill the process with the most memory usage
20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> same with cpu usage but its alot worse than that
20:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> same with cpu usage but its alot worse than that (citation needed)
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> does the wildcard bypass ‚Äîno-preserve-root?
20:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> yah
20:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> wawow
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> str_append(pBuf, ModifierName, BufSize);
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny>             str_append(pBuf, "+", BufSize);
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> modifiers are unused but this code doesnt work does it?
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> pBuf isn't modified
21:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> so it will do "+trl"
21:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> jesus christ the whole
21:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> everything is a mess
21:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> guess it hasnt been touched since 0.6
21:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> lmao
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have written my first proc macro in rust
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> the best 30 minutes of my life
21:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> x-x
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> if(g_Config.m_ClSubTickAiming)
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny>             {
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny>                 if(str_comp("+fire", pBind) == 0 || str_comp("+hook", pBind) == 0)
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny>                     m_MouseOnAction = true;
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny>             }
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> most people dont have mouse 1 bound to +fire?
21:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> they have it +fire; some other shit aswell
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> if(g_Config.m_ClSubTickAiming && m_Binds.m_MouseOnAction)
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny>     {
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny>         m_Controls.m_aMousePosOnAction[g_Config.m_ClDummy] = m_Controls.m_aMousePos[g_Config.m_ClDummy];
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny>         m_Binds.m_MouseOnAction = false;
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny>     }
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
21:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> and this is its only usage?
21:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> why not just
21:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> g_Config.m_ClSubTickAiming
21:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> ?
21:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> since its only used on said mouse action
21:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> im not even meant to be doing stuff with any of this i should just leave it as is xddd
21:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> it compiled???
21:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> nvm
21:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1307450084895625226/image.png?ex=673a5947&is=673907c7&hm=4419744151266d08c154077c31b99f37c89415cc1d9f0c2fa42f544fcffed998&
22:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> segfault :D
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Special binds are a workaround for bindable keys that can also be used in the menus, i.e. F1-F24
22:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> i see
22:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> is it possible to get traceback on asserts?
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Either run with a debugger to begin with or install a post-mortem debugger that will be called when the program dies
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I used https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw as post-mortem debugger on Windows
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I use https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw as post-mortem debugger on Windows
22:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> eh i just need to know the line number x-x
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> That's what DrMingw does
22:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> yep
22:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait i can just do a segfault inside the dbg assert and asan will tell me
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Does ASAN not break on the `dbg_break`?
22:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> nop
22:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> well i have asan on (hopefuly)
22:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> and it creates an illegal instruction
22:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> which asan doesnt catch
22:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> 2024-11-16 21:18:41 I assert: /home/solly/Games/ddnet/src/game/client/components/binds.h(36): ModifierMask invalid

22:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh i guess not...
22:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> uhhh why is asan not asaning
22:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> just had to nuke my builddir
22:23 < bridge> <robyt3> > Q: Why didn't ASan report an obviously invalid memory access in my code?
22:23 < bridge> <robyt3> > A1: If your errors is too obvious, compiler might have already optimized it out by the time Asan runs.
22:23 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/addresssanitizer
22:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> optimize out an error?
22:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> ive heard of compiler going "ah yes these things have been asserted thus i can optimize like etc etc"
22:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> but it just was that asan wasnt enabled
22:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> i just forgot to check for null somewehre
22:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> in the spaghetti that is CBinds::oninput
22:29 < bridge> <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5710
22:29 < bridge> <louis> the jumping code in reference to this is so confusing xd
22:30 < bridge> <louis> we have m_Jumps, m_TotalJumps, and m_Jumped
22:30 < bridge> <louis> but seems like m_Jumped is a 2-bit mask for an odd reason
22:37 < Voxel> You know what would also be cool for the future? Some way to make automappers communicate with each other. Like, you run one automapper, and then that one can send certain tile info, and recievers can get it and proceed to do their own stuff using the info it has.
