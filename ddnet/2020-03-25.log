04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi, what is velspeed*ramp and ramp
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> velspeed the theoretical velocity of your tee
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ramp is a value between 0 and 1, starting at 1 and goes down the faster you get
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> velspeed * ramp is the velocity of your tee that you see on screen
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ramp will only lower horizontal velocity, but will still decrease the higher your vertical velocity is
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @louis
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh ok thx
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could it be an option on dummy maps where if any member of a team dies, deep dies second so the main dummy always gets strong?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> the strong and weak is kept the same after killing
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> o
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i didnt know that
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that this commit ^ breaks backwards compability, but it doesnt matter in this case.
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oo did u finally rename the client
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rip
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I renamed all that stuff in the server, so that other clients (or a coming ddnet client) can use this aswell without falsely identifying as a fclient
