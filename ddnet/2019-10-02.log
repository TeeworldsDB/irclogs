05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich ^
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @HMH is it really the best idea to move the actuall db stuff to a seperate process? What are the benefits?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also what will be the db reflection scheme? Will we have a single central db that all the rpc-services will communicate with?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I pushed the `staging` branch to `master`, it was newer than anything I had
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is the work I made after that gone now?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you didn't do the work on top of the master I think
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can access it with `git log you can do `git log 09ea52ce0206406a8a318d46d22818e99e56c690`
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can access it with `git log` you can do `git log 09ea52ce0206406a8a318d46d22818e99e56c690`
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can access it with `git log 09ea52ce0206406a8a318d46d22818e99e56c690`
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then do `git cherry-pick` with the relevant commits
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mh, I dont have the time currently, can you do it?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like this?
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> was it only this commit?
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was the only commit that I saw on master before
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that isn't in the current master)
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 did you simply cherry pick?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, had some merge conflicts

13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chat applications like these are horrible to have technical discussions, things get buried so quickly
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> @Learath2 like this things are more flexible and we do not force a specific db-scheme, right now i am trying to get it to work with sqlalchemy which could for example replace filescore using sqlite while also supporting our mariadb stuff. Also we do not need to form sql-queries in c++ anymore.
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can someone fix bors in ddnet7?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> u mean pepper fko? xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nvm you cant get that joke
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @HMH sounds good to me, how about the reflection scheme? how do you propoes
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do you propose we distribute the db? same as before?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. do we run one rpc-service per node?
