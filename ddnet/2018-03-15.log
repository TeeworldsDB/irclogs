12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum I'll impleement that ddnet.tw/ranks also shows first rank. But my todo list is groing kinda big, not sure when it'll be done
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ayyy nice
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But it's a bit difficult, which to show
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if there is a teamrank, first teamrank, otherwise first rank (just one person)?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> finishes within the first ten minutes of each other, when not teamrank? ^^
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or insert <other arbitrary time> instead of 10 minutes
12:32 <@deen> But then is it fair for the first teamrank to overwrite the first ranks?
12:32 <@deen> So maybe we should show both
12:32 <@deen> but then the site is even more overcrowded
12:33 <@deen> /ranks/ is already so huge I'm worried about browser performance
12:33 <@deen> Someone want to paginate it?
12:33 <@deen> Or we make stuff more dynamic, just filling a sqlite db and dynamically serving for specific maps/subset
12:51 <+Learath2> noone really wants to touch the website except for small parts as the website being generated by python is odd
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: nah, just whatever comes first
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when the team rank comes first, show the team rank
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise show the ranks within <arbitrary time> of the single finish
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> The website has a weird setup generally. For example to get to all ddmax releases you have to get to recent rlses click on the server type of any on there and then you can switch to only ddmax
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> http://prntscr.com/irjr4v ðŸ‘€
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> I don't have that menu on any of my browsers
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> And it doesn't look like ddnet design
14:47 <+jxsl13> hola :D
14:48 <+Learath2> aloh
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Im 'corneum yeah I also got those problems
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ikr. i even forgot some of these features just because i couldn't find them.  or i thought they got removed
16:37 <+jxsl13> .
16:39 <+jxsl13> anyone who I can ask in here x)?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ask what?
16:40 <+jxsl13> about linker problems
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i suck but feel free to ask i probably wont be able to answer u hehe
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but im sure some1 else will do that for you c:
16:45 <+jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/niY3LR87
16:46 <+jxsl13> sqlite.h is included in the teehistorian header and is also added in the bam.lua.
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to link to sqlite
16:48 <+jxsl13> is being linked
16:48 <+jxsl13> sqlite.h is a helper class and engine/external/sqlite3/... is the library
16:49 <+jxsl13> or rather helper file, cuz no class
16:56 <+jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/JqFjYeEU
17:06 <+jxsl13> ._. fuck yeah
17:07 <+jxsl13> is the declaration of static functions only allowed in within a class :O?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or change the linking order
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's the linker command?
17:07 <+jxsl13> it's already solved :O
17:07 <+jxsl13> xD
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should have some -lsqlite or similar in there
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
17:08 <+jxsl13> cuz the keyword static seems to be only allowed within classes ._.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, static has different meanings depending on where you use it.
17:30 <+jxsl13> what is the maximal count of characters an rcon command/command argumentcan have?
17:43 <@deen> 512 characters potentially
17:44 <@deen> if nothing else is limiting, see src/engine/server/server.cpp:960
17:46 <+jxsl13> thx
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just allow zoom for every mod
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everyone is using ath so it doesnt matter. just allow it
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> everyone?
18:09 <+jxsl13> or just disable dyn cam server side :D
18:09 <+jxsl13> *cough*
18:09 <+jxsl13> at least for 16:9 screens
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can't possibly know your screen size on the server
18:11 <+jxsl13> just 16:9 and it's ok
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> who cares. everyone want zoom and if its unfair for the guys who dont want to use bots like ath xD
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just want zoom like every other client (excpet vanilla) has without bots in it
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ._.
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> everyone wants to bot, why is it not in ddnet client
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noone wants to but, but hey, you said you want to bot^^
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gaaaaaaaaaay
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> Is there any way to fix "inp_mouseold 1" issue on win10? probably related to sdl2
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> @fokkonaut fyi ath is not a bot. Even the zoom thing is legit nowadays, ask noby. The server can detect the client and forbid it, and the only way to disable the server from detecting it is not using zoom; sounds fair to me.
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have a client where i can zoom on every server
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its funny how the only client with "hax" in the name has devlopers who alaways claim that the client is haxxless xd
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ath will always be a bad client no matter what
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> shitty lua scripters thinking that they actually code lol
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes if people turn off the lua scripts and turn off zoom then the setting that hides client flags will actually prevent it from being detected
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but most people dont actually do this i think
18:45 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 where is the initialization of the CTeeHistorian Object ._.?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> @ChillerDragon it's a pun that sadly noone gets, so we like to just call it "ATH" to prevent confusion... see here if you want to understand it https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27859/hack-development
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye ikr hack but non devs and majority of people think hacking is a bad thing
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> especially hax is used by haxx0r dudes who use it as a negative word
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 teehistorian_index is choking on something
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/Gv
18:58 <+jxsl13> I call ppl using hax if they actually are just good xD
18:59 <+jxsl13> when someone points out they might be cheating
18:59 <+jxsl13> -> hax -> irony -> hack -> nor irony
19:00 <+Henningstone> that's another thing noone seems to get :\
19:09 <+jxsl13> ._. heinrich5991 ?
19:23 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> what sort of cheating do people usually do? aimbots?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> everythign
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> everything
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye hax is irony but irnoy for using thee hacking term with bad connotation
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> well... some stuff must be impossible to do without breaking the game surely
21:55 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 online :O?
22:19 <+jxsl13> anyone online who is knowledgeable about the teehistorian stuff ?
23:02 <+Learath2> what's the problem now? :)
23:09 <+jxsl13> I'm slowly getting where I want xD
23:09 <+jxsl13> I don't understand most of th ecallback stuff, but slowly working
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> jxsl13: what's the matter?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 that's normal
23:33 <+jxsl13> trying to collect the necessary data from yout teehistorian functions to write to the sqlite db
23:34 <+jxsl13> like is it possible to access the nick names from within the teehistorian class without modifying the functions?
