00:08 <@deen> hm, i don't know
00:48 < Maple> yo
00:48 <@deen> hi
00:48 < Maple> wassup
00:55 <@deen> nothing
00:57 < laxa> deen: could you please look at this ? After thinking a lot about it, I feel like it's right, but it doesn't sort... Client doesn't crash either.
00:57 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/ddnet/blob/sorttest/src/game/client/components/menus_ingame.cpp
00:57 < laxa> line 215
00:58 < laxa> and I know that the code is pretty ugly
00:58 <@deen> i don't understand your code =/
00:58 <@deen> it's the same as before
00:58 <@deen> maybe just test it in a small example outside of TW
00:58 <@deen> until you find out what's wrong
00:59 < laxa> you don't understand the laxasort xD
01:01 < laxa> you loop through the table, and go back to start everytime you swap something
01:03 < laxa> deen: isn't the scoreboard suppose to be sort ?
01:04 <@deen> it is
01:04 < laxa> hum weird, it's not on my client
01:05 <@deen> it's sorted by team, then by time, then by name (case insensitive)
01:06 < laxa> oh ok my bad then
01:16 < laxa> deen: is the scoreboard sorted in scoreboard.cpp ? can't find anything in it
01:22 <@deen> it uses m_paInfoByDDTeam which is already sorted
01:48 < mr_pause> deen: Ok, i sorted this damn player list =D
01:48 < mr_pause> laxa promised me sexual favors from his sister, i hope he did not lie !
01:48 < mr_pause> deen: Should i PR ?
01:48 <@deen> no idea
01:49 <@deen> what you're even trying to do
01:49 < laxa> deen: ingame -> esc -> player -> you have a player list
01:49 < laxa> he sorted that
01:49 <@deen> ah
01:49 <@deen> no sorting necessary for that, there is already a sorted list you can use, i think
01:49 < laxa> I had the idea of doing that when watching hallowed's video of the tournament
01:49 < laxa> you need to use it if you wanna mute someone
01:50 <@deen> but yeah, make a PR and i will take a look
01:51 < laxa> http://youtu.be/5u6nj4bpLoM?t=16m19s
01:51 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Moderate Teeworlds DDNET Tournament [FullHD] | Rating: 4.69/5.00 | Views: 260
01:51 < laxa> he takes like forever to find the faker
01:51 <@deen> do the same in the votes then
01:51 <@deen> and as i said, there should be presorted lists already that you can use
01:52 < laxa> neither me or mr_pause know the structures =x
01:52 < laxa> and I took 3 hours to do shit that don't work
01:52 < laxa> and he took 2 hours to make it work xD
01:53 < mr_pause> laxa: I'm going to kill you
01:53 < mr_pause> deen: Where is the presorted list ?
01:53 < mr_pause> I did not bother to crawl through all the code, i thought laxa did his homework =P
01:53 <@deen> m_paInfoByName
01:54 <@deen> in gameclient
01:54 < mr_pause> Oh god
01:56 <@deen> at least i would guess you can use them
01:56 <@deen> haven't looked at the code myself
01:57 < laxa> he is testing it
01:58 < mr_pause> deen: Indeed it does work
01:58 <@deen> nice
01:58 <@deen> maybe paInfoByName is not case insensitive
01:58 < laxa> deen: so you want me to sorte "kick player" and "move player to spectator" right ?
01:58 <@deen> would have to be fixed then
01:58 <@deen> yes
01:58 < laxa> ok, I'll see that maybe tomorrow
01:58 <@deen> laxa: you, not your friend!
01:58 < laxa> xD
01:59 < laxa> I wanted him to look at my code, not do it
01:59 < laxa> but he didn't liked the laxasort :(
01:59 <@deen> i can relate
01:59 < laxa> so he did it :'(
01:59 < laxa> !en-fr relate
01:59 < Nimda> Translation: rapporter
02:00 < mr_pause_> It's case insensitive, just checked
02:00 <@deen> nice
02:01 <@deen> then i probably fixed that already
02:01 < Maple> laxa upload my demo plz
02:01 < Maple> sorry
02:01 < laxa> Maple: hu ?
02:02 <@deen> hall of fame
02:02 < laxa> I don't see any new demo in uploads
02:02 < Maple> ill reupload
02:03 < mr_pause> Well, it was a great adventure
02:03 < Maple> it says "Error !"
02:03 < laxa> Maple: anyway, I won't do fraps + encoding + upload now, I have to sleep :)
02:03 < Maple> sleep tight
02:03 < laxa> and artkis wanna do the next video
02:03 < laxa> send a pm on forum
02:04 < mr_pause> laxa: I let you do the PR for sorted names
02:05 < mr_pause> laxa: Just replace paInfoByTeam by paInfoByName instead of your laxasort
02:05 <@deen> maple: if it says error, rename it, there are probably weird characters in it
02:06 < Maple> Chill Let's Climb_495.20_Maple.demo
02:06 < Maple> anything weird in there?
02:06 <@deen> yes, the '
02:07 < Maple> works like a charm
02:07 < Maple> ty
02:08 < Maple> i feel ashamed of uploading my demos where i do mistakes
02:08 < Maple> it doesnt feel worthy of the hall of fame
02:08 < laxa> it's up to you
02:08 < laxa> I won't decide for you :)
02:08 <@deen> i do mistakes in every video
02:09 <@deen> never had a perfect run
02:09 < laxa> even short runs aren't never perfect
02:09 < laxa> right now, I feel really depressed
02:09 < Maple> why so
02:09 < laxa> we spends 5 hours to change 10 chars on the code
02:10 < laxa> and it would have worked right from the start
02:10 < Maple> #justprogrammerthings
02:10 < laxa> PR inc
02:10 < laxa> then sleep
02:11 < Maple> deen why are there some maps you decided to get top 1 but never play others
02:11 <@deen> i liked them
02:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Laxa opened pull request #45: Sort playerlist inside game from Player tab (DDRace64...upstream) http://git.io/7CT15g
02:13 < Maple> so its like the ultimate honor if you play a map
02:13 < Maple> noted
02:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/bys_CQ

02:13 < laxa> At least I can feel good about sleeping well tonight !
02:13 < Maple> i actually started touching to that old tournament map i was preparing
02:14 < Maple> which id qualify of "experimental"
02:14 < Maple> and ive noticed
02:14 < Maple> most of the maps you have n.1 in
02:14 < Maple> are those with new features
02:15 < Maple> so hipster maps
02:15 < mr_pause_> Well guys, going to sleep too
02:15 < mr_pause_> !help
02:15 <@deen> bye mr_pause_ 
02:15 <@deen> Maple: of course, i have to try out my new features :P
02:16 < mr_pause_> deen: Good luck with ddnet, if one day you have the time for a C++ rewrite by all means do it =P
02:17 <@deen> mr_pause_: it's planned and it's called hookrace: http://hookrace.net/
02:17 <@deen> but not in c++
02:20 < Maple> oh are you actively working on hookrace
02:21 <@deen> no
02:21 <@deen> :P
02:22 < Maple> it seemed interesting
02:26 < mr_pause_> deen: Looks nice, but using a language so young is courageous =)
02:27 < Maple> yea do it in fortran instead
02:29 < Maple> alright im going to try to map some
02:29 < Maple> my map will only be 6 months late
02:29 < Maple> xD
02:29 <@deen> ^^
02:29 < Maple> i was actually stuck in a problem i wasnt able to solve
02:29 < Maple> thats why i stopped working on it
02:30 < Maple> though the solution was in The beginning by 
02:30 < Maple> Epictee
02:30 < Maple> gadly i did prototypes of the part i wanted to do
02:30 < Maple> but i lost some ideas
08:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Laxa opened pull request #46: Sort ingame menus -> kick player + move players to spectator (DDRace64...upstream) http://git.io/YHS57w
08:10 < laxa> deen: it wasn't too hard :p
08:13 < laxa> deen: broadcast to console not working properly when there are 2 lines of broadcast :(.
09:19 <@deen> laxa: i know, you have to parse the output and convert every newline to a console newline
09:21 <@deen> and make an option for logging console output
09:22 < laxa_work> deen: is console newline \n ?
09:22 <@deen> I'd think so
09:23 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
09:23 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 35
09:23 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 464 users online at 2014-09-14 20:25:02
09:23 <@deen> :P
09:24 < laxa_work> no bot message for merge :(
09:24 <@deen> yeah, the bot doesn't work often, no idea why
09:24 <@deen> i change nothing and sometimes it just doesn't work
09:24 < laxa_work> is it git's bot ? Or yours ?
09:24 < laxa_work> github I mean
09:25 <@deen> github's
09:25 < laxa_work> hum, weird :x
09:26 < laxa_work> is there a place where I should do my command to parse the text ?
09:26 < laxa_work> my function I mean
09:26 <@deen> no idea
09:27 <@deen> where the console output is printed probably
09:27 <@deen> split by \n then and print each separately
09:52 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/8MKiZg
09:52 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 89b92b4 def: Cleanup
10:29 < laxa_work> deen: wtf, can't do that : char *tmp = malloc(strlen(str));
10:29 <@deen> don't malloc please
10:30 <@deen> allocating heap memory during game is evil!
10:30 <@deen> use a fixed size buffer with a reasonable size (same size used for whole part i guess)
10:30 <@deen> whole output*
10:31 < laxa_work> can I do that then : char tmp[strlen(str)];
10:32 < laxa_work> will do that then
10:36 < laxa_work> ok, I made this : http://pastebin.com/hrNH4Wqf
10:36 < laxa_work> Can't test it cause I am at work, but at least it compiles :)
10:40 <@deen> no
10:41 <@deen> that's still dynamic and it's not in C89 so it won't work with VS
10:41 <@deen> EastByte can sing you a song about that
10:41 < laxa_work> xD
10:41 <@deen> maybe you can just use strtok
10:41 <@deen> but this may be fine too right now
10:42 < laxa_work> I just looked at system.c in teeworlds
10:42 < laxa_work> why do they redefine all strings functions oO ?
10:42 < laxa_work> seems like a giant waste of time really
10:43 <@deen> I'd guess matricks likes the names
10:44 <@deen> also, many functions they redefine are platform dependent
10:44 <@deen> haven't checked string ones
10:46 < laxa_work> do you want an option in settings as well ?
10:46 <@deen> of course
10:46 < laxa_work> xD
10:46 <@deen> otherwise noone will even discover that
10:47 < laxa_work> they could discover if they read the updates from news
10:47 < laxa_work> but you probably right
10:55 < EastByte> can't sing right now, I'm ill
10:57 <@deen> Get well and sing again, EastByte 
10:59 < EastByte> but the song text will be more like "don't use vs"
11:15 <@deen> it's good to see that ddnet is not the only software with segfaults :P
11:15 <@deen> dosbox segfaulted for me yesterday a few times
11:20 < pause> Hi ho

11:59 < laxa_work> Going to eat, brb 1 hour !
13:38 < laxa_work> re !
13:39 < laxa_work> Or... Do we say "re" in english ? Not even sure, think it's french only, but can't find the meaning in my head.
13:44 < EastByte> it's french?
13:47 < EastByte> short it's a shortcut for return
13:47 < EastByte> I thought it's a shortcut for return*
13:48 < laxa_work> It might work for english and french I guess then :)
13:58 <@deen> hm, no maps getting tested again
13:58 < laxa_work> a strike ?
13:58 <@deen> no, just noone wants to test
14:12 < pause> laxa_work: laxatorrr
14:14 < laxa_work> I am called laxa
14:14 < EastByte> :!
14:14 < EastByte> ups
14:37 <@deen> I'm wondering how expensive it is to have the serverlist requested on every "refresh" click
14:38 <@deen> I'm just monitoring it, but people don't seem to click refresh very often
14:38 < EastByte> hmm 600bytes download shouldn't be expensive
14:38 <@deen> well, if it happened 100 times per second it would be :P
14:39 <@deen> but right now it's about once every 5-10 seconds, so that's fine
14:39 < EastByte> we could add a minimum interval between
14:39 < EastByte> wait
14:39 <@deen> yeah, that would make sense, but so far i see no problem
14:40 < EastByte> there already is a request per refresh I forgot
14:40 <@deen> hm?
14:40 < EastByte> I misunderstood something
14:40 <@deen> ok
14:40 <@deen> ah, interesting
14:40 <@deen> if you switch to DDNet tab no request is sent
14:40 <@deen> only if you click on refresh^^
14:41 < EastByte> well, should be my fault^^
14:42 < EastByte> https://github.com/east/ddnet/commit/cda02a3d9abecd77f466cf3672f5241124f8bd69#diff-3287b2addb72598cfece115cfba5ded8R1224
14:42 < EastByte> what have I done here?
14:43 <@deen> hm?
14:43 < EastByte> ah it's the refresh button nvm
14:43 <@deen> something else: is it possible to change country filters without refreshing?
14:44 <@deen> maybe something like emptying the list, but keeping all the entries, and then putting them back in if they go through the current filter
14:44 <@deen> hm, maybe not so easy
14:45 < EastByte> I thought about that
14:45 < pause> deen: make a filtered copy
14:46 < EastByte> when a country is being enabled it's easy to add the server dynamically
14:46 < EastByte> but on disable it's different I guess
14:46 <@deen> yeah
14:54 < EastByte> I hate autotools
14:55 <@deen> understandable
14:55 < EastByte> ^
15:46 < o_be_one> hi
15:58 < laxa_work> o_be_one: hi
15:58 < o_be_one> how r u laxa_work :) ?
15:58 < laxa_work> Right now ? I am mad.
15:58 < laxa_work> my VS is in french at work
15:58 < laxa_work> which is a really stupid idea
15:58 < EastByte> haha
15:59 < laxa_work> and TFS is even worse than svn from my experience.
15:59 < laxa_work> I like Capgemini, but I think I am going to hate the technologies we use
16:08 < o_be_one> i speak french :p
16:09 < laxa_work> me too, but it's really hard to make searches with french
16:09 < o_be_one> why ?
16:10 < laxa_work> maybe cause you got like 20 mores answers when speaking english rather than french
16:12 < laxa_work> can't debug on my VS
16:12 < pause> I speak french too !
16:12 < laxa_work> "Symbols are not loaded for this document"
16:12 < pause> Oh shit, i'm french, please someone help me save my soul
16:13 < Maple> hey
16:13 < EastByte> hi Maple 
16:14 < Maple> cant play teeworlds at school 
16:14 < Maple> it blocks udp/tcp
16:14 < Maple> :(
16:14 < EastByte> you would need to set up a vpn tunnel for that :P
16:15 < Maple> :o
16:15 < Maple> show me mastur
16:15 < EastByte> but I guess it's not worth the effort for playing teeworlds
16:16 < Maple> teeworlds is worth any effort
16:17 < laxa_work> Maple: omg xD
16:18 < Maple> !
16:18 < Maple> whatsup
16:21 < laxa_work> Maple: you speak french ?
16:21 < Maple> bien sur
16:21 < laxa_work> But for real or ?
16:21 < Maple> oui
16:22 < laxa_work> http://www.frozenway.com/
16:22 < Maple> jsuis quebecois
16:22 < EastByte> no germans here?
16:22 < Savander> Nie ma tu polakow, EastByte  :)
16:23 < EastByte> ¡Perdona! no te entiendo
16:26 < Maple> yo hablo espanol tambien
16:26 < laxa_work> Maple: using this, you may be able to play teeworlds, but afaik, servers of this are in France, so your ping might be really really bad.
16:27 < Maple> if i play on the FRA servers, it should be the same yea?
16:27 < laxa_work> y
16:34 < Maple> ok jvais essayer
16:36 < Maple> hah sa marche
16:38 < laxa_work> :)
16:39 < laxa_work> Maple: I could speak french with you, but deen doesn't like that and I agree with him, so speak english !
16:40 < Maple> he doesnt hesitate to speak german
16:40 < Maple> anyways thanks, i got to go to class
16:40 < Maple> bye
16:42 < Savander> yoyoyo
16:42 < Savander> xD
16:58 < laxa_work> can't stop loving youtube, ddnet channel's videos still stuck at 301 views after 1 week !
16:58 <@deen> that means the views are fake views :P
16:58 < laxa_work> no
16:58 < laxa_work> not according to what people said to me
16:58 <@deen> "unverified views"
16:59 <@deen> google says that's stuff like same ip for all or sth like that
16:59 < laxa_work> afaik, all videos that goes below 301 views have to be verified by google
16:59 < laxa_work> but this process is apparently quite long for new channels...
16:59 <@deen> no

22:01 < Nimda> The oboe /ˈoʊboʊ/ is a family of double reed woodwind musical instruments. The most commonly used variant, the standard oboe, plays in the treble or soprano range. It is made from a wooden tube roughly 65 cm (25½ inches) long, with metal keys, a conical bore and flared bell. Sound is produced by blowing into the reed and vibrating a column of air. The distinctive oboe tone is versatile... ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboe )
22:02 < pause> Un hautbois
22:02 < laxa> No french there you heretic
22:02 < laxa> go get your dedicated server back instead of squatting mine !
22:03 < pause> Well, you were like "oh why you don't use the account i gave you" for like one year
22:03 < pause> Now i'm using it, you should be happy =D
22:03 < laxa> Yeah, so, I propose this : you cancel your rented server and instead give me 30euros/month
22:04 < pause> Let's think about that...
22:04 < pause> No.
22:04 < laxa> Why better give 30 euros to a profitable organization than to a friend ?
22:04 < laxa> Best logic !
22:05 < pause> Well, for 30 euro i could at least rent your sister =D
22:05 < pause> Would be much more useful than a server tbh
22:06 < laxa> rent my server for a slap, very usefull
22:06 < pause> xD
22:07 < laxa> is it dangerous to do : apt-get dist-upgrade on debian/ubuntu ?
22:07 < laxa> if yes, why ? :D
22:12 < EastByte> because of sprintf
22:13 < laxa> wut ?!
22:13 < EastByte> it's hilarious to find such vulns in modern software
22:13 < pause> Yes, use snprintf please
22:13 < EastByte> laxa: sprintf is the reason for the vuln
22:14 < laxa> so... I should never do any dist-upgrade ?
