00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> have you already forgotten about the blessed mmx instruction set ðŸ˜„

07:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Something seems bugged with the image xD
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what the hell ?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just come back to Discord
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Soon ddnet will be major, version 18 getting closer and closer
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ðŸ˜„
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we will all go to germany because they have good beers, all wearing ddnet shirt and drink to long live ddnet
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> For version 21, usa people will also go for a drink with ddnet shirt ðŸ™‚
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5420/files#diff-29ffe32916052e1066eed938021aadfeb29f855d7c63d9c1ca3350aceffb79f3L206-R206
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> you finally fixed my skin nice :happy:
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do we really have `cl_download_community_skins` and `cl_skin_community_download_url` while we just have `cl_download_skins` and `cl_skin_download_url`? It does exactly the same, just downloads a skin from another url? That was the reason I requested the `cl_skin_download_url` variable back then, so that people can simply change the url.
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So much to the topic not to add useless configs
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and UI options even xd
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/993862994805137458/unknown.png
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, also considered that (`cl_skin_community_download_url`)
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I slowly lose all hope
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut you should know how annoying maintaining lots of options is, you're also maintaining a client AFAIK
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we could have just set the default url to skins.tw
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> the german translation for both settings are also not consistent btw ðŸ‘€ fyi
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could probably make a PR if you want
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont really maintain it, I made it so 0.7 players can get the feel of the most important ddnet features for me
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i polished it a bit, but not actively maintaining
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and on my serverside mod, i have a lot of options, but also a lot of features. if done wisely and correctly, those are not an issue. But this seems unusual xD
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should have not gotten merged. i even said smth about this in the pr iirc
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #5449 got closed, when did this feature get in?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5397
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5397#discussion_r895163135
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you troll xD say
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u say not adding more config vars too, why does everyone say that and then end up doing it anyways secretly after 1 day merge already
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> without any feedback (guess cuz its a small pr)
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that config option seems easy enough to remove
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can probably even make a PR
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unlike the config option you want to introduce
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like it can only be removed with a lot of backlash
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw, I wasn't the biggest fan of that either, just wasn't around to voice my concern
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why add it in the first place
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I'd also be in favor of your approach
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can we put down the fight now
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I initially proposed the community option I just wanted to append a `?community` at the end
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yet we're more than one maintainer and we're okay with differing opinions
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sometimes code that is non-optimal in some maintainer's eyes gets merged
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok nvm then
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's okay, we can improve it
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, not like I'm being hostile
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont search the issue on my side, please
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can disagree about something but agree on other things, it's normal
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but can we also agree on that we both went a bit out of hand, and that we can still work together, otherwise I'd like to stop working on DDNet completely, it was really not nice of you today.
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't do such ultimatums
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont feel comfortable being bullied like that
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or like, being threated
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wrong word
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> treated
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I scrolled up in #general, and it didn't look like you were entirely innocent either
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What did I just say?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And did you also see my trie**s** to fix the situation, and my apology?
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I didn't
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said that both did bad things and want Learath2 to acknowledge that
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, I'll just let it go. I was indeed not being very nice, I'll try to keep a more professional conduct in the future
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes. Because I did already by saying we both did bad things, and because I at least tried to solve the situation 4 or 5 times. While learath just put oil in the fire with his toxicity at that moment. He was really mad, which is okay, but he gotta stand to it
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thank you
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Me too
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should probably get some friend to look at the conversation and tell you what he thinks about the messages
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should probably get some friend to look at the conversation and tell you what they think about the messages
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, in the end I just tried to be there for the community, or at least a part of it. Because I know that it was clear before the release already, that there wont be such an option or something. And I also already before the release knew that people dislike, and more people are gonna dislike it when it drops.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> All in all, I tried to get learath to understand exactly that, and that its important for many players and that we also have to take a look at the feeling of things, and how they affect the gameplay and how they help or distract
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true you fokkonaut went a bit overboard, but i can also see how some learath answers may make you yell, but that is no excuse i guess
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing is an excuse, as learath "excused" he is just a human, yes, we are all, and everyone makes mistakes. Correct is it tho, to come back together
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which he clearly did not want
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> learath gave off brutally honest vibes ini
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> learath gave off brutally honest vibes imo
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what that means
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first rule of sincere conversation: do not psychoanalyse your partner
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just saw learath being overly sarcastic and fokkonaut getting mad xd
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast that was the feeling i got
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you do, it only goes downhill from there
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont let him accuse me for things tho. Thats exatcly what he did
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said "he clearly doesn't want to come back together"
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> U acted way different in the channel, and agreed that learath was really mad, not just sarcastic
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's an interpretation of you
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because that is, what it was
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never agreed to anything
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you cannot say that, no
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is a place where your discussion style is bad, IMO @fokkonaut
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> might be
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But why do I have to understand other people only, when nobody tries to understand me?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thing is
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can understand others
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i dislike not being understood on the other side
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you again say that nobody tries to understand you
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And then both sides are kinda against each other
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is probably not true
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> â€¦
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then again different: They dont show it.
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And thats a problem.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, then say that
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It might be that I cant perfectly express myself in a hectic conversation in english
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or my goal
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or that you take that too serious, and I took learath too serious. Thats all no problem, but getting shot in the face like that is not nice
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And thats my final statement, lets just stop on this. I dont think it can go anywhere else really. Important is that we can look forward, which I personally am always a fan of
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you offered learath2 money to make it more appearling to him to get the thing done, that's not expressing yourself, that's just being an ass
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> that was hella rude imo
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and again "you take it too serious"
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, he said he will do it now because (toxicity) mr. boss fokkonaut (or quite similar) said so. That went on, until I said dude, if you feel better I can give you money for that
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please stop predicting the intentions or the psychology of your conversation partners
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it leads to worse discussions IMO
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats simply false.
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do you know if making calls ffi calls e.g from c++ to rust or rust to c++ has inherent perfomance deficit than purely native code?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you as an admin should take a closer look. Sad.
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll timeout fokkonaut for now
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "Sad."
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Deserved :kek:
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :saddo: admin, staff bias
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true u went overboard there
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> offering money
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u know im always against admins
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki no inherent bias
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki no inherent performance deficit
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nice
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but practical ones
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sometimes, cross-language LTO isn't enabled
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so for example, if we made a c++ interface to use rust modern hashmap, would we get the perf benefits?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, generics don't work across FFI
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh true
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Skeith that was uncalled for
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Oops
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> :greenthing:
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was looking at #5292
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5292
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe we should try some small thing
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to get the feeling
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and decide
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what tho
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> #5292
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5292
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh ops
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> sorry, accidentally deleted one of your messages there
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from who?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi trying to stir something up ðŸ˜„
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yours :D
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk which xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I just enabled the github cog again for this channel
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen why did u close the openssl evp issue?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is not enabling the reuse of the ctx good enough?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho we should not use deprecated stuff, specially with openssl and security related things
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i rly dont feel good about our (own) implementation of the sha thing
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as they say, never do crypto urself
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something like that
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ddnet client that mines crypto :santatrollet:
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u see the related issue the struct was made opaque for a reason
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Taking a hash is not *that* complicated, we are not rolling our own SSL or anything
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Skeith very mature
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/993873199139913819/unknown.png
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @c0d3d3v ALOT of people from the chn community really like the new HUD ;)
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The hud's really nice, ya
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly @c0d3d3v is doing a lot of work, and he deserves praise, even if i dont like the freezebar xD
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof, so many notifications, sometimes i cleanup and miss where i am mentioned
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (github)
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Feel free to ping me here if smth urgent needs to be done, i didnt notice  the domain migration issue till now xD
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only reason was for forward compatibility of the library
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only reason was forward compatibility of the library
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't really see much that can go wrong with implementing a known hash function yourself
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps timings?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk either, i always never rly tried to do my own hash impls
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess the 'don't roll your own crypto' refers mostly to building crypto systems out of primitives?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or designing your own primitives?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always thought about it in the whole grand scheme, so i include primitives too xD
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think good candidates to try rust are either a client component or a server entity, what do u think?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> something low-level and not much connected would be better suited IMO
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know how hard it will be for me to cross-compile Rust
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd also try to figure that out before merging stuff like that
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoreticallyâ„¢, rust isn't that bad
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i wanna try something small to see how it feels
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah maybe something more low level
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3569
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u are simply wrong
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was discussed multiple times, in github & in discord
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> get u facts straight before talking
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cry
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still a dumb decision yd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hey
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u want to add skints.tw
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Not Keks that was insensitive as we were just trying to calm down
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut stop that
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dude i did nothing
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do you delete now
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is so cringe
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you yourself told me not to take everything so serious xD
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my touchpad isn't working correctly
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this discord channel is very cringe
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof touchpad
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for legendary #5555 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> startup + VPN problems
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> STUN? or was it already added last version?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5555
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> these issues are always so weird xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm also surprised by that one ^^
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird stuff
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this one is absolutely bizarre
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I accidentally nuked my firefox profile ðŸ˜¦
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> backup?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't have one
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh rip
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no sync?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no sync indeed, I really should have been more careful
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just need to reinstall all my extensions and log in everywhere
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good time to switch to webkit ðŸ˜‰
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> webkit tries to cripple adblockers
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have the weirdest of bugs, if I click a link inside a chromium app it won't open in firefox, it'll say there is a running firefox instance that isn't responding
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> better don't switch there ðŸ˜‰
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but firefox instance that is running is working just fine
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ublock + containers
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> essential
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also like languagetools to not write like a pepeg
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @c0d3d3v i saw u linked a article about rust for cpp devs, but it misses a lot of things, maybe this is better https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5292#issuecomment-1148997561>)
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is absolutely insane, if I do `xdg-open https://ddnet.tw` it works just fine, if I click a link in discord, that's exactly what chromium does but it doesn't work
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> What do you think, I changed the text in the hook collsion line tab... @cheeser0613  suggested to change one of the texts, see https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/990564093926719528/993891989324042331/unknown.png

16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does someone with good english agree? Then I can change it.

16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> details like this
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thanks ... I will look into it
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you have mimeo installed?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ups wrong ping
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> aiming sounds wrong to me
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its only about the hook, not about where you aim
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you have mimeo installed? 
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> My default openers are also sometimes crazy... I tried to use mimeo instead of xdg-open that helped for some time but is also not consistent. Sometimes my `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache` cache is just filled with wrong entires xD then I delete the file and everything works again.  
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Default_applications
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make a dummy change which just adds some useless function and tell me how to build it ðŸ˜„
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> saving this for later https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know a way I could run a command with a specified environment?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u mean with specified environment?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chroot? xD
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> env vars?=
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> env variables? Just put them before the command
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `source myenvfile && ./mycommand`?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Env vars yeah. I need to clean the environment so nothing remains of the old one, read the new env file and run the command essentially
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `bash -c "source myenvfile && ./mycommand"`
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `env -i bash --noprofile --norc -c "source myenvfile && ./mycommand"` but that's just guessing
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bash pro
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ask chiller
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is the wizard
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems to work:
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bash-5.1$ echo $FOO
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bash-5.1$ cat myenvfile
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> export FOO=bar
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bash-5.1$ cat mycommand
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> #!/bin/bash

17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> env
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bash-5.1$ env -i bash --noprofile --norc -c "source myenvfile && ./mycommand"
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bar
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> FOO=bar

17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I should make a fake pull request with what I built for rust-ddnet interaction
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice, thanks @deen that worked perfectly
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bizarre, for whatever reason chromium apps launch xdg-open with `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=disabled:`
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 if you find a fix, tell me
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also have that problem
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can't click links in chromium apps too?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> y
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like discord
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm very close to replacing xdg-open with a wrapper that clears `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the problem seems to be that I have that variable unset, and chromium replaces that with `disabled:` which breaks
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk what part of my setup is failing that that variable is left unset though
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you git-blamed it? ^^
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't know what app is responsible so don't know what to git-blame ðŸ˜›
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If chromium wasn't stupidly replacing it with `disabled:` xdg-launch just uses `~/.dbus/session-bus/`
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i like mt bitches disabled: aswell
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> i like my bitches disabled: as well

18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ha ha ha ha what a kneeslapper
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xDÃ¨
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> wtf runescape
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/993923329989812344/RDT_20220705_1855546277024894227902550.jpg
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i am music assembly dev web ðŸ˜…
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 figured it out, but I doubt your problem is the same as mine. I was starting sxhkd before I started the dbus session so it wasn't inheriting the environment variables required
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> everytime when i stream my game to discord, these artifacts happen, and they stay until i close the game
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/993930261433679872/unknown.png
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kellar J.> Hi everyone, I'm new here, does anyone know how to speak in Portuguese?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is a fix for it, let me search it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think @Not Keks  said many times that this one is normal. You can use some weird setting that makes discords recording performance worse and that fixes it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4711#issuecomment-1046824198
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he even contacted discord support ðŸ˜„
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u can also try to enable vulkan
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> doesn't seem like a nice trade off
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe that helps
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not but it'll work
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i have problems with vulkan
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does discord even test their shitty libraries
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vulkan works for me, opengl not
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the old option both work, but performance is not as good
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u sure vulkan is on then?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if it works for learath
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> nah vulkan is just not an option for me
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u on macos or what
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> because appearently it freezes media like youtube in the background
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah u that guy
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still no driver updates to fix this? xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i'm on the latest drivers idk
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well else just use OBS or NVIDIA shadow play
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It freezes other media? That's also bizarre
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just use the old recording thing in discord if your computer is not too bad
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there are so many different issues for so many different ppl on so many different OS with so many different hardware
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it's insane
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean why does fucking razor put out a tool that injects rendering of games
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> you mean this?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/993934980415754320/unknown.png
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> razer?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, disable the "latest technology" and I think it'll work
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah we had problems with some razer tool too
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it injects some overlay into ddnet
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, overlay cool?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and destroys everything
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we never tested it, but lets just release it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah razer causes so many sorts of problems, my friend couldn't start a game because the games anti cheat didnt allow the razer services
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why our renderer broke so hard though, if it broke on AAA games it'd probably be instantly noticed
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are they leaving something dirty after they render their overlay? Do we rely on something being unchanged on the next frame which they change?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why would it do that?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just to make software more unreliable
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> to display stats iirc, I don't really remember what overlay it was
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ah i think mouse heatmap
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/745926398140612678/985005717230604319/unknown.png
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> top right
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is the overlay
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> that's nvidia
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks useless to me xd
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he uninstalled the  razer tool and it worked again
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and smone else confirmed
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the blue text
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd actually be very interesting to know what they are breaking when they inject themselves at what I presume is the end of our pipeline
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ah weird i never saw that
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We must be doing something drastically different to other games if this went unnoticed this long
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, we use opengl xD
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> case closed
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet its simply not tested
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AndreW> Sry guys if i was spamming a discord invite, i was hacked
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs how would u test an OpenGL injection
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Other games use opengl too, I had no such problems in DOOM or Civ
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u also didnt have this problem in ddnet
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I only tested the discord thing, not the overlay
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs u didnt install this razer trash nobody needs xD
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ij
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but still, then its just luck or smth
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Make sure to change your password ^^ it'll change your discord user token aswell
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, not saying it should be fixed, I'm just genuinely curious
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AndreW> I was changed
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else thing i can imagine is that this only happens on opengl 3.3, bcs of `gfx_enable_texture_unit_optimization 1`
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs that uses ALL available texture units of the GPU
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and the software renderer probs sucks hard compared to a high end NVIDIA card
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so the extra units simply get lost or are ignored
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but nobody ever confirmed it, and its a NVIDIA only problem for some reason apparently
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only thing i can imagine is that this only happens on opengl 3.3, bcs of `gfx_enable_texture_unit_optimization 1`
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test test
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is github down?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh maybe its me
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok it works
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how google will react
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet.tw is pretty up there
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5hz seems a little too busy for the snowflakes, but 1hz seems too slow ðŸ˜›
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Too many snowflakes on screen i think
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can increase the batch count, then we can make even more snowflakes
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets reach 1 million
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in my clan chat they said we took "freeze" too literaly ðŸ˜„
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> How to bring old hub back
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> disable HUD, if u dont need it
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> it was useful to see hearts + old stars example for timing 2s freezes
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah stars are a different topic yeah
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> Atleast make a option that u can bring old hub back and stars..
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> quick question, is there an api/npm package for ddnet? thinking of re-making https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot with JS
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I like new hud, just prefer stars over snowflakes.
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> They fade away too slowly
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could add tick marks on the bar
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> to make it better than stars to time 2s unfreeze
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> I mean it's ok i'll just download older client i guess
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rip
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> didnt know anyone used the heart hud to time freeze xd
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i doubt anyone actually did, they mean stars
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> hmm didn't really use it, just really rarely but if u disable hud fully it feels so naked
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2s freezes, where did you use these?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> on some speedruns its useful af
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc the way we did stars they shouldn't even be accurate enough for this
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> actually adding ticks to the bar would be great
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dont they emanate from center every freeze tick
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Objectively the freeze bar is fine but it is changing one of the most important visual indicators in the game so I think its expected some people will never fully prefer it
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> Hey, is there any way to get the (freeze ninja with katana) back?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> Btw i like the snowflakes when u are in freeze. but there are little bit to big. 
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> But cool feature!
22:47 <+xq> How is dbg_dummies used? My server keep crashing no matter what value I give it.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not supposed to be used
22:51 <+xq> I guess, either way figured it out. Had to launch the server with the value in a config.
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> CNetMsg_Sv_Record does no longer contain the personal best time (it is only send in some special conditions). I guess (without further investigation) it is because we changed the SQL query for the player data. I want to use the information for an update to the finish time display.  If someone has an idea why it is lost... he can give me in an hint... I will try to fix it tomorrow.
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That sounds like a bug. I think Sv_Record should contain the best time
