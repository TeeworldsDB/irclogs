10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen video recording is linux compatible too right?
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yes
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GoJE GrEEN !> Hi @deen 'auth_add' miss in   https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/4a7dd2005121ec837a8d27c159d04665fef9e51f/servers/scripts/auth-add.sh#L8
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GoJE GrEEN !> Hi @deen 'auth_add' missed in   https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/4a7dd2005121ec837a8d27c159d04665fef9e51f/servers/scripts/auth-add.sh#L8
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-snd> @GoJE GrEEN ! ðŸ˜„
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki yes, but I don't like enabling it because at the moment it enforces a specific window size. It *could* be fixed to only disallow resizes while video is being recorded, but i was lazy
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @GoJE GrEEN ! i don't know that script tbh
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we maybe add the servers git hash to record_race? that would help track down ranks during the transition phase
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats a nice idea
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you can theoretically track those down via teehistorian
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check in the given timeframe, look at the teehistorian header, it has the server git hash
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This also helps with the bug, but I don't think this was it
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Count returns -1 for `TEAM_SUPER`Â not `TEAM_FLOCK`
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and -1 wouldn't break the loop
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> I found a bug in the editor, where you cannot change the color of anything. Here is a video of it: https://youtu.be/bTwFSmH5HVc (( I know its 360p for some reason, my OBS is fucked ))
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling I broke that
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's fixed by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2231 @Learath2
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seem to need more cores ðŸ˜›
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 yesterday we had 3 different bugged versions at once
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> its still fucked for me
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> > I have a feeling I broke that
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> @Learath2 do you know when it will be fixed?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @dlusion does #2231 fix it?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> Uh im sorry but i have no idea what any of that means lmao
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> where can i find this file?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/716369209487261751/unknown.png
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> I cant find an src folder.
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah no not like that ðŸ˜„
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> yeah im not really sure how to do it :/
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are you on windows?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> Yep.
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> this folder is empty.
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/716369594935410738/unknown.png
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> Well i'll just use and older version for now ðŸ™‚
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how old do you need to go?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> Only 1 version.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dlusion> So 30th of april.
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, did we even do anything about the editor there??
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway I guess #2231 does fix it, I'll check it tomorrow
