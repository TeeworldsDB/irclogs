10:16 < mrQ> Hey! Can you give an advice how DDNet is facing Vali DDOS attacks? Are there any useful settings that can be used during such attacks (like reducing sv_netlimit)?
10:17 <+laxa> Finally ddos over against my server
10:17 <+mrQ> how did you succeed?
10:18 <+laxa> What ?
10:18 <+laxa> There is nothing to do against UDP flood
10:18 <+laxa> and the ddos just stopped
10:18 <+laxa> the ddos was on Teamspeak server port
10:18 <+laxa> not ddnet
10:19 <+mrQ> ah, ok
10:19 <+mrQ> But what do you usually do during ddos? do you change any ddnet server settings?
10:20 <@EastByte> nope, that wouldn't help at all, the ddnet server already is pretty safe against spoofed flooding
10:20 <@EastByte> you need to drop the packets either in kernel-mode on a strong dedicated server or using a hardware firewall
10:22 <+mrQ> ye, NFO hoster provides such feature to change rules on hardware firewall. But its hard to identify the flooding packet
10:23 <+mrQ> We are just facing vali's attacks every day at event time (20:00)
10:35 <+laxa> !ping
10:35 <@Nimda> Pong!
13:43 <+laxa> EastByte: deen: TS is back online if people are asking
15:29 <+Ryozuki> deen check this :) https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

19:23 <+asdf> at compiling ddnet i got this error: [string "src/tools.lua"]:162: no driver set -> nextline -> bam: script error (-t for more details)
19:24 <+asdf> what can i do now???
19:28 <+asdf> how can i set this driver
19:30 <+Henningstone> that error sounds pretty strange
19:30 <+Henningstone> are you trying on unmodified ddnet?
19:30 <+learath2> bam -c all && bam config and try again ?
19:31 <+learath2> i think the second one is supposed to be bam configure
19:32 <+Henningstone> actually it's bam config :D
19:32 <+asdf>  so, what to do?
19:32 <+asdf> i am trying to do that like in ryozukis video
19:32 <+asdf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I73AQNPIWIs
19:32 <+Henningstone> have you actually installed a compiler? (dumb question, but wanna make sure if you need a tutorial...)
19:32 <+asdf>  ähm wait
19:33 <+Henningstone> which output does "gcc --version" give you?
19:33 <+asdf> output:
19:34 <+asdf> configuration: AUTO compiler                           gcc
19:34 <+Henningstone> hm, that actually just set your "driver" to gcc (see config.lua "compiler.driver")
19:35 <+asdf> and how do i do that? ._____________.
19:35 <+asdf> in the configure.lua i cant find "compiler.drive"
19:36 <+Henningstone> no, just have to look into config.lua
19:36 <+asdf> oh in the ddnet folder
19:37 <+asdf> LOL, there is no config.lua
19:37 <+asdf> just the configure.lua
19:38 <+Henningstone> it should be right in your ddnet folder given you ran "bam config" :o
19:39 <+asdf> ähm ...  i did it like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I73AQNPIWIs ... there is no config.lua
19:39 <+asdf> o.O
19:42 <+asdf> LOL ... when i run this bam server_release on the VS command prompt, it works
19:43 <+Henningstone> oh I see... that video is not quite optimal... He uses MinGW to compile, and you are using VS
19:44 <+asdf> so, is it ok to run the bam server_release with VS?
19:44 <@EastByte> yup
19:46 <+asdf> then there is another thing
19:47 <+asdf> when i have the ddnet (Visual Studio 2010) in my visual studio ... there is no _test.exe like in the video .........
19:48 <@EastByte> eh, what is the _test.exe for?
19:49 <+asdf> i dont know, but he clicked it
19:49 <+asdf> i have so much different ...
19:52 <+asdf> i think i give up ...
19:52 <+Henningstone> it's not that hard... only the video is quite confusing IMO
19:53 <+Henningstone> what problem do you have left now?
19:54 <+asdf> i deleted everything again xDD i start new now
19:57 <+Henningstone> The only thing that can really give you problem is: If you want to use Visual Studio, ALWAYS run ANY "bam ..." commands in the VS console! 
19:58 <+Henningstone> if you forget that, bam will autoamtically try to compile with gcc (thus mingw on win). And if you don't have that installed, of course it will fail...
20:01 <+Ryozuki> i didn't clicked that _test.exe
20:01 <+asdf> i ran everything with the VS
20:01 <+Ryozuki> btw
20:01 <+asdf> Ryozuki, looked like Xd
20:01 <+Ryozuki> im using vs 2015
20:01 <+asdf> i am using visual c++ 2015 express or smth
20:02 <+Ryozuki> what is consfusing about the  vid?
20:03 <+Ryozuki> i used vs to compile bam
20:04 <+asdf> do i have to use the VS 2015 community?
20:04 <+asdf> cuz there are some differents and this is confusin me d
20:04 <+Ryozuki> oh
20:04 <+Ryozuki> try to do what he said
20:04 <+Ryozuki> open developer prompt
20:05 <+Ryozuki> and run bam server_release
20:05 <+asdf> yeah
20:05 <+asdf> but when i do this, the next error is in VS
20:05 <+Ryozuki> which one
20:14 <+Henningstone> Ryozuki: you compiled bam with VS, yes. But then you compiled ddnet itself with MinGW :P
20:14 <+pixel_> and i need to compile ddnet with VS?
20:14 <+Ryozuki> try
20:15 <+pixel_> yeah, ddnet is downloading
20:15  * pixel_ slaps pixel_ around a bit with a large fishbot
20:15 <+pixel_> and how can i compile the NORMAL teeworlds =?
20:15 <+pixel_> the same way? but bam release?
20:16 <+pixel_> maybe it is easier
20:16 <+Henningstone> in 0.7: "bam conf=release server" (or replace server with client, if you want that
20:16 <+pixel_> where is 0.7? :o
20:17 <+pixel_> i just know 0.6.3
20:17 <+Henningstone> in the teeworlds git repo. But nevermind what I said :P
20:17 <+Henningstone> vanilla compiles just the same way as ddnet. "bam server_release" in the VS console
20:18 <+pixel_> ok
20:21 <+pixel_> if someone have a solution, send me on forum, i am off now, bb
