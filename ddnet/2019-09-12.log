08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> if it`s invisible, how can you see it tho ðŸ¤”
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> It gets logged
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thatâ€™s not a font problem

17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Are there any best practices for loggigng/printing debug/normal information?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I thought it is always best to log after it is done. So if it is a message for the user for example he knows that it already happend.
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> For example a chat message when a player left the game. Should only appear when the player is already gone.

17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> buut.. i was just thinking for debugging purposes it might be more interesting to see what was initilizied and not finished in case of a crash. So you know that the disconnect caused the crash if you look at the logs.
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Any thoughts or related ideas?
