11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh no
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even git itself is going dumb
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> Did anyone else get this weird email? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609586067.png
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> i never did any bruteforce work lul
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, but I get spam from "researchers" spamming every github user relatively often
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> oh i see
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> i dont want to ghost him but im also afraight to answer
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> are these hoomans? i mean he uses a gmail so yea
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: don't answer, it's spam

15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw, in the first link I sent today: rust is the second most used language in AoC, after py3

15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Self reported studies usually have some bias, but still impressive

15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2nm processors
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt this like rly smart
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc amd is at 7nm
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly small
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i meant
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why i said smart
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tsmc was looking into 2nm technology but it felt so far off. Iâ€™m no siliconperson but I think at those sizes your yield becomes veryshit

15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iirc GAAFETs can go that small, but Iâ€™m not sure how affordable itâ€™d ever be
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its 22
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i read 2 for some reason
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently even finfets can go that small, interesting
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :poggers:
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> best update
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lmao
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 bitcoin at 30k dollars
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-keeps-hitting-new-records-193106428.html
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It took bitcoin (BTC) 10 years in existence to reach the $20,000 mark, on Dec. 15. Then it took just 17 days to reach $30,000. It took the Dow Jones almost three years to make the same move.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > In the past, a common criticism of bitcoin from skeptics was that it isnâ€™t useful as a real currencyâ€”you canâ€™t spend it in most places. In 2020, investors decided they donâ€™t care about that, and donâ€™t want to spend their bitcoin anyway. Institutional firms flooded in, viewing cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset to hold in their portfolio.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > At the very least, the consensus now appears to be: Bitcoin isnâ€™t going away. It has existed for 10 years and will continue to exist.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> yea ikr told ya guys
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> but its the usual end of year rise so..
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah its not
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> lets wait for the ath and then
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> alt coins will rise
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> and bitcoin will half again and sleep another 3 years
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> check ripple. They got sued and xrp droppen into the basement.
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen how do you manage a pr that needs ddnet-libs to be updated too?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794962576306864148/1837d222489fb949.jpg
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> the os corner
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how to show score in the tab, not the time (score that i set with `SetClientScore()`)
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet or vanilla?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I guess ddnet, so go t gamecontroller.cpp::Snap() and remove the timescore flag
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ddnet
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> yes thx
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794969360414015498/unknown.png
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beautiful error
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Itâ€™s actually pretty good
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gave you the linker line and told you what is missing thatâ€™s breaking linking
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i found it funny it added a big wall of text
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 maybe u know how, im kinda stuck <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3472#issuecomment-753498063>
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like something @heinrich5991 should look at being the cmake guy, but I think we just ship the so
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah but i think i never saw this
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shipping so files
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on linux
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam does it
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/794971885737476116/unknown.png
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One problem I can think of is whether we want to allow building without discord game sdk
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its already an option
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we want to allow it then I think you need a stub just like the one we have for the steamapi
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will need a stub
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich the magician maybe knows how to do this
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iâ€™ve been thinking about whether the stub was a good idea btw. I think the argument heinrich gave was that a build configuration addition is one more thing to test. Which I agree with, but a stub just allows us to test that it builds in either case. It doesnâ€™t let us actually test whether or not the integration works
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get an library, wrap it up with a stub which we then wrap up with a kernel interface, feels very unmaintainable
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent an entire day on math just to get 1 example done, at this rate Iâ€™ll become a starbucks barista. Then Iâ€™ll have a lot of time to contribute to ddnet after work
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 4 hours to find the set of pointwise convergence for nx/(1+n^3x^3)
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anja79> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/795010964272447548/video5.mp4
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah, the easier thing would just be ifdefs
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still think that our way to build the steamapi stuff is better
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it allows you to build the steamapi version without signing any NDKs e.g.
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no need to fiddle with dependencies to build with the steam version, either
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just builds without any external dependencies
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki discord sdk seems to be written in rust ðŸ˜®
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt see anything rust related
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check the so
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `_ZN10serde_json5value2de78_$LT$impl$u20$serde..de..Deserializer$u20$for$u20$serde_json..value..Value$GT$18deserialize_struct17h18b5f2849f604c08E`
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> serde is a rust library
