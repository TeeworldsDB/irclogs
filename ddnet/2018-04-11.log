09:53 <@deen> Start from scratch
09:53 <@deen> Don't look at the DDNet queries
09:53 <@deen> but instead write your own, much easier to understand and learn that way
11:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes but i have no idea where to Start and what to search. I komme some sql basics but i have no idea how to get a rank without selecting all
11:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes but i have no idea where to Start and what to search. I know some sql basics but i have no idea how to get a rank without selecting all

11:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 so, the dyncam is enabled by default and cannot be turned off without using the console
11:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, forgot the defaults :P
11:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shouldnt matter too too much, we didnt get any new players since 1958 anyways
11:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i got a few complains that a fresh install cant disable dyncam
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you shouldn't underestimate how bad ppl are with console options xD
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feel free to fix it :) or I can in an hour
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, better you do to lazy to setup pr xd
11:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could you create a quick issue? I'm pretty distracted today

21:16 <@deen> So I guess I should wait for Windows testing of nightly before releasing new version? heinrich5991  Learath2 
21:16 <@heinrich5991> yes. unless you want to live-test the aio thing
21:16 <@heinrich5991> you can also revert it for the release if you want
21:37 <@deen> I'll just release it and go on vacation
21:44 <@heinrich5991> :D
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can test it on old win7 32 bit tomorrow if it helps
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think i had the crashes there too
22:17 <@deen> great, would be nice to test
22:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u need to be tested?
22:22 <@deen> client and server to work, output and tracing to work
22:22 <@deen> nothing to crash
