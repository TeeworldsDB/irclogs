09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 it's time to change the language's syntax yet another time 😬
09:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> now array size will be before the type itself xd
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @0xdeen u are a haskell fan right?
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know about granule?
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://granule-project.github.io/papers/esop22-paper.pdf
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://granule-project.github.io/
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> (it can be installed via stack, which is a haskell tool iirc)
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its interesting cuz it implemented graded types
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> graded modal types
09:15 < bridge> <fluni> when im finished with my computer science bachelor i will join up in developing (hopefully)
09:15 < bridge> <fluni> also: is there a windows rust ddnet build already
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> not that i think no
09:15 < bridge> <fluni> also: is there a windows rust ddnet build yet
09:16 < bridge> <fluni> unlucky
09:16 < bridge> <fluni> would like to give it a shot
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not compile it urself
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> install rust
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> u are a comp sci bachelor 😬
09:16 < bridge> <fluni> not yet
09:16 < bridge> <fluni> :)
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u limit urself by a title/ study
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn it urself
09:17 < bridge> <fluni> real and true
09:17 < bridge> <fluni> will do
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
09:17 < bridge> <learath2> Fr fr
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u just follow a curriculum u will be average
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> or lower
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> self learn is the best u can do in this field
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> To follow the path:
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     look to the master,
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     follow the master,
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     walk with the master,
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     see through the master,
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     become the master.
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like this web a lot https://justforfunnoreally.dev/
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i find it funny how he knows about graded modal types, which is smth rly niche and not about building a rust project
09:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what academia is doing nowadays? :justatest:
09:21 < bridge> <fluni> idk shit about coding tbh xd
09:22 < bridge> <fluni> like purely math and network things
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what u think about linear types
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> u would need to write most code like `db, result = query(db, blah)`
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> a good resource https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#rationale-linear-types
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt allow u to close a file twice
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> or a db
09:27 < bridge> <louis> https://pg.ddnet.org/downloads/ddnet-playground.exe but not sure if its up to date
09:41 < bridge> <0xdeen> I was a Haskell fan around 2007-2013, haven't used it since then
09:51 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, it is a smart and correct solution, but it does look very cumbersome to use. Idk, maybe nice?
09:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> well with borrows maybe its more ergonomic
11:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @0xdeen i registered a server myself and i think i finally fixed it hopefully
11:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324319324156071969/image.png?ex=6777b7fb&is=6776667b&hm=7efa15bc821aebefafc719e47beb681acbd22dbc8fa6ac1ce06ec9fcb68c56d4&
11:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> ok, trying
11:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:crossed_fingers_intensifies:1233655818277228564>
11:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> 85/256, seems fine
11:27 < bridge> <0xdeen> cool, I'll announce it on Steam now too. Maybe 256 players won't be enough 😄
11:27 < bridge> <0xdeen> we didn't get the registration on GER1 working btw, really weird
11:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> probably too old
11:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> even with whitelist for old registration servers
11:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> but maybe fine on ger2
11:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if i got motivation i should remake this for next year.
11:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like with a database or something so maybe we can host multiple ones instead of relying on a gaint one.
11:30 < bridge> <louis> would be pretty sick
11:30 < bridge> <louis> i feel bad for those in east asia since you get 250+ ping
11:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> honestly, feel fine just by prediction
11:31 < bridge> <louis> but with a segmented map its harder to put easter eggs and weapons which (i hope) people find fun
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> since it is mostly single player
11:31 < bridge> <louis> ye maybe
11:31 < bridge> <louis> in my experience jp isnt predicted correctly especially with tunes
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it does jitter tho
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> remind me in 10 months or something
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could remake this
11:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> @tsfreddie close to CPU limit 🙂

11:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
11:50 < bridge> <louis> :justatest::justatest:
11:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> make `sv_poses_queue_interval_low` higher might help, which is how often it refreshes what player sees on screen. it is already `1500`ms tho
11:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can also do `sv_snapshot_interval 2` if it is not already, or even 3 or 4 until you feel like prediction is not doing fine anymore.
12:04 < bridge> <0xdeen> The latter worked
12:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> epic
12:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @0xdeen do you still have 22 23 and 24's poses data
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> @tsfreddie Where is the source for the server? I can get the http stuff in there

12:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no i don't mind
12:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> english is opposite from chinese semantic
12:32 < bridge> <0xdeen> i think deleted, why?
12:32 < bridge> <0xdeen> run with gdb and do `backtrace`
12:33 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okay
12:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i might want to add search, if you have the old one i can update them
12:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but nvm we could just start adding it this time
12:34 < bridge> <0xdeen> nope, removed them

12:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes
13:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is that pure ddnet? Or did you make some changes to it?
13:04 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i just activated SQL
13:04 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and actually i have something like that

13:04 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> when i disable use sql it works but when i able it it doesn't
13:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
13:23 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> @nayzox_tw so you did not edit the code? Which Ubuntu version do you have? Do you use MySQL or MariaDB?
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i did not, i have ubuntu 24.04
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
13:23 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i use mysql
13:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Weird
13:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Mysql might be untested I think everyone uses mariadb
13:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You could try that
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> RARHHHHHHHHH
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> gonna try
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ':)
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> thx
13:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But ideally it should also work
13:24 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah but idk... maybe i did something wrong
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> with mariadb the data seems to be loading but when i try to change map it say
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 2025-01-02 13:47:19 E sixup: couldn't load map maps7/Mixi4jkaem.map
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like why is it loading maps7/ ?
14:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and not map
14:50 < bridge> <0xdeen> it needs both. You can use the map_convert_07 tool to convert the map to 0.7 format
14:50 < bridge> <0xdeen> if you want compatibility for TW 0.7 players to join your s ervers
14:51 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and if i don't want
14:51 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i can disable it ?
14:51 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> because i have like 900 maps actually
14:51 < bridge> <0xdeen> sv_sixup 0
14:51 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okkkk thx

14:56 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> what can i do with that....
14:59 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> when i change maps my server crash
14:59 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> with "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
15:00 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> only when sql is on
15:00 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but idk what's wrong with my sql database
15:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> Is this current ddnet state?
15:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> I think I've seen this error before and fixed it
15:01 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> wdym
15:01 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ah
15:01 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> idk
15:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> current repository in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet or an older state?
15:01 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> current
15:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> from what i can see, is `IsNull` just not initialized when calling mysql_stmt_fetch_column() ?

15:03 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> my brain isn't braining
15:05 < bridge> <0xdeen> `Bind.is_null = &IsNull;` will make it be written to
15:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> hm, odd
15:05 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> is the problem the sourcecode or my sql db ?
15:05 < bridge> <0xdeen> source code
15:05 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i can't solve it or i can ?
15:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> maybe a compatibility problem with the mysql version you are using
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> hmm probably
15:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> which one is it, what operating system are you on?
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ubuntu
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 22.04 or something
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 64 bits
15:06 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> maybe
15:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> can you do
15:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> `mysql --version` and `mariadb --version`
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.6.18-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> 
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh how the hell is it debian..........
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ....
15:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> can you do
15:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> `mariadb --version` (forgot, just mariadb is enough it's a dropin replacement)
15:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> 10.6.18 is old - i'm on 11.4.4 - works for me
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okkk
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> how can i update
15:07 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> because i installed it today
15:09 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ```

15:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is docker slow
15:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> just curious, cuz usually when i hit these i just use the docker image:justatest:
15:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> well that just hides the fact that it's borked on their machine but doesnt fix the underlying problem
15:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm asking for me tho
15:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :greenthing:
15:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek: - if you're just using docker to build the server, i'd consider it okay'ish
15:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i often keep my servers distro untouched, install dockers and just get my services that way.
15:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> that's fair for people knowing how to use docker yea
15:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> thx
15:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> ReiTW had to sit through 2hours of me suffering with docker
15:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i feel assured
15:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what?
15:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> which part
15:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> i setup a test environment for blockworlds - and i had to have the DDNet server communicate with an api i wrote
15:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sounds very manageable, maybe i'm too docker coded
15:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> looking back it was very very manageable
15:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> but understanding where you are within the docker container etc made my head go brrrrrr
15:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> like.. "okay this file i need to copy into here, this into DAMN IT THAT'S THE WRONG PATH"
15:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest: ideally you would never need to go inside a container
15:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> well maybe you are trying to build a image yourself
15:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> then idk, that can be hard
15:20 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i don't find it..
15:20 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> not from my VPS

15:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> did melon literally just means apt update
15:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> no, updating the actual index by changing the repository within /etc/apt/sources.list
15:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> so he can fetch latest packages
15:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> fair
15:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i also never done that before
15:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> i had to do that on my raspberry pi once :kek:
15:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> broke my entire home assistant with it :NotLikeKogasa:
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robyte actually did it, epyc ddnet maintaining moment
16:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wtf, it's possible to chat with copilot on github -.-
16:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324397149450145923/image.png?ex=67780076&is=6776aef6&hm=c19bda17472103ac09fa0e063d09becb1f2cc18d45ca868a9a6fddc78e2e6139&
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask him how a rewrite in javascript would look like
16:25 < bridge> <EGYT> Y'all should move to Codeberg, for real
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how fast are their runners?
16:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there any script to format pyson code in ddnet repo?
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's the only selling argument for me tbh
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think there is some checker that simply uses pysoron tools
16:27 < bridge> <EGYT> also, am I late to translate?
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3h too late maybe
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so no 😄
16:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> lmao
16:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324399268873896097/image.png?ex=6778026f&is=6776b0ef&hm=5e27648b905cc3750640349f8b0255a625d0fac81cab41109f766e5a2978de93&
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean that is what you wanted technically xd
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was it to fix the issue
16:32 < bridge> <0xdeen> @_route66 Thank you!
16:34 < bridge> <EGYT> On the side note, uh, why am I still here? I don't play DDNet nowadays anyways...
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nobody can quit teeworlds
16:36 < bridge> <EGYT> false
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's true
16:36 < bridge> <EGYT> false
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Prove it
16:38 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> can a developer check my config file pls to see if it works
16:38 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> to see if the problem comes from there or not*
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why don't you let the game check it
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok go
16:38 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Me ?
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:38 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> hum
16:38 < bridge> <EGYT> look
16:38 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> in fact
16:39 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I have already tried to look at what it tells me
16:39 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but I still have the same problems
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tell your problem
16:39 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> the database does not load sqlite data, I wonder if it comes from the connection in autoexec_config
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and when the top5 is displayed it is without nicknames (even though there are basic ones)
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and the /mapinfo displays nothing either even though they are supposed to display data
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you opened the sqlite file and looked if all data was correctly written?
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and sometimes it can't even connect to the base
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> Yes
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> sql file now
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are u on windows?
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> no
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> linx
16:40 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> linux
16:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and it's an sql file, I corrected all the errors normally
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if writing works and reading not, then maybe it's a bug in the code?
16:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> what code?
16:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> which
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the source code
16:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh
16:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I can't do anything about it can I?
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you could fire up a debugger and see why reading fails.
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or add more logs to see if errors occure
16:42 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> ok
16:42 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I'm going to see
16:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> looks like using a rc version early can get you banned from some servers :troll:
16:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324402741354954793/image.png?ex=677805ab&is=6776b42b&hm=ebcbbaefeabe138adcffa4f212111dcc73d44e1a96812a6169df71a7ef7155d3&
16:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Really nice! Now the next goal is 666 stars
16:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
16:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is MySQL not working a known issue @0xdeen? If only mariadb works and MySQL doesn’t we should maybe mention that in the readme or fix it.
16:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hold on let me help
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's sqlite
16:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I tried on mariadb too but I was told that I needed version 24.10 of ubuntu to install version 11.4.4 of Mariadb on my server,
16:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and it gave me an error when I tried to change maps (I think it still does)
16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> mysql has been deprecated for a while now with mariadb being the standard replacement for it - we could at this point just change mysql to mariadb in the readme
16:47 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but I can't install 24.10
16:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> mysql has been deprecated for a while now with mariadb being the drop-in replacement for it - we could at this point just change mysql to mariadb in the readme
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u just start a exec on macos?
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or is that too advanced?
16:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> should be fixed
16:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> too hard I think
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think so too
16:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> xD
16:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I'm going to wait for my friend to come back to see all that
16:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> I have never used SQL
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and Route66 renames to Route666
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't let deen see that, but databases are boring 😬
16:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> fr
16:50 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that's known
16:50 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> well that happened to me for the first time
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie btw i know u asnwered this 20 times, but why exactly do u need a new flag?
16:50 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, it can only be fixed at their end now
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like what does the flag tell the client or server
16:51 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what type of coordinate it is in the input packet
16:51 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wtf D:
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
16:51 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> seeing cursors in spec is so cursed
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is as it always should have been
16:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can turn it off
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also added a dyncam_spec config in ddnet-rs
16:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no menu settings ye, cuz i don't want to touch menus tbh
16:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no menu settings yet, cuz i don't want to touch menus tbh
16:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> any further ideas? cuz usually this convo goes to people trying to figure out ways to do it without a flag in the input.
16:56 < bridge> <zenixula> why ukr server dont work
16:56 < bridge> <zenixula> ?
16:56 < bridge> <zenixula> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324405983333580910/image.png?ex=677808b0&is=6776b730&hm=01de50f08cefdb6c4384ac5ce891f336f55ec7fdb43e90c3715760ee645e9f78&

16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In ddnet-rs it's simply solved by the fact that the server knows if u are in freespec or not
16:57 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the ukr server is currently under attack. you can check with /ddos here
16:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is there a way to revert this
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like freecam is a proper concept
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the clients know about it for other clients too then
16:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :brownbear:
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i wouldn't say this is better to be clear about it xd
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i actually thought about making it an enum first too
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i dont think a local player ever wants to follow what the other tee is spectating
17:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @syrinok last chance btw, are you still hating it. and have you convinced lerato to hate it too
17:04 < bridge> <syrinok> I definitely think my suggestion is a massive improvement for the overall feel
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where can i read?
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or is there a tl;dr?
17:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> we might get more people on yourside during the RC. ill prepare a pr but ill wait for a bit
17:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the skeith hated thing?
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what he hates and what he wants to improve
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> best in 2 sentences xd
17:07 < bridge> <syrinok> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1323634633425948763
17:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> spectating players have a separate zoom value from playing zoom now. because when i implementing the new auto spec cam feature where it sync what spectated player camera setting it is easier to manage how the feature toggles
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh it even copies the zoom?
17:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> code wise
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that is a no-go imho
17:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> yes
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zoom is something you set locally
17:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that doesn't bother skeith
17:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can turn it off as soon as you zoom once
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i think that is a bad default
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should be opt-in not opt-out
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 99% of cases u want your zoom
17:09 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it's perfectly fine to see the exact perspective of the person you're spectating, but it shouldn't override your zoom level when you're currently trying to zoom out, I also think it shouldn't have 2 different zoom levels between spectating a person and your own
17:09 < bridge> <syrinok> these are my gripes with it
17:09 < bridge> <eidderFsT> mostly the two zoom i assmue
17:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i do plan on remove the two separate zoom but skeith still want it opt out by automatically turn on via condition which i am opposed to
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in a demo i could understand the zoom thing (maybe)
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but in a spec i do not tbh
17:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im fine with opt in
17:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i do plan on remove the two separate zoom but skeith still want the auto cam thing opt out by automatically turn on via condition which i am opposed to
17:11 < bridge> <syrinok> It's good information to see what a person is seeing
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how often?
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as moderator maybe
17:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think if auto cam is off it should never turn itself back on unless when you can see the indicator.
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a normal person just wants to spec around
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd be surprised if many ppl like it
17:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> id be surprised if many ppl hate it either, i think most just wouldnt care.
17:13 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it's just fun in general to see the exact perspective of other tees when you're looking at their POV
17:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw it was implemented so by default the cursor doesnt go out of your screen if you are spectating a zoomed out player
17:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> which their cursor is futher out
17:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> its really for the spec cursor at least when i implemented it
17:14 < bridge> <syrinok> Also freddie I had a bug with the cursor in a demo I recorded, the cursor was attached to someone else entirely I think? rather than my perspective
17:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> will take a look. i could see that happen.
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you don't. or does your screen resolution change too?
17:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> there is only one cursor info at all time so in demo it will only work for the tee you are recording.
17:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw it was implemented so by default the cursor doesnt go out of your screen **too often** if you are spectating a zoomed out player
17:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> wait no
17:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im lying
17:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> actually i need your demo niw
17:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> actually i need your demo now
17:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> or a screenshot
17:17 < bridge> <syrinok> Don't think so, but you still know what they're looking at regardless
17:17 < bridge> <syrinok> Let me see if I can find the demo
17:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324411468753535020/image.png?ex=67780dcc&is=6776bc4c&hm=8816f46b0cf4e720313c57ed2884da0ba260c0005b9abbc8fc647d749e72971d&
17:18 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> the heart on the side really doesnt help :troll: :troll: :troll:
17:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it is not toggleable
17:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think it should be reverted
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno, i am not really convinced.
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think we could add a small 🔒 icon next to the name in the spectator list and only if someone clicks it, it uses the same zoom too
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wouldn't want to manually change the zoom all the time, just bcs someone plays on 21:9 TV and zooms out by default
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and Teero that pro plays zoomed in
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that sucks even more 😂
17:22 < bridge> <syrinok> My suggestion makes it only show their perspective at your default zoom, if you zoom out once it breaks it and should never copy their zoom levels until you reset
17:22 < bridge> <syrinok> I think that's fine
17:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and i dont
17:22 < bridge> <syrinok> It's like spectating someone else in any other game
17:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think it should never turn back on if you zoomed at all
17:23 < bridge> <syrinok> Yall weird as fuck not gonna lie, but whatever, impossible to convince
17:23 < bridge> <syrinok> do whatever
17:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that might be a good idea but where were you before the RC tho. lol i cant just make a UI change this fast.
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So if i have my default zoom, i see Teeros zoom in?
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but we can still default to off for now
17:25 < bridge> <syrinok> You'll see exactly what Teero is seeing
17:25 < bridge> <syrinok> minus resolution difference
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but I dont want to xD
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I simply don't understand why ppl would like that as default behavior
17:25 < bridge> <syrinok> Don't spectate teero then, or zoom out, not everyone's gonna be a weirdo like teero
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But if 99% have default zoom then it's even worse
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when suddenly it zooms out or in
17:26 < bridge> <syrinok> Why can't the cursor be accurate regardless of zoom level btw, freddie
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah who the fuck broke that btw xD
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is defs the most useless change ever
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the cursor is relative to the tee
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is it a lack of information or is Freddie bad at math?
17:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do you mean the zoom level changes consistency?
17:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i changed it back already.:justatest: if you are talking about aiming, not spectating
17:28 < bridge> <syrinok> Idk, I'm assuming when you zoom it'll just inaccurately show the person's cursor position, if that's not the case then just don't match the person's zoom level at all, it's pointless besides fun / slight information
17:28 < bridge> <syrinok> I just notice when i zoom out when I see the cursor it glitches their cursor a bit in the process
17:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oh, we assume cursor is world pos
17:29 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm assuming it breaks it, or is it just recalculating it?
17:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so idk what is broken
17:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do you have a screenshot comparison or something
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but that is just bad design, why should cursor be world pos xD
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we need to translate cursor pos to world pos for a cmd, then do it on the client
17:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could make it not, but it is nice to see what a cursor is landing on exactly.
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the server does need to know the exact screen resolution to work, lmao
17:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> aiming is screenpos now
17:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> telecursor is specially handled
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok then let me rephrase
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's world pos. then the client should send it like that to the server
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but even that
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should not be used by the server
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it just sounds super inaccurate
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for spec ok, but for calculations, i dunno
17:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> are we talkind about aiming or now?
17:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> are we talkind about aiming or not
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well also about telecursor
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aiming must be relative always
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything else must get the world pos from client
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not calc on server
17:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could remove telecursor chat command and make it a netmsg.
17:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but we need to remove telecursor fast
17:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> for this version
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i asumme it wasnt u who even added it, or was it?
17:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> telecursorV
17:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> telecursor?
17:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no
17:34 < bridge> <syrinok> Accept friend request so I can send you the zipped demo freddie
17:34 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm assuming that's why I can't send you this file
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just send here
17:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Maybe discord's angry about it being a zip file, 10MB upload limit is amazing
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no secrets under tees
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here u have high upload limit too
17:36 < bridge> <syrinok> No thanks, dunno if anything private was said
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok then send here with pw
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and send pw to freddie
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
17:36 < bridge> <syrinok> :J
17:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> one sec. i'm flooded with dms and random things
17:37 < bridge> <syrinok> cursor seems entirely broke in this demo, dunno why
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in #bugs we also have a case of wrong interpolation 😄
17:43 < bridge> <eidderFsT> aiming was inconsistent after someone decided to send world pos, and the world pos is actually wrong if dyncam is on. telecursor position hence was broken under dyncam, and aiming made some old players feel really inconsistent.
17:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so i changed it back to screenpos and found other ways to make telecursor work
17:48 < bridge> <syrinok> @tsfreddie Could you just make it to where auto zoom never zooms in past your default zoom
17:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and to make telecursor work client was sending camera info to the server. the camera info is never used for anything apart from telecursor. which lead to spec cursor having the info. which is how auto spec cam was implemented
17:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could
17:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so if we want a rework of telecursor, the whole spec cursor need to be scraped again
17:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Would remove trolling (people zooming in to extreme levels)
17:49 < bridge> <syrinok> 
17:49 < bridge> <syrinok> I really wish we could just have an option to make default zoom auto
17:50 < bridge> <syrinok> I like my version a lot more than having to toggle it on each time
17:51 < bridge> <murpi> I'll give it another try. I'm on a fresh Windows installation at the moment. I encountered this issue on a much older installation before. 😄
17:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw i said i could but im like fixing four or five things at once plus the event server for some reason.
17:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im currently very overwhelmed. ill try to think more before 18.9 releases, hopefully i have enough time
17:53 < bridge> <syrinok> The current version is fine enough as is, it's just mildly annoying and you should 100% expect people to be annoyed by the double zoom when it hits release
17:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im also rushing to fix chn stuff for websites and bots :pepeW:
17:54 < bridge> <syrinok> 🫡
17:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> idk why it all happened at once lmao
17:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> my goal i think is to remove the two zoom but not the default zoom = auto spec cam
17:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> currently
17:55 < bridge> <syrinok> Add an option for it, #fuckthesystem
17:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw are we adding cursor to tab?
17:56 < bridge> <syrinok> That whole context menu thing?
17:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ue
17:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye
17:56 < bridge> <syrinok> No clue! Would be cool
17:57 < bridge> <syrinok> (Also don't add an option for it btw, you'll have deen hein and maybe robyt at this point yelling at you, unlucky)
17:57 < bridge> <eidderFsT> actually. can i add a button in esc menu instead of assuming stuff.
17:57 < bridge> <syrinok> I wish we could have options for things that are used a lot! Options good for convenience :C
17:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is that a place we could use?
17:58 < bridge> <syrinok> I have no clue, I'm just a lowly moderator
17:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like there you can turn it on and off. on is your behavior, off is if you turn it on it auto turns off
17:59 < bridge> <syrinok> That sounds like an option to me, freddie!
17:59 < bridge> <syrinok> tsk tsk
17:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sure
18:00 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so on assmues you want it, and temporarily turn it off. and off assumed you dont want it unless you temporarily turn it on
18:00 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what was the accuracy thing btw
18:01 < bridge> <syrinok> Accuracy thing?
18:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> this
18:01 < bridge> <syrinok> I think I might've been wrongly assuming something about the cursor
18:02 < bridge> <syrinok> Is it already accurate to where they're aiming regardless of your own zoom level
18:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is it the thing that become inaccurate at some point
18:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like a few month ago
18:03 < bridge> <syrinok> Hook collision?
18:04 < bridge> <syrinok> the laser pointer
18:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> hmm
18:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is it #8452
18:04 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8452
18:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> or are you talking about other things
18:06 < bridge> <syrinok> I assumed it just didn't show an accurate position cause it gets kinda glitchy when you first zoom out when spectating someone, the cursor jumps to a different position, but I think it just corrects itself once
18:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so spectating
18:07 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, if you're spectating a tee and watching their cursor, if you zoom out their cursor will zoom out as well but then go back to the "accurate" (I'm assuming) location, it corrects itself
18:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> assuming specing 18.8
18:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sounds like a bug
18:09 < bridge> <eidderFsT> well more like a compatibility issue but i think i know what caused it
18:10 < bridge> <syrinok> Also I totally do have that hook collision line bug currently, if I zoom out my hook collision shows it hooks through when it doesn't
18:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> eitherway, ye, i think i touched way too much code for this version, from controls to server cursor to spectating, so it gets really confusing which one when you just say accuracy
18:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can check that, although i dont think it is related but it sounds like i couldve cause it
18:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> can you check if it is also like that when specing 18.9

18:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> did i miss anything
18:21 < bridge> <syrinok> Don't believe so 👍
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make community vote if it should be default on 😬
18:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it wont be
18:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> actually idk
18:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you do that
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok give #announcements permissions
18:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i dont think people know what it does yet tho
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> give me insanity's role
18:25 < bridge> <syrinok> Yall devs need to not be so afraid of options lmao
18:25 < bridge> <syrinok> If the feature is used CONSTANTLY and people would obviously be divided on using it, allow an option...
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am afraid of bad default behavior
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not*
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i outplayed myself
18:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :lol:
18:26 < bridge> <syrinok> gg
18:28 < bridge> <syrinok> Have it defaulted to off, but have an option for people that wouldn't want to have to always toggle it on aka me
18:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Honestly, I definitely see why people are using the DDNet client less and less
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> More and more ppl use ddnet actually 😄
18:30 < bridge> <syrinok> As a moderator, I don't think this is true
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: does teeworlds 0.6 server acknowledge ddnet packets or just ignores them? i tried ignoring them and ddnet kept sending me them with resend flag xd
18:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i honestly worry people would wonder why they cant see some peoples cursor cuz it was out of screen. but that is also the case for specing old clients so i probably shouldn't
18:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> nope, more and more people use modified ddnet clients
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But see your argument is two sided.
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You want new technical features like demos ingame, accounts?
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you cannot spam the client with useless stuff all the time and hope it works forever
18:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Big influx of new players skews data to determine this I guess, but a lot of people have been swapping to tater.
18:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> See the point is that more and more people are playing DDNet in general, and you missed the joke
18:32 < bridge> <syrinok> Eh, we can certainly be smarter about options, rather than being against having them no matter what
18:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> DDNet specific clients, more likely
18:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i should sleep
18:32 < bridge> <syrinok> Good night Freddie
18:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it doesn't mean they are using the original, which is weird, but understandable
18:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> haven't been able to for about two nights now lol
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say it's a hard topic, I could imagine most options are not used or only by 1-2 ppl
18:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if the topic is "why people use other clients, than ddnet's client" then it makes sense to say that they are not using the vanilla ddnet
18:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Not every russian kid who joins downloads that which must not be named
18:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> most of them are probably getting vanilla DDNet
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But we don't have any stats
18:33 < bridge> <syrinok> Shrug, this feature would be. So I'm definitely advocating for an option here
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I didnt say I am against this specific option, I was really more about your generalization
18:35 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya I understand, I believe Freddie tried to add options for this feature when it was originally submitted, and devs opted not to have any. Which is a problem in my opinion
18:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya'll need to think more about having options for major changes, imo
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well maybe you are right, maybe we should be smarter about options.
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. if a new option is added the dev also has to add tests for it.
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For the client this probably means taking some kind of screenshots to ensure behavior is as intended
18:38 < bridge> <syrinok> Can probably phase out certain options over time if they're deemed unused
18:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i always have videos in my pr
18:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> well i lied
18:40 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i do care a lot about my pr to have clear enough info imho
18:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea even if you do not know the Message id you should acknowledge all vital chunks.
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> im going crazy
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> ty
18:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you really go crazy go allocate some time to setup libtw2 wireshark dissector
18:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will keep you sane you can just compare a healthy connection to yours and see exactly where you are going wrong
18:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> chillerdragon: i love you
18:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah because debugging the same problem for 5 freaking days is not normal
18:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> even more ig
18:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @tsfreddie: u ok?
18:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Happy new year Freddie
18:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> 🎆
18:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Love you too
18:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> how do people sleep when they got tasks to do
18:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i cant sleep
18:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pills and alcohol
18:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ah forgot i was asking a german
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: wait are you on arch too?
18:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes BTW
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it possible to install older wireshark versions with pacman or i have to build it manually?
18:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is libtw2 behind? -.-
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats why i couldnt set it up the previous time
18:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I often use my own package manager crackman
18:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which allows me to get new stuff on Debian and old stuff on arch
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> but how exactly does it do that
18:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Compiling wireshark is smooth af it just is a fat git repo
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright
18:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then it’s one build command in libtw and moving the .so
18:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will take a bit of time but trust me it’s a game changer for your problem
18:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> thank you the teeworlds expert
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> writing cis is harder than writing vk
19:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no
19:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324438357412941947/image.png?ex=677826d7&is=6776d557&hm=88b02763608b00107e2d2295e3be8526d51d9a25c2d7376a04c63efe4182e255&
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> change my mind
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well only for windows tbh 😂
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since 2 days i do nothing else lmao
19:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i should stop checking every messages and assume everything is my fault :justatest:
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nothing is your fault lol
19:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> anxiety prob
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first of all we have a clash of opinions
19:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no i was looking at general
19:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oh btw, someone said the auto thing did clamp to their settings already, do you mean clamping to a safer one or is that ok
19:09 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ill double check the gl1 handling too tomorrow
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok, but what even happens on _invalid_ values anyway
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like what datatype do we even use lmao
19:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> int
19:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ddnet protocol is all int i think?
19:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ig so
19:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> int and str
19:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ill double check extreme zoom values too
19:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> str is just an array of uint8, jk
19:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> technically int is also array of uint8
19:13 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm unsure why the cursor jump thing happens when zooming Freddie, doesn't happen consistently! gl :monkaStop:
19:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> are you sure it is not version related
19:14 < bridge> <syrinok> I have no clue, not enough people on nightly to test
19:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do you always see the jump if they dont have an indicator
19:15 < bridge> <syrinok> I tested with Souly he's not on nightly, couldn't get the cursor to jump when I zoomed
19:15 < bridge> <syrinok> I have no clue what causes it to happen, maybe it's when they're moving the cursor quickly when I zoom
19:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could remove a piece of smoothing and make sure it always shows the real position
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe overlay in debug mode like the tee
19:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not that one
19:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but good idea
19:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i did turned off interp when debug is off
19:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but robyt3 says debug should not toggle features
19:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so maybe i should make it a overlay
19:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i did turned off interp when debug is on
19:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> idk if they buy that i added a debug overlay after the feature is already implemented tho
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> when is this allowed ever? is someone trying to do a fish-style command substitution
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> add it for urself for now ig
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if the problem is not consistent then rip
19:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> its not the interps fault im pretty sure
19:19 < bridge> <syrinok> I got it to happen while watching cyberfighter, it also appears in the demo. he's on nightly
19:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> i just had a space in the directory name xd
19:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> compiling wireshark now
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 🤔
19:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> there was a zoom smoothing handling since server camer info is unsmoothed
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> should be fine
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller not escaping paths??
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
19:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> (otherwise it would be a lot of netmsg from client)
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> nah
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> my fault
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> i installed wireshark twice
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> so the second one got named with ` (1)` in the end
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> 6% compiled in 15 minutes
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> why does server need to know zoom? can’t u send its states only at the start and end of the interpolated window
19:21 < bridge> <syrinok> He was also zooming when I zoomed, maybe it's due to both people trying to zoom when auto is enabled
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> e.g. just dont interpolate for the server. but i am forgetting what this issue is all about
19:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> wait. if auto is off the cursor will always jump, is it like jumping back and forth or just teleporting due to them zooming
19:23 < bridge> <syrinok> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1324443071076761712/DDNet_YUWpMlmeLV.gif?ex=67782b3b&is=6776d9bb&hm=5bf7886bee32a58d7fdc7bef87be3905dbcba0b574b04f81ebf07bc595c7b456&
19:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the cursor will just teleport when they zoom, maybe you speced right when they were changing zoom and it looked like
19:24 < bridge> <syrinok> That's from me zooming and resetting zoom
19:24 < bridge> <syrinok> Maybe
19:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> only in demo?
19:25 < bridge> <syrinok> Nah, also ingame
19:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> they might just be zooming in and out
19:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it looks like they are just zooming in and out really
19:26 < bridge> <Ewan> so you just want the interpolation so that looks good?
19:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i didnt make interp for that cuz we already had three different interp for zoom.
19:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im scared of stacking another one
19:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I'll record him zooming out then watch the demo to compare, I guess
19:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do let me know if you are sure it if you zooming causing the jump
19:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do let me know if you are sure it is you zooming causing the jump
19:28 < bridge> <syrinok> I need a good test subject that stands still xD that's also on nightly. Would a dummy have the same results?
19:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if it is not your zooming, then i guess maybe adding a interp is a better experience. the problem is it will never match camera zoom smoothing so we do need two different smoothing, one for auto, one for nonauto oof
19:32 < bridge> <syrinok> Cursor position is very slightly off btw
19:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it can be
19:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it is integer
19:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it will be completely wrong if you zoom way out and point somewhere with a mouse_distance 50 or something
19:34 < bridge> <syrinok> Swapping between dummy and spectating dummy, the cursor is slightly off normal zoom, it's just a pixel or two off, not a big deal
19:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, server cursor is different that your mouse
19:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no way to fix that really
19:35 < bridge> <syrinok> Fair enough, just making sure
19:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> well there is a way if i just send another pair of floats but that sounds wasteful
19:36 < bridge> <syrinok> It's barely incorrect, so not a real issue
19:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> try this, it can be a lot more wrong if you intentionally make it wrong
19:39 < bridge> <syrinok> Can't test the accuracy with dummy, my zoom resets for both :greenthing:
19:39 < bridge> <syrinok> oh, 2 clients ig
19:43 < bridge> <syrinok> Oooo, I can make the cursor jump this way
19:43 < bridge> <syrinok> It doesn't happen every time either, definitely feels like a bug

19:47 < bridge> <syrinok> So it's trying to show me the unzoomed cursor location each time I zoom while spectating, neat
19:48 < bridge> <syrinok> or something like that

20:38 < bridge> <zwelf2> Those tables were created from the long config above. You can drop them except the ones I mention in this message.

20:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> i was supposed to send snap single and not snap empty

20:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> okey
20:41 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nice
20:41 < bridge> <zwelf2> looks good
20:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i believe snap empty is never sent to the client xD
20:42 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> data still doesn't load
20:42 < bridge> <zwelf2> Is there data in the tables?
20:42 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yeah
20:42 < bridge> <zwelf2> Are there errors loading the data?
20:43 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> hm
20:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> ahh snap empty might be sent when delta size is smaller or equal to  0
20:43 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> the only errors

20:43 < bridge> <zwelf2> When you finish a map on the server to add new data, then restart the server. Does the new data appear?
20:43 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nope
20:43 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> but the /top load
20:43 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like if i hadn't a database it would just print an error

20:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> nope
20:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> doesn't work
20:46 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> like it say "no map like "001" found
20:46 < bridge> <zwelf2> is there any response?
20:46 < bridge> <zwelf2> or does it just wait long doesn't write a message to chat?
20:47 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> wdym
20:47 < bridge> <zwelf2> ah, u gave response in one message above
20:47 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> it says "no map like "001" found in the chat
20:47 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> yes lol
20:48 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> and i can't vote another map bc it makes the server crash (only when sql is on)
20:49 < bridge> <zwelf2> crash doesn't sound nice. (do you have a stack trace?)
20:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> huh
20:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> log file ?
20:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> or gbd thing

20:49 < bridge> <zwelf2> print the respective database server?

20:49 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> i don't have t hat

20:50 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> oh

23:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: so i plugged in libtw2 snapshot implementation once again just to figure out that i did not attach the size to the data in the snap single chunk lmao
23:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> it works now though

23:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet rewrite in rust is real
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's go
23:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> whos gonna win? jupstar or koll
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or zwelf + patiga
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> exactly robyte who starts tomorrow
23:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> we all kinda work on different things xd
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think what zwelf is doing is kinda close 😄
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he plans a server impl in rust
23:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no
23:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> it took me whole 2 months to just get snapshots and initial connection working lmao
23:32 < bridge> <zwelf2> I haven't done any networking yet. Only physics + teehistorian stuff https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> well thats because i had zero knowledge about the protocol before
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> twsnap?
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> or is it just for reading
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> not writing snaps
23:33 < bridge> <zwelf2> It's a better representation for snapshots (output from twgame physics, input for twgpu rendering) and can be serialized to/deserialized from libtw2 snapshot format.

23:34 < bridge> <zwelf2> https://docs.rs/twsnap/0.7.3/twsnap/
23:35 < bridge> <zwelf2> It's the interop between Patigas and my crates.
23:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> sounds amazing
23:43 < bridge> <zwelf2> @kollpotato Do you have a link to your repository?
23:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> its a complete mess rn and i currently rewrite most of the code
23:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> even wrote custom derive macros
23:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> you can take a look at it on my github, but its the old version
23:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> and it also doesnt work xd
23:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i also need a good name
23:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> twgame, ddnet-rs are taken
23:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> im thinking of teeverse but it sounds too similar to tee galaxy
23:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> alr enough talk i go to sleep
23:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> gn devs
23:50 < bridge> <zwelf2> gn
23:51 < bridge> <zwelf2> Not sure if still relevant: If you don't modify the crates that you copied from libtw2, you could also use the version from crates.io: https://crates.io/search?q=pre-rfc3243-libtw2
23:52 < bridge> <zwelf2> Also to https://github.com/teeuniverse/teeuniverse
23:52 < bridge> <zwelf2> but might still be fine
23:53 < bridge> <zwelf2> Might also resemble teewars
