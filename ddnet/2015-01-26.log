17:27 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, i am
17:27 <@deen> but i only play on ddnet, so you know where to find all my maps
17:27 <@deen> also, i clean my downloadedmaps often because I have a small ssd
17:28 <@heinrich5991> yea, ddnet's maps are already integrated, that's why I noticed these maps that are in two directories :)
17:28 <@deen> heinrich5991: some of the old players on ddnet have every map
17:28 <@deen> you shouls ask them
17:28 <@deen> Broken and the gB people for example
17:29 <@deen> oh, and i mostly have to clean my downloadedmaps because of all the testmaps
17:29 <@heinrich5991> already got Broken's older maps, interested in a newer downloadedmaps though
17:29 <@deen> where a mapper uploads new maps every day
17:30 <@heinrich5991> who are the gB people?
