18:02 < laxadedi> deen: HH has been bought by some other people, just wanted to 'warn' you
18:03 < laxadedi> the owner wasn't taking care of the servers anymore, maybe it's going to get better pretty soon
18:04 < o_be_one> true story
18:04 < o_be_one> but what is at HH actually from ddnet ? havent they already left it ?
18:04 < o_be_one> laxadedi: the new owner is PulseHeberg, just check if he is better
18:04 < o_be_one> (from my point of view, not really)
18:51 <+Ryozuki> deen, /top5 and /points don't work, there must be some error with db (only ger)
19:34 < laxadedi> o_be_one: well, I heard a story from a friend with pulseheberg that makes me wonder how serious they are
