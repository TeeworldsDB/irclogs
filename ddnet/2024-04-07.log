02:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> run `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` in the console and see if it fixes it.
02:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> did you already try just deleting your build folder and retrying? iirc this could happen using the wrong rust toolchain - even tho im not 100% sure - what compiler are you running? - if the error persists you could try swapping to gnu or msvc respectivly:
02:31 < bridge> <meloƞ>

02:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> keep in mind i might be talkin bullshit here :D
02:33 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i don't think he even has rust installed
02:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
02:37 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i don't blame him really
02:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> From the official ddnet repo fof building on Windows: ```
02:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Download and install some version of Microsoft Visual Studio (as of writing, MSVS Community 2017) with C++ support, install Python 3 for all users and install CMake. You also need to install Rust.
02:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
03:14 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ddnet 16.5
03:14 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :troll:
03:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yes please uninstall all your existing build tools so you can do it the way the outdated build instructions say to
03:33 < bridge> <Ewan> just install rust through msys

10:45 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> why china automatcly checks in as i open the game?
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are u chinese?
10:51 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> not
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and what do you mean then by "checks in"?
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chinese servers showing?
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or chinese language?
10:52 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> showing
10:52 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> and selects the flag
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u check if your filters are correct?

10:54 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> ye
10:54 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> thats the problem
10:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> If you are having trouble where the flag automatically re-enable itself. Try closing the game normally instead of force closing it using keyboard shortcut
10:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It is possible that your config is not saving properly
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> scratch that
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is bugged
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese filter does automatically re-enable itself. I'll check with github issues
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sorry
10:57 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> okay ty
11:11 < bridge> <teero777> china has infiltrated ddnet
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what a bug to just annoy specifically russian players
11:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the ping of chinese servers are low enough to be annoying to russians and not others.
11:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
11:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh damn. I'm trying to debug this, and it turn magic

15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nowadays they have faces
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in the picture they have mixed eyes
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still creeps me out
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> opensource?
15:04 < bridge> <teero777> what kind of structure are you using for the tees btw?
15:04 < bridge> <teero777> array, vector?
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> an outdated version is open sourced
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it will be open source ofc in future
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linked hashmap
15:06 < bridge> <teero777> didnt think of that
15:06 < bridge> <teero777> i did infinite tees serverside once
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it uses a vec or smth internally i think
15:06 < bridge> <teero777> just using a vec was somehow very slow
15:07 < bridge> <teero777> maybe my pc was just shit
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it defs isnt very fast
15:07 < bridge> <teero777> i could connect ~250 tees until server went below 50tps
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but with WASM in mind i also don't see a chance to make it multi threaded
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe a better algorithm can improve it a bit
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i reached 700 tees
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> would destroy the physics sadly
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but on desktop pc ofc
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> xDD
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> new video
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> aipgores with all the players
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think you can reform it a bit without destroying physics
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the most expensive checks are simply the distance checks
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd say it defs makes the code harder to read
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so dunno if worth it
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> are there squareroots?
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> i dont think there are
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> afaik yes
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but even without
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> tee to tee collision is heavy
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> n² bcs 64 ^ 64 checks
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 64^2
15:10 < bridge> <teero777> collision is the most performace heavy out of all i think
15:11 < bridge> <teero777> atleast that would be the bottleneck imo
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well 99% of the time they dont collide i guess?
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yes in a worst case it's even worse 😄
15:11 < bridge> <teero777> i mean tile collisions
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
15:11 < bridge> <teero777> all those intersect functions
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u could thread out all tees that likely wont collide with each other
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and do these checks in parallel
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but again, it will make the code harder to read
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u really really need 500+ players ok
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else just buy better hardware
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
15:12 < bridge> <teero777> tile collision could be optimized insanely with chunking and actual line collision instead of instead of for-looping over all the blocks xd
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait what?
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why should it loop
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> over all blocks
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or do you mean if u dont do step by step moving
15:14 < bridge> <teero777> it goes pixel for pixel when doing line collision
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt it do that also to do tee bounces
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> if all tiles were represented by lines you could just do line collision which is simple math i think
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u'd need to track moving objects
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> im talking about tile collision still bro xD
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> Tile collision could be optimized insanely with bucketing
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> TILE
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but they happen at the same time

15:15 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks these things
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226520801164005376/image.png?ex=66251182&is=66129c82&hm=d428704233bcd069aeef0d6e154f49f33234a92ab829aadb0c76f4078fb6f003&
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dude
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> no they dont xD
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u not even reading
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u mean ddrace tiles
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> tile collision and tee to tee collision is something diffrent right?
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it happens before
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> tile collision and tee to tee collision is something different right?
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah yeah fine
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> xd
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then the physics sucks anyway lmao
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> wot
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> whats that?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with elasticity you would bunce into walls that way
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Tee to tee collision is actual n^2, horrible
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bounce*
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> I meant tee to tee collision, sorry, what is the issue with tile collision? It should already be fairly optimal
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Constant time per tee iirc
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think he means that the check happens in a ray shooting approach
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where u have a step count and go step by step
15:20 < bridge> <emrestyle> :poggers2:
15:20 < bridge> <learath2> Tee to tee collision is n^2 which can be improved by splitting tees into buckets so you don’t ever check against tees that can’t possibly be colliding with you
15:23 < bridge> <teero777> the heavy thing are the array accesses to the m_pTiles array. they take a lot of time
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> i thought something like this. i think this is flawed too
15:24 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226522947196551187/image.png?ex=66251382&is=66129e82&hm=75aa381ef854616d7840bb32043f977b6240beaa814bbe574fb31cf89942afbf&
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i cannot say
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> last time i checked some sqrt was defs in top3 heaviest things
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> Am I misremembering how we do it? I think we just slowly move you along from one position to the other in steps, at each step we check for collisions at the corners of the box
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> check CCollision::GetMapIndices
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know that code
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's mostly some integer calcs
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u benchmarked it, i believe you
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> Do they? That access should be all cache hits if I think about it
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am just surprised that this is the biggest bottleneck
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the distance check sounds scarier
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> btw the distance still uses sqrt
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since u asked
15:26 < bridge> <teero777> u did some tests with perf and basically
15:26 < bridge> <teero777> while(1) Predict();
15:26 < bridge> <teero777> i did some tests with perf and basically
15:26 < bridge> <teero777> while(1) Predict();
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i should check in newest ddnet code
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but sqrt² will also change physics sadly
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if it's faster
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> distance squared
15:27 < bridge> <teero777> i dont see a sqrt that isnt speeder related or other things
15:27 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226523814410719232/image.png?ex=66251451&is=66129f51&hm=9c07d32d28280ab25ce51adfb07dfb16be4568198dfd85761bf092e4d6f85897&
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with zwelfs test cases we could check how much we can change physics without breaking edge cases maybe
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> look in gamecore.cpp
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> float D = distance(Pos, pCharCore->m_Pos)
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now open distance
15:28 < bridge> <teero777> ah
15:28 < bridge> <teero777> i forgot distance existed
15:31 < bridge> <chairn> that's old boomer shit, and rick roll end of url
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah that's the boomer way to check if the URL is rick roll? xD
16:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> with a quad tree or what?
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> Even constant sized chunks would help and be very simple. But you could also do a quadtree yes
16:08 < bridge> <carlthefish> penis?
16:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Could be replaced with dot product though, the actual distance value is never used
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Though tbf it is just fast enough, it becomes more of a concern as playercount increases, e.g. 128/256p servers could probably benefit more
16:13 < bridge> <carlthefish> Vagina?
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> Bizarre behaviour
16:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> how dare he say such words
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> 12yo behaviour 😛
16:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> wait i thought we're all like in our mid 20's here, who invited him!
16:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> heresy! - TREASON!
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> Except me, I’m simultaneously 12 and 80
16:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> 12 in your mind, 80 in your back
16:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> (i have severe back pain)
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you mean never used?
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's used one line later
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the question is how accurate is it changing dist to dist_squared
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> He means the actual value is not used except for ordering, which sqrt preserves because it’s increasing
16:18 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I wonder if it could change physics :justatest:
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> It might
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hard to say, since distance must be rather small anyway (physical size)
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it _might_ ™️ work
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> But perhaps we are close enough to 0.0 that it doesn’t matter
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on ARM it might already perform differently
16:20 < bridge> <learath2> I think we just might have enough precision to get away with it
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or on windows
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or on different compiler flags
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if squar root is standard
16:20 < bridge> <rekman1> do u think adding hands to tees makes the game more fun?
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they have hands
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hook smth and u see the hand
16:20 < bridge> <rekman1> not really
16:20 < bridge> <rekman1> bruh
16:21 < bridge> <rekman1> thats not it
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226537287035129896/image.png?ex=662520dd&is=6612abdd&hm=8fdc106f2a8f19cf0a1aabb4a94c1269c130330cb53147799d49bfdccf9dfada&
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2 hands
16:21 < bridge> <teero777> actually TAS comes in handy here. i can just replay the same inputs and check if there are any diffrences
16:21 < bridge> <rekman1> there just as short as my forehead
16:21 < bridge> <rekman1> lol
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
16:22 < bridge> <rekman1> should be like real hands man
16:22 < bridge> <rekman1> not like ice cream
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> @zwe
16:23 < bridge> <rekman1> bro do u know how to make a channel like u can creat some kinda chat
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> @zwelf2 might have a solution to these already 😛
16:23 < bridge> <rekman1> or sug
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> did he write tests?
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> He reimplemented the entirety of teeworlds physics in rust with tests to make sure they are the exact same
16:24 < bridge> <rekman1> fr make this a feature if u can im leaving here
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> It’s part of his work to replay teehistorian files iirc
16:24 < bridge> <teero777> woah cool
16:24 < bridge> <teero777> is it faster? :troll:
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not faster not slower probably
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's almost 1:1 copy
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least physics wise
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u can see the code
16:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame/-/tree/master/ddnet/src?ref_type=heads
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 i replaced all distance with dist_squared except for the one in `// check character collision`
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it made 5 fps difference
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 45 vs 50 fps
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess sqrt is already too optimized
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with 400 dummies btw
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> these fat asses
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226541918008250388/image.png?ex=6625252d&is=6612b02d&hm=10c2f36614b3dda419aa887076e1e3701ee10a3acbd7056f5dbb4677e3d634d8&
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> waoh
16:53 < bridge> <mazty> lol
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it could always be the rendering code that is slow too
16:54 < bridge> <teero777> could be
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> ```cpp
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> void Omegacheat::EnableCheat(){
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> while(true){
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SendVirusesToPC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> CrashPC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> DDoSPC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> BonziBuddy();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SellClientMessages();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> ByeByePC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SellCurrentPCDataToDarkNet();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SellClientTO(noby);
16:57 < bridge> <mazty>  }
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> }```
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> ```cpp
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> void Omegacheat::EnableCheat(){
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> while(true){
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SendVirusesToPC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> CrashPC();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> DDoSPC();

16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SellCurrentPCDataToDarkNet();
16:57 < bridge> <mazty> SellClientToPlayer(noby);
16:58 < bridge> <mazty>  }
16:58 < bridge> <mazty> }```
16:58 < bridge> <mazty> thats a client hehehe
16:58 < bridge> <mazty> a normal client
17:00 < bridge> <mazty> ```cpp
17:00 < bridge> <mazty> HackTeeroPC();
17:00 < bridge> <mazty> ```
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> #off-topic stop spam
17:01 < bridge> <mazty> :c
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks i managed to recreate the situation in the demo renderer where it sleeps insanely long
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1226551897943445675/image.png?ex=66252e78&is=6612b978&hm=af9d8180987254ec1e76ee0d13c50c487b0dcd78542136fd20d836fbe27b3095&
17:19 < bridge> <teero777> SleepTimeInNanoSeconds is 8218685
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh 8 milliseconds sounds ok
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:20 < bridge> <teero777> yea weird
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> other threads busy?
17:20 < bridge> <teero777> nop
17:20 < bridge> <teero777> all sleeping tight
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how big is the resulting video
17:21 < bridge> <teero777> i didnt render it even. i wanted to change smth so i just quick via the menu
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh very weird
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it go into the `render` call
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of gameclient
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or OnRender
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or whatever it's called
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> it does render it but i only made 1 frame sooo
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> since i did pause on start and then quit
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean your client
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is it still actively calling render calls
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe some other vairable is broken
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok asking differently:
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it exit the sleep
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or is the sleep itself the problem
17:25 < bridge> <teero777> it exits sleep
17:26 < bridge> <teero777> but the next time it sleeps again
17:26 < bridge> <teero777> its like having fever
17:26 < bridge> <teero777> poor client
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried to analyze using perf... i still can't use that tool xD
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just so bad.. why is there no tool like valgrind but without being the slowest shit ever xD
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried to analyze using perf... i still can't use that tool xD
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just so bad.. why is there no tool like valgrind's callgrind but without being the slowest shit ever xD
18:21 < bridge> <Peakies> is it 512 slot server ?
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's a 6400 slot server
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (i added two 0's to the 64)
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's 400 dummies connected
18:22 < bridge> <Peakies> is it still get vanished or you fix it ?
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> tasty
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you mean with fix it?
18:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> w+
18:24 < bridge> <Peakies> I mean on your server when you get close to some point that too many tee is rendering they get invisible or something don't know how to explain it
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah i know what you mean
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that doesnt exist in that version
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's litterally 400 tees rendered
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no network limitations
18:25 < bridge> <Peakies> hmm well 400 is too much I was trying to make like 150 or something for my server special events like arena tournament or something
18:26 < bridge> <Peakies> but couldn't make it possible
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, the client has to support it too
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> server side only it's not possible with the ddnet cpp version
18:27 < bridge> <Peakies> well my server have it's own client
18:28 < bridge> <Peakies> that base on ddnet 17.1 or 17.2.1 don't remember but anyway
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i guess then you could make it work if MAX_CLIENTS points to 128 and no other weird limit is in the client somewhere
18:29 < bridge> <Peakies> if you have plan to public your 400 slot server and client I like to learn how to do it
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i do plan to, but not very soon
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> Gprof isn't as good as perf but easier to use
18:29 < bridge> <Peakies> I don't know where should I find that limitations
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also note that it's written in rust
18:30 < bridge> <Peakies> fine to me I can wait until that day 😄
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the client checks a lot of stuff with MAX_CLIENTS
18:30 < bridge> <Peakies> oh shit I just installed rust don't know anything of rust language
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just search it
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> There is also a tool to convert perf data into callgrind data so you can use tools like kcachegrind on it
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nani
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be awesome
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway my findings are:
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the biggest bottleneck is simply the iterating itself
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the two O(n²) are simply expensive
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> especially the prediction tick calls it every frame
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on the client
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe i rewrite the physics for my version, since it doesnt need to be ddnet compatible
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> O(n) should be possible with small breakages
18:36 < bridge> <teero777> :D that would be very cool
18:40 < bridge> <Peakies> @robyt3 switch display screen with 3rd party application on DDNet still need attention like using `DisplayFusion` to use it's functions for sending focused window to next display
18:41 < bridge> <Peakies> resolution and display number won't update
18:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Please open an issue for it if you think it's something we could fix
18:44 < bridge> <Peakies> I think it's possible to check current screen number with gfxScreen or something
