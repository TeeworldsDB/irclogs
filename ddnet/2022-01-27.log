01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf, how can you loose a phone number?
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Do you mean your phone subscription ended?
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Á¥´Â∑ù> Recently, my game has been stuck. Is there any way to open the log so that I can troubleshoot the problem
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea for example.
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Chairn)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem with the new whatsapp thing is that everytime you add a new device all the keys need to be regenerated, which creates a message on all your chats about how your keys changed
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you mean stuck?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `cl_show_console 1`¬†will display the console attached to the game, which can help
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Switched providers twice quickly, then they lost track of where the number is, took a few weeks to figure out.
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Phone numbers based accounts are shit af
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> schufa is not amused (https://www.giga.de/news/schufa-greift-handydaten-ab-millionen-deutsche-betroffen/ )
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Accounts based on phone numbers are awesome af
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Accounts based on phone numbers are awesome af </sarcasm>
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Phone lost -> account lost üëç No worries, less problems
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well I had this problem with snapchat, someone was easily able to get access to an old account of mine using my old phone
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> had to continuously block him & contact snapchat to delete the account
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> xDDDDD
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> worked fine tho
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but this idiot was spamming my mails by trying to change back the password
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> hey
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i got white lines in my cursor even though i dont have any white lines inside the picture, i dilated it but that didnt fix the issue.

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> >  Smells like a quirk of how we render things, maybe ask in developer and Jupstar can see it
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks like there might be an aliasing between blue and white, while it should be between blue and transparent
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw @bencie can you check `gfx_opengl_major` and `gfx_opengl_minor`?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > gfx_opengl_major
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > Value: 3
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > gfx_opengl_minor
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > Value: 0
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that's not the core profile renderer, I think we only use that after 3.3
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why your client chose 3.0
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen We should probably add a button to reset gfx settings so the auto detection can run again, everytime we encounter these I wonder if it's a stale config
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @bencie send image
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i wanna see
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/936271477907546152/thing.png
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> oh wait what
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> on preview there are whitel ines aswell
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> not in editor thio
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also the fact that `gfx_opengl_major` and `gfx_opengl_minor`¬†are both config values and are used to display the current used version is annoying
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> not in editor tho
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, interesting
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> wait
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> lemme see if i accidentalyl compressed or something
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can definitely see the white in gimp btw
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> no even if i save without compression it saves it with the white lines included
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i dont get why i cant see the white lines in PS tho
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also have white artifacts on the other cursors
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> doesnt really bother me since its just a personal gameskin that im not gonna be releasing,  but the blue one is way too visible
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i thought it was a game problem but i guess its something else
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> even if i open the picture in photoshop
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i cant see the white lines to even fix it
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> if i figure out what it is ill let u know ^^
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @bencie ok just checked it out in photoshop and it is indeed invisible by default
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Go to preferences -> Transparency and Gamut and change your checker to Dark
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you'll see it
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> oh goddamn yeah
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/936273828315820102/unknown.png
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> way more visible
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thanks <a:WidePeepoHappySparklingHeart:588486777073827850>
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Isn't it just the lighter rings on the inside of the circle, and in general lighter shading on the outside? You can clearly see in the original photo he sent
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/936273925774639144/unknown.png
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yeah its probably too faint of a blue so it appears as white, ive had the most trouble making the blue one since selecting the outer rign and the inside for 2 different transparencies was very weird for this one for some reason
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> so i did a horrible job on it
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Setting modern graphics to on should do that
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> but on white grid you cant see that its bad
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @bencie I'd probably make one greyscale and get the transparency right, then I'd hue shift to get the final rings
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i'll do that for future skins, i find it easier to fix these than to redo it ^^
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thanks for the help again
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> :)
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u have to drag it onto dilate.exe
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i did
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > i dilated it but that didnt fix the issue.
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh isee
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/lto-tape-backups-for-linux-nerds
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt know this existed
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30099540
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You didn't know tape existed? üòÑ
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this lto thing looks like "new technology"
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk atleast thats what it looks like from reading the blog xd
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > If you are planning to use your tapes for long term archiving tapes supposedly have a 30 year life (obviously no LTO tape has been around 30 years to verify this claim),
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Linear Tape-Open (LTO) is a magnetic tape data storage technology originally developed in the late 1990s as an open standards alternative to the proprietary magnetic tape formats that were available at the time
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LTO has been around since forever
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only since 90's
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LTO-9 came out last year, maybe that's what the blog is about
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean lto-8
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the first comment in hn mentions rust
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon we will take over everything
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interesting, 9 is out too, I wonder why the author says 8 is the latest available at the time of writing
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> posts about hard drive stuff always brings out the old ppl talking about their floppy disks
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda funny

20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Do you know what FakeSnap function is used for?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For the 64 player support for older clients
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we talked about it last time
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this sends a faked player with the last possible id (15) with empty names, which is used to send chat messages of players that are not in "your list"
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Ok, i didn't know the function name.
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Now i understand better, thank you
