00:30 < bridge_> <animepdf> @robyt3 Hi, your [Fix map downloading overriding more recent map change messages](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/05970178b285fa798d1905b792a3b9a4c8c33771>) commit broke map downloading from community servers, if they don't have http map download support, it basically doesn't try to request it the old way
00:35 < bridge_> <animepdf> after few tweaks it turned out to be because of new `CClient::ResetMapDownload` and it's missing call on `src\engine\client\client.cpp:1562`
00:38 < bridge_> <animepdf> Okay, it breaks on *some* servers, you can test it on my `Anily` servers, it was firstly reported there ü•π

15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 which one do you think makes more sense?
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ```c
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> 500 + (255 + 1)
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> 
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> (u16)500 + (u16)((u8)255 + (u8)1)
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> (u16)500 + (u16)((u16)255 + (u16)1)
15:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ```
15:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Mh, your literals are of the smallest type that fits them?
15:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> they currently are
15:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but I wrote a code which does 2nd option
15:19 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and I wanna know if it makes sense xd
15:20 < bridge_> <learath2> I wouldn't promote results that overflow
15:20 < bridge_> <learath2> So u8 + u8 = u8
15:21 < bridge_> <learath2> And I would promote results to the larger of unbalanced types
15:21 < bridge_> <learath2> u16 + u8 = u16
15:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Though this is just a quick thought, you usually need to think about these things a bit üòÑ
15:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Thinking for nerds, I do first and then wonder why the hell it gives me wrong mafs
15:22 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Thinking for nerds, I do first and then wonder why the hell it gives me wrong mafs results
15:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Thinking for people who is smort, I do first and then wonder why the hell it gives me wrong mafs results
15:42 < bridge_> <yuphio> I have heard many USA players complaining that the previously stable USA3 servers are "being ddossed by Russian players/bots" due to some popular online video or something. I have noticed that the USA3 servers are very unstable recently, with high ping spikes several times per hour. Is there anything we can do to prevent this? Such as blacklisting all Russian connections from joining the USA3 servers?
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sure, call the NSA and ask them to block all russian internet traffic, lmao
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it's a real ddos, then you can only upgrade the server ig (or if you have access to the filter, you can fine tune that)
15:44 < bridge_> <jxsl13> geo blocking
15:44 < bridge_> <jxsl13> is what is meant here
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> First of all, it's a claim. Maybe the servers are attacked by smth else.
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. What kind of block should that be?
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Blocking IPs inside the DDNet server does basically nothing against lags
15:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except they found a bug in the server code that causes massive spam of some ingame events
15:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> same as what von blocking does
15:47 < bridge_> <jxsl13> vpn
15:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vpn blocking is not for ddos protection
15:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's for moderation purposes
15:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The fact that the server responds with "You have a VPN" already shows that the VPN isn't actually blocked
15:48 < bridge_> <jxsl13> do it on firewall level dunno. I'm not really a friend of geo blocking. just intepreting the request.
15:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The only effective way would be to block it at the ddos filter
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So firewall, only if it's somehow connected to the backbone
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> otherwise a software firewall will probs not help
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1280525548929421414/image_from_ios.png?ex=66d865d9&is=66d71459&hm=c18223e3da042e33daec22e29f7f1ce34653669f4d13cf0150ea979aa5fe20e2&
15:57 < bridge_> <learath2> The attacks aren't coming from russia even if the attackers are allegedly russian
15:57 < bridge_> <learath2> The first d in ddos is "distributed" it's usually from all over the world

16:34 < bridge_> <jxsl13> probably forgotten
16:59 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> wt
17:02 < bridge_> <forgottenabscat> maybe i catch a fever?
17:30 < bridge_> <zhn> who knows
17:45 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ipv6 is crying intensely - why?
17:45 < bridge_> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1280554179592585276/image.png?ex=66d88083&is=66d72f03&hm=f850807b0b565cfbc9e2e58935d8c301804f0fc6a3c8b006c246a533b29977ea&
17:48 < bridge_> <0xdeen> You might not have an ipv6 connection
17:48 < bridge_> <0xdeen> You can disable it with `sv_ipv4only 1`
17:50 < bridge_> <melo∆û> fair - i just find it odd that libcurl keeps on trying after a "failed to connect to host" error
17:51 < bridge_> <0xdeen> We keep restarting it. There is no way for us to know if your internet is down temporarily or permanently
17:51 < bridge_> <0xdeen> If temp. you wouldn't want to stop
17:54 < bridge_> <melo∆û> also fair :P - one more question - why is my server not respecting the rcon set within autoexec_server.cfg/myServerconfig.cfg ? `ddnet  | 2024-09-03 15:47:56 I server: | rcon password: '3cjRpV' `
17:54 < bridge_> <melo∆û> it generates it for me even tho
17:54 < bridge_> <melo∆û> `sv_rcon_password "test"` exists
17:54 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 99.9% a me issue - just curious as to why
17:55 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Probably it takes the autoexec_server.cfg only from data directory
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ah i should've specified i'm using docker:
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ```
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> version: '3.9'
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û> services:
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û>   ddnet:
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û>     build:
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û>       context: ./
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û>       dockerfile: Dockerfile
17:57 < bridge_> <melo∆û>     container_name: ddnet
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û>     volumes:
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û>       - ./data:/ddnet/data
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û>     ports:
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û>       - 8303:8303/udp
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ```
17:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û> it respects autoexec_server.cfg within the data directory - it's copied properly and it also reads myServerconfig.cfg and respects it - except for the rcon password
18:02 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Huh, no idea. That always worked for me
18:03 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Why is it printed out? I'm not getting that output
18:03 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Ah, that's the auto-generated one
18:03 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Try moving the sv_rcon_password higher in the file
18:11 < bridge_> <melo∆û> :monkaS: why did that work - thanks i guess :kek: - still weird tbh
18:20 < bridge_> <0xdeen> My guess is it has to be before the map definition
