00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Awesome
00:48 < Index> Hi everyone! I'm working on a small feature in the character.cpp file where I need to detect if the player is near a freeze tile. However, I'm running into an issue where the constants TILE_FREEZE, TILE_LFREEZE, and TILE_RFREEZE are undefined.  Could anyone point me to where these constants are defined, or let me know which header file I should include to access them? If these constants don't exist, is there a recommended way to check
00:50 < bridge> <totar> any this feature is?
00:50 < bridge> <totar> and this feature is?
00:52 < Index> well I'm working on a feature to help improve movement handling in tricky situations, especially when players are near hazardous tiles like freeze tiles. The goal is to better understand how to manage player positioning and avoid common pitfalls that can occur when players get too close to these tiles. It's more of a learning exercise to enhance my understanding of the game's collision system and player mechanics.

02:45 < bridge> <totar> tbh if he cannot figure out where the header file is then I think he is a long way from making a gores bot so I am not worried
02:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
02:46 < bridge> <Ewan> I dislike botters & fake ranks as much as the next guy but I'm not going to withhold information based on their intent. it's oddly hypocritical that this happens at all considering DDNet is an open source project
02:47 < bridge> <nouaa> @totar give me your TAS algorithm, I promise not to cheat, *It's more of a learning exercise to enhance my understanding of the game's collision system and player mechanics.*
02:47 < bridge> <totar> lol
02:48 < bridge> <totar> I could describe it in detail and I don't think you in particular would put in the effort to implement it but I think someone watching this chat might
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> can't it be that?
02:48 < bridge> <louis> send tas algorithm and i send back better tas algorithm. deal? yes? thank you, awaiting response!
02:48 < bridge> <nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/business-man-leon-short-gif-21636355
02:50 < bridge> <totar> tbh I think that most of the people coming in here to ask beginner questions that are sometimes obviously about making a bot are not really a threat, since they will need to figure out like 100 more things on their own. Which if they could do they wouldn't have asked the beginner question in the first place.
02:52 < bridge> <totar> there are some things that shouldn't be answered but obviously I'm not going to list those
02:52 < Index> how do you handle optimizing frame perfect actions while ensuring minimal input lag and maintaining consistent performance?
02:53 < bridge> <totar> this is a significantly more sus question
02:53 < Index_> just some beginner questions..
02:53 < bridge> <totar> the answer is in the freeze header file, I promise
02:53 < bridge> <totar> it's spelled out there
02:53 < bridge> <totar> in high detail
02:54 < bridge> <louis> To optimize frame-perfect actions with minimal input lag, implement high-frequency input sampling with precise timestamps to align inputs with game states accurately. Use predictive algorithms to anticipate future states, and maintain a short input buffer for timely execution. Synchronize input handling with frame rendering for consistent performance.
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> thank you
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Index: ghat gpt is doing u more harm than good
02:55 < bridge> <totar> completely correct, thank you for that insight
02:55 < bridge> <louis> Index_: just apply what i wrote to the ddnet codebase and you should be set
02:55 < Index_> Got it, thanks! How do you handle the trade-off between high-frequency input sampling and potential performance overhead, especially in terms of CPU usage and memory constraints?
02:56 < bridge> <totar> you can do input sampling on the gpu for high performance
02:59 < bridge> <nouaa> ah, the classic conundrum! When faced with the trade-off between high-frequency input sampling and performance overhead, I always recommend starting with a cup of coffee brewed from beans that have been serenaded by a choir of alpacas under a full moon. Then, set your computer's clock to run backward at exactly 3.14 times the speed of light. This will confuse the CPU into thinking it’s on vacation in the Bahamas, drastically reducing its workload. 
07:51 < bridge> <teero777> Is there a name for a minor edge case that requires changing the whole codebase?

08:18 < bridge> <learath2> Hi guys. I found this amazing game last night and wanted to contribute. Does anyone know where in the source code is input handled? I want to add a small feature to enhance both my understanding of the codebase and the user experience. There is this hazardous tile called "freeze" (as I'm sure you know). I would like to manipulate the input in a certain way to make it more streamlined to avoid these kinds of hazardous tiles
08:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Have you ever written tree-sitter parser? :DD
08:21 < bridge> <learath2> No, only ever modified one
08:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, maximum size is currently 16 KiB
08:40 < bridge> <reitw> Lmao Itube evolved from being a fake dev to a beginner trying to make a bot :KEKSad:

09:50 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what that is but it looks cool 😄
09:51 < bridge> <learath2> Ah a bar
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```go
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> package main
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> type Foo[T any] struct {
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     Key T

09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
09:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is there a way to make it work? :thonk:
09:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> In anyfunc, you want T Not any
10:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> eg(`func AnyFunc(args Foo[T])`)
10:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> eg `func AnyFunc(args Foo[T])`
10:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> Why are you writing Go @milkeeycat :gigachad:

10:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I write in golang at work
10:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
10:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> Did that atleast answer your question Milky ? :harold:  i'm still learning
10:09 < bridge> <learath2> I will tell you how to make it work as soon as I understand what you are trying to do 😄
10:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye, it juust has to be `func AnyFunc[T any](args Foo[T]) {`
10:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ah generic
10:11 < bridge> <learath2> You've successfully confused me. What is this?

10:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nvm, i threw that idea in garbage can 10 mins ago xd
10:12 < bridge> <learath2> Ah I see the issue now, yeah that doesn't work
10:14 < bridge> <learath2> Sleep time
10:15 < bridge> <learath2> btw, the answer to "is there a way to make it work" is almost always yes in go. Just do the type checking at runtime with `reflect` 😄
10:15 < bridge> <Ewan> I hate interne outage
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that shit better be faster
10:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i don't want to touch reflect anymore :justatest:
10:20 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/learath2/go-struct2struct use my definitely production quality library for something rn

10:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think our current server browser ordering overemphasizes full servers
10:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps we could group servers that are roughly the same?
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. group all servers from the same community with the same map and gametype?
10:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not that interesting to me that there are 13 ddnet servers within my ping range that offer multeasymap
10:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with >40 players each
10:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps we could even add a "players recently joined this server, maybe join them" selection of servers?

12:06 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
12:08 < bridge> <itom6176> What about a "Quicksearch" option in the starting screen? So you can decide which difficulty and gamemode and automatically join a server. Preferred with a good ping and players on it.(Dunno how much work that would be just an idea)

13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ got the github mobile notification from rossbit xd
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see, when i want smth from you. directly ping on github
14:01 < bridge> <tuskakt4overhaven> how to lower ping?
14:03 < bridge> <manikoo> buy better internet
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> buy some server space where our servers are hosted and then build a house inside
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes usually works well @Jupstar ✪ you can do so here for example xd https://github.com/ChillerDragon/github-meta/issues/5 if its not related to any issue
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good idea. directly ping random ppl too
14:23 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks
14:24 < bridge> <reitw> hey, was there any changes regarding ddnet master ?
14:24 < bridge> <reitw> master4 ig
14:24 < bridge> <reitw> seems like our server can't register anymore
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 anything new?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is your payload too huge?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hi tha real 2
14:29 < bridge> <reitw> no clue, also masterping doesnt work on master1 anymore
14:29 < bridge> <reitw> ```
14:29 < bridge> <reitw> # ./masterping ipv4 https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/register
14:29 < bridge> <reitw> Error: couldn't receive ping from mastersrv in time

14:29 < bridge> <reitw> ```
14:30 < bridge> <learath2> Any error?
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u ping master1.ddnet.org?
14:30 < bridge> <reitw> nothing more than that
14:30 < bridge> <reitw> it's behind cloudflare so
14:30 < bridge> <reitw> would work
14:30 < bridge> <reitw> yup
14:53 < bridge> <reitw> have no response from master4 sadly
14:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wrong :santatrollet:
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> legend
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao tha real 2 how did I never see that xd
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:nekospin:1039804721378111548>
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not as far as I know
17:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> The same thing happened on a few of our servers, hoster claims they weren't blocking. I changed /etc/hosts to another cloudflare ip and it worked
17:04 < bridge> <0xdeen> On Cloudflare side also nothing seemd blocked
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> not enough iterations 🙃
17:07 < bridge> <louis> i agree
17:07 < bridge> <louis> also is there a way to search for only empty servers?
17:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I tihnk this is different, this is the UDP packet not getting through, not the HTTPS/TCP stuff
17:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem is that master4 died
17:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> master4.teeworlds.com
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (also known as master.ddnet.org)
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's the UDP 0.6 masterserver
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't fix it right now, but someone™ should
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> AH, it's not the http master that died
17:43 < bridge> <reitw> Yea I was unclear, our server is vanilla based,
17:43 < bridge> <reitw> But the output shared before is still another problem I need to check (I use masterping aswell)
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think we need more voice channels xd
17:47 < bridge> <manikoo> we need ingame vc
18:20 < bridge> <0xdeen> @reitw works again?
18:20 < bridge> <0xdeen> What happened is that we have more than 64 KB of a json and our buffer size was too small 😄
18:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> And I never touched this twmaster before so took me a while, I hope I did things correctly
18:23 < bridge> <reitw> @0xdeen apparently it's visible ( @blaiszephyr confirmed it)
18:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> ( i did indeed )
18:23 < bridge> <reitw> Thank you

18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also the video is really pixelated for me
18:31 < bridge> <zhn> i tried to something similar to tdtw one
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> almost cant see it

18:37 < bridge> <zhn> nah i like that feet
18:37 < bridge> <teero777> i don't
18:37 < bridge> <zhn> its 0.15 angle offset
18:37 < bridge> <zhn> pretty good lookin

18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does the jittery depend on the velocity of the tee?
18:59 < bridge> <zhn> yup
18:59 < bridge> <zhn> on length of velocity vector
18:59 < bridge> <zhn> previously it was dependent only on Vel.y
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not being used to it it looks cursed for me tho 😄
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like your tee has a mental breakdown
19:01 < bridge> <zhn> ye they're literally scared of their own speed
19:05 < bridge> <zhn> im introduced new inter-state variable to know how long tee is being in the air
19:05 < bridge> <zhn> looks ugly imo
19:05 < bridge> <zhn> im missing some essentials for it to not look weird xd
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to hear wind sound too
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and add some air stripes that make the tee look fast
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it could by epyc
19:08 < bridge> <zhn> maybe i can introduce some kind of feet position offset that controlled by velocity
19:08 < bridge> <zhn> i don't really know how air stripes could be implemented in a sane way

19:09 < bridge> <zhn> what about skid particles to appear on tee ground touch that's (wow) controlled by velocity too

22:50 < bridge> <louis> i think this is how the acrual game works too no!
22:51 < bridge> <louis> i think this is how the acrual game works too no?
22:51 < bridge> <louis> since when u jump your speed is overall higher so your ramp is higher -> horizontal speed decreases
22:51 < bridge> <louis> ramp is so confusing though so i'm not certain
23:24 < bridge> <yrrr_> when you walk on the ground your speed shows as constant and when you jump it temporarily decreases and when you land it is the same as before
23:29 < bridge> <louis> ye thats cuz of ramp
23:32 < bridge> <yrrr_> you are right
23:32 < bridge> <yrrr_> i just read the move function properly
23:33 < bridge> <yrrr_> i thought the ramp function was applied a second time in hud.cpp
23:33 < bridge> <yrrr_> but the effective speed is only calculated temporarily in the CCharacterCore::Move() function
