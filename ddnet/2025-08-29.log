01:55 < bridge> <netsu_0741> yo noob
02:55 < bridge> <silkayttech> guys i use exit lag and i cant join to ant server,how to fix it
02:55 < bridge> <silkayttech> he say i use vpn
02:58 < chillerbot12> omagawd @chillerdragon I almost forgor to mind you about: make sure rossbit doesn‚Äôt break my baby
02:58 < bridge> <Ewan> don't use exitlag
02:59 < bridge> <silkayttech> too big ping
02:59 < bridge> <silkayttech> exit lag +- fix it
02:59 < bridge> <silkayttech> (
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> exitlag gets you flagged for vpn and won't let you log in
02:59 < bridge> <silkayttech> ohh
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe a different endpoint would help but i doubt it
03:00 < bridge> <silkayttech> i try this
03:00 < bridge> <silkayttech> and this dont help
03:00 < bridge> <silkayttech> ((
03:00 < bridge> <Ewan> which server are you playing on that gets you bad ping
03:01 < bridge> <silkayttech> ger-rus
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> obviously if u play on the ones closer to you then you should lag less
03:03 < bridge> <silkayttech> k i try
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> if exitlag was not on the VPN list it might help but there's never a guarantee
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> the idea is that they provide a dedicated route for ur connection that could be shorter or longer than whatever would normally be used
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's mostly marketing
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and if most/all of your ping is before the first exitlag hop then it won't help much/at all
06:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
06:51 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
08:29 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^.^
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like the abbr MADT
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> it sounds like ur mad
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just the multiple apic description table
11:49 < chillerbot12> Elo @ChillerDragon I just wanted to remind you that: merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10570
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 you mean because the `16` in the loop does not contain the greensward skin? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ce5fb497046f0ae182c4b6f86ccf0a6e9d1641d5/src/game/server/teeinfo.cpp#L127
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i may have forgotten to look at that
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i got the code from fokkonaut and tested that it looks good in both directions
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fokkonaut uses NUM_SKINS instead of magic 16 which does include the custom skins https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/aafdec69ca335fa4a6bb4fd1892d101989e2b0a5/src/game/server/teeinfo.h#L62
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/aafdec69ca335fa4a6bb4fd1892d101989e2b0a5/src/game/server/teeinfo.cpp#L180
11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the 16 was previously including all standard skins, but did not include greensward
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i trust his work so i assume this was an oversight on my end
11:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** should probably be fine to include. But i wonder what changes since it already works so good. 
11:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Alright, then I'll change it to a for-each loop
11:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I can test your pr in the end and then we are safe @robyt3 go refactor it all üöÄ
11:52 < bridge> <robyt3> üëç

12:50 < bridge> <Assa> the link is scuffed, I can't see it
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> GagHob: Error xD
12:52 < bridge> <Assa> best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
12:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the link is scuffed indeed and it may contain my gh credentials
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> how to integrate extension?
12:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa installing this is ez af btw. I am not planning to pushlish it
12:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which browser?
12:53 < chillerbot12> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: @chillerdragon I just wanted to remind you that: merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10570
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> foxy ofc
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** click around here
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** add addon developer something
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then clone the repo
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and when opening the addon select the manifest.json
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "Load temporary add-on" is the button
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its poc af btw but it kinda works xd
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> perfect, going to fork around and find out
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it uses your current gh session to talk to the api
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> what else does it do?
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you run out of free credentials and have to pay its not on me
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats it
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ChillerDragon/GagHob/blob/32ef859e879171fd3c783e5e95fff331e4058bb7/gaghob.js
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its 70 lines js
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I've seen, thats almost trivial
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yeah im 10x engineer like that
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> I might add some caching or something if this happens
13:04 < bridge> <Assa> it removes itself after restarting ff
13:10 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I either need to sign it or I need to install firefox developer edition for it to stay permanent
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ou thats annoying
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe you can zip it using the release.sh script and then install as non temporary somehow
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i can also look into that some day but today im a bit busy
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** heinrich spawned again so there is lots of stuff
14:34 < bridge> <kebscs> üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ
14:35 < bridge> <kebscs> So literally what I said
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> If hein doesn't like pr, he can close no matter what others think
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes hein is the bigwig
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> In that specific case there is no others that disagree tbh. As Jupstar said we wrote that guideline with exactly what he is complaining about in mind. 7-8 people concur'd that all new features need to be approved
15:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I would say its debatable
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** Yes issues are encouraged but closing a pr to open an issue is a different thing
15:30 < bridge> <kebscs> you might have selective hearing/reading
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> but he specifically said "I would generally not comment on implementation issues when I don't like"
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> and then close a pr in favor of an issue which as above wont ever get any comments
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> this isnt "features need to be approved" but vetoing everything one doesnt like
15:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea heinrich could also comment something like that in the pr "implementation is horrible but i wont even get into it because we first have to discuss if the feature is wanted and if so how exactly it should look like"
15:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and then the discussion happens
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> this is a community ran project, all contributors are volunteers
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> i really dislike how one person can veto everyone here, with which most contributors disagree
15:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but having heinrich helps to come to decisions when there are disagreements
15:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its not that dramatic what happend i would say. Also the contributor with the closed pr does not seem upset. @kebscs lets just carry on.
15:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** dictators are better than democracy
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> im seeing what happens when you ignore all the problems
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> maintainers, contributors leave
15:34 < bridge> <kebscs> playerbase goes down
15:34 < bridge> <kebscs> no new features
15:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i think contributor happiness can be optimized
15:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when ddice
15:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe one day i finish my maintainer reformal manifesto issue
15:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when ddIce
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> If that's the case why does it matter to anyone that we want it happening on an issue instead of a pr?
15:40 < bridge> <kebscs> but he wont ever comment that on an issue?
15:40 < bridge> <kebscs> youre really trolling
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> Everyday I wake up and wish that this project was an actual dictatorship or my personal project, just so I could remove you
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> Alas, we can't always get what we want
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> youre reading every other message, or only the messages you want to read and then get mad when anyone tries to correct you
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont want any harm and youre personally attacking me
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> when im just trying to explain the issue
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> Says the guy on a crusade trying to villify one of the maintainers
15:42 < bridge> <kebscs> you might be getting everything too personal
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> im complaining about the decision, not a person
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is such a chillerdragon thing to say xd
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> Is this the part where you weren't making it personal?
15:44 < bridge> <kebscs> that was an example as this is what the issue was about
15:44 < bridge> <kebscs> i have not seen other maintainers do that so i wont look into it that hard on a discord chat
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> We want feature discussions to happen completely separately from implementations. PRs are therefore not the correct place. It's not very complicated
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> üíÄ
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> cba explaining it for 3rd time
15:45 < bridge> <learath2> Dont
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i wont your ego doesnt allow you to read what others think
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> youre racing to only type your own opinion
15:46 < bridge> <kebscs> and wont take in consideration anything else
15:46 < bridge> <kebscs> and only quote selective messages
15:46 < bridge> <kebscs> this isnt really a discussion but you jumping in front of everyone to type what you think
15:47 < bridge> <melon> didnt learath state that 7-8 people (assumingly maintainers) agreed to what he just said
15:47 < bridge> <melon> but ig i'm glazing again :Pepega:
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> where are they
15:47 < bridge> <01000111g> Anyone knows how to find out which utf8 emojis are displayable in ddnet?
15:47 < bridge> <01000111g> Anyone knows how to find out which utf8 emojis are displayable in ddnet? (for player names, chat etc)
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> You don't want consideration. You want people to agree with you unconditionally.
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> I don't know what to tell you, we want discussions in issues. Maybe the guideline was not worded exactly as you like. But that's the intention
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> the issue only has comments and reactions from other contributors
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> if im wrong please explain it to me instead of attacking me
15:48 < bridge> <kebscs> if you ignore the points i make, i wont be able to understand
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, would you like me to reply to any specific point?
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> The summary is pretty much Jupstars comment. The guideline was added for what he said. These PRs we just don't really want created in the first place
15:51 < bridge> <kebscs> this i agree with, but just say specifically that you dont want the feature, and not move it into issue where it wont be discussed
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Not really any easy way, I had a small python script for it lemme see if I can find it for you
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> closing pr for an limbo issue is what i didnt like
15:52 < bridge> <melon> (what doess limbo issue mean)
15:52 < bridge> <melon> (what does limbo issue mean)
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> where noone replies and it just gets lost
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> and theres 800 issues
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> and theres 792 issues
15:53 < bridge> <melon> aah `in limbo`
15:53 < bridge> <melon> aah `in limbo` (googled it)
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> Would you have preferred if one of us just closed it with "wontfix" and not even allowed further discussion somewhere else?
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> well ig thats worse
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> So is the problem that issues have worse visibility?
15:56 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> So is the problem that issues have worse visibility than PRs?
15:57 < bridge> <kebscs> would love if you commented on some issues, even small remarks
15:57 < bridge> <kebscs> would be way more pleasant
15:57 < bridge> <melon> isnt that just.. a harsh way of putting pressure on maintainers?
15:58 < bridge> <melon> i mean - if a PR goes stale it puts work in 2 directions, the maintainer having to bring it up to standard, and the PR maker who has to rebase/change the code
15:58 < bridge> <melon> issues not getting as much attention as wanted isnt something a PR with `use this as a place for discussion` will fix
15:58 < bridge> <melon> it'll just annoy both ends
15:59 < bridge> <kebscs> if someone's happy to make a pr he probably wont care about rebasing
15:59 < bridge> <kebscs> and prs usually get more comments
16:00 < bridge> <kebscs> could be the urgency for a maintainer to comment, otherwise it'll get merged with bad changes
16:00 < bridge> <kebscs> issues just get lost
16:04 < bridge> <melon> i mean, are there any issues you consider "lost" ?
16:04 < bridge> <melon> 
16:04 < bridge> <melon> issues are a pool of things with certain urgency, if an issue gets `lost` its not really the maintainers fault is it?
16:06 < bridge> <melon> IMO a maintainers "job" isn't to crawl through all existing issues and commenting on them, we have tags to filter them by and urgency is determined by that
16:06 < bridge> <melon> i.e a `crash` or `bug` gets more attention faster than a feature request
16:07 < bridge> <melon> see this for example:
16:07 < bridge> <melon> 
16:07 < bridge> <melon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7556
16:07 < bridge> <melon> 
16:07 < bridge> <melon> no issue was made, 1.4K LOC implementation of a pretty great feature - but it became idle because it was huge with no prior discussion
16:08 < bridge> <melon> see this for example:
16:08 < bridge> <melon> 
16:08 < bridge> <melon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7556
16:08 < bridge> <melon> 
16:08 < bridge> <melon> no issue was made, 1.4K LOC implementation of a pretty great feature - but it became idle because it was huge with no "proper" prior discussion
16:08 < bridge> <kebscs> yea more issues could be labeled, so at least theyre acknowledged they exist
16:08 < bridge> <melon> see this for example:
16:08 < bridge> <melon> 
16:08 < bridge> <melon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7556
16:08 < bridge> <melon> 
16:08 < bridge> <melon> 1.4K LOC implementation of a pretty great feature - but it became idle because it was huge with no "proper" prior discussion
16:08 < bridge> <kebscs> idk, the discussion could have happened in the pr
16:09 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why noone replied to it
16:09 < bridge> <melon> it changed the defaults of binds, one of the strongest tools of the client as well as graphical changes
16:09 < bridge> <melon> people looked at it and were like "oh boy this ones heavy"
16:10 < bridge> <kebscs> see, this could have been typed in the pr
16:10 < bridge> <kebscs> and would be nice to everyone
16:23 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 60 chillerdragon why not merge #10570, it's already approved x 3 and Zwelf answered a teehistorian update is not necessary

20:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GitHub mobile for ios commit comment support is hilarious. You get a notification and see the message in the preview but if you click to see the comments you see just the diff and nothing else. Been like that since I can remember. How does Trillion dollar bill gates not fix this
20:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are there even any iOS GitHub app enjoyers in the chat?
20:31 < bridge> <learath2> Android github app is so busted. Comments just appear out of order and stuff
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> iOS app isn't great either
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> there's just too much to present correctly in a mobile interface imo

20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> how u faring guys
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 2 beers and its friday
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> gonna sabour them slowly
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> saber somewhat makes sense here
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you cant saber a glass bottle slowly though
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its funny imagining you trying
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> sabour
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> is the word wrong
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `A sabre or saber is a type of backsword with a curved blade associated with the light cavalry of the early modern and Napoleonic periods.`
20:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do not know of a word "sabour"
20:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i pressume you actually meant "savour"
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> savour

21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> it arrives monday
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: the irc lib u are using is unmaintained
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> just make ur own from scratch
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> ez
21:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> do u know why irclogs have a trailing whitespace in them?
21:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> deen doesnt
21:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1411066190989889630/image.png?ex=68b34d4c&is=68b1fbcc&hm=af1b452dfe241f02351b157cff0b9f128ba9f4432fd363850b01bb09877ad8cb&
21:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i guess its a feature
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought I switched to a maintained fork
21:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> At some point
21:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn‚Äôt trailing at the end? Your screenshot looks like the start of messages? I‚Äôm confused.
21:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah that's a leading whitespace my guy
21:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> chillerdragon is correct
21:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The screenshot you showed shows that ddnet is gigachad because he has @ prefix. In irc your ‚Äûroles‚Äú can be a single letter prefix like @ or + and so on I assume the plebes that don‚Äôt have any get a space instead for epic ascii alignment
21:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> omg my phone corrected deen to ddnet gg?
21:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> deen = ddnet
21:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fair
21:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :deen_star:
21:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The screenshot you showed shows that deen is gigachad because he has @ prefix. In irc your ‚Äûroles‚Äú can be a single letter prefix like @ or + and so on I assume the plebes that don‚Äôt have any get a space instead for epic ascii alignment
21:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> in my defense, it's trailing after the character `<`
21:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> xd
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> deedeenet
21:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In case someone forgot the scoring for CTF here are the docs https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=ctf_scoring
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This looks funny somehow xd
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I doubt after all these years anyone ever found these docs useful haha
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who is this for?
21:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> accessibility for the blind people
21:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine sending a nitpick comment on the pr that implemented LMS gamemode that it should also update docs for scoring xxxxD
21:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Missed opportunity for trolling
21:37 < bridge> <filoqcus> Good evening! I wanted to set up a server and allow access only to certain IP addresses via iptables as a replacement for a ‚Äúwhitelist,‚Äù as advised by ChillerDragon, but now I can't register my server. Which IP addresses do I need to allow so that the server can register on the master servers?:omo:
21:44 < bridge> <filoqcus> I tried to get an IP address like this:
