08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We really need a solution for the votebot problem. Any good ideas?
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe we should extend the veto to kick and spec votes?
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At the risk of ending up with a bunch of guys blocking everyone in the middle of the map
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> As a little step maybe that kickvotes run til the time ends and not pass when 50% f3 or f4, not being able to vote in running kickvotes when joining or a delay anyways of being part in votes after joining. That doesnt fix the problem but gives more time to react.
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Maybe there is also a way to automatically detect that a vote passed by votebot and the server turns off kickvotes automatically then?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> So we dont see like on Sunday The whole server being kicked
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that only helps if a mod is on, doesn't it?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Doesn't it help if you can't vote the first 5 min after joining a map?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> If someone sees a lot of tees joining and they wait 5 min, someone can call a mod in the meantime.

10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> All we need is time
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There's now a 5 minute delay for anyone to start or participate in a vote
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Let's hope that's enough
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Only for vote kicks or also mapvotes?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map votes have some special rule that allows you to vote if the server was empty before
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can try it out and report back if it doesn't work as expected
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen for mapvotes its not needed because of veto, the vote botter tried to change The map but wasnt possible.
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I hope you also made the server know that he dont have to "wait" for the new joined players to vote xD
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but i think u did
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I personally would do some nooby hacky fix that detects fishy behavious like a bunch of numbernames joing at the same time and blocking them from voting hehe. But that doesn't work with an smart attacker -.-
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wasn't there a delay after join you have to wait before you can vote? Imo that is very effective because the vote bots don't stay on the server normally they are just connected to vote.
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The attacker would just make his bots more player like i guess ^^
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> as you can see there now is a delay to be part in kickvotes after joining
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah k
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon  sad life (smart attacker)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon  btw the function is already included
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> since long time
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> never saw it abusesd btw
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but also not used xd
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because you’re locked out of modhelp channel
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah true xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why :c
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because it’s only spammed with troll shit
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you lock m eout because i cant hanlde spam xd?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i didnt see it ingame either and i am mostly on the servers with the most players
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s not really used frequently
