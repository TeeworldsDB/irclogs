01:09 < bridge> <ReiTW> not only univ/schools, everything that is research related, for education purpose yes
12:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Jupeyy_Keks Is there something else you wanted to know or test for #6369 or can we merge it?
12:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6369
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess we can merge
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen ddnet should work with libx11 1.8.4 right?
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for some reason the ebuild in gentoo had <=1.8.2
14:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk why
14:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does it even need libx11 dep
14:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081936580685602936/image.png
14:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why a gdk dep
14:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk who made this before haha
14:51 < bridge> <deen> seems weird
14:52 < bridge> <deen> especially for server
14:52 < bridge> <deen> pnglite also wrong
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this was initially done by a non ddnet dev i guess
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> libpng is only needed on client right
14:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we also dont use libglvnd, a lib from nvidia lol
14:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nor glib
15:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> LICENSE="CC-BY-SA-3.0 OFL-1.1 BSD"
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do we use ofl?
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah looks like a font license
15:01 < bridge> <deen> see all our license.txt files for the mess we have
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> good that jopster is a lawayer
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wtf
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki the rust gang attacks
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is github bot
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> disable it or smth xd
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its funny bcs it even can add labels xD
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ohhh
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so the json
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> was the color
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xddd
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> color -> "color"
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah xD
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u test the cargo update with a old rust
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think we need to be compat with debian version or smth
17:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> debian 10 has 1.41
17:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rustup install 1.41
17:02 < bridge> <deen> no
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `rust-toolchain.toml`
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> [toolchain]
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> channel = "1.41.0"
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u crate a file with that it will set it to that
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so its easier for new devs
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file
17:06 < bridge> <Iza> is the 16.8 update released on steam yet?
17:10 < bridge> <deen> Yes
17:10 < bridge> <deen> Is something wrong with it or why do you ask?
17:11 < bridge> <deen> If you are on nightly, you only get it in a few hours, but not relevant changes in there for client
17:11 < bridge> <Iza> Ah okay
17:11 < bridge> <Iza> Moderational reasons
17:12 < bridge> <Learath2> God forgive me for I have installer proprietary shitware on my computer ðŸ˜­
17:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ban all old versions!
17:12 < bridge> <deen> nvidia driver? ðŸ˜„
17:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Well that's not shitware ðŸ˜›
17:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> discord?
17:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Nah, MATLAB and Mathematica
17:14 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm using the web version of discord on linux because for some reason the desktop version is very slow and I cba to debug it
17:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Use matlab Web too then
17:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Doesn't have the control systems toolbox
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk matlab but just build one your self hehe
17:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Make it a browser extension
17:17 < bridge> <Learath2> How would I build proprietary software myself?
17:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah toolbox sounded like a button but I guess itâ€™s more \:D
17:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea sounds like work
17:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You screwed then
17:18 < bridge> <Chairn> are you doing some automatism theory?
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also use web on linux
17:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Automatic control, last boss of engineering course
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with my self compiled firefox it runs better
17:29 < bridge> <Chairn> not my best memory either ðŸ˜„
17:29 < bridge> <Chairn> well, linear control is fine, non linear one on the other hand...
17:29 < bridge> <Chairn> way too advanced mathematical stuff
17:30 < bridge> <Chairn> when rust browser?
17:30 < bridge> <Chairn> oh stupid me, firefox is rust already
17:30 < bridge> <Chairn> but is it 100% rust?
19:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can do most of the stuff on the stack, I tried doing that in libtw2 for the most part. you lose out on some of the niceties of rust though
19:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> php's memory leaks are no problem because you can just restart apache every 10 requests, you know?
19:55 < bridge> <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
19:55 < bridge> <Learath2> The web version is all js
19:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Rasmus_Lerdorf&oldid=3062755
19:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > I'm not a real programmer. I throw together things until it works then I move on. The real programmers will say "Yeah it works but you're leaking memory everywhere. Perhaps we should fix that." Iâ€™ll just restart Apache every 10 requests.
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> No
20:47 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> I'd love to see a bunch of skin color presets you could save (you can already bind them but it's not so convenient). Is it relevant tho?
20:48 < bridge> <Iza> i requested that long ago but the devs don't see that as importent tho i assume
20:49 < bridge> <Iza> we could just steal the profile selector from tater client tho
20:49 < bridge> <Iza> i requested that long ago but the devs don't see that as important tho i assume
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can also create skins as .cfg
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and execute them
20:51 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Ha, true
20:52 < bridge> <Iza> it still is like 1000x more inconvenient than just having a plain simple profile selector
20:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the plain simple profile selector is something that will make the options tab more complicated for new users. it's also code that needs to be maintained
20:53 < bridge> <Iza> do we assume that new users have an average iq of 70 or am i missing something?
20:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's not the problem
20:53 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> They kinda do
20:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem is that I don't want to open a program and be shown a lot of irrelevant options at first
20:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I want to see the ones I'm likely to change
20:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if calling me IQ 70 helps you, I guess do that?
20:55 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Not really the point but why HSL is not 360 instead of 255?
20:55 < bridge> <Iza> I don't know about you but i am certain that alot of users will find it relevant and are likely to create their own profiles for their need of personalisation
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's less than 10% of the users who'd do that
20:56 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Actually why is everything 255
20:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know, I also dislike that
20:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 255 likely comes from the fact that a byte can represent 256 different values
20:56 < bridge> <Iza> why not ask the people?
20:57 < bridge> <Iza> or just implement it as a test and see what happens
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we implement something, we're lynched if we take it away
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also the problem with asking for features is that people always want more features
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they don't see the new user/code maintainability problem if it's "just one more feature"
20:58 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Honestly the amount of parameters is insane as fuck. You can tell this is a game of passionate devs. So to me your point doesn't work well
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, you're right
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they should be removed or presented in a better way
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "it's bad. no problem to make it worse" is not a slogan I abide to
20:59 < bridge> <Iza> i mean i totally get the point of maintainability but i do not stand behind this "make everything dumb simple for the new people" policy
20:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> am I allowed to make it simple for me?
21:00 < bridge> <Iza> since when is that your point?
21:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I, too, like simple software with good defaults
21:00 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> I actually like it very much like that. Some of them are too precise and not really relevant to the average player, but the most part are very cool to me
21:01 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> I think it is one of the strongest assets of the game behind gameplay
21:02 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Although it's a mess, I can't disagree about the shitty presentation
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wouldn't it be its open-source nature instead?
21:02 < bridge> <Iza> why shouldn't a profile selector be simple?
21:02 < bridge> <Iza> thats what i dont understand
21:02 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Ofc, I was focusing on in-game experience
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remember too complicated config dialogues from other games
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where you had to create profiles to change simple settings
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> instead of just be thrown at the configuration options
21:03 < bridge> <Iza> you don't have to do it like them
21:04 < bridge> <Iza> i would just like for a convenience feature that is self explanatory
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess the "simple profile selector" was too imprecise before
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that's the goal anytime
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do we make it a convenience feature that is self explanatory?
21:05 < bridge> <Iza> well the best thing i can refer to here now is to just look at the profile selector from taterclient
21:05 < bridge> <Iza> i think they did a solid job
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> got a screenshot?
21:05 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082031139818057808/image.png
21:05 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> something resembling this
21:05 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Is how I'd picture it
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not knowing the game, this looks horribly complicated. maybe it gets better if I knew the game
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
21:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the middle part is probably just selecting shapes
21:06 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Just the color part, yeah
21:06 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Up & bottom / feet & body
21:07 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> But instead of given colors you could set the one you want
21:11 < bridge> <Iza> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082032633703317615/image.png
21:11 < bridge> <Iza> i think that's pretty neat
21:14 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> I was picturing smth like that
21:14 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082033327629930617/idea.png
21:14 < bridge> <Iza> damn you got the same background as me
21:16 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> ^^
21:16 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Boxes of given/set colors you could select
21:17 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Something resembling this
21:18 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Too many selection boxes ðŸ˜ 
21:19 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> But yeah, it works too
21:20 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> ~~Too many selection boxes ðŸ˜ ~~ Actually I just find it ugly, no real point to make
21:38 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082039364156137572/idea.png
21:38 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> and so
21:38 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Clicking on a color box would open its dedicated HSL tab
21:39 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Clicking on a skin box would open its dedicated skin selection tab
21:39 < bridge> <Ravie> let's replace the useless prefix thing with presets :justatest:
21:39 < bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082039800753832087/preset.png
21:41 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> When you think about it, the default eyes boxes could work as presets along with what you said Ravie
21:41 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> When you think about it, the default eyes boxes could work as presets along with that Ravie
21:42 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Ravie
21:42 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> The default eyes boxes could work as presets along with that
21:43 < bridge> <Ravie> I mean you would just save all the current settings and then you can pick it from the dropdown list
21:43 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Yeah
21:50 < bridge> <Floral Strobe> Also thanks a lot to whoever implemented smooth scrolling today, my eyes finally stopped hurting
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd say if, we'd need to merge TEE and PLAYER tab
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082043327412711516/image.png
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else its confusing gui wise
21:56 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> eh i believe someday heinrich will not be so serious about custom options so i could request for parameter that changes skin box
21:57 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> 4 columns... is too much for my dead eye xd
21:58 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> also maybe ddnet should have favourite skins box instead of all skins cuz i don't think that player will change skin everyday xd
22:45 < bridge> <Iza> @heinrich5991 see? the people are in for this
22:46 < bridge> <Iza> just need to know how to implement it
23:01 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Can you guy explain this?
23:01 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1082060220777378013/screenshot_2023-03-05_23-00-12.png
23:01 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :pepedead:
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Replicate:
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> right click on the red rectangle 
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> press tab, while holding red rectangle
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> release rectangle, the option stuff don't disappear
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> hold the red rectangle again
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> press tab again for visibility
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> right click again
23:02 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> repeat from step 1
23:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @str I predicted that people are in favor of new features
23:50 < bridge> <Devinci> *freeze bar enters the chat*
23:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Devinci that would be this message
23:51 < bridge> <Learath2> How is windows a serious operating system?
23:52 < bridge> <Learath2> I had a usb with a corrupted partition table, no matter what tool I used windows couldn't just zero out the damn partition table and start over
23:52 < bridge> <Learath2> The partition table broke diskpart, made it completely unusable
23:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Booted into linux, `cfdisk -z` and it just worked. Not only that I could also just open it in `cfdisk` and read the broken partition table no problem
23:57 < bridge> <Learath2> The fact that they can demand money for this summer project level OS actually baffles me
