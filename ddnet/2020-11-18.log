00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ban reasons in other languages (ie arabic) do not show up correctly, is it fixable?
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Jupstar âœª @TsFreddie may know
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that needs harfbuzz and the unicode bidirectional algorithm probs
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u mean me

00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no its not the same issue that affects right-to-left text in tw chat
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its like
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is it
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> one of my mods tried to ban someone with arabic reason
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it showed up as nonsense ascii characters
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for the person who was banned
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm idk
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill get the screeny 1sec xd

00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ryozuki
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> why are you chicken soup
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im not
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> latest version right
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> macos nobo
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no thats old client, good point xd
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they use version 9
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u think it would work with newest
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try it
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 9 is sdl1
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly old
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ryozuki i tried with verison 10
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778401637466898472/unknown.png
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sdl2 but still no work
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> try with 15
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would u try with version 10
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cus
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its sdl2
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i dont have 15 on this comp
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ig ill download
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nope
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ryozuki
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778402319007875072/unknown.png
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> same thing xd
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> real reason = Ù„Ù„ØªØ¬Ø±Ø¨Ø©
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the server can understand the ban reason because it shows up correctly on the discord bot
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778404306830360636/unknown.png
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i guess the client doesnt display it correctly? or its not sent correctly by the server
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The devil is interfering with your illegal ban of a brother
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's sooo odd tho, hm I don't see how it could happen ðŸ˜›
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Learath2 lol, ye same, maybe the client is trying to decode it as ascii when its utf8?
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't look like it
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> is your character position always available when you /pause
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> like even when your camera goes out of range.
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not if you hack something in :D
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> /showall would work for example
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but only on ddnet
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i want a "You are here" arrow at the edge of the screenðŸ˜„
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> when you are pausing
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @noby do they work in chat?
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TsFreddie dont think thats possible in a good way
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The local character is not even set when you are pausing
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would maybe be possible to reach it through the snap array but then again it only works within the range or with /showall
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f8b07f705ef5b8f35d05511163ee54bec44cbae5/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1482
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> maybe we can change the range detect a bit and always include the current player's snap
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> /pause is a ddnet feature anyway.
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do I need to check anything special while doing virtual functions and base and child classes?
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If I call a function from the base class the overridden function wont get called
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont understand, because I did it basically the same way as entities do it in tw or the gamecontroller
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> are the parameters the same type? try adding override to the child class' function to get a compiler error if it isn't
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> parameters are the same, yes
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> class CFoo : public CBar
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> CFoo is the child, right?
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt give errors with override
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but also doesnt work :D
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, doesnt work
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont get it
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make a minimal example
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```c++
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> class CPerson
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> {
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   int m_Age;
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   virtual void SetAge(int Age) {};
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> }
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> class CWorker : public CPerson
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> {
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   virtual void SetAge(int Age) { m_Age = Age; }
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> }
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> something like this maybe? :D
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i also tried not declaring the CPerson's function without virtual, also doesnt owrk
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It's basically the same as teeworlds' CEntity stuff, but in my case the base classes function is called
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i checked that with a dbg msg
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, forgot in the example: of course i call the CPerson's function, so basically m_pPerson->SetAge(Age);
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You are supposed to actually try the minimal example to figure out the problem, and not leave that to me
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Works fine for me: https://gist.github.com/def-/2a748ad06913cf1ab39e4912fc1ca2f1
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh, doesnt work for me in the teeworlds code? ...
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf :D
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try making SetAge public
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> both is public for me
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in both classes
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If your minimal testcase works it's not a minimal testcase
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you maybe calling the function through a pointer to the baseclass?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is that a problem?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> CEntity does the same
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really, it's fine I just wanted a better image
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe you call `SetAge` in base class (`CPerson`) constructor?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you added override to the child class method and the compiler didn't complain?
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Comrade nope, calling it from CGameContext
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 yes
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and are you sure that `m_pPerson` is pointing to `CWorker` instance?
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you mean? :D
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its pointing to the CPerson class, calling a function, which i think should be overridden by the CWorkers function
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But appearently its just calling the CPersons function
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just show us a diff? I'm out of ideas, if it doesn't complain with override, it overrides correctly
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> well, it if points to `CPerson` object, then everything works as expected
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only thing that remains is that you are not creating a CWorker but a CPerson instead
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that could actually be it lmao
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah thanks alot man
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big lol
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> happens ðŸ˜„
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> haha :D
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> well, if it points to `CPerson` object, then everything works as expected
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Thanks, but how did you get that thought? xD
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well as I said, if override doesn't complain, then you are overriding correctly
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You said you have a pointer to CPersom
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you are not doing the call in a constructor
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the only thing that remains is that the pointer doesnt point to a CWorker at all :P
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aye
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Great, thanks alot
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut make the destructor virtual in ur base class
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to avoid problems
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the future
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-destructor/
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wont need a destructor, but yes, you are right
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur base class destructor is not virtual it will never get called
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur chiuld destructor wont get called*
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> child
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my english xd
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> @deen would be nice if you could ping @ChillerDragon in such an issue so i do get a mail and dont create a dupe https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3311 and next time i wont listen to heinrich :p
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a pr
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u made a issue
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its fine
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye true
10:05 <+ChillerDragon> im so brainded xd
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:06 <+ChillerDragon> still didnt see and a ping would be nice so i dont create a issue after the pr :D
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there pinged
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> ye githubs ping system is not as fleek as irc tho
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I assume people here see PRs. And heinrich explicitly told you to only create an issue if the problem stil occurs (that means in the current master state)
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> i looked at git history and did not see any fix cuz im blind
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> ja was fail
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> but pls use an @ if you do something that could interest em :)
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> me*

12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> reason=stars is broken as well
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> at least on CHN
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just tried on GER, not working
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have a fix open, but waiting for review
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: oh
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3319
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen in #3319 why does str find and endswith fix the issue even? I couldnâ€™t really make sense of it
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3319
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably because the command is no longer at the beginning of the vote command
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still just piling another hack onto the existing hack ^^
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait why?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how I imagine this works:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is at the start of a command now?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably something like `sv_reset_file solo.cfg`
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (note that this is still all speculation on my part, I haven't looked into it)
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, no really? ;D
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3317
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is kinda awful ngl, butI guess 3319 should still be merged in the meanwhile
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just an idea: if someone would port ninja indicator bar from 0.7 to DDNet codebase would it be merged?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean with both UI and netmessage support (didn't researched which is needed there)
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on good news, i already load them into memory @Pure_luck ðŸ˜„
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it should be ez to implement probably
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would like to see that yes, but I still think we should get upgradable netobjects before this
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Jupstar âœª you mean only GUI is needed and ninja start time is already got from netmessages/snapshots?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really donâ€™t want to start introducing things like ddnetcharacterv2
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess the data is already on the client, maybe you donâ€™t need any new netobject
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Pure_luck i dunno how 0.7 implemented them, but i added a few 0.7 sprite capabilities already
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> client data from 0.7
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Jupstar âœª yes
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the rendering of arabic characters in chat isnt entirely correct, but at least the characters show up and i hear they are readable
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> vs the ban reason where they are unreadable
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> send the arabic string pls
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i ban myself now to test xd
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> Ù„Ù„ØªØ¬Ø±Ø¨Ø©
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> str_sanitize_strong(aStr);
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but dunno what this does
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, it does that
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it mangles the string
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> who invented this function
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway its in CNetConnection::Feed
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if we want to fix it
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it being mangled in the client or the server
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> client
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should at least fix that it's being mangled instead of replaced by ??? or so
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is there a chance that it can be fixed so that messages appear the same in ban reason as they do in chat
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its a commit from matricks 9 years ago xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 11*
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got the screenshot again? @noby
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778401637466898472/unknown.png
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thanks
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > Wait, so do we want to just send any utf8 ban reason? I don't see any reason to limit it
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen yes that would be the best thing
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> awesome thx @deen :feelsamazingman:
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I found something odd
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I set gfx_opengl_major 2 and minor 3, which should probably break since that's not a real thing, but it launches fine, doesn't output anything about the opengl version it launched with and if you go into the console and just type `gfx_opengl_major` it crashes ðŸ˜›
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it clamps the values
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to existing GL versions, if major is < 4
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also cant reprod the crash :/
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt output anythign for SDLs default
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so 2.1
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do it with a clean config, I set opengl3.3 in the settings. I restart, I set major to 2, I restart. It crashes when I want to check the value of major
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> are u on release mode?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the release on ddnet.tw so probably yeah
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> linux?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> windows
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh, ok
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh it also broke my visual studio when I tried to attach it
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great platform this windings, I'm so glad a lot of people use it and provide it's parent company a monopoly
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cannot reprod on linux, so would be nice if u debug it, if u got time for it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes, the kind that disappears when you attach a debugger
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lovely
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well it could be a compiler bug ofc
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> asan and ubsan doesnt show anything for me
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's gone now, happened like 10 times in a row and now it's gone...
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another bug lost to time I guess
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did u try a clean config the last 10 times? xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the first 2 were dirty, then I reproduced it 8 times in a row with a clean config
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> reading the variable should be the same as any other config variable
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it could also just be unlucky timing
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> timing bugs are the most horrible
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> timing with the graphics thread?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or sound
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno what happens during startup
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> had atleast 2 persons under windows that had double sound once, unreproducable xD
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet benchmarks
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> soon every benchmarker uses them
17:03 <@deen> hm, some tests use binaries, some build from source. I guess building from source is better, so will do that
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meldon> after 20 minutes of gametime my client suddenly only outputs half the fps, and it starts showing. only fix is a client restart. known problem? sometimes changing to a server with fewer tees helps/delays it but not always
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what client version?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meldon> 15.0.3 i should update probably
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we had a bug in that version
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meldon> haven't  checked for new updates since it's not in the bottom anymore, thank you
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah we have a homescreen now, it should show a green symbol when there is news or update
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> top left in the server browser
20:59 < ____Khalim_> suka
23:46 <+pastaaa> wos kevin
