00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> can try also to run it tho, I'm on winshit
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> having the same
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same problem?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019369788834857040/unknown.png
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: no
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it must have windows specific hardware information, thus kind of ruins the program
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I tried it beforehand on gnome kde, didn't promise much
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can run wireshark natively on linux btw
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah, after messing around with wine, I figured that using a different engine did improve upon loading it
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but it looked horrificly ugly
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but it looked horrifically ugly
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not entirely sure what you're trying tbh
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can simply install wireshark like other programs on linux
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's in your package manager
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well, if it's that easy, then I must be doing something extremely wrong with handling windows apps on linux
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> cuz it never wants to work the way I want it to
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> (especially if I'm using Lutris, along with wine prefixes, it literally fucks my wine prefixes for ALL programs that I use Wine with)
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> (especially if I'm using Lutris, along with wine prefixes, it literally fucks my wine prefixes for ALL programs that I use Wine with, and it's not a bug on Lutris or Wine, I might just not know wtf am I doing with Wine)
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wireshark isn't a windows app, right?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wireshark is a normal cross-platform app like ddnet
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (as wireshark is a cross-platform app, it's also a windows app. but you shouldn't install the wireshark windows app on linux)
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> XD
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Sounds fair :happy:, sending it when I'm home again (around 2-4pm German timezone for you)
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Kinda sux, we checked yesterday and can't find out why
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> So it's time to install some Linux distribution... :zzzz:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ravie Senpai yes, windows only for gaming
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> overwise would have been on linux
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki `If you want to work on interesting problems using Rust professionally, you should consider working here at Discord.`
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> u have a certified Discord job
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most rust jobs want senior devs
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with years of c++ background
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Not sure if it was years ago, thats when I tried installing it on ubuntu
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> not i honestly not care for wireshark
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> now i honestly not care for wireshark
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes, like companies
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> who wants people with 3+ years of Carbon language experience :justatest:
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk why so much buzz about carbon
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust is better
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but one good reason to use Carbon over C++ ig
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Carbon has no men safety just good interop
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Carbon has no mem safety just good interop
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is only that Carbon might have a package/lib manager
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Even they recommend using rust
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> instead of messing with ur CMakeList etc..
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for me that's the only good reason
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C++ experience working* what you done in ur free time / open source work doesnt matter
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so in which company can u work with C++ without being rejected
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> cuz of 0 years in a company
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Proba none
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao tf
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They require a degree too often
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i never tried applying to any c++ job
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> imagine finding a job asking for HolyC years of experience
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I could just put that i worked at the company ddnet.org for 5 years with c++
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "charity work"
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig u could just do an internship in a company
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> prove your skills
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> & then easily apply
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I like money
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They never pay good
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> don't forget bc project :ReiTroll:
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> don't forget teeworlds bc project :ReiTroll:
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ho lol he left the discord
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Better
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah no
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> deletin, this can invoke some people
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> True
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Anyway i use rust for internal tools rn
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And i made a complete web app in rust  that the boss didnt know how to market in my prev small company
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So i already got some "real" xp with rust
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I try to convince someone to use Rust
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> he likes python & fastapi
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well fastapi is good aswell & also creates a documentation
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I don't know which Linux distribution could fit to my work, I need to dig deep into it
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That's a lie, at least it depends
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to get it to run on windows ðŸ™‚
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try it in a VM next
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Okay, can't wait to test it then, please keep me up to date :brownbear:

16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Hello guys <@&293541515781996568>, I am currently finishing my PhD and i thought you might be interested in the very first chapter which is about context on semiconductor industry, memory technologies, etc. It should be easily understandable (if i did my job correctly :)) for non technical people. Im taking any review you might have on the content but also on orthograph. Thanks
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019616501562626128/these.pdf
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Hello guys <@&293541515781996568>, I am currently finishing my PhD and i thought you might be interested in the very first chapter which is about context on semiconductor industry, memory technologies, etc. It should be easily understandable (if i did my job correctly ðŸ™‚ ) for non technical people.

16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't proofread french ðŸ˜„
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the second page starts with english
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, it's all in english obviously, its just that the doctoral school demand a french resume along with the abstract
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> remerciment is intended to be french?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> comments here or in DM? DM probably to not spam this channel?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as you wish ðŸ™‚
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think memory is uncountable, but you use it in plural many times
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. check https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/non-volatile_random_access_memory
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because it denotes a chip in general
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so there may be several memories
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with different technologies, integration, etc.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memory
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > memory (_countable_ and _uncountable_, plural memories)
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is a bit misleading because memory also means something else in english
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory, I do find a couple of "memories", so I retract my point
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk maybe we have a computer science student who natively speaks english in here?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gdin
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But he is not active
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i still have to run it trhough advanced spell checker, especially for conjugation and some plural
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Chairn thesis for which school lol
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Aix-Marseille University, not Grenoble
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :sad:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i anonymised the file i sent ðŸ™‚
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon do you remember the minecraft within minecraft with redstone? It was executed under a custom mc server implemented in rust that does redstone 10000x faster
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the juice:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> -A; I am a programmer.
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> -B; Cool me too and in what you programm?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> -A; In mc redstone
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean you the biggest minecraft pro i know actually xDDD
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://imhex.werwolv.net/
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a dissasembler made in imgui
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a dissasembler made with imgui
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes I know. I looked into all the rust Mc projects
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> They all have cool ideas but sadly nothing feature complete enough for a survival server
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Imagine playing the game smh
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I do
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you also know what exactly they parallelized?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just redstone? minecraft is tick based right, so it has to start somewhere and end somewhere xd
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Read the repo
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u post it i assume u read it xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Each 256x256 plot runs on a thread
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There is also the Redpiler
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The redstone compiler
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok but they especially focus on redstone for computers xD
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The sv doesnt have many vanilla things
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd love to have redstone working well
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that always kills the server xD
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well not using java is a step
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is another c++ server as far as i know
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah this
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mc these days has lot of content
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mc has infinitife content, such a tryhard community
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> There are a lot of cool things. But I have yet to come across a usable client or server reimplementation. Last time I tried cuberite the incompleteness and bugs felt way worse than a slow javaI feel like all the good content is all written in Java
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Not Keks)
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know of a pattern when exposing `shared_ptr`'s to C APIs?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The pattern is probs not using c
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking just malloc a piece of memory, store the shared_ptr there and expose the new piece of memory to the C API instead
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, how did I not think of that. I'll do a quick rewrite of libcurl in C
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> c++
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Skip c++
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> expose the raw pointer?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah true, I'll also rewrite ddnet in rust too along the way, thanks ryo
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The library will keep the raw pointer around for a while, I need to ensure the pointer given to the lib is also counted as a ref in the ref count
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Ryozuki @Learath2 did you see my message? https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1019616501982036048
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I usually see this way around, wrap the c api pointer in a shared ptr or unique ptr with the free function
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, expose raw pointer, store a ref in another struct?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye but im not home rn
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I'd missed it. I'll take a look
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And 63 pages
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, only 25
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + half of it is figures (maybe a little less)
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, about what I had in mind. I guess that's what I'll go for
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, i'd make a struct with the raw pointer and a shared_ptr to keep the ref, and just pass the raw pointer to the C api
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u modifying libcurl?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so that way, they should be kept in sync
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm passing a context variable to libcurl that'll be returned to me. I need to pass a shared_ptr
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The C api doesn't use the data, it's just context I'll get later. So I can just pass a pointer to the struct with the shared_ptr
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is libcurl just modifying the context  or allocating smth?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not touching that at all. It's just user context. You pass it a void *, it'll give it back to you on a callback
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <matrix_coinbase> Click and thank me later 
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <matrix_coinbase> ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <matrix_coinbase> http://t.me/Stevecoldham001
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd put the `shared_ptr` behind another pointer
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 c++ std is lacking: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/smart_ptr/doc/html/smart_ptr.html#intrusive_ptr
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I ended with `std::shared_ptr<CHttpRunnable> *ppRunnable = malloc(sizeof *ppRunnable); *ppRunnable = pRunnable;`
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you doing? ðŸ™‚
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm redoing the curl-multi pr
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're amazing ðŸ™‚
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich the positive
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜€
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't remember the problems with the old one anymore
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just cant see the smiles as other than sarcastic for some reason (not saying yours are)
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are standard `:)` smilies
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It had a very small issue, but I just didn't like it for whatever reason
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this one ðŸ˜€ is 99% sarcastic
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I learned that ðŸ˜‰ can be seen as sexual in the US?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this totally blew my mind. I've never seen that before ^^
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well not really by itself but otherwise it could be
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> wanna play ddrace ? ðŸ˜‰
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean I would play ddrace, but I think it's a joke on the smiley ^^
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait what? So I should stop using ðŸ˜‰ at work all the time? ðŸ˜‰
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you interact with US americans at work?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, US company
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> let's fix some bugs ðŸ˜‰ lmao
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Eating a banana is also highly sexual ðŸ˜‰
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for some reason, this hasn't happened in europe so far
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wow, i use ðŸ˜‰ all the time
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll continue using it until europeans find it weird ^^
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what i don't like in emails and chatting however is three little dots...
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think it's true, I see ~1000 matches for ðŸ˜‰ on work slack
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think everyone is flirting secretly ðŸ˜„
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i always over interpret them
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah good to know ðŸ™‚
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ðŸ˜‰
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ... is mean in my opinion, or like it shows the writer doesn't say everything he wants

19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ðŸ˜‰ is only sexual if you make it sexual in the context, normally it's fine
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 thanks for going through open PRs
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42589128/sale/Programmersdaysale
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know if you can bind a socket to itself?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a datagram socket to be exact
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be done every once in a while; it's been a long time since I last did it. you're welcome ðŸ™‚
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, binding a socket to itself?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are we talking about `bind` or `connect`?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An UDP socket, when you write to it, you receive the message you send on that socket
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, sending a message to yourself?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I don't know if that's possible. let me try
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, works @Learath2
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```rs
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use std::net::UdpSocket;
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     let socket = UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0")?;
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     let addr = socket.local_addr()?;
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     socket.send_to(b"Hello world?\n", &addr)?;
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     let mut buf = [0; 128];
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     let (read, addr) = socket.recv_from(&mut buf)?;
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     println!("{}: {}", addr, String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf[..read]));
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     Ok(())
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean a socket is just a fd
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> You can send to it directly
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Stop!!! People think they can harm DDNet with it!!!
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully it'll wake up select just fine
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a small rust program. it has nothing to do with ddnet
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt this the loopback or smth
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ðŸ™‚ gives off a very passive aggressive vibe to me
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: if my stale 0.7 skins pr bothers you we can close it no problemo
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i literally do not know whats the problem here, by the way.

20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> do .cpp files not need an #include [file].h?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't have access to clang-format?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I do, it's just I don't know what violation it's causing.
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you do, you can simply run `python scripts/fix_style.py` and it'll do it for you
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably alphabetically sorting
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps it wants to sort it
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: I'll get back to you if it annoys me. I just wanted to check all the pull request's statuses
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oke
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how's the 0.7 thing going btw?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> You can close without warning. I can reopen if needed
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im going minecraft all day
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Didnâ€™t Code shit in my freetime since weeks
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:(
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay ðŸ™‚
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> minecraft is also fun!
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> !
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> You also watch liveoverflow right?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I met liveoverflow before I watched videos of him ðŸ˜›
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I also watched a couple of videos from him ðŸ˜‰
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I play on his server
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Where?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> his minecraft server?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Go leak
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, sounds like doxxing myself as well. no leaks today
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Where did you meet him
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hehe
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So it was irl?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Did you know he was a yter back then?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ok I stop -.-
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hah, went through all PRs ðŸ™‚
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now I'm going to make some dinner
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So to clarify, to merge commits in got bash I type `git rebase -i master`?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So to clarify, to merge commits in git bash I type `git rebase -i master`?
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> i always go `git reset --soft HEAD^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^` xd
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> but wat do i know
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> always found rebasing a bit intimitadting
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> but ye rebase -i looks good
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> then you can edit the thingy
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> depends what you want to do
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> and kick out commits you dont like or soemthing like that
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `git merge upstream/master` is fine as well
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> i think he wants to "merge commits" as in combine multiple in one
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> not merge branches
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you would know chairn
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you want to rebase a pull request, then use your command `git rebase master` or with `-i` flag if you need to change commits
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im so close to just closing the entire multicolored lasers branch LOL
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> oof
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its so messy
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you just want to merge and add a merge commit, then `git merge master`
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> `rm -rf .git && git init && git add . && git commit -m fml`
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> ^ dont do this xd
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> also gj @heinrich5991 on going through all prs. I should do that too sometimes to get a dopamine kick. Its the fulltime github influencer equivalent of writing "hi" to all whatsapp contacts :D
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah **HOPEFULLY** once i squash some commits it will be ready
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah **HOPEFULLY** once i squash some commits my thing will be ready
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> then again this was my first time ever coding so uhhh :monkalaugh:
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> **FUCK. YOU**
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019674053860143134/unknown.png
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what does it want from me??? \
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what does it want from me???
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I clang formatted it
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what clang-format version?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont **know**
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im using some unreliable VSCode extension
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im using some unreliable VSCode extension to clang format it
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> don't bother with that, we can clang-format it for yoyu
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well can i at least squash some commits first
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sure
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> okayyyy
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> id be more open to work on this but i have like, 2 boring therapy meetings in a row
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Remove the empty lines you added after the includes, there should only be one empty line after the includes
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea i figured that out already
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> god my lack of coding skills back then are rly biting me now its so stressful
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i use clang-format from xaver and it never failed me ^^
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u need to use clang-format-10
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also u need to tell vscode explicitly to use a formater
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the settings
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well it failed **ME**
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it had NO reason to add an extra line
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not the computer that is buggy, its the user in front that uses it wrong ðŸ˜‰
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no but i dunno, maybe newer clang-formats do that, but i honestly doubt that
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont know. all i know is that im completely unmotivated for this pull request in this state
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i cant even squash commits because other ppl's are in the way
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what does that mean
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1019683663648141473/unknown.png
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can literally move the commits around
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a theory that you were liveoverflow ðŸ˜„
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't tell apart people with similar accents
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im tempted to just cheat and close the PR to completely make a new branch and copy all the clean code from this into the new branch
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it'd use the loopback tho
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crackmes.one/
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good place to learn rev eng
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idek if this is even allowed tbh
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <zKBTuran> musl
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Volvicc> nice where?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is there no method to loop through the easy handles in a curl multi handle? ðŸ˜¦
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Voxel if it boils down to tooling such as clang-format and git rebase, I can also do it for you
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (in general, please don't do git merges in feature branches btw)
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that would be appreciated... sorry if the entire PR is a mess :feelsbadman:
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alright, link it and I'll do it after the game
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> #5639
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5639
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was so close to getting rid of that unordered_map, now I need it back because curl can't spit the easy handles back out ðŸ˜¦
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> put it into the multi_handle? ^^
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> into the userdata of the multihandle?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> put what in htere?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the easy handles
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why bother, might aswell store it myself in the unordered_map if I'll have to double store it either way
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> libcurl already internally has a list, it just won't let me access it ðŸ˜¦
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only need it during cleanup too, soooo close ðŸ˜¦
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you need to do during cleanup?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All the remaining easy handles inside the multi
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I checked some examples they had in the curl sourcecode and they also keep an array of easy handles so they can cleanup
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just shit api design ðŸ˜¦
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That rewrite was going so well too. Now I'm not in the mood to continue ðŸ˜„
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe ignore the cleanup? ðŸ™‚
