00:00 < bridge_> <Teero> anyway chillerdragon you need to start some kind of converstion or open an issue on gh or smth so the chat log isn't on screen when moderators look in this channel
00:01 < bridge_> <Teero> chillerdragon: what do you think about this banger? https://on.soundcloud.com/f7akqaMEdDGLEfkXsJ

00:02 < bridge_> <Teero> always listen to this when i do ddnet dev
00:03 < bridge_> <Assa> grr
00:04 < bridge_> <Assa> fixed like 8 bugs in that shit hookline code
00:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Dunno teero
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s weeb music
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Who deleted fokkos meme I didn’t even see which one it was
00:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> xd
00:17 < bridge_> <Teero> the heino cleaning up offtopic meme xd
00:17 < bridge_> <Teero> the heino cleaning up offtopic in developer meme xd
02:04 < Thrava> goodmorning devs
02:05 < Thrava> I think there is still a very small change that I can complete my work before 10/2
02:08 < bridge_> <Teero> it's 2am...
02:09 < Thrava> It's 8:09
02:10 < Thrava> UTC+8
02:10 < Thrava> The vote generator is a bit of troublesome since it have so many condition(or formats) if purely generated by program
02:11 < Thrava> But thankfully, the EntityFramework let my work much smoother
03:38 < bridge_> <thrava> Is ddnet.org down?
04:36 < bridge_> <thrava> I don't believe the command length of a vote is also can not be adjusted
04:37 < bridge_> <thrava> Someone come to tell me it's true please
04:37 < bridge_> <thrava> Well, I'm going to test it
04:40 < bridge_> <thrava> Thank god, it can be adjusted
04:44 < bridge_> <thrava> Thank DDnet, Thank devs, Thank C++, Thank VisualStudio, Thank voting.h, Thank VOTE_CMD_LENGTH, Thank CMake, Thank exec command, Thank RCON, Thank everything, for letting the cmd length of a vote be actually adjustable
06:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
06:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> gm
06:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> so humid here
06:43 < bridge_> <zhn> make server side alias system for commands idk
06:43 < bridge_> <zhn> also if you need so much functionality in vote commands, just use `exec bla.cfg`
06:44 < bridge_> <zhn> if you do something different just tell us what you want to achieve
06:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw i got oficial rust std working for my kernel
06:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/rust/pull/1
07:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> very nice
07:20 < bridge_> <melon> Gumo
07:21 < bridge_> <melon> @ryozuki can I override a global use flag for a single package?
07:21 < bridge_> <melon> 
07:21 < bridge_> <melon> i.e a global -systemd flag but enable it for a single package? - doesn't seem to work and I need it to build COSMIC even when not using it
07:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> surely gentoo has a solution for this already
07:33 < bridge_> <melon> for sure but I'm stupid
07:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant u just add +flag in the package use?
07:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wait
07:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats bound to be wrong
07:38 < bridge_> <melon> <a:pepeMeltdown:799389563175829544>
07:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if the package requires systemd it must be for a reason
07:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u need cosmic
07:39 < bridge_> <melon> i wanna try it out
07:39 < bridge_> <melon> :justatest:
07:39 < bridge_> <melon> I'm not sure if it requires it but it fails compilation because of a systemd check in the source
07:40 < bridge_> <melon> not home anymore so I can't check again
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/COSMIC
07:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> eselect repository add cosmic-overlay git https://github.com/fsvm88/cosmic-overlay.git
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the wiki has a openrc section
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why do u have -systemd global flag?
07:41 < bridge_> <melon> fuck systemd
07:41 < bridge_> <melon> Junk
07:41 < bridge_> <melon> :owo:
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh wait
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also have it

07:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u build using the overlay?
07:42 < bridge_> <melon> ye :/
07:42 < bridge_> <melon> I followed gentoos wiki
07:43 < bridge_> <melon> That's why I'm confused
07:43 < bridge_> <melon> Maybe because I wanted to use Unstable
07:44 < bridge_> <melon> someone call my boss and tell him to let me go I want to try
07:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and u did
07:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> emerge cosmic-meta pop-theme-meta -pv
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/fsvm88/cosmic-overlay/issues/64
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr did u sync the overlay recently?
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they fixed a issue related to systemd
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/fsvm88/cosmic-overlay/issues/66
07:46 < bridge_> <melon> Yesterday ye
07:46 < bridge_> <melon> What is -pv
07:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr what did u unmask
07:47 < bridge_> <melon> Unstable
07:47 < bridge_> <melon> cosmic-base/* ~amd64
07:47 < bridge_> <melon> cosmic-de/* ~amd64
07:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in docs it only mentions cosmic-base/*
07:48 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1422097739654758504/Screenshot_20250929-074832.png?ex=68db6f3a&is=68da1dba&hm=564419f31575cc66d25f47caff2cbef36fabd39022e27e7fa8d0eb6c9a3b7374&
07:48 < bridge_> <melon> :justatest:
07:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> The --ask (-a) and --pretend (-p) options allow examination of the planned system changes before they are actually made. The --ask option will make emerge display the intended changes and ask for confirmation before continuing. The --pretend option will simply display the intended changes and halt, and does not require superuser privileges.
07:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont follow the wiki, follow the overlay readme
07:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it may be more updated
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> :baked:  ok will do
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> Also thanks for finding the issue
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the ebuild has this
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> Tho it's weird I got hit by it, 2 months old
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```

07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do u have elogind in global use?
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> can't check, but I don't think so
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u should
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> I keep my global flags to a minimu
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think alternative is systemd related
07:49 < bridge_> <melon> o
07:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh yes
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > elogind is the systemd project's logind, extracted to a standalone package. It's designed for users who prefer a non-systemd init system, but still want to use popular software such as KDE or GNOME that otherwise hard-depends on systemd.
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have it
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw
07:50 < bridge_> <melon> Oh, then I should have it
07:50 < bridge_> <melon> Because I use KDE6
07:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but u need the global flag i guess
07:51 < bridge_> <melon> Thanks ryo that helped :owo: 
07:51 < bridge_> <melon> I'll check it out later when I'm home

08:55 < bridge_> <Assa>                         QuantizedDirection.x = round_to_int(QuantizedDirection.x * 256.0f) / 256.0f;
08:55 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
08:55 < bridge_> <Assa> shouldn't it converge to a value after one step?
08:59 < bridge_> <melon> float rounding errors because computer stoopid
09:00 < bridge_> <melon> Generally yes, practically no
09:00 < bridge_> <melon> Theoretically yes, practically no
09:04 < bridge_> <Assa> practically it should converge really fast due to the rounding step
09:09 < bridge_> <Assa> I guess I understand now, the quantization is only applied after the first step ...
09:57 < bridge_> <Assa> I like our new heinrich merge bot ❤️

10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not yet
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the std can be used but lots of parts are "unsupported"
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im adding atleast the fs support

10:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw, i saw lot of random OSes in the std, maybe if i get something consistent in edos i can even get it in rust
10:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i saw this https://github.com/hermit-os
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i love how we have like a task force of 3 ppl working on a hookline xd
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Make an os that focuses on gpu performance and you will get famous in no time
10:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the AI gurus will come en masse
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i am trying out git rerere today wish me luck

10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** did it
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im scared

13:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 when remove UB from ddnet by clicking merge?
13:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my rust CI started breaking after a minor diff and the error message is useless af
13:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i am full rage
13:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** such a waste of time
13:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh wait did heinrich just wrote a blocking comment there? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10787
13:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i cba to do that i need to finish rcon first omg
13:29 < bridge_> <kebscs> @chill
13:29 < bridge_> <kebscs> can you press merge on <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10931>?
13:30 < bridge_> <kebscs> its already approved
13:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it looks so complicated
13:30 < bridge_> <kebscs> and logic is now same as in 0.7 i know how much you love 0.7
13:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 0.7 is not flawless
13:30 < bridge_> <kebscs> it just changes the array size :/
13:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hec they even removed broadcast at first
13:31 < bridge_> <kebscs> whats complicated
13:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its gameplay
13:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i need to fully understand it to merge it
13:31 < bridge_> <kebscs> but its just array size 10 -> max_clients
13:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what do you need this for?
13:32 < bridge_> <kebscs> rn doesnt do much as you dont use ninja to hit that many tees, later will be cleaner to do target tiles
13:33 < bridge_> <kebscs> 10 is just a random number
13:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
13:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder why the hammer branch got changed
13:35 < bridge_> <bumm.> @ryozuki did u delete ddstats.org?
13:35 < bridge_> <kebscs> m_NumObjectsHit = 0;?
13:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not hosting it anymore
13:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ye
13:35 < bridge_> <kebscs> its only used for ninja, and already reset when you fire ninja
13:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so it made no sense either way in hammer?
13:35 < bridge_> <kebscs> yes
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs> ```
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs>     case WEAPON_NINJA:
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs>     {
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs>         // reset Hit objects
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs>         m_NumObjectsHit = 0;
13:36 < bridge_> <kebscs> ```
13:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** why was it there <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
13:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its not in teeworlds
13:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ah u said same pr was done in tw
13:38 < bridge_> <kebscs> yes, removed in the linked pr
13:38 < bridge_> <kebscs> <https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2898>
13:38 < bridge_> <kebscs> roby comment "I removed m_NumObjectsHit = 0; from the hammer code because that variable has nothing to do with the hammer."
13:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
16:04 < bridge_> <thrava> then about 3000 cfg will be created
16:04 < bridge_> <thrava> sv_motd, sv_name command in map votes
16:05 < bridge_> <thrava> There are almost no function, but the string takes 700+ length
16:49 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: Tja
16:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tja
16:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Jupsi is Bad influence for me
16:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tja is the third best german word
16:50 < bridge_> <kebscs> ?
16:51 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s German saying
16:51 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> How to translate it @jupeyy_keks ?
16:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you don't have the fate in your hands and have to accept it as is
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my translation
16:52 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: it’s quite sassy way of saying „not my problem“ kinda shit
16:52 < bridge_> <melon> tja.
16:52 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Jupstar used it when he approved but didn’t merge assa pr
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i used it because i wanted to express:
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you add 1 feature and add 20 new bugs
16:52 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: go break physics and merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10931 or no balls
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i don't merge server code
16:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Based client dev
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i don't touch this spaghetti
16:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Where a deen
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> penne are more tasty
16:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> deen used to merge so much
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he has kids
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> money
16:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I miss his blazingly fast merges
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if i'd not be emotionally attached to a stupid rust project with 0 users, i'd not be here anymore as well
16:54 < bridge_> <kebscs> what map requires 10 tees lined up + ninja
16:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> what are the other 2?
16:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> His kids inherit merge rights? They should merge with too!
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah ah ah I knew i could trigger the curiosity of someone with that
16:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> His kids inherit merge rights? They should merge too!
16:54 < bridge_> <kebscs> and if you have ninja you can already jump higher than it launches up anyway
16:55 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'm looking for names for my other projects :lol:
16:55 < bridge_> <kebscs> also i increased ninja movetime for that vid showcase, it was too short with normal ninja
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 1. Pflaume
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2. Pflanze
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You see both start with Pfl. That is not a random incident. Pfl is the way to start a word
16:55 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: I didn’t say break official ddnet ranks but „break physics“
16:55 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: dont rq where would you go?
16:55 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Did you stop playing?
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No, I am also addicted
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Honestly dunno where I'd go. How about some other open source project
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Oh I wanted to answer to you call your project with smth that starts with Pfl
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the other was to chiller
16:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> We got you dw
16:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Pflompiler
16:58 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> …

16:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I ask my nice when I'm home
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> niece
17:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Family reveal

17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Did you know that I know deens kid IRL
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sick isnt it
17:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I did not
17:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That’s sick indeed
17:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Does deen know?
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Directly whispered him which programming language to learn
17:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> nim
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So it's in his early brain
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nim :lol:
17:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I think that generation won’t code anymore
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder what deen will teach it
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Like at some point he gotta learn
17:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Hopefully he will teach ddrace
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or do you think until then ChatGPT is our teacher?
17:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ye
17:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Humanity dead
17:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Or apocalypse at least
17:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Or just vibe all the way
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Life is getting more like a dream it feels like
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> As in, everything feels blurry
17:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Always has been
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No goals anymore
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No skill needed anymore
17:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Drugs still work
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe we'll have drug without addiction or perma dmg
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe we have nearve gear
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> A old schoolfriend of mine always said he'll invent the nerve gear xDD
17:13 < bridge_> <zhn> you are banging a nail with microscope for whatever reason

18:39 < bridge_> <Assa> @kebscs going to test your PR again, maybe I don't find time today but latest tomorrow
18:52 < bridge_> <kebscs> i went line by line from gamecore, and tested few setups
18:52 < bridge_> <kebscs> and i think all good now
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> try it
19:32 < bridge_> <thrava> why
19:33 < bridge_> <thrava> I need to update the statistics of map when changing the map
19:40 < bridge_> <thrava> I wonder how the DDnet server update the statistics in motd when using random map
20:11 < furo> @thrava The MOTD is loaded from (map).map.cfg which the server will always try to execute when loading in a map. The cfg itself is updated every X minutes by a cronjob.
20:14 < bridge_> <thrava> Ok thanks
22:07 < bridge_> <melon> !remind 9000 do something for {redacted}
22:07 < chillerbot> Helo melon I will remind you at Mon Oct 06 2025 04:07:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
22:08 < bridge_> <melon> chiller pls don't nuke that ones important
22:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> could have at least made 9001

22:33 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @blaiszephyr: I guarantee nothing :p
22:48 < bridge_> <Teero> !remind 90000 death is imminent
22:48 < chillerbot> Helo Teero I will remind you at Mon Oct 06 2025 22:48:10 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.

23:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 🥀
23:19 < bridge_> <thrava> The max storage path count is no enough for me
23:20 < bridge_> <thrava> For ddnet maps, it takes 15 in total
23:20 < bridge_> <thrava> and there just 1 remained
