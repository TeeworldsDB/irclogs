03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im trying to figure out what rarely causes big lags for certain players on my server, the lag doesnt show up on demo and goes away when they selfkill

09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 if you have pnglite installed in system, but force bundled anyway, the EX64 define was true
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> PNGLITE_LIBRARIES gave me a cmake error about being unset
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I couldn't compile, if you have a better fix go ahead
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any windows pros here? I moved my win10 machine in another room and somehow i cant set it up correctly agian .-. If i plug my screen cable into my pc it shows an correct image but i have like 3 fps on my desktop. If i plug it in another slot i get half resolution but smooth expierence.
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Windows pros arent a thing, pros dont use windows
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Mokuz  why not?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen for the "force-bundle" thing, did you change the configuration, or did you specify `-DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON` on the initial cmake command line?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I can't reproduce either of these
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell me what OS you're on?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ahhh
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I can reproduce the wavpack thing
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup, I can
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> @deen 'cuz it suck
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it does .-.
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i keep failing to fix my screen i will uninstall windows
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but im pretty sure it would be even harder to get it running smooth on linux
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Mby
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> specify -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON, I didn't have pnglite installed at all
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> archlinux x86-64 current
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> yeah, Arch Linux and AUR don't have a pnglite package and, IMHO, it isn't a good trade-off to create a package for it.
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @Mokuz winshit is good for client side
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> Srv side its fullyshit
18:05 <@Nimda> Arcadian by Jimmy Jazz & Soapy Sandwich just released on Brutal at 2018-02-16 18:00

19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Youre wrong
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> You're wrong ðŸ‘º

20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> @ReiTW | Blizzard Team is right
21:41 <@deen> Learath2: you forgot to update ger2 btw, it failed all team records. should be updating now
21:46 <+Learath2> deen: I did update it tho
21:46 <+Learath2> a couple servers just didn't restart
21:47 <+Learath2> I checked it with md5sum /proc/pid/exe, some were up to date some weren't
22:17 <@deen> oh
22:17 <@deen> that's weird, why?
22:17 <@deen> ah, i think I know why
22:17 <@deen> still some servers with 832* port running, but i deleted their fifo file already
22:19 <@deen> i thought I shut them down before, oops
