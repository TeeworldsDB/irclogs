21:08 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 520
21:08 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
21:09 <+o_be_two> deen: what your players will do if you stop DDNet :( ?
21:11 <@deen> o_be_two: stop complaining :P
21:11 <@deen> i mean that's what the players will do
21:12 <+o_be_two> they'll complain on where to play now ? they'll say that finally ddnet was really cool
21:14 <+o_be_two> to be honest i just think that ddnet is too like a company and not like a fun adventure, idk if you see what i mean, but i just see (a little ok, i'm not involved in the team thats true) that some old staff says that it was too many work to do
21:14 <+o_be_two> with deadline and other things
21:15 <+o_be_two> thats the craziest part of an organization, beeing able to produce more effortless, not possible ... I let my admin to do what they want/can, and i dont all other things, like you do for sure
21:15 <+o_be_two> and i do all other things*
21:15 < ImYFU> current ddnet team, doesn't actually feel like a team.
21:15 < ImYFU> just a little observation
21:24 <+o_be_two> ImYFU: what do you think about DDNet ?
21:26 < ImYFU> o_be_two Which part of it specifically? Client/Gamemod/Forum/Community/Staff?
21:27 <@heinrich5991> project?
21:29 <+o_be_two> all ImYFU 
21:32 < ImYFU> Well, first of all, I don't really play ddrace, I finished few maps, I sometimes try to play it, but I guess it's not my thing (or I am just bad which is more likely). But I like the gamemode itself, the idea and all the features you can use in map creation, it's all good, I like that. Client is great, although I don't use it, I prefer k-client, because it has some more specific features I need. 2nd message coming
21:35 <+o_be_two> i've tried k-client, its nice but too heavy, its not the mind of DDNet, but i understand that you can like k-client
21:37 < ImYFU>  Now the servers, there are many. I even feel like there are too many servers, but I guess I can't really say that, because as I noted I don't really play ddrace. Idea of spreading ddrace worldwide is good, but I personally think, it should not come from DDnet, if Afrikans or Chinease or whoever else wants to have ddrace - let them host it on their own. They want to be in Global Ranking? Let them send you their records and stuff. That's my IMHO keep that in mi
21:39 < ImYFU> Forum, well, it is good, I like it. I've seen better ones, but this one is definitly good.
21:39 <@heinrich5991> your second-to-last message was cut off
21:40 < ImYFU> No, it's fine
21:40 < ImYFU> Just forgot to put a period
21:41 <@heinrich5991> [20:37:18] <ImYFU> [...] That's my IMHO keep that in mi
21:42 < ImYFU> Hm, that looks fine to me
21:42 < ImYFU> keep that in mind.^
21:44 <+o_be_two> not bad suggest about possibility to send rec
21:44 <+o_be_two> cause when you sposorise and keep access to the host, you can get all ddnet pw
21:44 <+o_be_two> (i think, i havent checked, but its just conf files so ..)
21:45 <+o_be_two> but its hard to trust all people
21:45 < ImYFU> Community. Now, I can't say I know the community. I know people, but mostly because of other gamemodes. You can't really say much about this large community, I think it's fine. It's not toxic, like grenade zCatch or fng or block, whatever.
21:45 <+o_be_two> could be easy to fake times
21:45 < ImYFU> perhaps
21:45 <+o_be_two> what you play ImYFU ?
21:45 < ImYFU> zCatch and ictf mostly
21:46 < ImYFU> I don't play much lately, mostly ban bots on zCatch
21:46 < ImYFU> I am from TeeVision zCatch servers
21:47 < ImYFU> What's left? Staff?
21:48 < ImYFU> I am actually part of the team
21:48 < ImYFU> I am a forum moderator
21:48 < ImYFU> Since the start of this week or something
21:48 < ImYFU> It doesn't feel like a team, at all.
21:52 < ImYFU> It needs a better organisation, some kinds of schedules (for testers), and goddamn talk. You see, it appears that some people doesn't like each other. It is stupid, it should be solved, you cannot work efficiently, if someone in a team doesn't like you.
21:54 < ImYFU> Ah, last thing, if ddnet is about to be shut down, I insist on running a global broadcast on servers about that. Majority of ddrace players do not use forum.
21:55 < ImYFU> I guess that's it
21:57 <+o_be_two> ImYFU: you seems to know where you go, you think you can do something to help DDNet to be beautiful again ?
21:58 < ImYFU> I offered the only help I could give - moderating
21:58 <+o_be_two> no time for other things ?
21:59 < ImYFU> I am not a mapper, I tried it few times, but you see the only map that matters is ctf4_old
21:59 <@heinrich5991> spoken like a true instagib player :)
21:59 <+o_be_two> level design is mutch work and/or ideas, i cant do this too
22:00 < ImYFU> I am not a coder, it's the second least understandable language for me after german
22:03 < ImYFU> The only thing I can is banning people, it doesn't take much skill, you just have to be a moderator in guts and 273,16 К in heart
22:06 <@heinrich5991> :)
22:08 < ImYFU> I keed I keed
22:08 <+o_be_two> ImYFU: you can be more, community management is a good skill for moderators
22:09 < ImYFU> Mind to elaborate? Not really sure what "community management" is
22:20 <+o_be_two> hum its communication with the community
22:21 <+o_be_two> the best part si to give a way to the community, to motivate them, to show them the good way for the project, these kind of things
22:21 < ImYFU> Aah
22:21 < ImYFU> Community doesn't care :D
22:21 <+o_be_two> and btw, its to help haters to be less hater, help good players who doesnt participate to community to want to participate
22:22 <+o_be_two> not really, thats why they talk on ddnet forums and tw forums
22:22 < ImYFU> Community is big enough to take care of itself
22:22 < ImYFU> No, forum people is another breed really
22:23 < ImYFU> like, the people who reads they forum are hardly 20% of players
22:23 <+o_be_two> well there's a "link" with players and DDNet to keep alive
22:23 < ImYFU> It always like that, forum people =/= whole community
22:23 <+o_be_two> even if they dont use forum
22:24 <+o_be_two> community management is not only forum, its all kind of communication way, even in game
22:24 <+o_be_two> well it depends on the community
22:24 < ImYFU> ^It depends on its size really
22:25 < ImYFU> The bigger community is - the less it cares about each other
22:25 < ImYFU> !ddnetpeak
22:25 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 431
22:25 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
22:25 < ImYFU> 431 players
22:25 < ImYFU> Doesn't look dead to me
22:27 < ImYFU> You know what is dead? idm is dead (loved to play on your servers, laxa), Catch16 is dead, iFreeze is dead, many other gamemodes are dead
22:28 < ImYFU> !ddnetpeak
22:28 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 423
22:28 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
22:28 < ImYFU> Hell, even vanilla looks dead from up here
22:28 <+o_be_two> Actually the most played game on TW is DDRace ...
22:28 <+o_be_two> and Blockers.
22:29 < ImYFU> So? How come you say, it's dead
22:30 < ImYFU> It's ALIVE
22:32 < ImYFU> And it won't die
22:32 < ImYFU> Because it's always something different
22:32 < ImYFU> Gameplay changes drasticly from map to map
22:32 < ImYFU> And it's challenging
22:33 < ImYFU> DDrace is fine, it won't die, because community quits
22:34 < ImYFU> Let me say that
22:34 < ImYFU> At least, it will be like vanilla
22:35 < ImYFU> Popularity of ddrace will be stable, people leaving - people joining.
22:36 < ImYFU> ings, you didn't see them
22:38 < laxa> You can't say anything without any numbers to prove your thinking you know ?
22:41 <+o_be_two> but DDNet is the actual engine of DDrace
22:42 < laxa> Everygame looses his player base more or less slowly starting from the last update/content
22:43 < laxa> that's statistically true I guess
22:43 < laxa> look, even old games like diablo 1 have still players
22:43 < laxa> (I am talking about online games)
22:43 < laxa> as far as I am concerned
22:43 < laxa> I have no intention of taking my servers down
22:43 < laxa> even though no one is playing on them
22:44 < ImYFU> <3 diablo 1
22:44 < laxa> People who read forums on ANY game are something like less than 5% of the players, maybe a little bit more if you count the most active members
22:45 < ImYFU> Actually been watching Diablo 2 stream hour ago
22:45 < laxa> diablo 2 streams oO ?
22:45 < ImYFU> y, russian one tho
22:45 < laxa> argh
22:45 < laxa> give me link :)
22:45 < laxa> diablo 2 is dead though since diablo 3
22:45 < laxa> and before, blizzard wasn't caring anymore
22:45 < ImYFU> diablo 3 crap tho
22:45 < laxa> full of bots
22:45 < ImYFU> ^^"
22:45 < laxa> yes I agree
22:45 < laxa> I had some bots myself :(
22:46 < ImYFU> Median XL?
22:46 < laxa> No
22:46 < laxa> I played really actively for some months
22:46 < ImYFU> It's popular tho
22:46 < laxa> chasing dclone was my thing
22:46 < laxa> and trading on jsp
22:47 < laxa> there was IRC channels for dclone hunting
22:47 < laxa> announcing soj sells etc...
22:47 <@heinrich5991> why is botting a problem in d3?
22:47 < ImYFU> ^^
22:47 < laxa> heinrich5991: we talk about d2
22:47 < laxa> for example
22:47 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:47 < laxa> if you create a public game
22:47 < laxa> bots come instantly to advertise for their website
22:47 <@heinrich5991> [21:45:50] <ImYFU> diablo 3 crap tho
22:47 <@heinrich5991> [21:45:52] <laxa> full of bots
22:47 < laxa> then the game is blocked/bug and no one can join anymore
22:47 <@heinrich5991> I thought this was referred to d3
22:47 < laxa> yeah sorry ^^
22:47 <@heinrich5991> -was
22:48 < laxa> Well still, d2 was a fun game
22:48 <@heinrich5991> played it a little
22:48 < laxa> But it gets boring really quickly
22:48 <@heinrich5991> the maps were actually randomly generated, unlike d3
22:48 <@heinrich5991> in d3 it's mostly mashing some components together
22:48 < laxa> it's not totally true heinrich5991
22:48 < ImYFU> yeah
22:48 < laxa> maphacks had all maps stocked inside them
22:48 < ImYFU> they rather are predetermined
22:49 < ImYFU> after years of playing you can exactly know where to go
22:49 <@heinrich5991> ImYFU: d2 d3?
22:49 < ImYFU> d2
22:50 < ImYFU> Btw, Median XL is still active and in development, not by Brother Laz tho
22:51 < ImYFU> And they have streams
22:52 < laxa> my friends on TS are all playing Path of Exile lol
22:52 < ImYFU> Path of Exile is good
22:52 < laxa> Never tried
22:53 < laxa> RPGs are boring after a while
22:53 < laxa> Most of them consist of bashing more or less
22:53 < laxa> they all do PVP/PVE seasons to let some challenge
22:53 < ImYFU> I didn't played it all 3 difficultes, but it is good
22:54 < ImYFU> Yeah, it's kinda something people would wait from D3
22:54 < ImYFU> PoE is^
22:55 < laxa> The game I bashed the most is t4c
22:55 < laxa> if you know :)
22:55 < laxa> Second ever or so mmorpg
22:55 < laxa> was released before 2000
22:56 < laxa> the editor is still selling server licenses and there are some active servers
22:57 < ImYFU> I think the oldest game from my favorites is like ~20 years old
22:58 < ImYFU> lemme see
22:58 < ImYFU> 1996 year
22:58 < ImYFU> game called BLOOD
22:59 <@heinrich5991> oldest game I still play? I think I can win that contest. 1987: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack
22:59 <@heinrich5991> ^^
22:59 < ImYFU> Oldest game I play - www.lifecompetes.com
23:03  * fstd has recently played a round of rogue, since it happens to be installed by default
23:03 < fstd> sorry, heinrich5991.  i win the contest :P
23:04 < ImYFU> nope, I still have the lead 
23:04 < fstd> (btw is on the dedi, if you want to try)
23:04 < ImYFU> Game of Life 1970
23:05 < ImYFU> But okay, it's kinda not the game
23:05 <@heinrich5991> fstd: can I compete with zork which I discovered in the "computer game museum" and subsequently installed it on my machine (and played a few times)
23:05 <@heinrich5991> It's very dark here. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
23:06 < fstd> fair enough :)
23:14 <@heinrich5991> You die...--More--
23:14 <@heinrich5991> meh :(
23:36 < o_be_two> :)
