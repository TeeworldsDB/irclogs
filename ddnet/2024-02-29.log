08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> the 1:4
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it tries to set the format to DSD_U32_BE
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> can i somehow force the format to be S32_LE?

08:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there a way to catch a moment when team got loaded on client :thonk:
08:47 < bridge> <teero777> Wdym? If I understand correctly then that would be the moment you send the team members to the client. Correct?
08:48 < bridge> <teero777> From client or serverside?
08:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i want to print hello world on client when user successfully loaded his save
08:49 < bridge> <teero777> Ah that's what you mean.
08:49 < bridge> <teero777> Well you could just check the chats msgs xd
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cl_dubstep 0
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What's you average fps
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hard to read from that graph
09:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> like 1600
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cl_refresh_rate 0
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx_refresh_rate 0
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
09:44 < bridge> <cyberFighter> yes
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you set a limit for gfx does it get stable?
09:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> yeah
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then it's probably normal. I dunno why it looks like it goes close to zero tho
09:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> nvm heres what it looks rn
09:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1212682105985826816/image.png?ex=65f2b938&is=65e04438&hm=779aff2a751f15eebe564ccc641480bebd55e833f493bbe996f52f92e8f46422&
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe min max are wrong
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What limit did you use
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Try 1000
09:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> thats also 0
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So it fixed itself? Xd
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> hi guys
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 Thursday for vulkan
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did you already learn about subpass dependencies?
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> I have one in my triangle renderer to delay the color output stage until I have an image to output to üòõ
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> I honestly don't really know what else I'd use one for now
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> vulkan
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> im going for 100wpm at 100% accuracy on monkeytype english 1k
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta type faster
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if i can do it in vr
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> that would be fun
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> closest i got was 98/97%
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's just going downhill now
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> the data backs me up'
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1212698312138817536/image.png?ex=65f2c850&is=65e05350&hm=30b069ee2cdeae62834c3bda85155e26ffb4b3438a0539408d05a2ff1045571b&
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i get worse as i type
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> Is this just for this session? I experience this for everything I do. My first few attempts will be decent but obviously warming up, then I'll perform very well for an attempt or two. Only downwards after that
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i need to become a kernel hacker
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah just the session
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i just did 1k
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You will need them if u have multiple render passes or multiple subpasses.
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> IMO they are probably the hardest topic in vulkan. U need to understand basically everything u need to know about parallelization in computers + graphic cards + it's a super unintuitive design. On CPUs you would never work with flags to describe memory operation orders. And also not all memory flags will work with all pipeline flags
10:52 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if this is a common human thing.
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> probably
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> The main idea is to hold up the pipeline until another subpass is done, right?
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well kind of xd
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The pipeline is always there
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's more about the order of commands inside it
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> Well yes. That's what I was talking about. Good enough until I have a need for it üòÑ
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I honestly still shot myself often when I think about it. It's just that if you FCK up, you can easily crash your gpu
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> . and it's also not very easy to debug and test out since u always need the full back end started to see if it worked
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Synchronization layers defs help here
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But even then I still often have to read the spec to fully understand the problem
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkAccessFlagBits.html
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Table 1.
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Something u should keep in mind xd
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ofc it also depends on how tryhard u want to optimize
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can often just lock the whole pipeline and it works xd
11:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> hack valgrand's anticheat so i can play league on linux in peace >:c
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> valgrand ?
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> oh vanguard
11:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah gg vanguard
11:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> i just woke up - i have my excuses!
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i only want to fix this bug with my new dac
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> im insisting upon a good morning for u
13:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ... just becone a riot employee and fix the client lol
13:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ... just become a riot employee and fix the client lol
13:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i've read about a story of a person that used a software for years and reported a single bug for years, after them not fixing it he applied for the company, got hired, fixed the bug, and handed in his notice immediatly after
13:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk if its true but its such a gigachad moment
13:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i've read about a story of a person that used a software and reported a single bug for years, after them not fixing it he applied for the company, got hired, fixed the bug, and handed in his notice immediatly after
13:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if you need to fix a bug that badly, then it must be worth more, than your current job
13:57 < bridge> <diariesvexar> .
14:44 < bridge> <xbt573> hi everyone
14:44 < bridge> <xbt573> i need to write external program which makes some actions on DDNet/Teeworlds server (for example, banning VPN players)
14:44 < bridge> <xbt573> is there any better solution to server communication than econ? any low-level protocol?
14:45 < bridge> <xbt573> patching server source code will take a long time for every server type i have
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> fifo ig
14:47 < bridge> <xbt573> it's no better than econ, i hate parsing human-readable stuff
14:48 < bridge> <xbt573> my current software is a wheelchair full of regexes for every server type
14:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> well either econ and fifo it is tbh
14:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> well either econ or fifo it is tbh
14:50 < bridge> <xbt573> what is fifo? üê∏
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D i had that question aswell 2 weeks a go "file input /output"
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> it allows sending external commands to your client
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> ddnet creates a fifo server on startup:
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> which you can then send commands to through a fifo client
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1212759000483893288/image.png?ex=65f300d5&is=65e08bd5&hm=fde32da742e9540476e014bacbeb1011089867d868912208c76a0ed024955c10&
14:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> sending "echo hello" to the fifo pipe, will execute that command
14:51 < bridge> <xbt573> oh, i thought you meant different fifo
14:51 < bridge> <xbt573> but... is it any different from econ?
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> DDNet implements DNSBL üôÇ
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> I wouldnt recommend doing it via FIFO
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> DDNet uses DNSBL üôÇ
14:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> i understood it as a way to send multiple different commands to the server - but using a DNS blacklist surely sounds like the way to go forban/blocklists
14:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> i understood it as a way to send multiple different commands to the server - but using a DNS blacklist surely sounds like the way to go for ban/blocklists
14:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> i understood it as a way to send multiple different commands to the server - but using a "i googled the name": "DNS-based Blackhole List"  surely sounds like the way to go for ban/blocklists
14:57 < bridge> <xbt573> it is the reason i'm searching better solution
14:57 < bridge> <xbt573> i already have some stuff made with econ, and i hate it
14:58 < bridge> <avolicious> DNSBL
14:59 < bridge> <avolicious> It works and is built on top of the most tested and used protocol out there
14:59 < bridge> <xbt573> vpn is only an example, i have other usecases
14:59 < bridge> <avolicious> Whats the use-case?
14:59 < bridge> <xbt573> oh, it's not dns based blackhole list? üê∏
14:59 < bridge> <avolicious> It is, but its based on DNS
14:59 < bridge> <avolicious> DNS is heavily tested every day
14:59 < bridge> <avolicious> it works
14:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> would be horrible if not tbh XD
15:00 < bridge> <xbt573> telegram/discord bridge, player data (nickname/version/ip address) accounting, message broadcaster
15:00 < bridge> <avolicious> You need a mix then
15:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> damn, feels like a project i could get workin on at some point
15:01 < bridge> <avolicious> We are using gRPC for this
15:01 < bridge> <avolicious> But its currently not built into DDNet
15:02 < bridge> <xbt573> another problem is i have different server types/flavors, like ddnet, vanilla teeworlds, fng, teeware, etc.
15:02 < bridge> <xbt573> hard to built into every source code tree
15:02 < bridge> <xbt573> hard to put into every source code tree
15:03 < bridge> <avolicious> gRPC
15:03 < bridge> <avolicious> vanilla teeworlds wont accept the change tho
15:03 < bridge> <avolicious> fng dont know
15:04 < bridge> <avolicious> teeware, i doubt
15:04 < bridge> <avolicious> ddnet most likely
16:00 < bridge> <zhn> –∞ —Ç–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ —Ç—ã –≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∏
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill just return the dac

21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u like long sci-fi movies with lot of ambience (like blade runner)
21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> you will love it
21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i LOVE it
21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz its my vibe of movie xD
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a must watch for sci-fi lovers anyway
21:05 < bridge> <teero777> btw i was wondering. is it illegal to scrape gpt 3.5 from the website? i mean the api costs money
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

21:07 < bridge> <teero777> on every gif i find it says teeworld instead of teeworlds
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> mildly annoying
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> maybe he didn't mean the game but the world instead!
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> he meant a specific server
