02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> how susceptible to bugs is swap on team 0?
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> dangerous move, no?
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> How do i play a submitted DDNet map from discord?
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/455392314173554688/778354639589998613
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> i've read that, but what do i do with the file that i'm given
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> use vote menu
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> tater doing god's work over here
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> what vote menu?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> what vote menu?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> i don't know what that is
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> esc > call vote
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> oh in-game
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> i have a file though, what do I do with a file
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> i have a file though, what do I do with a file?
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> start lan server in home screen
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> if file is from #üì¨submit-maps then it will be in vote menu on test server
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!Pixel> thank you
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd real life stories
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtff the log is still not filtered in F1
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btff the log is still not filtered in F1
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw the log is still not filtered in F1
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should be done before release probs
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @gerdoe can you pm me your config later? i want to test the text assert you get
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is not backend code so i dont see why i should not be able to reproduce it if it happens always for you
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @gerdoe are u also on nvidia btw? and do the crashes happen since a few days only? üòÑ
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @cheeser0613 does the crash not happen in ddnet 16.0.x?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> didnt happen
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Are the bench demo files used for anything?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> only on 16.1
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> but it does have a huge lag when i switch the windows
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so if u now select 16.0 it works?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> so it might be the driver problem
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> both version have huge lag when i switch windows but so far only 16.1 crash
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok do u have FSAA on?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> 0
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it uses the same GPU on both versions?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> purple text in f1
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974971241637245008/unknown.png
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its intel
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not nvidia
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is one maybe using nvidia the other intel?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> weird, just now i can change it to nvidia but now i cant change it
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we had a change to detect igpus, but they should still have less priority than real gpus
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I have some performance issues for my webgl renderer of tw maps, especially when editing. Are there optimizations implemented in tw's renderer ? I was thinking splitting vbos in chunks, or greedy meshing, idk
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I have some performance issues for my webgl renderer of tw maps, especially when editing. Are there optimizations implemented in tw's renderer ? I was thinking splitting vbos in chunks, or greedy meshing, or rendering only visible parts, idk
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well only rendering visible chunks sounds sane üòÑ
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> well I don't have chunks atm haha
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we should try out `-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error`
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its like a minor ubsan version just with trapping instructions instead of any real output
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no idea of the performance cost
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it works on mingw
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> generally speaking splitting vbos is not a good idea
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the gpu wants no buffer changes
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> better do more draw calls
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @k2d222 funnily enough I'm currently also writing a `twgpu` rust crate for rendering teeworlds stuff, currently I only have map rendering, but still need to optimize some stuff, am cpu bound right now ^^
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wgpu in action :poggers:
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga when release to test üòÑ
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> The thing is, I'm doing a map editor so a lot of mesh editing is going on and when editing e.g. the game layer with millions of tiles it hangs
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ~50-100ms per tile
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen maybe you can look into it if you have time, we still have so many hard to reproduce issues, and i kinda think not all asserts must be triggered by the statement but can be memory overflows or other bugs that just lead to them
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aaaaah soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Do you think it could be ported to wasm ?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, it also works on the web :)
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> always 2 steps ahead @Patiga !
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh yeah thats a hard mission you are on üòÑ
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could maybe allocate the whole map as one buffer
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and just disable index == 0
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gpu side
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @k2d222 so far on my approach, tilemaps are literally 2d textures on the gpu, so editing tiles could be quite easy ^^
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or just rebuild the index buffer
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how to reproduce? what is not filtered?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i get pretty much all dbg_msg messages
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Not Keks now that I know that I'm cpu bound I figured out that I need to work on envelopes, so far I just have the very naive approach of sampling the envelope with 0 knowledge each frame, with linear search through the points. when I turn off envelopes, I get roughly 50% more frames :d
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but I suppose I can swallow my pride and try to do the first release before the first planned refactor and actual optimizations
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh quads are also not insanly optimized on ddnet
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Not Keks yes, all dbg_msgs is intended
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tile layers maybe most
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then particles
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then text
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest still kinda sucks üòÑ
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but thats insane spam
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything with `log_info` and above, `dbg_msg` counts as `log_info`
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> older clients printed much less
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why cant we use console_log_level
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to hide some message, we can move it from `dbg_msg` to `log_debug` or `log_trace`
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should be able to use console_log_level
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with console_log_level, you can also enable log_debug or log_trace in f1
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but pretty much everything is written for dbg_msg üòÑ
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that was my rationale for including it
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so people can send more accurate logs when they have a problem
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why isnt Console Printing just one level higher?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its like before
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes i understand that
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but console_log_level could also be updated on fly and write old messages
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just fear that most ppls use f1 for reading chat messages
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and now it sends so much stuff, vulkan info, http infos
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe the vulkan stuff could be moved to log_debug?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd also like some filtering for log tag, so people can view only chat if they want
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, that would also be nice, but I couldn't figure out a nice design for this
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess one could just save all messages even though it might drop messages that are still shown(?)
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway then i'll move stuff to log_debug for now
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> another settings for f1 messages
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like cl_show_console_messages debug
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah oh
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't listen me xd
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> never
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before the GPU info was directly visible after client start, but the background menu map spams the loading now
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974992307831046154/unknown.png
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also stuff like this, is rarely useful probably
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974992604355784774/unknown.png
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> add redactor skin
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> i restart my pc and test again for few times i think it just something wrong with new nvidia driver

14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> gtx 1050 ti, doubt
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remember he is from china
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they have weird extra products there üòÑ
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> if tw cannot  it, then it's a chinese copy
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> if tw cannot recognise it, then it's a chinese copy
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think there is a gtx 1050 in china
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> nop im from malaysia
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> okx d
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are you on rc?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> doesn't matter, but the product, where it came from is all matters
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u have background map off
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since i have ur config now üòâ XD
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you even now half of my teefriends :o
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> know*
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> is there an api to get all the map information?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> like:  mapname, difficulty, mapper, stars, points release date etc
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> no api but you can use raw list at https://ddnet.tw/stats/
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wanted to make one, but there is one by TsFreddie: https://api.teeworlds.cn/ddnet/maps/Fiji
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (at the bottom)
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I stand corrected
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> üòÑ
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ahh really cool üôÇ
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> thansk
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> thanks
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> imagine KoG would have something like that :kekw:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Hmm, that's not up to date though
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> https://api.teeworlds.cn/ddnet/players/
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> 
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> the top 5 are correct with points
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> and the new map "Weapon Finals" are in the list
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The points are inaccurate
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> yea i will check it and track it
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see, I didn't know how TsFreddie gets the data, I thought he was scraping the website
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess I'll add an api now
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> üëÄ
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He might be scraping slower
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Similar to the players: https://ddnet.tw/players/?json2=deen
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> if you are a player who love stats and comapare each others i would be really cool
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, most players don't use APIs üòÑ
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah like that. I really want to re-do the site in a modern way
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> or like this: https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=deen
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> true
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> I try to create a stats bot for private usage and want to scrap KoG and ddnet servers/websites... but is much easier to scrap for ddnet
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should've asked for api before you started scraping
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I had it on my todo list for a while
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> i already asked twice for api but there is more work for KoG 2.0 right now maybe he will do it in the future... the problem with kog website is that is async is like you need to wait "a whole day" that the website got all the information to display
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't mean KoG, I meant for DDNet
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> ahhh
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (I have nothing to do with KoG)
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> yea ik
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 see, someone appreciates my website style of static stuff and only returning simple html!
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> static > dynamic for the 80% of the website xD
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (My idea of a modern website isn't as modern as you'd think. I'd probably do a php site, so it'd return simple html too)
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> Like news, maps, info, and much more can be static but sites like user profile need to get loaded dyn
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't have a function to get the actual server address we're connected to?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from game code
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> IClient::ServerAddress?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> or is that not updated?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just a random string that the user entered
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't tell you what the client ultimately connected to
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'll just add a method for it
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> you can just dl the database here https://ddnet.tw/stats/sql.js/ and run your own queries i guess
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> but tbh not sure how accurate it is or when it refreshes
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> better than scraping
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I guess happens early in the morning. That is the latest entry.
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/975088873900245082/unknown.png
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> updates once per day
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Setup the repo for the web map editor at https://github.com/k2d222/twwe
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> and a demo server is (sometimes) running at http://tw.thissma.fr (without tls, not setup yet)
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> (...and it even works on mobile üòÜ)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @KDaniel done: https://ddnet.tw/maps?json=Fiji
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, it's missing the game tiles, one second
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> Thanks, I will check it out if I'm home :)
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no responses here, rip
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not planned
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Could be awesome especially for racing
21:25 <+ScReeNy> Hey, ive been a bit inactive and found some weird behaviour while playing with a friend. Is it intended that you can finish maps twice in team 0? If so would be suprised, because it appears to be sortof breaking the team 0 ladder
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if you go finish and go back to the start, you can start a legitimate race twice
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hasn't it always been like that?
21:29 <+ScReeNy> It hasent been like this before as i remember. 
21:31 <+ScReeNy> well im talking about 1-2 years ago, the last times i did something similar in cheats
21:51 <+ScReeNy> mh i tested versions guess im wrong
