00:53 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm, the overhead for changing a map is huge. it has to be fully compressed in memory and recompressed, taking 2 seconds for some maps for me
00:53 <@deen> and memory is always low on ddnet servers =/
00:54 <@deen> could we maybe instead just put the configs inside the maps permanently and have a tool to easily extract/change them?
11:30 < Suki> Someone Herr?
12:40 < Prime> hi deen , is any limit for map file size ?
12:40 < Prime> for DDNet maps
12:42 < Prime> what is the largest map by the file size ? at this moment ?

13:09 <@deen> hi bye Prime =/
13:09 <@deen> I'm just too late, as usual
13:09 <@deen> Oh, and Suki was there too
13:26 < laxa> Hey guys
13:27 < laxa> I am so happy about something that I wanna brag about it :D
13:27 < laxa> I finally exploited a buffer overflow in a wargame challenge ^^
13:27 <@deen> cool
13:27 <@deen> now find and fix buffer overflows in DDNet!
13:28 < laxa> Wow, I am still really novice
13:28 < laxa> didn't even used shellcode ^^
13:28 < laxa> and for ddnet, I would need to learn a lot about networking and learn the teeworlds protocol
13:28 <@EastByte> cool laxa
13:29 < laxa> If you want, there is a really great french website that offers a wide range of chall, they have 12 wargames challenges
13:29 < laxa> You don't really need to understand french to do them ^^
13:29 <@EastByte> well you can post the link
13:29 < laxa> You need to register though
13:29 < laxa> the wargame are hosted on their server
13:30 < laxa> https://www.newbiecontest.org/index.php
13:30 <@deen> oh, i just noticed, the foot mod segfaults from time to time
13:30 <@deen> the only mod currently segfaulting
13:30 <@EastByte> laxa: btw. when you have to use shellcodes somewhere to succeede, notify me pls :)
13:31 <@EastByte> the case where you actually can use shellcode is pretty rare I think
13:34 < laxa> well
13:35 < laxa> next wg, I can't shellcode apparently
13:36 <@deen> i think i can save a lot of memory on the servers by normalizing the database
13:39 <@EastByte> normilizing normaly is done while planing the table structure
13:39 <@EastByte> not in production :P
13:40 <@deen> pff, i already have a plan to switch other the table structure without any server restarts
13:41 <@EastByte> good luck^^
13:42 <@deen> not going to do it now, just added to my todo list
13:44 <@EastByte> deen: http://nim-lang.org/docs/channels.html "Note: The current implementation of message passing is slow and does not work with cyclic data structures."
13:44 <@EastByte> is this a reason to not use channels?
13:44 <@deen> not sure, what are you trying to do?
13:44 <@deen> i haven't used them yet at all
13:44 <@EastByte> well communication between threads
13:44 <@EastByte> without using the unsafe shared heap
13:45 <@deen> if you don't need to transfer a lot of data or don't care much about performance, it's fine ai guess
13:45 <@deen> otherwise, I think Araq was working on something for better teamwork of threads
13:46 <@EastByte> hmm, channel read/write allows nonblock, so it should be fine
13:47 <@EastByte> I will just pass events/requests over channels, probably not much data
13:51 <@deen> sounds fine
15:08 <@deen> hi Chairn
15:08 <@EastByte> hellow Chairn 
15:09 < Chairn> hello guys
15:11 <@deen> !twp deen
15:11 < Nimda> deen is currently playing Hardcore 12 on server : DDNet GER2 - Brutal [DDraceNetwork].
15:12 < Chairn> !twp Chairn
15:12 < Nimda> Chairn is currently playing 3way on server : DDNet GER - DDmaX [DDraceNetwork].
15:12 <@EastByte> !twp east
15:12 < Nimda> No east found online.
16:25 < Sadale> creepy.
16:25 <@deen> Sadale: hi, what's creepy?
16:25 < Sadale> the !twp command
16:26 <@deen> how is that creepy?
16:26 < Sadale> not really. you could find him in teeworlds using search function anyway
16:26 <@deen> exactly :P
16:26 <@EastByte> nope, you have to use !twp first

19:42 < Chairn> deen: are you interested in a comparison feature to avoid what happend with Forris?
19:46 < Chairn_> oh great, just had a bsod
19:47 < Chairn_> so i dont know if i missed your answer or there was answer yet deen ^^
20:07 < emirp> hi deen
20:43 <@deen> Chairn_: yesw
21:04 < Chairn_> okay, for now, i just focus on game group, i dont think someone would be interested on other groups
21:05 < Chairn_> but not sure if i did it correctly
21:05 < Chairn_> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/771dd3d8e38946615258a6b95eacf1ebaa52a09c
21:08 <@deen> Chairn_: so you're implementing the comparison in the client?
21:08 <@deen> and just counting the number of different tiles, hm
21:09 <@deen> i think our imagination in this channel was an online or command line tool with a visual output
21:09 <@deen> so you can see which parts of a map were changed
21:09 <@deen> Maybe this could be used and then just do image comparison: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11475
21:14 < Chairn_> its just a start
21:14 <@deen> but i don't like the idea of having to start the client for it =/
21:14 < Chairn_> im trying to make something kinda like github, or winmerge
21:14 <@deen> ok
21:14 < Chairn_> that just shows the different from both maps on game groups
21:18 < Chairn_> hm, doesnt seem to show tele numbers in the tw-map-gen from CHoupom
21:31 < nuborn> hi
21:35 <@deen> hi
21:37 < nuborn> I just wondered, would you interested in adding client prediction for laser and shotgun?
21:37 <@deen> yes
21:38 <@deen> and for teleporters: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/237
21:38 < nuborn> ok, nice. teleporters would be nice too. and they could help with predicting weapons
21:39 <@deen> would all be great for high ping players
21:39 <@deen> I'm also wondering how new players with high ping should find out about antiping
21:46 < Chairn_> you can make the server send a message to the client when it connects and ping is over 100
21:49 <@deen> that's annoying for people who play with high ping all the time
21:51 < Chairn_> only for people with less than 100 points :D?
21:51 < Chairn_> not a real solution though
21:52 < nuborn> maybe the client could print the suggestion itself,  when the it connects to a high ping ddnet server and antiping is disabled. at least the first few times the player joins high ping servers
21:52 < nuborn> when it*
