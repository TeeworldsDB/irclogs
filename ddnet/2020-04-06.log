02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> is some dev here?
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> might need some help with an issue in my game 😄
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> hello i am dev
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> how can i help
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> well
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> just yesterday i installed ubuntu on my laptop
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> 19.10
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> so, when i play ddnet fullscreen it runs normally
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> when i minimize it, it happens some weird video issues
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> graphic issues
03:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> dont minimize
03:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ez fix
05:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Smart af
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pepe f1 -> gfx_resizable 0
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it should default to 0, until someone fixes the SDL code, which is a mess
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 that would be weird, I build it with --with-darwinssl
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well there was that one guy in #general and I also downloaded and checked it. Does the static library maybe use the builtin libcrypto dynamically?
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you are no longer allowed to link with libcrypto on macOS, maybe there is a way to build libcurl with the modern apple crypto apis or maybe we can build and bundle openssl
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen why are we linking statically anyway? I think we should include a framework like we do with sdl
11:03 <@deen> because I build that myself and for sdl i just take the prepared one
11:03 <@deen> no idea how build curl into a framework for mac os
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well there is a ./
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ./MacOSX-Framework script shipped along with curl
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't work anymore in catalina but maybe it still works on whatever old version of macOS you build on
11:18 <@deen> I cross-compile
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, hmm when you have time can you check if secure transport gets enabled correctly while building?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that script looks pretty simple too, it should be easy enough to modify to work with osxcross
12:05 <@deen> should I use --with-secure-transport instead of --with-darwinssl?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> --with-darwinssl enables secure transport
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what SDK are you building with btw?
12:07 <@deen>   SSL:              no      (--with-{ssl,gnutls,nss,mbedtls,wolfssl,schannel,secure-transport,mesalink,amissl} )
12:08 <@deen> osxcross
12:08 <@deen> so apparently darwinssl is not enough (anymore?)
12:08 <@deen> will try with secure-transport instead
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but for using osxcross you first get a sdk
12:08 <@deen> good question, don't remember
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which version of libcurl is this? on 7.69.1 it seems it's still --with-darwinssl
12:09 <@deen> 7.67.0
12:09 <@deen> i checked with --help
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it is --with-secure-transport on that version
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have experience with vulkan
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not much, I did render a triangle
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im swimming in verbosity and i get a segfault no idea why xDD
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> vulkan is VERY low level
12:12 <@deen> hm, apparently secure-transport also doesn't work. let me try 7.69.1
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your SDK might be too old too, I think secure transport got a major overhaul at 10.8
12:17 <@deen> ah
12:17 <@deen> any tip for which one to get?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well i'm not completely sure with regards to compatibility, but I think you can compile with any sdk >= <lowestversionwesupport> and set the deployment target to <lowestversionwesupport>
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Turns out curl's configure checks for /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework which obviously doesn't exist when I'm cross-compilint
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how did you fix it?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> changed the path manually in the configure file for now
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure how this can be fixed properly, maybe just get rid of the check?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try to do a patch to curl later
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, does the SDK include Security.framework?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting, wouldn't know how to fix it either though, it'd be a little bit of a hack to check whether the CFLAGS line has a -isysroot
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Like this I guess: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/5189
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just a sec, need to install my own SDL framework to test
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes excessive fiddling just to get things to link against my copy of SDL2
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the curl change does work
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast when I compile on macOS, I'm not sure if the version you compile will work
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks for checking
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bois i still cant read c++ errors is there some sort of tool that is more noob friendly when it comes to linker errors?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/696741495306190938/unknown.png
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean is it even possible to read the error out of this without looking at the code?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon it usually means you forgot to define a method of `IClient` that you declared in `CClient`
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> hello misters nerds and hackers! Is there any way I can know how many of DDNet servers users play with vanilla client?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> version number maybe
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> check for clientid=0
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Ooookay! Can I have log pas to DDNet database now ?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sry for sarcastics, but how it could help me?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then the answer is no
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> logs cant be public
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> true! But what about some "funny" statistics or something (you call it)
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I just wonder why devs care about vanilla support so much
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> new players had vanilla client ofc
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have some statistics script that you want to run on the actual servers, you can give it to me to run it on the actual logs
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> first you find vanilla then ddnet
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thank you, @heinrich5991 , I will return when I have some
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i looked at the stats on my server last year and totaled everyones last-used version number https://pastebin.com/2DC5zJni @BannZay
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> outdated but similar to what ur asking about
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why cant vanilla client just be ddnet
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> bloat
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> devs care about vanilla support because alot of people are still using vanilla
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt ddnet just vanilla but better
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> are there features exclusive to vanilla
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there arent but some people prefer vanilla client
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do u need ddnet features in vanilla client
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why not
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> bloat
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if ppl want to see other servers they dont see weird -999 times
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> antiping/64player support
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and skins and quality of life changes
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> skins might be a reason to not use ddnet client
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just enable vanilla skins only tho lol, it's what i do
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u can add or remove whatever skins u want from the game files but some people dont know or dont want to bother
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/696749238385639554/unknown.png
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 1 click fix
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u need to find it first
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so like 5min effort
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if ur new
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> most common reason to not use ddnet client is because its laggier i think
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby did you try continuing the bisect? ^^
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no i deleted the folder is there an easy way to resume closer to where i left off
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can start from two commits that are closer together
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you just need a bad commit and a good commit, closer the better
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could test whether 0a9f291 is bad
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it is, then we have a bad commit
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how to test
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> build it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> see if if makes your fans spin
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git checkout 0a9f291`, test it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> clone the repo then git checkout? ok
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need to re-clone it if you already have it somewhere
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git worktree add /tmp/bisect`
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I only have one git repository for teeworlds and ddnet)
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont have the newest version ill redo it
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (let's note down commit IDs before deleting this time)
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 1 for ddnet 1 for teeworlds, the branches just diverged so much
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have two worktrees for that
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still the same repository
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/696745007453044737
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but is there a tool that tells me which method?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> makes cherry-picking easier
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, never used worktrees
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's basically another checkout with the same repository
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> very useful if you're in the middle of writing a feature and need to test some PR
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon the method you just added/renamed/changed in some way
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea so looking at the code
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i have build errors since hours and there is some code i touched 😄
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon C++ errors are notoriously shit, there is no tool that makes them better
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im talking in general
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sad
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 build one pls thx
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the information is lost, the compiler is the one that's supposed to handle this
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i downloaded it ill build now
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby 👍
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if you ask the compiler people it's the standards committees jo, and if you ask the standards committee it's the users job not to be a moron
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh i suck at this job
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon a clean rebuild is usually helpful as it might be giving a warning you are ignoring
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did it
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also compile with -Wall -Werror
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is that default in tw ?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe even -Weverything if you have clang
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I thought -Wall -Werror was default but I never get compile errors, how2enable?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Weverything` is useless
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it activates warnings that are not helpful
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon that  error is pretty sane for c++
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ..
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` is active for ddnet, I think @Learath2
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh no
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> still not very helpful
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Wall -Wextra`
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u need to google vtable
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Werror` on CI
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> -Weverything I suggested because it enables some weird static analysis, might catch what chiller is missing
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im sure vtable is some sort of virtual function table
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why cant it drop a func name
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon are u using clang or gcc
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think clang is known for clearer errors
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cc --version
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :saddo:
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cc (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gcc
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the easiest things to check is the virtual constructor and destructor, if they are virtual that is
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well the issue was a missing = 0; on a virtual
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on a pure virtual
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i gues
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea sad c++ seems to be evil
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the more bash i write the more annoyed i am by c++ 😄
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I love it when my strings get accidentally split by spaces when I forget to quote them
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i love how u only have one argument :p
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shellcheck is ur friend ull never forget to quote
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in python, the compiler does that for me
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hotkey in vim to lint using shellcheck is bae
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no more accidental errors
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fans still spin, am going to test again with working version rl quick to make sure its nothing else i have running
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and fans spun down once i started playing with old client
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991 can i continue bisecting from that commit?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cppcheck is a decent static analyzer
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby yes, you mark that one bad, then you checkout the good one and mark that one good
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im nub at git
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> installed cppcheck thanks will look further into it when ill get stuck on something again @Learath2
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @onby what do you want to do exactly?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> continue bisecting versions of ddnet between the commit heinrich just sent ^ and the working version
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git checkout <commithash>
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> tho
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git log
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then search for the current hash
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> last time it was like git bisect start and  i just typed 10.6.2
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and scroll up
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idr
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/eo
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @onby those are the hashes following 10.6.2
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git checkout fe05f0dfbc92bf440e80504777b02a6f49132e0d
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to step one further
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> commit ec5ede7633ed9bde1d1673f5dbb92f654030a0e8 (tag: 10.6.2)
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby>     Version 10.6.2
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess thats the one i need
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do i have to git bisect start
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which commit works for you?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or which version?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git bisect start
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 10.6.2 works
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git bisect good <your good version>
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and master doesnt?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git bisect bad <version with fans spinning>
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it works but fans spin
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok ty and i can put the hash of the commit in its place?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or the release tag works as well
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> git bisect bad 0a9f291
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Bisecting: 102 revisions left to test after this (roughly 7 steps)

18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you check that 0a9f291 is bad?

18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then continue testing
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do u think it could have something to do with the way its compiled

18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then i quit and opened the working one and the fps is 350 not 200 and the spining starts to decrease

18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> git stash them and keep going

18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have local changes because it doesn't compile without them
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> does stash mean i will not have to do the changes again
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stash means you can get them back

18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ooo ok cool
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Git stash never worked for me...
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always lose my changes and get pissed
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw dont remove or modify client.m
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git stash is best
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The way it starts the client could indeed be the issue as it actually messes with the stack
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm? old versions didn't have it I think @Learath2
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rly?lol now im curious what its doing
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and git stash worked
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think @onby's version doesn't have it
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's fine, it it doesn't have it then don't add it and if it does have it don't remove it to get it compiling

18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what is this hacks
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the old client.m starts the client from a NSApplication event
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wtf
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> NSA 👀
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus actually blocking in the callback which might be affecting performance
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the new and improved client.m no longer does all that insane stuff
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh wow after a couple more bisects this version finally has the old style of text font
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and it seems to be better
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just play version 902 :p
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont use mac
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont like sdl1
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> install arch and install the ddnet package
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> install hackintosh lmao
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS is so sooooo soooooooo painful
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> om
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what should i do if this version seems to be the halfway point between working and not
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the fps is noticeably better than last bisect
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> imagine not allowing people to use your ssl library thus not allowing people to use TLS1.3
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fans spin only a little bit
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 admit it u slowly become big 🍎  boi
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby did u make sure settings are the same
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its same settings_ddnet.cfg i have cl_save_settings 0 always
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and what does it mean fans spinning? are u not limiting the cpu ?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i limit ddnet to 1000hz
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it means the fans spin
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you are only allowed to use the ssl library through apples shitty Secure Transport API which doesn't support anything new
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and if the same settings cause no spinning on ddnet 10.6.2 and spinning on 10.6.7 then there is a problem no?

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> opengl best
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah the opengl3 renderer is great for performance
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> onbgygl3
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should allow opengl 4.5
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on those who can
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still can't believe the bugs we have in it... Imagine failing to render 2d graphics in 2020
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's shameful
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't need any opengl 4.5 features

18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [11:57 AM] onby: what should i do if this version seems to be the halfway point between working and not
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [11:57 AM] onby: the fps is noticeably better than last bisect
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but fps seems less than 10.6.2
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets use all the shiny new things

18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 18.3.6
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> does that point to there being two things that cause reduced fps
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> should i just mark it as good for now
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon lol
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arcane laptop
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby take a note of the version
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually the exact SHA
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then mark it bad if you want to bisect further
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks

19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it almost feels like there are two things reducing fps

19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby need the last good as well
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pureos has a own kernel @Learath2 ?

19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe i should switch phone

19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to note down the last commit that was marked good and the last commit that was marked bad
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. if you never marked a version good before, it's the good version you started with (was it 10.6.2?)

19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont know whether to mark the final bisect as good or bad
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> since the fps is like half as much as the version before it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but the fans dont spin
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so both may be bad in some way? if i understand the output

19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this guy is stupid
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> "P.s.: some of you might consider it as "cheat" or something but the serverside solution is already there - you cannot see distant players. But yea, this change might lead to advantage until serverside anticheat is not good enough"
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i hope thats trolling
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its a thing in fng
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt it
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or is it only in noby fng
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ban
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> server will never detect zooz
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> :D
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the one on my fng is slightly different but its on all servers
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and yeah detecting it is basically impossible
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean if he really wanted to he could just use a custom client and remove zooz
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and if this guy knows that it will be something that has to be detected by an anti cheat
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then he knows its a cheat
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> well he already did
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ez modify 1 line of code for zooz on all server
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> My own problem:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> I play with the cl_dummy_hammer setting, what means my tee always aims at my "dummy" one. But there is other tees where i cannot automatically aim at which renders game at least uncomfortable for playing
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> General problem:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> Ridiculous client side limitations leads to client without aimbot
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> I consider aimbot as a graphics setting, which should NOT be limited by any gameplay mode (as dynamic camera is)
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u rendered other tees as ur dummy could u have free aimbot
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how would you do extensions to the demo format?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @BannZay apply this patch to latest ddnet
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/696787048425717820/zoom-unlock.patch
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git apply zoom-unlock.patch
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 in vanilla?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so its allowed to post cheats here now?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 please remove it
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @Ryozuki wtf i thought it was a joke
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I look away for one second :P
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yeah for vanilla
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991 so do u think the problem is in the two commits i found
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> > and if this guy knows that it will be something that has to be detected by an anti cheat
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @onby , actually this something should be handled by game server but surely not "detected by anti cheat". And also whats wrong with customization/setting up your client? I dont like a lot "by default" stuff in DDNet, that is why Ive been photoshoping, learning setting commands, even pushed some PRs to make game fit my needs. In return got called "stupid". Comeee on, man
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why bring up anticheat
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if what ur suggesting isnt a cheat
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ban
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> also u can zooz in ddnet
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and theres nothing wrong with customizing ur client as long as ur not doing it to get an unfair advantage over other players
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which u r
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I just wanted to point out to a thing which was some sort of cheat of implementing feature. Its a dirty hack
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> just dont render far tee`s
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but let me configure fucking setting
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> all servers already do this for bandwidth reason
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but thats not a solution
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> because its still like getting dyncam in every direction at once that doesnt shake
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont render  at client, mister
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wat xd
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the server decides which tees to send to each client based on how far they are
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont render  in client, mister
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and ok  i cant call u stupid but i can call the idea stupid
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, I dont mean you any of ways
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but can you explain whats wrong with the idea itself?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its considered cheating in pretty much every pvp mode on tw
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the vanilla client cant zoomout
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> okay, I proposed solution. Either do it client or server side. Just let player see only close enemies
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes but what im saying is
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> every server already does this
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> maybe rander some lines of vision
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u can see a tiny bit further than dyn range, in every direction, on standard servers
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which isnt as overpowered as seeing every tee ofc but its still a huge advantage
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so whats the problem of removing this advantage?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> without touching zoom?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how is it possible
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> cmon
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you kidding me?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ur not reading
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> "just let players see only close enemies"
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i said already
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> every server does this
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it helps but it does not fix the problem
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> server doesnt know about dyn
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so u have to send in all directions
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and then u can abuse it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ^
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, thats why was talking about clientside solution
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and even on modified servers that do understand dyn and try to account for it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you cant modify old clients
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its still a cheatxd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you can modify new clients too
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont touch serveer
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean the general idea might actually work
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it wasn't in the PR
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea, I just called to implement it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how can it actually work
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i can imagine how it would work but i cant imagine how it wouldnt still be cheaty
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> just render tee`s what would u see without zoom
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nothing more nothing less
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so ur getting dyncam that isnt harder to control like dyncam would be
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> =cheat
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then u cant use dyn anymore
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> In general I dont understand dyncam, in particular my sentence still valid
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just because u dont like dyn it doesnt mean it should be removed lmao
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> dyncam 1. comes with every client and 2. doesnt allow u to see any more than anyone else
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> In general I dont understand dyncam in fng, in particular my sentence still valid
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @abcqwerty why would i joke
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it just changes where u can see
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how is ur sentence still valid
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> server doesnt know about dyn
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont touch server at al
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wat
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> his idea is for the client to only show the tees that a dyner would see, but with zoomout
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> client side anti cheat isnt possible wtf
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but thats still a cheat lol
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> omfg
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it sounds more like a limitation that the client would impose, like it currently does by not allowing zoom
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i have a question why is shotgun beyond death allowed on the solo server ?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> just render tee`s what would u see without zoom
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nothing more nothing less
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> where is cheat?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 2:24 PM] onby: so ur getting dyncam that isnt harder to control like dyncam would be
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:24 PM] onby: =cheat
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby only render tees that you would see without dyncam
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can just modify the client to cheat
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is what @BannZay is proposing
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this would work and this could be implemented
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well thats gonna piss off most players on instagib modes i think
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> if you move dyncam right, then render litle further right tees
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:26 PM] onby: 2:24 PM] onby: so ur getting dyncam that isnt harder to control like dyncam would be
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:24 PM] onby: =cheat
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there are tradeoffs that come with using dyncam that make it fair
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they cant aim as fast with it for example
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u could make the server aware of dyncam right
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> only if the player has standard mouse settings like max distance, deadzone etc
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant modify old clients
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if u change one of those things then the server cant reliably tell whether someone has dyncam or not
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> rip
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> oh do clients only send the angle
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they send position
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but still
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> oh but they wouldnt send the mouse settings
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> only x,y position of the cursor relative to tee
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, hope my idea not that bad as my communication skills. So I hope someday someguy implement unlock zoom in DDNet for us
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I understood the idea, and yes, it could be implemented without dyncam at least
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> communication is fine
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, communication seems to not have worked for the longest part, I think
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby which commit did you determine from the bisect?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as for me I have never used dyncam, since turned it off after client installation
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:23 PM] onby: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/2a1bf9316536f63b76b8cf27535d5f796830007f
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/66f6f16e81520350ece56b8937ac043fc5a308be
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:23 PM] onby: the problem seems to be one of these?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think those have any way of being the issue
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you try compiling one of these and the commit after one of these?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there should be a significant change if this was the issue
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ` | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI`
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i will try in a bit
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and if not then il try to bisect for the other bug
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> hi,
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I made a pr on ddnet7 and the github action have some problems (MacOS debug mode)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Anyone know how to fix this? I have no plan about github action
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/pull/89/checks?check_run_id=560400443
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Trafalgar Law master branch is currently broken, needs a fix (that was recently pushed to teeworlds by Ryozuki and to ddnet by deen)
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby you can checkout the commit before that with ~ and see if that works better
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would love to debug this too but teeworlds and ddnet always made my macbook pro fans spin
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (design failure by apple, this computer so much as gets toasty it starts making sounds like a vacuum cleaner
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> )
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how do i use ~
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and yeah ill try today
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `<commit sha>~`
