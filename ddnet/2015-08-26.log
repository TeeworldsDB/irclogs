00:10 < Chairn> he did it again :(
00:11 < Chairn> probabnly just a joke though
00:11 <@deen> well of course
00:11 <@deen> no one reasonable would upload a map forris posts
00:11 <@deen> also, use [code] instead of [c]
00:11 < Chairn> but at least my code works :D
00:12 < Chairn> but very incomplete for now, game layers is compared, but not printing, still have a lot of work
00:12 <@deen> ok, but still nice
00:12 < Chairn> im surprised it didnt take more than 1 sec to compare all tiles
00:15 < Mahdi> Okay guys, thanks :) Have fun!
00:20 < Chairn> okay, that was a real troll :D
00:20 < Chairn> first tele is on start, out is at map's end :D
00:25 < Learath2> was reading around in the forums and found this "wanna play them? come to ddrock official server (with official DDMax license by Tsin)"
00:25 < Learath2> Tsin is handing out licenses now :P

04:44 <@deen> got them built on the main platforms
04:44 <@deen> Only Android remaining
04:44 <@deen> oh, and i just rebased sdl2-try3, but only after building the versions, oops
09:28 < danstaaar> Hey everyone! :)
09:28 < danstaaar> I was here a couple of weeks ago with a problem regarding the server settings, and got great help!
09:30 < danstaaar> I was also wondering if there was the possibility to include a sample config file with the server that contains all commands, sorted by function (server, game settings, map settings, debug settings etc.) with their default value
09:30 < danstaaar> aaaand I'm working on that. Any chance that anyone else is interested in that? ;)
09:40 < danstaaar> Well, it sure is quiet here..
09:41 < danstaaar> Another question, as soon as anyone sees it:
09:42 < danstaaar> Is there a possibility to split the configuration to several files? Can I "include" other config files or something?
10:11 <@heinrich5991> danstaaar: yes!
10:12 <@heinrich5991> you can use "exec foobar.cfg" to execute foobar.cfg
10:12 < danstaaar> Ahh nice! That helps a lot! Thx bro
10:12 < danstaaar> ... and that is platform independent, right? ^^
10:15 <@heinrich5991> yes
11:55 <@deen> danstaaar: yes, we already have a sample config for the next ddnet release
11:55 <@deen> but you can improve it!
11:55 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/autoexec_server.cfg
11:58 < danstaaar> Ahh, ty deen! I'll look into it
11:58 < danstaaar> wow that would have been helpful
11:58 < danstaaar> Would you mind including that in the default server download?
12:00 <@EastByte> dm tdm 16 players, yay
12:00 <@deen> yes, that's the plan
12:00 <@deen> for the next release
12:00 <@EastByte> dm1*
12:01 <@deen> I
12:01 < danstaaar> Sweet! :)
12:01 <@deen> heinrich5991: can we get this working and then release the new version? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/296
12:01 <@deen> EastByte: oh, and your demo sort
12:01 <@EastByte> I think I can finish it until this evening
12:02 <@EastByte> do we need it earlier? :p
12:02 <@deen> as early as heinrich5991's PR works for me :P
12:02 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: take your time
12:02 <@deen> I don't know why it didn't work, maybe someone else can test
12:04 <@deen> i think sdl2 is still too early to release and others can't enter some characters either
12:05 <@EastByte> aaand I just broke my statsbot
12:06 <@EastByte> !twp east
12:06 < Nimda> No east found online.
12:06 <@EastByte> having arch linux in chroot on debian isn't the best idea

12:41 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master fe22eda def: Hide console window on Windows by default
12:53 <@deen> hi Savander 
12:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: there's a better way of hiding the console, I think
12:54 <@heinrich5991> namely: set the flag in the executable header that you're a gui application
12:54 <@heinrich5991> (but I'd recommend logging to a file instead by default)
12:55 <@EastByte> you can set a linker flag for that
12:55 <@EastByte> but then we can't enable it afterwards
12:55 < Savander> hi deen 
12:55 <@heinrich5991> "/SUBSYSTEM:windows /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup"
12:55 < Savander> i forgot to disable autodemorecorder
12:55 < Savander> on my servers
12:55 < Savander> in 2 days, 10 gb of demos
12:55 < Savander> ;b
12:55 < Savander> fuck.
12:56 < Savander> :D
12:56 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: but right now the console shows and then vanishes :) not ideal at least
12:56 <@EastByte> Savander: so you are playing 24h a day?
12:56 < Savander> no
12:56 < Savander> on servers
12:56 < Savander> auto_demo_record
12:56 < Savander> 10 servers making demos
12:56 <@EastByte> ah
12:57 < Savander> (im playing 48h a day)
13:41 < Savander> deen,  after pressing few time "ctrl + v" on windows in chat, client crashes.
13:41 < Savander> sdl2
13:41 < Savander> oh sorry
13:41 < Savander> first time works
13:41 < Savander> second not
14:11 < Savander> ohm?
14:11 < Savander> on debug mode
14:11 < Savander> it doesn't crashed.
14:15 < danstaaar> Ahh, a Heisenbug!
14:28 < Soreu> deen: I figured out what causes this bug with switch-freeze / switch-deep being darker than normal entities, you have sceen on skype
14:41 <@heinrich5991> deen: I fixed config_store_d
14:41 <@heinrich5991> can you try it now, so I can rebase?
14:52 < o_be_one> supp'
15:01 <@deen> heinrich5991: but i want people to be able to enable it in the client
15:02 <@heinrich5991> ah ok
15:02 <@deen> Savander: i've seen, your "!                              Teeworlds.pl" servers have a lot of players^^
15:02 < Savander> yea
15:02 < Savander> hahaha
15:02 < Savander> it works!
15:02 <@deen> more than all of ddnet sometimes
15:02 < Savander> it's nice way to test
15:03 < Savander> my VPS
15:03 <@EastByte> ^^
15:03 < Savander> xD
15:03 < Savander> 2$ per month
15:03 <@EastByte> so many players and no ddos attacks
15:03 <@EastByte> that's how it shoould be
15:03 < Savander> OVH 
15:03 < Savander> cheapest server..
15:03 < Savander> xd
15:03 <@EastByte> wait
15:03 < Savander> hmm?
15:03 <@EastByte> rly?
15:03 < Savander> what
15:03 <@deen> EastByte: from how I've seen the feedback about DDNet, I bet if we get on Steam we will be DDoSed into oblivion by all the TW vanilla people
15:04 <@EastByte> when I tested the 2$ servers at ovh, the ping was extremely unstable
15:04 < Savander> cuz
15:04 < Savander> i have this server about 1 year
15:04 <@deen> i don't think i've ever read the word "cancer" so often in a day^^
15:04 < Savander> and i did a lot of issues
15:04 < Savander> i mean, i reported
15:04 < Savander> :PP
15:04 <@EastByte> nice
15:04 < Savander> from, unstable network
15:04 <@EastByte> I should try that aswell^^
15:04 < Savander> to uncontrolled restarting my VPS
15:05 < Savander> and now, it works really good
15:05 < Savander> ;D
15:05 < Savander> roft, i know how "virtual" in c++ works!
15:05 < Savander> im proud of myself! :D
15:05 <@EastByte> virtual calls ftw
15:06 < Savander> how many people on teeworlds.pl?
15:07 < Savander> btw
15:07 < o_be_one> Savander: VPS or RunAbove ?
15:07 < Savander> o_be_one, VPS
15:07 < Savander> it's funny, because
15:07 < Savander> my servers recorded demos whole the time
15:07 < Savander> ( i forgot to disable it)
15:07 < o_be_one> perf was too bad 1 year ago, ram was aweful on it ...
15:07 < Savander> and i doesn't cause lags
15:07 < o_be_one> omg
15:08 < o_be_one> debian 7 ?
15:08 < Savander> yes
15:08 <@EastByte> what's perf?
15:08 < o_be_one> crazy ..
15:08 <@EastByte> iirc ovh want to get rid of the classic vps
15:08 < o_be_one> EastByte: performance ? like 512 ram and 1 share vcpu
15:08 <@EastByte> k
15:08 < Savander> hmm? I'm really not experienced in this
15:08 <@EastByte> I only know it was OpenVZ
15:08 < o_be_one> btw its openvz
15:09 <@EastByte> :p
15:09 < o_be_one> ^^
15:09 < o_be_one> maybe is on an empty node .. ?
15:09 <@EastByte> o_be_one: on a german hoster I run arch linux in chroot of debian 7
15:09 < o_be_one> cause when ive tried, it was just not possible to keep it lol
15:09 < o_be_one> lol EastByte crazy x)
15:10 < Savander> o_be_one,  its to mee?
15:10 < Savander> i don't know, i have this server since July 2014
15:10 < o_be_one> Sadale: what ? about empty node ? Yes im just saying that its possible you are hosted on an empty node
15:10 < Sadale> o_be_one, wrong highlight. you noob =p
15:10 < o_be_one> oh i'm able to see it i think, can you tell me ip :D ?
15:11 < o_be_one> Sadale: x)
15:11  * Sadale ties o_be_one up as a punishment
15:11 <@heinrich5991> deen: could you try config_store and config_retrieve?
15:11 < Savander> 92.222.181.62
15:11 < Savander> or savander.pl /youstats.pl /teeworlds.pl
15:11 < Savander> doesn't matter xd
15:11 < o_be_one> Savander: you love PL ?
15:11 < Savander> im from poland
15:11 < Savander> ^^
15:12 < o_be_one> oh nice, theres awesome teams of OVH in PL :p
15:12 < Savander> ^^>
15:12 < o_be_one> Project MAnager of RunAbove is from and in PL ^^

15:12 < o_be_one> Oles, the owner of OVH, is from PL :p
15:12 < Savander> btw
15:12 < Savander> what is RunAbove?
15:13 < o_be_one> RunAbove is cloud solution (OpenStack) from ovh, but it's a lab to test futur products of OVH at cheaper cost :p
15:13 < Savander> ah
15:13 < o_be_one> i love how it works, and im affected to this :)
15:13 <@EastByte> then my ddnet eur vps was RunAbove
15:14 < Savander> you're working in OVH as i can  suppose?:D
15:14 < Savander> runabove is something like AWS  (amazon web service?)
15:14 < o_be_one> yes
15:15 < Savander> runabove has more stable network than OpenVZ ?:PP 
15:16 < o_be_one> more perf yes
15:16 < o_be_one> for network i cant state actually, its different
15:16 < Savander> okay
15:16 < Savander> but, what with my servers?
15:16 < o_be_one> but it go througt VAC to, so same antiddos
15:17 < Savander> On empty node?^^
15:17 < Savander> server*
15:17 < o_be_one> well i havent all tools actually, im getting them
15:17 < Savander> :)
15:17 < o_be_one> ive tried to find you, not found on what i have, but i'm sure i'll be able to find you soon :p
15:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: it works!
15:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: great, thanks for fixing
15:18 <@deen> EastByte: now I'm just waiting for your PR and then release :P
15:19 <@deen> has been pretty long since last release
15:19 < Savander> deen, you checked copy/paste issue? :D IN debug mode it works
15:19 < Savander> in release mode, not :D
15:19 <@deen> Savander: i think it's a windows issue
15:19 <@deen> it worked on linux
15:19 <@deen> and sdl2 will not be in the release
15:19 < Savander> yea i know
15:19 < Savander> but, im just curious
15:19 <@deen> have to get all the things fixed and wait for Learath2's autoupdater update
15:19 < Savander> why in debug mode
15:19 < Savander> it works good
15:19 <@deen> Savander: compile it in release mode
15:19 <@deen> maybe it works too
15:19 <@deen> and my build is just broken?
15:19 < Savander> okay
15:20 <@deen> maybe a problem with the 64 or 32 bit versions of sdl2 too
15:20 < Savander> deen, your build
15:20 < Savander> is broken
15:20 < Savander> i think, works for me now
15:20 < Savander> in my builkd
15:20 <@deen> Savander: you build 64bit?
15:20 <@deen> and downloaded 32bit?
15:20 < Savander> nope
15:20 < Savander> i downloaded 64
15:21 <@deen> you build with visual studio?
15:21 < Savander> mingw
15:21 <@deen> weird, me too
15:21 < Savander> tell me how to check
15:21 < Savander> build
15:21 < Savander> i mean, 32 or 64 
15:21 <@deen> try downloading 32bit, i think it will work :P
15:21 < Savander> i don't know if i build it in 32 or 64 bits, :PPPPP
15:22 < Savander> how i can check this xD?
15:24 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'll rebase it today, is that enough?
15:26 < Savander> ok deen 
15:26 < Savander> i compiled it into 32 bit version
15:26 < Savander> don't know how to compile it to 64. srry :C
15:27 <@deen> heinrich5991: i hope, I'll keep testing now =)
15:27 <@deen> Savander: yeah, you need mingw64
15:28 <@heinrich5991> deen: testing what? maps? :)
15:28 <@deen> heinrich5991: i don't know, read the code, try out everything
15:28 <@heinrich5991> ah – you're tlaking about my pull request
15:28 <@deen> heinrich5991: when you rebased it i will pull and set it up on the official ddnet servers
15:28 <@deen> yes
15:28 < Savander> hahha deen  weird
15:29 < Savander> if i copied long message
15:29 <@heinrich5991> the quick summary is:
15:29 < Savander> and i want to paste it on chat
15:29 < Savander> it'll send this message in few parts
15:29 <@heinrich5991> there's a new field in the map info (which is a datafile item), named settings
15:29 < Savander> without enter
15:29 <@heinrich5991> it's the data index of the settings blob
15:29 < Soreu> Savander: still better than too-long-message on android, where then it displays only like last word
15:29 < Soreu> xd
15:29 <@heinrich5991> the settings blob is a zero-terminated zero-separated list of commands to be executed on map load
15:30 < Savander> xd
15:30 <@heinrich5991> checking whether the settings are present is done by checking the length of said item
15:30 <@heinrich5991> all that is race-compatible

15:51 <@deen> Anyone want to fix a layer rendering bug?
15:51 <@deen> Soreu found it :P
15:52 < Soreu> together with BannZay btw
15:52 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/rendering.jpg
15:52 <@deen> depending on the order of layers the half-transparent tiles get rendered differently
15:53 <@deen> forcing a render layer would be the easiest fix, but would be better to figure out why this happens
15:54 < Soreu> kinda not only these half-transparent - these "empty" from game/front layer (very bottom) also are darker then
15:55 < Soreu> (id 241+ etc)
15:56 <@deen> huh, right
15:56 < Soreu> so every entity depending on if its layer is behind Game-layer
16:02 <@deen> maaybe that's just the way transparency works in TW
16:02 <@deen> and we can't make it perfect except by reordering the rendering
16:04 <@deen> just an effect of the alpha blending it does?
16:04 <@deen> hm, or is it rendered twice
16:05 <@EastByte> have I said before that the CStorage implementation is stupid?
16:05 <@deen> ^^
16:07 <@EastByte> now I need to rewrite the whole list directory procedure (interface+implementation+base func) only to get the dates of files
16:08 <@EastByte> and since we are working in C++, that only requires 6 files to be edited
16:08 <@deen> yeah, that always hurts
16:08 <@deen> when i need to add a small function and have to edit 5-6 files. really need tooling to work with heavily OO code
16:13 < Savander> deen, 
16:13 < Savander> side buttons on mouse doesn't work
16:13 < Savander> on SDL2
16:13 < Savander> above mouse3 >
16:13 <@deen> Savander: yeah, quite possible
16:13 <@deen> need to fix this stuff
16:14 <@deen> Haven't found a solution yet, ticket instead: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/304
16:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- opened pull request #305: SDL2 (master...sdl2-try3) http://git.io/vsAuh

16:26 < Savander> huh?
16:26 <@deen> huh huh?
16:26 < Savander> huh huh?
16:37 <@deen> i think i solved the clipboard issue, let me compile
16:47 < Savander> :)
16:50 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/26_Aug-15-16_46.png
16:50 <@EastByte> are these dates readable enough?
16:50 <@EastByte> I think they are :)
16:51 < Savander> timestamp xD?
16:51 <@EastByte> ^see Savander can read it
16:51 < Savander> hahah
16:54 <@deen> Savander: please try again: http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-sdl2-win64.zip
16:54 <@deen> (should not crash)
16:54 <@deen> (and should work)
16:54 < Savander> ok
16:55 < Savander> works ! :)
16:55 <@deen> great!
16:56 < Savander> :)
16:57 <@deen> EastByte: make them a more human-readable format :P
16:58 <@deen> i like 2015-08-26 personally
16:58 <@deen> and maybe call it "Modification Date" or otherwise disable the date on directories
17:00 < Savander> timestamp is in
17:00 < Savander> DemoHeader
17:00 < Savander> or im wrong>?
17:00 < Savander> so just
17:01 < Savander> Creation Date
17:01 <@deen> we only open demo headers when the map is selected, right?
17:01 <@deen> because that would be expensive
17:01 < Savander> yes
17:01 < Savander> how it works now?
17:01 <@deen> so we can't just open each demo and check the date
17:01 < Savander> ah
17:01 < Savander> it's this
17:02 < Savander> date from system timestamp/
17:05 <@deen> yes, cheaper to get
17:06 < Savander> yup
17:09 < Savander> SDL doesn't have something like SDL_Tick?
17:10 <@deen> dunno, google finds this: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/25_capping_frame_rate/index.php
17:11 < Savander> yea
17:11 < Savander> maybe this'd works better than
17:11 < Savander> my limiter :PP
17:23 < Savander>    //The frames per second timer
17:23 < Savander>             LTimer fpsTimer;
17:23 < Savander>             //The frames per second cap timer
17:23 < Savander>             LTimer capTimer;
17:23 < Savander> LTimer exists ind SDL2?
17:24 <@deen> It's a class he wrote himself: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/23_advanced_timers/index.php
17:25 < Savander> ahm
17:25 < Savander> SDL_GetTicks();
17:34 < Savander>                 int frameTicks = capTimer.getTicks();
17:34 < Savander>                 if( frameTicks < SCREEN_TICKS_PER_FRAME )
17:34 < Savander>                 {
17:34 < Savander>                     //Wait remaining time
17:34 < Savander>                     SDL_Delay( SCREEN_TICKS_PER_FRAME - frameTicks );

18:08 <@deen> If anyone wants to try, I think another SDL2 issue fixed: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2128&p=22885#p22885

19:21 <@deen> hm?
19:22 <@deen> about uploading the map on ddnet?
19:23 < Donate4DDNet> yeaah
19:23 <@deen> it should probably be tested regularly, for example by sending it to iMTG (hi_leute_gll)
19:23 <@deen> or making a topic in the forum
19:23 < Donate4DDNet> ok ty

19:37 <@deen> anyone have an idea why some mouse keys don't work on Windows (were called mouse6 and mouse7 with sdl1.2)
19:37 <@deen> ?
19:38 < Savander> imossible
19:38 < Savander> but wait
19:38 < Savander> in SDL2 it doesn't work?
19:44 <@deen> yeah, right
19:44 <@deen> i asked someone to try
19:44 <@deen> on Linux it's fine
19:47 < Savander> saavik
19:47 < Savander> using 6 and 7
19:47 <@deen> yeah, i also asked her but she's afk :P
19:48 <@deen> now i rather need someone with windows to debug it
19:48 <@deen> someone who can reproduce the problem
19:48 < Savander> cuz
19:48 < Henningstone> I have windows but I'm to lazy to start it :0 takes 10 minutes >.<
19:48 < Savander> i don't have mouse 7 and 6
19:48 < Savander> :?
19:49 < Henningstone> and I have mouse 6 and 7
19:52 < Henningstone> oh just realized that I have also mouse8 xD
19:52 < Henningstone> so many mouses... ^^
19:57 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/296
20:00 <@deen> I think it worked before, dunno what happened
20:03 <@deen> so I can delete comments at DDNet's greenlight page but I can't post one myself because I never bought a game^^
20:03 <@deen> Just wanted to link some guy to ddnet.tw/funding because he asked for how it's paid
20:04 < Henningstone> just buy some 50 cent game to unlock your account, you'll get cards and probably they worth more :)
20:05 <@deen> nah, i actually don't like steam :P
20:21 < Savander> hehe
20:21 < Savander> i think, you don't need to buy anything
20:21 < Savander> i mean, download few games
20:21 < Savander> get cards
20:21 < Savander> and sell them
20:21 < Savander> xD
20:46 <@deen> :P
20:46 < Savander> :D
21:26 < nuborn> deen: should I make a pull request with the fps limiter?
21:27 <@deen> nuborn: if it works well. best talk to Savander and Chairn, they also worked on that stuff
21:33 < nuborn> deen: ok. Chairn said it worked well, but it gave a somewhat incorrect result when the nvidia card was set to "force vsync" / override the teeworlds setting. the only problem is that I cant test that on my pc (so I dont know how to fix it either)
21:51 < Chairn> well, you cant fight the settings through nvidia because it always override game's one ^^
21:52 < nuborn> yes. but did the other fps limiter have the same problem, with +20 fps, in this situation?
22:43 < Chairn> it seems there are some new players on ddnet
22:43 < Chairn> lot of tees with default skin on brutal server :D
22:43 < Chairn> because it was the fullest
22:43 <@deen> Tell them nicely that they should search for a Novice server to get started!
22:44 <@deen> and good to hear
22:45 < Chairn> i tried to vote, but miss 1 vote
22:45 < Chairn> everyone is at start :(
22:45 < Chairn> maybe you can help us ^^
22:51 < Chairn> miss 1 vote again :D
