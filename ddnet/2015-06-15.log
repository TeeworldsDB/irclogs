13:18 < Savander> what?
13:19 <@deen> the mysql server died on ddnet.tw

13:19 <@deen> weird stuff

13:26 < Savander> and i sad
13:26 < Savander> beause
13:26 < Savander> because it's hard XD
13:26 < Savander> "german is fine, you need to learn it!"
13:26 < Savander> ya...
13:26 < EastByte> saavik speaks german?
13:26 <@deen> yes
13:26 < EastByte> oh
13:27 <@deen> better than most germans
13:27 < Savander> very well
13:27 < Savander> hahahahahhaah
13:27 < Savander> xD
13:27 < EastByte> hm maybe I confused her with someone else on ts
13:27 < Savander> she just don't talk
13:27 <@deen> ^^
13:27 < Savander> she prefer to write
13:28 < Savander> I talking with her in Polish only
13:28 < EastByte> does she have a really sharp voice?
13:30 < Savander> sharp?
13:30 < Savander> what you mean?
13:31 < EastByte> a high voice, but nvm
13:34 < Savander> she has nice voice
13:34 < Savander> like a ... womanX D
13:34 < Savander> xD./...
13:35 < EastByte> aha
13:36 < laxadedi> Anyone ever tried ruby ?
13:36 < EastByte> nope and you don't wanna do that
13:36 < EastByte> http://ddnet.tw/up.png
13:36 <@deen> same
13:36 < laxadedi> Have to learn it for a school project, pretty weird language ^^
13:36 < EastByte> first time I'm on title page :D
13:37 < laxadedi> deen: are you aware that tw is probably going to be on steam ?
13:37 <@deen> yes
13:37 < laxadedi> so... ddnet might increase his player base
13:38 <@deen> yep, great
13:38 < EastByte> maybe
13:38 <@deen> so, since ddnet is a mod of tw, can ddnet also be on steam or what's the process?
13:38 < laxadedi> How many players can you have on GER ?
13:38 <@deen> "can"?
13:38 < laxadedi> connecter on server
13:38 < laxadedi> connected
13:39 <@deen> without lags?
13:39 < laxadedi> Yeah
13:39 <@deen> maybe 1-2k
13:39 < laxadedi> I don't remember the specs of the GER server
13:39 < laxadedi> that much on 1 server ?
13:39 < Savander> probably you can
13:39 <@deen> but I would just buy another server if needed
13:39 < Savander> maybe i "workshop"
13:39 < Savander> on steam
13:39 < Savander> you know.
13:39 < Savander> on*
13:40 <@deen> 500 players is about 35% CPU usage
13:41 < laxadedi> apparently, you can submit your 'mod' on steam greenlight
13:41 <@deen> ok, so same process for ddnet
13:41 < laxadedi> but afaik, it's going to be the same process with/without teeworlds being on steam
13:41 < Savander> yup
13:41 <@deen> which would have much less momentum now that tw is on steam already
13:41 < Savander> it's developers decision
13:41 < Savander> you know
13:41 < laxadedi> Yup :)
13:42 < laxadedi> ddnet rules for greenlight should be there : https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/source_games
13:43 < Savander> bbtw
13:43 < Savander> maybe it works like a source engine
13:43 < Savander> etc?
13:43 < Savander> you can put game into steam or mod
13:43 < Savander> game/mod *
13:43 < Savander> xd
13:44 <@deen> well, first let's see what happens with TW on steam
13:45 < Savander> heinrich
13:48 < EastByte> "This game will dominate Steam Free-To-Play category... but not as much as Robocraft. But it will dominate."
13:48 < EastByte> would be awesome to see teeworlds in a toplist
13:49 <@deen> doesn't dota2 dominate the free-to-play list?
13:50 < Savander> probably
13:50 < Savander> dota2 is a domain of steam
13:51 < EastByte> just reading comments on the greenlight entry
13:51 <@deen> the comments will contain lots of hyperbole
13:52 <@deen> people asked me to advertise writing nice comments on the TW steam page
13:52 <@deen> so i guess they did the same elsewhere
13:52 < EastByte> yea
13:54 < Savander> they did
13:54 <@deen> not nice
13:55 <@deen> in other communities the project would immediately be removed or punished
13:56 < Savander> but it was ont eeworlds
13:56 < Savander> people just telling others about greenlight
13:56 < Savander> and it wasn't that much
14:22 < DMTee> hola
14:23 < DMTee> sagt mal gibts eigentlich noch ne aktive Teeworlds-Plattform (Forum). Teeworlds-friends is ganz schön eingeschlafen

14:25 <@deen> ochristi: nah, they already call me Kim Jung Deen, I shouldn't restrict more :P
14:26 < DMTee> deen is there a possibility, that we run our tournaments under ddnet? we also can carry a livestream
14:26 < ochristi> but it's for their own good!!!11
14:26 <@deen> DMTee: who is "we"?
14:26 < DMTee> mostly me but in the name of Utd.Legends
14:26 <@deen> what kind of tournaments?
14:27 < DMTee> foot
14:27 <@deen> sounds good, yes
14:27 < DMTee> 1vs1 2vs2 and 3vs3 we got 8 so far so i also got a little experience with tournaments now

14:28 < DMTee> i come back later with mor details :)
14:33 < Nimda> Petrified by Aras just released on Novice at 2015-06-15 14:29
14:34 < DMTee> so deen i would say i post it on the ddnet forum. do u need than something mor from me like some graphics or something like that for the main site?

14:36 <@deen> otherwise no
14:38 < DMTee> ok, than cu soon :)
14:40 < Savander> deen,  can you ?:D
14:40 < Savander> deen on teeworlds
14:45 <@deen> ?
14:45 <@deen> ok
14:45 < Savander> no no
14:45 < Savander> it was
14:45 < Savander> 5 minutes ago xD
15:08 < laxadedi> `they already call me Kim Jung Deen`, really ? :D
15:08 < laxadedi> those kids have no limits !
15:08 < laxadedi> Well, I guess that's the price to pay when you are developping video games anyway :(
15:21 < EastByte> laxadedi: where did you pick that up? ^^
15:21 < laxadedi> EastByte: 14h25
15:23 < EastByte> ?
15:24 < laxadedi> what was your question about ?
15:24 < laxadedi> thought that was about the quote, but apparently not
15:31 < EastByte> what is 14h25 refering to?
15:36 < laxadedi> time of the quote
15:36 < laxadedi> in this channel
15:38 < EastByte> ah I found it, my servers time is postponed by ~10 minutes
15:56 < meowwww> hey guys, every time im trying to compile the client source code i get the error g++: error: unrecognized command line option '-static-libstdc++'
15:57 < Savander> on ?
15:57 < Savander> system
15:57 < meowwww> win7 64bit, with codeblocks
15:57 < meowwww> i followed the instructions of unsigned char* 
16:00 < Savander> gcc installed?
16:01 < EastByte> the option -static-libstdc++ should actually be available
16:02 < EastByte> maybe codeblocks uses the wrong compiler?
16:02 <@deen> laxadedi: you didn't read all the stuff about me censoring people etc?
16:02 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1442
16:02 <@deen> this stuff
16:03 <@deen> oh, i see hi_leute_gll doesn't have "Censored by Kim Jung Deen" in his signature anymore^^
16:11 < o_be_one> hello :)
16:11 < meowwww> which version of gcc you guys are using?
16:11 <@deen> meowwww: 5.1!
16:11 < meowwww> this might be the problem
16:11 <@deen> at least when it works, some programs don't compile with gcc 5.1^^
16:14 <@deen> meowwww: which version do you use?
16:15 <@deen> meowwww: you could try removing the static-libstdc++ stuff in bam.lua
16:15 < meowwww> i removed the line and it works
16:29 <@deen> ok, hmm
16:36 < EastByte> deen: today I tried to replace select with epoll in the server source
16:36 < EastByte> but somehow there was +10ms latency
16:37 <@deen> oh, that would be cool
16:37 <@deen> weird
16:38 < EastByte> epoll doesn't really make sense when using only one fd but it should atleast have the same performance
16:38 < EastByte> I'll do further testing
16:39 <@deen> the ddnet servers wait
16:39 <@deen> for events on the socket
16:40 <@deen> i guess that stops working with epoll
16:40 < EastByte> huh?
16:40 <@deen> search for net_socket_read_wait
16:41 < EastByte> I replaced it with epoll_wait
16:41 <@deen> ok
16:41 < EastByte> the good thing is, epoll is initiated only once
16:41 <@deen> but that would cause exactly 10 ms delay
16:42 < EastByte> I don't know exactly how much it was
16:42 < EastByte> my ping actually raised to 40ms on a local server
16:43 < EastByte> why would it cause a delay?
16:43 <@deen> because if that doesn't work the server sleeps until a tick happens
16:44 <@deen> and if your average packet comes inbetween 2 ticks, then that's 10 ms
16:45 < EastByte> oh
16:45 <@deen> anyway, epoll would be great
16:46 < EastByte> well I didn't implement the x timeout there
16:46 < EastByte> so that really might be the reason
16:46 <@deen> i know, i told you so :P
16:46 < EastByte> right right
16:46 < EastByte> unfortunatly I lost the code doing a git checkout
16:47 <@deen> ouch
16:49 < EastByte> not sure whether it's worth to build base/system.c wrappers for epoll
16:49 < EastByte> it's only available on linux anyway
16:50 < EastByte> but including unix headers in server.cpp looks nasty
16:50 <@deen> yes it is worth it
16:51 <@deen> because yay, more performance for official ddnet servers
16:53 < EastByte> I meant whether it's better to implement epoll in server.cpp directly or via wrapper
16:53 <@deen> wrapper would be cleaner of course
16:54 < EastByte> but it's not as simple as with select
16:54 < EastByte> nvm I'll try to do that
16:55 <@deen> try it with direct epoll first if you want
16:55 <@deen> if it works, wrap it
16:55 < EastByte> I'll see
17:28 < Savander> Clan tag next to nickname in teeworlds, possible?
17:28 <@deen> yes
17:28 <@deen> but annoying
17:28 <@deen> i think it's enough to be in TAB
17:28 < Savander> i 0.5 i twas next to haha
17:28 < Savander> in*
17:28 <@deen> in 0.5 there was no clan tag
17:28 <@deen> they added it in 0.6
17:28 < Savander> tsii!
17:28 < Savander> it was !
17:28 < Savander> (hidden!)
17:28 < Savander> xD
17:29 < Savander> btw
17:29 <@deen> i don't even understand clans personally^^
17:29 < Savander> YouTube has introduced 60fps
17:29 < Savander> 6 months ago, maybe more
17:29 < Savander> don't remember
17:29 <@deen> yes, looks great with TW videos
17:29 < Savander> i'll show
17:29 < Savander> you something
17:30 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR5Sap_LBCQ
17:30 < Savander> look at date
17:30 < Savander> of upload
17:30 <@deen> when you upload a video to YT, they may store the original version of it to re-encode to new formats
17:30 <@deen> that makes sense
17:31 < Savander> yup
17:31 < Savander> but i didn't know, it was in
17:31 < Savander> 60 fps
17:31 < Savander> i had 13 years old
17:31 < Savander> xD
17:31 <@deen> ^^
17:31 < Savander> but!
17:32 < Savander> this video show my 'beginning" 
17:32 < Savander> video created half-year later after i started playing this game
17:33 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-c3IH9jdJc
17:33 < Savander> but still!
17:33 < Savander> THIS IS AWESOME!
17:33 < Savander> xD
17:33 < Savander> oh shit!
17:34 < Savander> 5 days ago, this video reached 6 years!
17:41 < EastByte> haha my old fragmovie is still on yt
17:41 < EastByte> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W6bxlSc-KA
17:42 < EastByte> only 4 1/2 years ago though
17:42  * EastByte is pretty skilled at video editing
17:43 < Savander> woah!
17:43 < Savander> without sound?
17:43 < Savander> i though my video had sounds
17:43 < Savander> but now, it doesn't have
17:44 <@deen> maybe you had licensed music and yt removed it
17:44 < Savander> maybe
17:44 <@deen> but i hear music in your 2nd video, Savander 
17:45 < Savander> ye in 2nd i hear too
17:45 < Savander> but in first, i don't
17:45 < Savander> but nvm, maybe licensed music
17:45 < Savander> nice montage EastByte !
17:45 < Savander> maybe trailer for teeworlds.com? :D
17:45 < Savander> ^^
17:46 < EastByte> ofcourse
17:46 < Savander> yea!
17:48 < EastByte> my youtube channel is like a time capsule
17:49 < EastByte> so many unlisted videos
17:49 < Savander> :>
19:19 < DMTee> hola
