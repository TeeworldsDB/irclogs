01:37 < eeeee> mentaltrb: sounds like someone in #teeworlds has a similar issue
02:24 < o_be_one> hey guys
02:24 < o_be_one> how i can add one jump ?
02:24 < o_be_one> in mapping
02:24 < o_be_one> deen, maybe u there
03:34 <@deen> hi
03:34 <@deen> on the switch layer there should be a jumps tile
03:35 <@deen> use that and set the number or delay to 3 (i can never remember which)
03:35 <@deen> o_be_one: usually it's fastest to look how other mappers did it in other maps
03:38 < o_be_one> yes your right
03:38 < o_be_one> but i wanted a ++ jump
03:38 < o_be_one> not to set a number of jumps, deen 
03:38 < o_be_one> thanks for your help
03:38 <@deen> we don't have something like that
03:38 <@deen> what if you touch the tile 10 times?
03:38 <@deen> you get +10 jumps?
03:39 <@deen> on the game layer we have "refill jumps"
03:53 < o_be_one> its a tp tile, so it will just add 1 jump and tele to spawn
04:03 < eeeee> someone should really make gamecore scriptable
04:03 < eeeee> like in .lua files, fetched as a separate resource with maps
04:17 < pielover88888> Does anyone have the source to this? Dead links man, they get me every time :/ https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7447

15:59 < Learath2> eeeee: what should a serverbrowser refresh do ? 
16:00 < Learath2> refetch the file or ask the normal ?
17:36 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: probably refetch the entire file

21:08 < eeeee> Learath2: yeah that firefox issue means you can never ask normal from js, so should refetch the file
