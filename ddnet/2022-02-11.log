02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk where to ask questions related to release candidates so i'll just use here
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but where can you use live freeze in the rc? i can't find it in the map editor
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://matrix.to/#/@jupeyy:matrix.org  new version is really unstable
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://matrix.to/#/@jupeyy:matrix.org > new version is really unstable
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://matrix.to/#/@jupeyy:matrix.org> new version is really unstable
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it segfaults quite often, but tabbing out works
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i cant start the client on gfx_fullscreen 1 cuz it segfaults, but i can switch in game
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it seems to crash when switching maps
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> crash at startup using gfx_fullscreen 1:

02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh, it seems that dbg_gfx 4 is the reason of the segfaults ðŸ˜„
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis it seems that it's not in entities yet ðŸ˜„
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's below the tele weapons

03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its been an issue for a long time
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can even do stuff like this
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633113490529321015/809850928932323358/Casthere.demo.mp4
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but ivent found any maps to cheat it with (or else i would have cheated them)
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> no @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti would
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> :konstitroll:
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I already cheated maps with that
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And thats why the start shotgun on GetSpeed 3 is turned off when u finish
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> To avoid trols find a way to chot
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> send maps
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Fixed
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> One was Getspeed
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :kek:
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :kek:
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The other one was broken space
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Biggest troll
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ok, did we test validation layers last time?
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I wouldn't know any reason that it crashes without telling something, but maybe they are just buggy.
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Chairn)
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you show how big the allocation was, BIT2 seems to be smaller in VRAM usage than Arctic Frost, so this is kinda unexpected, or you just have too many skins xD
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Chairn)
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (dbg\_gfx 3) is just verbose no validation layers
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in #4600 you said bit2 worked, i think i havent really changed anything since that
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn\: in your pic you use 1GB of VRAM just for textures, currently on a fresh install its a bit less than the half of it
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/940705460925898802/unknown.png )But i think the client should also use lessEditor images are around 50MB
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Entities can also save 50MB by simply not loading 2D textures if it requires 2D array texturestextures simply are a VRAM killer
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that's also why all these 4k games are like 100gb xdd
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> How can show strong/weak in hud?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_nameplates_strong`
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Plss fix my issue
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ayli> @everyone
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ayli> WhÐ¾ is first? :)
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ayli> https://diskord.gift/ECdVnSbeD
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its insane that discord cant fix such a simple thing
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess the incentives aren't there
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can't we add a simple bot that just bans someone who uses at everyone in 2 channels with the same message?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would probs kill most automated bots
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean we dont use at everyone anyway, we can also just delete all message with at everyone and links in it
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone sent me a collection of these scam links
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at-everyone isn't contained in most of them
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someoneâ„¢ could try teaching the bot to delete duplicate messages
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that would only work because we're insignificant, bots could start to randomize their messages
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true, but yeah thats my point, just do it for us xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> algrind
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> now that my search trolled me and i accedentally leaked it \:D juppy ma frint how do you remember this long as command? I keep coming back to matrix to get it xd

16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd

16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> watafak you have text files next to your git repos?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you have serious brain damage
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just clone all git stuff there so i dont loose trakc of them

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nob
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think ill just a manpage for valgrind \:D
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i use some weird ass man page tool anyways
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not too sold by your approach sorry
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in Libs there are automatic build scripts for mesa drivers, thats more interesting xd
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> â˜•
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Do you know if its more efficient to do CChar... char = getplayerchar(...) and use it everywhere or call getplayerchar everywhere?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would make sense that the first is more efficient right
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder, maybe it gets inlined or smth
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > m_TeamMask = GameServer()->GetPlayerChar(Owner) ? GameServer()->GetPlayerChar(Owner)->Teams()->TeamMask(GameServer()->GetPlayerChar(Owner)->Team(), -1, m_Owner) : 0;
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd looks perfect 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hard to say tho performance wise. compilers should be pretty good in this kind of stuff, depends on the complexity probs
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with LTO it'd probably get inlined
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it can't be, I think
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it depend on functions that are part of a class or what?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does mention that they inline with optimizations on, but it doesn't declare what cases in this manual at least
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that functions cannot be inlined across compilation units (= files) by default
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not even if they are implemented in the header itself?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but generally it makes sense yeah
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they're implemented in the header, then they're part of the compilation unit
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since they get inserted at the point of `#include <header.h>`
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why does the antialiasing also affect the whole ui?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it doesnt look good
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> is it intentionally?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs its fsaa, so it affects the whole framebuffer
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the framebuffers are created with multi sampling
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I set it to 16, the UI doesn't look bad for me
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it creates a fat delay xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk i have a normal 1080p monitor and the ui/hud looks abit blurry
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wouldn't you want especially UI with multi sampling? xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i feel no input delay difference
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ouch
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> no, without the aa everything looks so sharp and not washed out
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i dunno what you expect, thats the whole point of it
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so there is a more "washed out" transition
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk i just have a different experience with other games at aa
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how many games you play even use plain transparency.. if i ever see transparency its always milky which looks much nicer anyway (imo)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> what do you mean?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean can you just show a game that uses round corners and looks better and is similar to ddnet ui? xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i dont get exactly what you mean but generally speaking when looking at the text especially, in ddnet I instantly see that its blurry, but I think other games, the aa affect only applies to the 3d stuff
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i dont get exactly what you mean but generally speaking when looking at the text especially, in ddnet I instantly see that its blurry, but I think other games, the aa effect only applies to the 3d stuff
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and not ui/hud
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah if you mean text yeah
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> text usually uses hinting techniques, we could also relativly implement it for the newer renderers
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah it looks like i forgot to put on my glasses
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> at play with MSAA 0 on upstream because text, especially console is really blurry
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but GL 1.x. mhhh would need to check xd
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> whats hinting techniques?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like respecting RGB subpixel
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or BGR whatever your LED screen uses
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and what does the aa of ddnet do differnetly than other games?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should just not be used for text
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and what does the aa of ddnet do differently than other games?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not useful for this case
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah, are you able to change that?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would require doing multisampling your own so it doesnt affect the whole screen
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too much time for almost no gain
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i have too little knowledge on that but i thought its something that could be changed fairly easy
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well easy, yeah there are 1 trillion tutorials where you will find everything you need, if you want to try it go ahead
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for newer opengl versions you can simply do it inside the shaders, i dunno about older OGL
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> can i suggest that on the github and if its good it will be implemented into the game?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> like the actual code
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you should remember that this isnt very efficient tho, it requires you to either know about the current framebuffer content, or it will be just an approximation of what you really want, e.g. just create more transparent borders so it looks smoother
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have nothing against it ^^
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@lukamane)
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i really know basically nothing about coding/game development but maybe i should get into it
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say it can be a lot of fun, the vulkan backend was probs the most fun i had this coding within the last 2-3 years^^
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with coding\*
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i really wish i knew anything about it because i have so many ideas in my head
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> is it true that the vulkan engine is more effecient than the directx engine?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you cannot generally say that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but vulkan thought about almost anything and even respects mobile platforms
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in the end it depends on the driver still
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I just see alot of people saying in terms of the end user performance that its better
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vulkan is crossplatform so its used by basically all newer emulators
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it will be used by more and more games now that valve pushed linux so hard
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and as said mobile platforms profit from it too
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so i guess vulkan and dx12 are soo good bcs they get the most support
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most ppl think about these two if they do computer graphics
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ah okay
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> red dead redemption vulkan seems to be a few percentage better than dx12, but who knows how well written the backends are
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its really hard to predict, maybe vulkan is an edge more low level
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah valve is doing everything right now to optimize games for their upcomming handheld gaming device
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> from my personal experience since steam gives you the option between vulkan and dx12 when launching, vulkan definitely runs smoother
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> for the game r6 atleast
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont even know many games that have native vk and dx12 backend tbh
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most are either one or the other
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> btw how do you read and send messages? what kind of bridge do you use?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> in discord
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im in the matrix ddnet group rn
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a bot you can search it easily in the web
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> ah okay
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> make it an alias 'valgrindall' or create a small shell script that you put somewhere in the PATH
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> for instance i got an alias called gccsanitize that is:
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gcc -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=shift -fsanitize=shift-exponent -fsanitize=shift-base -fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero -fsanitize=unreachable -fsanitize=vla-bound -fsanitize=null -fsanitize=return -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow -fsanitize=bounds -fsanitize=bounds-strict -fsanitize=bool -fsanitize=enum 
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> It's the bridge to the matrix room #ddnet-developer:matrix.org using https://t2bot.io/discord
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u might find this interesting https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7666
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> @deen 
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> > There are 3 graphics you sent, but only 2 tiles, and the first and last look very similar to normal freeze and deepfreeze
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i think its cuz it is, he probably put it there just to visualize what it looks like compared to freeze and deepfreeze

18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Theres quiet a "major" bug. I think its major bcs it can happen at any moment in game and specialy when you are speedrunning.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> The bug happens if you use cl_skin_download_url https://api.skins.tw/api/resolve/skins/ and you have download skins enabled.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> You play, you make a nice speedrun, suddenly someone joins in with non standard skin from skins.tw and you have a nice big red popup on full screen that this skin have wrong width height etc.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Its not a big problem when you have this info when you start a game and when you are in menu, but not when you are  on server and you are racing.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Ofcourse when pop happens you no longer can move or do anything you need to close it first.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Maybe move that popup from ingame screen to menu only  ! or something ?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tell skins.tw to fix their skins
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Tsin contact skins.tw
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also now that u said that ppl will be hijacking runs xd
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.gg/mTVQuEDzzc
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i think a better solution to the skin error would be, that if you're not in a server, it pops up at usual (happens only on startup), but if you're either in a server or in a race, then it only shows it in chat instead of a huge bubble, so that it doesnt actually interrupt gameplay
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> or just get the admins of skins.tw to fix their skins in db
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://skins.tee.world/ has no broken skins
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mods.tw/ soon to exist
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://skins.tee.world/skin.php?skin=fool2.png
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> best skin
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good job <https://skins.tee.world/skinlist.php?skin=%27> doesnt work
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always try to put a ' on php websites
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would be surprised how many sql injections u find
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> wtf dont hack me
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://skins.tee.world/skin.php?skin=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't work either
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/601 when implement this
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> where is that guy btw
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he did quite alot in the past as it looks xd
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you know what would be cool? if for these tee showcasing websites, all the tees would be staring at your mouse pointer
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 0.7 skin selection xd
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> creepy af xd
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we need that too
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lol
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you know what would be even better? if there was a program to actually, like, render out a tee image that looks like the one in game. **tee.js** seems very disconnected from how it actually looks in DDNet
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> floats in js are wild
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its that
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't think so
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just do it with ints
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably just not copied correctly from ddnet source
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and from what I know, people are forced to resort to chroma mapping when it comes to youtube thumbnails
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is chroma mapping?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk what its called
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but its like-greenscreen
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but its like- greenscreen
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway @Patiga help
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you have a tool that fixed this dont u?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> our local skin rendering expert @Patiga ðŸ˜›
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't see what you want to fix rn ^^
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and map parsing expert
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i thought u worked on a skin renderer or smth
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or was it all for blender?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah I was confused by your 'fixed'. I only did skin stuff for blender. @Avolicious made one in php I think
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah nice is it accurate?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://kog.tw/render_tee.php?skin=Yroo&body_color=6913280&feet_color=11271936
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chroma keying? or maybe rotoscoping?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you can use that api I suppose
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the code for it is not available though afaik
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw isn't what we use on the skindb acceptable? Is it inaccurate?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it looks off I think
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its pretty bad xd
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xcd
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt allow high res skins

19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> lmao
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> they dont flip the eye
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> body is too up
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and feet too small I think
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xDD
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> learath blind xDDD
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he looks like he's about to jump
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you just have scanner eyes
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_PepeGaBlind:
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets make one in WebGPU

19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly far off
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> its just a few pixels :YEP:
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> use any skin that doesnt have symmetrical eyes
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with tune gravity -200 it kinda looks ok
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> where is the script that generates them?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I open gimp and they go exactly on top all of you telling me it's off are getting banned

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> y
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea the right eye probably just isnt mirrored
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah wrong answer ping
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://skins.tee.world/rendered/sheep.png
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if I look up my favorits skin, gooofdoom there, it looks off by a lot
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @ZombieToad\: so you got a working renderer?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pr it xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> where is the script that generates them?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> its not live renderer

19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hi irc users in 6 years!
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> â˜•
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> do you think matrix will still exist in 6 years
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IRC will still exist in 6 years
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> discord no idea, same for matrix
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> who adds support for building the client with webasm, then we can just render the skin using client code xdd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like overkill ðŸ˜„
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jupstar if ddnet was made in rust it wouldnt be that far fetched
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here are the two on top of eachother, left feet is like maybe a handful of pixels different
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/941765564425199616/unknown.png
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who is going to gulag first?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can oyu render a diff image?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the skin in ddnet.tw is definitly off u dont need to be a eye wizard for it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xDDD
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here is the diff, as best as I can align it with hand
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/941765832629956648/unknown.png
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that looks c ursed
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a handful of pixels off, you are all like high as a kite
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i understand why ppl dont see diff between 144hz and 60hz xD
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the eyes being a little smaller is the only thing that's noticable
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u put both feet at same level
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its the same reason
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know how to interpret the diff image
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "your eye can only see 24 fps, why do you need 144 fps?"
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (best flame bait)
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tabs > spaces
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2ms input more is nothing, humans have 150ms delay anyway
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust > c
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux > windows
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lmao, now i have to think of wayland with forced vsync
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 the feet are also too small, I noticed that directly when I saw my favorite skin
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/godzilla-let-them-fight-fight-ken-watanabe-watanabe-gif-5687182
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vim > emacs
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i also see it rendering blacks over the colors
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ubuntu 22 will have wayland and all windows users have a reason to flame linux xD
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> systemd > runit
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kog > ddnet ðŸ˜›
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz wayland devs are not gamers
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tru words
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Ryozuki)
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This and the eyes
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> and that makes sense not a stupid popup over whole screen that you need to close specialy when you are racing, @Learath2 or @heinrich5991 please move that skin info to console or chat.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but its just funny how they try to argument the fact away that there is more delay
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt matter if bad or good
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the real flamewar
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath will say vsync is good
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xDDDDDD
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe learath is 80y old and he doesnt know
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> skins.tw should stop accepting broken skins
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why so many stuff looks same for him
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> here are the scalings and positions of all the tee body parts, if someone wants to fix the script
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/941767023816491008/tee_notes.txt
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you all are just nutjobs ngl
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree with @Learath2
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tsin is writing the ddmax bible
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to start another flamewar
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do we have to fix skins.tww skins?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> it doesnt matter if they should accept it or not, if doesnt break the game then player wont give a f@#k, player see a big popup while racing and that destroys his/her gameplay 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> so its a client problem not the data itself
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> just comunicate the sking error in other way not a stupid popup
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah skins.tw should fix their stuff
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Their api is generating an error and people want us to fix it
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> it doesnt matter if they should accept it or not, if doesnt break the game then player wont give a f@#k, player see a big popup while racing and that destroys his/her gameplay 
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> so its a client problem not the data itself
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> just comunicate the skin error in other way not a stupid popup
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not a service we provide
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you even contacted skins.tw yet?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> it is a data problem tho
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whom do you trust more, a computer saying the skin is not good, or your eyes xd
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Tsin)
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> their skins are broken, while yes i'd prefer it showing up in chat instead ,its still skins.tw fault afterall
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you share a broken skin, then someone else shares it too, and then someone breaks it even more
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> info about error is shown to player by game client so instead of popup show it diffrently some into in console whatever
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then you are in an endless loop of worse and worse skins
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that won't motivate you to contact skins.tw to fix their stuff
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus maybe u should read this
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> average player don't see any bug ingame with that skin so why should he/she contact anyone ? =]
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because of the popup
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its like downloading a third party software then complaining to microsoft
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually on some gpus it just will completely glitch out
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> look, i get it, message is important, great I get it. Now use your brain both of you and handle that communication to the player in other way that it wont f@ck his/her speedrun
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no =]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reset cl_download_skins_url to default to fix it
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> @Ryozuki  get lost =]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> =]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> =]
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about I use my brain to get out of this conversation? Forgot how toxic you get
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bye
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way to kill the convo
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the non skins.tw stuff was fun
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bye
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2\: we all love u tho \<3 (all of the homo)
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> whats toxic about it ?  that I try to point out that there should be a better way to communicate to players an error that they see ?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it might have been the "now use your brain", but not sure
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Tsin\: anyway, nexus is pinged, maybe he'll fix it, then the warning did its job
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the reason a popup is shown is to get people to fix it. your suggestion doesn't seem like it'd get people to fix it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in meantime dont use that skin site
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Whats up
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> use skins.tee.world :D its a complete copy of the pre louis ddnet.tw db with some extra skins aswell
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> its not me, im talking in name of many players who asked me about that strange error that don't say anything to them.
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus apparently skins.tw has a skin with wrong format and it shows popup errors in the ddnet client
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be great if you can fix it
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know which skin is
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since i dont use skins.tw
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should show the download URL
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does it only show it on the broken skin?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> skin name would probably be enough, not sure if it already shows it
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yesÅ±
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yes
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> OK I can scan all skins and See which have a wrong Format. But cant fix it till tomorrow
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> NeXus you manage skins.tw ?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus did u join unique btw?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw a github commit xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> It has to be devideble by 16 right?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> welcome then :D

20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> The Website yeah
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 8 width and 4 height i think
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if you dont want streetched skins, height is half of width
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> ok, so please tell me if you will scan all skins and fix them will you also include a fix that will make that for new upcoming skins ?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah. There is no size check for skins atm
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I'll add it
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool, thanks!

20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> thank you,
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> btw @heinrich5991  and @Learath2  rly guys think about average players, showing them a popup with an error while racing isnt rly the best solution (move it to chat, move it to console, show it in menu only or make that popu smaller and add it in some corner and make it so it wont stop your gameplay).
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I've actually never seen ZombieToad do something that's only positive ðŸ˜®
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ??? i fixed a couple ddnet bugs before
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you link one? I actually don't remember ^^
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> hein very RICH troll
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> ðŸ˜›
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also remember when sp someone trolled the old wiki :monkalaugh:
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits?author=ZombieToad
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i kinda miss pain weapons bug
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> :(
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ty
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw 4096x2048 skin will use almost 70MB vram, so maybe a more sane value would make more sense xd
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but a database for svg skins would be nice too \:D
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> wats wrong w our baby https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg ?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats only for ddnet client skins tho
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> ah so non standard ddnet mapres for example
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> i have an outstanding collection of 1 svg mapres https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres/tree/master/svg xd
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i still have quite a few svg skins made by mind
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> go donate them to me
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> pr or nob
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i have 8gb ram its okay
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tru gamer
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> imagine playing tw with less than 32gb gpu memory

20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> oh i meant my video card ram

20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i have 32gb ddr3
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it shares VRAM with normal RAM
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> my computer is old
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> watfaka
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its basically VRAM only xd
