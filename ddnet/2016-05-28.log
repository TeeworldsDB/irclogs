11:17 < Ryozuki> deen you there?
11:17 <@deen> hi
11:18 < Ryozuki> soreu asked me to do some re-ratings but i would like to know if i have to do something more than editing the list on types/--/maps, for example wonderland, it will be moved from brut 1* to mod, the page will be automatically updated or?
11:19 <@deen> it depends on how many maps you're planning to rerate
11:19 < Ryozuki> 2
11:19 <@deen> if it's just a few then you should also edit ~/servers/releases, probably by hand
11:20 <@deen> if it's more maps, for example when we made dummy server, you can remove the releases file and regenerate it entirely with git-update.sh
11:20 < Ryozuki> ok thx
12:16 < parb0s> Has anyone an idea how I could convert the current map to a vector or to an array of integers where 0 represents "air" and 2 represents freeze for example without entities?
12:18 <@deen> parb0s: using tml: https://github.com/ddnet/tml
12:18 <@deen> see for example the properties.py we use: https://github.com/ddnet/tml/blob/master/properties.py
12:27 < parb0s> This can't be used in the in the mainloop of the ddnet client, right ? 
12:27 <@deen> ah, that's where you want to do it
12:28 <@deen> there you already have each layer of the map as an array of ints with some extra information, so all is good
12:28 < parb0s> Which class can I acces it from because I couldt find it
12:29 <@deen> For example m_pTiles in CCollision
12:29 <@deen> or m_pGameLayer in CLayers
12:32 < parb0s> ok thank you
