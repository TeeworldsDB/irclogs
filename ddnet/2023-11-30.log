00:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What does the new snap break?
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> It breaks skin changes, colour changes, name changes just to name a few
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> To stay compatible with a dead game?
08:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> Supsup
08:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:00 < bridge> <timofey1337> what should i set in the custom service when trying to port forward?
09:00 < bridge> <timofey1337> like the protocol is set to udp
09:00 < bridge> <timofey1337> but what about custom service
09:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea thatâ€™s a minor inconvenience itâ€™s not like they are impossible
09:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes every player counts. And it gets rid off this weirdness that there is this incompatibility doesnâ€™t it make you nervous? Also teeworlds might be dead but it still has more stars on GitHub. Has the OG teeworlds.com website which gets a bit of traffic. Still is included in a bunch of Linux articles and package managers. Ddnet has been always compatible with teeworlds and now it suddenly stopped just because porting would be a hassle. Every
09:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ddnet does not care about pvp support at all so might as well stay compatible to the latest pvp servers
09:26 < bridge> <teero777> gctf is 0.7 only mostly but I don't want to play 0.7
09:26 < bridge> <teero777> gctf community is 0.7 mostly but I don't want to play 0.7
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If every player counts, why don't you count for me then
10:01 < bridge> <cyberfighter> 0.7 will be dumped in 50 years or so
10:01 < bridge> <cyberfighter> when chillet passes away
10:13 < ChillerDragon> jopsti you will not be left behind we move you to 0.7 pog
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i decided to put my assembly stuff notes/cheatsheets in my own blog
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But I'd not want to start a bloated client
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Really sad you drop me from community
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0.7 will be erased
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks time to make a pr removing 0.7 code
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> as they say
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> no code is best code
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's true
10:28 < ChillerDragon> i just rmrfed the wrong dir does linux have undo?
10:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's so much easier to maintain less code
10:29 < ChillerDragon> jopsti ddnet is more bloat than teeworlds
10:29 < ChillerDragon> and breaking compat gets rid of the possibility to use lightweight tw as drop in for ddnet
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeworlds is boring
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is popular
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not hard to not be blind
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> we drop tw support
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> we make ddnet cleaner
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> we add mod support sure
10:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Imagine recurse force removing the wrong dir :kek: :kek:
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> we remove old hacks backcompat hacks
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> we use properly designed forward compatible packets
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> uuid is forward compatible idea
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> numeric ids are not
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think chiller does not who u reply to
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> see*
10:30 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> (we dump ddnet and make our own Version 100% Rust)
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> next week i got holidays so ill see
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill make the pr removing 0.7 and start a drama
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Xd
10:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Is matrix really that messed Up with bridging ? Meh
10:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is using irc
10:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ew
10:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :poggers2: :f3:
10:34 < ChillerDragon> > i think chiller does not who u reply to
10:34 < ChillerDragon> ryo i developed 6th sense
10:35 < ChillerDragon> i see replies in my head
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> We should also remove irc and force chiller to use matrix
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then no more cry about edited msgs
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Or out of context
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Do you agree chiller?
10:37 < ChillerDragon> i disagree
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Nice you agree
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Awesome
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i restyled my blog a bit https://edgarluque.com/
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ctrl-f5
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I never read your blogs, but they are always well structured
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Better than most blogs I've seen in my life
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly?
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> but how u know if u dont read em xd
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I skim them
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i used a mono font for everything before
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i switched to sans-serif one for non code
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its easier to read

16:09 < bridge> <learath2> Aren't you doing nasm?
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> both
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill do it in rust first to get a sense of the problem
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its quite hard to do directly on nasm xd
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> But it'll help you think like a real software pioneer
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> xx
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need a way to do tests
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> or unit tests
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> asserts
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Do that with nasm too
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> INT3 at asserts
16:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> has anyone used a crate for ipc in rust. for reading data from shared memory :justatest:
16:32 < ChillerDragon> im lost on gnome icons again omg does someone know which if those files is the gnome thumbnail from the .desktop file

16:34 < ChillerDragon> the desktop file just references `Icon=teeworlds` and i can for the life of it not find its location in my fs

17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Bergmann said that he didn't plan to look seriously at the language until it could be compiled with GCC. Torvalds answered that, while he used to find problems in the LLVM Clang compiler, now he's more likely to find problems with GCC instead; he now builds with Clang.
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> bigg
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @jupeyy_keks @learath2
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> torvalds uses clang
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> not gcc
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only sad thing is rust not using gpl
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think even if u replaced all code in kernel with rust it would still be gpl2
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its very important for linux to remain gpl
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> reading the comments of the article just makes me happier i chose to use agpl3 for my projects

17:43 < bridge> <Ewan> can i just transfer my valorant hours over to csgo
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not sad at all
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's sad that it is not public domain
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rust is like oxygen, you should not be able to license it
18:22 < bridge> <avolicious> push the project to github. Github parses the git and adds your commit to your stats
