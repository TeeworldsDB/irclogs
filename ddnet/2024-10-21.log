03:41 < bridge> <teero777> what happened
03:41 < bridge> <totar> dunno
03:42 < bridge> <teero777> Go maintain some
03:43 < bridge> <teero777> Go maintain some
03:43 < bridge> <totar> too many updates lol
03:44 < bridge> <teero777> When will ddnet finally be finished
03:45 < bridge> <teero777> (in the sense of making the physics not frustrating)
03:45 < bridge> <totar> after accounts
03:45 < bridge> <teero777> ah man
03:45 < bridge> <totar> and then we will need social network features
03:45 < bridge> <teero777> ah yes
03:45 < bridge> <teero777> So about 70 years +-10?
03:45 < bridge> <totar> upload you clip demos directly to ddnet servers and share with your friends! upvote your favorites!
03:46 < bridge> <totar> upload your clip demos directly to ddnet servers and share with your friends! upvote your favorites!
03:46 < bridge> <teero777> Daily cup!
03:46 < bridge> <teero777> K.O. elimination round on map releases!
03:47 < bridge> <teero777> Add in-game currency!
03:47 < bridge> <totar> we also need 0.8 and 0.9 support in our 0.6 based client
03:47 < bridge> <teero777> ah yea
03:48 < bridge> <teero777> I doubt 0.8 will happen before i leave tw tho
03:48 < bridge> <totar> then rewriting everything in rust
03:48 < bridge> <teero777> Idk that's going to be finished end of the year kind of
03:48 < bridge> <totar> 2 months?
03:49 < bridge> <totar> maybe if chatgpt does it
03:49 < bridge> <teero777> that's what mister jupstar told me
03:49 < bridge> <totar> ddnet will then need to support ddpg protocol of course
03:49 < bridge> <teero777> no
03:49 < bridge> <teero777> ddpg is individual
03:49 < bridge> <teero777> No bridge is intended
03:50 < bridge> <teero777> Not that ddnet even can
03:50 < bridge> <teero777> Everything is different xd
03:50 < bridge> <totar> do not underestimate chillerdragon
03:50 < bridge> <teero777> :justatest:
03:50 < bridge> <teero777> Brand new assembly client to connect to ddpg
03:51 < bridge> <totar> if you implement 0.6 server protocol in ddpg client you could make a bridge
03:51 < bridge> <teero777> jupsti doesn't want that
03:51 < bridge> <teero777> Bloat!
03:51 < bridge> <teero777> No backwards compatibility issues anymore
03:51 < bridge> <totar> you don't need to push it to his main branch
03:52 < bridge> <totar> I'm being sarcastic
03:52 < bridge> <teero777> Well yes it is possible
03:52 < bridge> <teero777> I hope so
03:52 < bridge> <teero777> What do I do
03:52 < bridge> <teero777> Fix submarine physics?
03:53 < bridge> <teero777> I have a week left of freedom
03:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> I just want dd-pg to be finished to the point I can write zombies mod
03:54 < bridge> <meloÆž> Furo or bencie can write bomb tag
03:54 < bridge> <meloÆž> Twerk will add ~~TAS~~ custom server
03:54 < bridge> <meloÆž> Teero will add ~~TAS~~ custom server
05:13 < bridge> <louis> lol that's pretty sick
05:15 < bridge> <teero777> https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c
06:08 < bridge> <totar> I watched this video and he hypes it so much but it's literally just struct alignment
06:13 < bridge> <teero777> yea good to know tho
06:13 < bridge> <teero777> i feel a little more motivated.
06:24 < bridge> <totar> Idk i was just expecting something different from the title
06:24 < bridge> <totar> It is good to know
06:25 < bridge> <teero777> what is m_Skip doing in CTile? it looks like it counts air tiles from each tile to the right. what is this even used for?
06:25 < bridge> <totar> I don't know
06:25 < bridge> <teero777> also m_Reserved is completely unused
06:25 < bridge> <totar> never heard of m_Skip in my life
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> class CTile
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> {
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> public:
06:26 < bridge> <teero777>     unsigned char m_Index; // what tile it is
06:26 < bridge> <teero777>     unsigned char m_Flags; // flags like orientation
06:26 < bridge> <teero777>     unsigned char m_Skip; // no fucking idea
06:26 < bridge> <teero777>     unsigned char m_Reserved; // not even used anywhere
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> };
06:26 < bridge> <teero777> ```
06:27 < bridge> <totar> It's probably reserved to keep the struct size the same
06:27 < bridge> <teero777> removing works fine it seems
06:27 < bridge> <totar> It's intentionally unused
06:28 < bridge> <teero777> the same as what?
06:28 < bridge> <totar> The same as the specification
06:29 < bridge> <totar> Its probably UB that it still works
06:30 < bridge> <teero777> what specification
06:30 < bridge> <totar> I mean the struct needs to stay the same size so it's compatible with old versions of whatever this is
06:31 < bridge> <totar> Idk what ctile does so someone else will wake up and explain it
06:31 < bridge> <teero777> that isn't the case when loading i guess. maybe when you make maps it makes a difference
06:32 < bridge> <teero777> that isn't the case when loading i guess. maybe when you make/edit maps it makes a difference
06:32 < bridge> <totar> There's lots of quirks like this in the code and protocol
06:32 < bridge> <totar> I think there's a wiki page or something with them
06:38 < bridge> <totar> This sounds like rudentary run length encoding to save file space
06:38 < bridge> <totar> This sounds like rudemtary run length encoding to save file space
07:07 < bridge> <teero777> that sounds reasonable

08:14 < bridge> <teero777> imagine
08:32 < bridge> <01000111g> Helo guys, is there a way to show my real life time ingame? I sometiems only have one monitor and forget RL cuz teeworlds draws me in, and then my sleepy time gets reduced :feelsbadman: Pls fix 11
08:32 < bridge> <01000111g> high-performer
08:32 < bridge> <alw5> cl_show_local_time_always 1
08:34 < bridge> <01000111g> there is no way that already exists wtfff, thank you
08:35 < bridge> <alw5> np
08:36 < bridge> <alw5> i remember seeing it in the settings
08:36 < bridge> <alw5> but i dont use it
09:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> thinking about making my own codegen backend
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but like llvm
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> just for x86
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its a good way to learn it in depth
12:25 < bridge> <satofan> How do I change the community on the server?
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bgolus.medium.com/the-best-darn-grid-shader-yet-727f9278b9d8
12:40 < bridge> <0xdeen> Not possible currently
12:45 < bridge> <satofan> So I can't make my own DDRaceNetwork server?
13:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> interesting but...
13:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ugh Medium is so ass
13:09 < bridge> <oxyzo.> choo choo

13:25 < bridge> <satofan> @0xdeen
15:40 < bridge> <0xdeen> You can make your own servers, but not create a community
17:16 < bridge> <nanamar> > @0xdeen I can't open ddnet anymore since the new update
17:16 < bridge> <nanamar> > https://i.imgur.com/tGRRI3O.png
17:16 < bridge> <nanamar> @trafilawx same
20:40 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i test sql queries on local server?
20:40 < bridge> <kebscs> they take ages
20:40 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how ddnet servers are so quick with it
20:43 < bridge> <totar> the ddnet servers have indexes that don't get created automatically
21:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> are all sql uis shit except for pgadmin?
21:13 < bridge> <totar> I didn't think pgadmin was significantly better than the other ones I've tried
21:14 < bridge> <totar> datagrip looks like it has the best UI but I've never tried it
21:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I use `psql` ðŸ˜¬
21:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> the goat
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> used datagrip for a short while. forgot how it was :kek:
