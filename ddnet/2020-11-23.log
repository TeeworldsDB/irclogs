10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What is this pr for? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3325
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because these "ball effects" are also possible by just snapping a projectile with m_Type = WEAPON_HAMMER
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and in the current ddnet version i am not able to see those white balls anymore
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with 15.1.3 i can see them.
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am using these balls in my mod, and now they are not visible anymore.
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Without this pr, or with 0.7 clients, or any other client it works, so dunno, @Jupstar ✪ ?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure the problem is not in the earlier commit that pure-luck openend an issue about?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that is linked in the PR?)
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh, i dont know tbh
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just noticed that after 15.1.3 they dont show up with type hammer
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that shouldnt be hard to find, do you have ideas what happened?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut we released a new version with that pr inside
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and pure luck said it worked again, so dunno
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok, will checl
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check*
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen are you sure the result of the benchmark is calculated correctly?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The frametimes in the log are correct, but the test suite shows different results
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you have an example?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2011232-FI-DDNETJ17015
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ingame it showed around 1400fps, and the log also shows frametimes that say this
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If the frametimes we print are correct, then pts does the calculation wrong?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well probably 😄
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno who, or when it gets calculated 😄
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/blob/master/pts-core/objects/pts_test_result_parser.php#L1053
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `if($frametime > 2000)` seems weird
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we use libframetime-output
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats really weird
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> si it only took my laggs and the game start xD
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it only took my laggs and the game start xD
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to create a crossplatform UI that can be shared as as single executable
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> preferably <30MB or so
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also in python, if that's remotely possible
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I tried: hello world pyqt5 program bundled with pyinstaller, about 70MB in size
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently installing wxwidgets to see if it is any bit smaller in size
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems that the pyqt thing include libicudata twice(!)
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 i used tkinter last time I did that with Python, should fix the 30 MB, but looks bad.
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gtk should be a bit smaller than qt too
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe just use a local webserver and open a link to it in the user's browser? That works on every platform and everything is a website nowadays anyway
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 rust links most libs statically and u can use gtk-rs
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can try https://github.com/hecrj/iced
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a gtk program i made in rust, it doesnt have much but u can see its size is rly small
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/780433181152510012/unknown.png
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> managed to shrink the pyqt5+pyinstaller to 20MB by stripping stuff
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the webserver thing is the way to go…
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki can I see the program's source code somewhere?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, ddnet increased in size quite a lot
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the win64 zip is 40M these days
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its the chinese font
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, 17MB of that is the font
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine I guess
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not home rn sry
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chinese bad
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla just took in a 19MB font as well
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> font sux
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> > just kill all asians
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> English is more optimized than chinese, you can say more with less
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 你tm在逗我
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 这长度你能比？
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> therefore chinese ppl are all artists xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 24 characters is all u need
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki is that so? in less bytes?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, in less letters
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, in fewer letters
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> alphabet is overrated
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> speaking of bytes
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 16 bytes can only fit 4-5 chinese chars
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you want an extension?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla got one.
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so maybe
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could also just go decoded utf8
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not really sure yet. but 16 glyphs would be nice
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and compress the network stuff
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can also just have a protocol extension for only names and only send those when names changes
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just give 0.6 a deadline
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and drop the old protocol soon 😄
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 0.8 would be a nice deadline. but that would take a few years
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ppl really want 0.8 to be good enough for porting. but i doubt it
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well 0.8 will probs already contain different mapfiles etc.
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if vanilla maintainer dont block it
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> with the water stuff probabaly
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that too 😄
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> redix should just get greenlight
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then vanilla can finally improve they stuff
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i think we did talked about a built-in map converter in server
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they should break compability to themself xd
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> redix isn't available for the rest of this year iirc
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what i say to myself every day
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: actually how do you think of the vanilla sux for mod mentality.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Take a look at your commit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/a4f13ed4a85a4a2b2e901342a9f4341c779e883c#diff-472b2e75e6cbd3e80ec9ec50e60d8b0dc61c4b9aa81f67ae395cc5d375875a0eL557 The `MAPITEMTYPE_ENVPOINTS` item is part of the map format and holds the number of envelopes in the map. You changed this so it is only saved if there is at least one envelope. I think this might be a bad idea. The Python tml library can't read those maps an
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Tezcan
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie yeah, why do they hate mods so much XD, they should use `protected` and `virtual` much more
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk:  interesting
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro changing this back is fine, but we'd want to avoid a zero-sized malloc there
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so allocate min(1, PointCount) instead
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie why first try implemented fng2 (on 0.6 vanilla), i indeed tried to not modify any files and overload as much as possible, but it was a mess 😄
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i ended up copying the same stuff(that was private:) all over again
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: i've made fng before
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it was just "protected:" it would have been much more easy 😄
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie when first try implemented fng2 (on 0.6 vanilla), i indeed tried to not modify any files and overload as much as possible, but it was a mess 😄
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but that might be a different concern that i normally think about
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe there're just way too many problems
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i mostly care about the server impl as mod ofc 😄
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i love how ppl just drop-in and expect client support for their server.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even tho a nice client base would be cool too
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well yeah, but you could arguee that this is a different game then, upto some point
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet for example is mostly simple stuff added, prediction and so on
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if it would add real different weapons, i'd say it gets a new game 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well vanilla's adding (water) weapon now. but probably still vanilla only.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i wonder how much stuff will be cut
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> (probably most)
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i personally think thats good, but they should break every compability
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vanilla always acts like it has to support ddnet
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do they?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't seem so for 0.7
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well 0.7 is soo similar
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye. i didn't get that vibe as well
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i don't really see a huge difference
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just because nothing got changed in vanilla
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's probably not a ddnet thing
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not because they tried to stay compatible with ddnet
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ok, but for me that sounds similar 😄
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i saw on vanilla discord arguments like "it would break current maps"
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that sounds like they want to stay downward compatible
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well they probably means all 0.6 maps or 0.7 maps so far
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but if it comes hard on hard, write a external unrealted converter
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no need to do this inside the code
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: i think hosters want map converter more. vanilla probably wouldn't do it if they never think about it.
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but what mod except race, even has sooo many maps
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for fng it say, if they like 0.8 converting these 5maps isnt the big issue
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think they just think about it regardless the userbase
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for fng i'd say, if they like 0.8 converting these 5maps isnt the big issue
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ that's e.g. due to the tileset reordering in 0.7
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which broke tons of community maps
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but now I'm pretty sure vanilla gives out different vibes to different ppl, which is cool
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but its not really an issue, embedd the vanilla images and finished
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if the map is 200kb or 20kb doesnt matter
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tell me which maps use 0.7 tilesets and which 0.6
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we can start embedding
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately it's 50k maps
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😉
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and 49.999 of them are 0.6 xD
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> A script could do that?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you find a good way to find out which maps expected 0.6 and which 0.7, yes
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was thinking about doing some ML for it, but never got around to it
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc, automapper
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if the mapper didnt force some broken stuff, the automapper should output smth similar
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or better:
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> define what looks right
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hey, I'm actually in favor of having such a script
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you can put something together, that'd be really nice
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if not, you found the problem why they now care about backwards-compatibility
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just such a PITA
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to not have it
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but lets be honest
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for 99% maps it will work
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> give me the tool
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just for the 1%, and they can be fixed manually
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm fine for 99%
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar ✪ do it now!
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and no, can't be fixed manually, you'd have to know where the tool goes wrong)
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie well, 0.7 is out for years, this is still an unsolved problem
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> showing that backwards-compatibility would have been a good thing
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i disagree
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is it good to have all maps working for ever
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how is it bad?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: actually, didn't 0.7 had some map structure change?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or did that happen later than tileset changes
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if you wouldnt have accepted 0.6 and 0.7 maps at one repo(e.g. bcs they arent even compatible) we could easily convert them
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ can't have that, teeworlds doesn't save those to separate folders
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 0.6 upto 2 weeks ago added crc and sha
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just crc
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.7 also added crc in the beginning
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sha256 was a change AFAIR
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but thats the 1% case again
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh come on
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nobody used 0.7 before release 😄
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can try making some rules for tileset checking.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ wasn't it actually after release?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also please stop making numbers up
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don't know the map structure like at all
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> say "very few" instead
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah i think you can detect always all broken maps by analyzing the tiles and define what should look correct to human eye
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like a automapper
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "can"
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't done it in years
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please do it, I'll gladly accept the tool for the archive
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as long as it just "can" be done
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's as good as if it's not possible
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said, it wont work for every case
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it works for enough to be relevant
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then give me the thing that works good enough
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd be happy with that
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're going in circles already
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should i waste my time with that now xD
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like map with intentionally broken tiles
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, see?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes i see it
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so with backwards-compatibility this would never have been a problem
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: i have time
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if vanilla 0.8 has a different file format its detectable easier
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we wouldn't be here discussing it
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I outlined a way to make it compatible in the teeworlds issue tracker
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it would just break compability ;D
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> edit: I have wastable time
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. 0.7 could have just added a version of the exporter(editor)
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all problems solved
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they used 0.6 file format instead
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so a broken downward compability
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, that would have worked
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> tbh why they didn't thought of that when updating tilesets is beyond me
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> seems like such an obvious thing to do.
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ironically i'd say, bcs in the end 0.7 was rushed xD
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if it took liek 10 years
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~microsoft buy us plz~~
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you want DOS support or what? XD
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> no we want microtransactions and dropped linux support and closed src
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and payed staffs
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> minecraft doesn't have any of that
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except paid staff ^^
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, closed source
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it was closed source before that
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> and microtransactions
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well minecraft does have microtransactions
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh really?
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> a shit ton
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> bedrockredition
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes, the bedrock one
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't know. I even played it recently?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they have 2 minecrafts java and c++
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you mean some fake minecraft that isn't the java edition? ^^
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> u probably played the linux compatible version
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think the skins and resource packs are payed
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> i mean the official minecraft by microsoft
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tbh the c++ version works much much better xD
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just no good mod support
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> i doubt it runs on linux
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, the bedrock version runs really well
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes sadly
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and i'm actually glad they kept both version somewhat in sync
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> also didnt ms drop linux supprot on skype
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in terms of features
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do they have crossplay?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> ms bad
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is anyone actually playing that version? ^^
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> they have different redstones and weapon system
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> yes chinese
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think anyone I know plays it
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but at least the blocks are mostly there for both version
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> europeans stay in java edition
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wdym chinese
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i thought bedrock is big in asia or something
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed alot of PS4 and XBox and tablet users use the mobile version, but i guess in the end most ppl are still more interested in modded minecraft 😄
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm offended
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Tw adding water guns? What happened about following the KISS principle like fanatics? <a:aPES_WTFEyes:642733839973613598>
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> vanilla minecraft is useless
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> vanilla minecraft cant handle more than 8 players online at the same time
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it gets boring fast, yes 😄
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> also something ms introduced
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh?
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> not it just doesnt have basic performance
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> minecraft always scaled badly
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think with beefy servers you can go beyond 8 players
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Microsoft will force u to make ur mojang account a microsoft account
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> server kills it self because it runs too slow on a 3.6ghz 8 core machine when 8 players play at the same time
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think the C++ version of minecraft is using playfab which ms bought as well
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> they made java version perform so bad to force people to buy windows and bedrock edition
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Worst
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah, heard that too
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> annoying af xd
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Now just to be clear, migrating from Mojang to Microsoft accounts is mandatory. If you don’t make the move, in several months you won’t be able to log in anymore – which means you won’t be able to play either. But no need to worry, because we’ll give you detailed and clear instructions on how to do so. You’ll get the information you need through this site, an FAQ on our support page, videos on our YouTube channel, and even email
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think ishould be able to sue them
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have the right to the product i bought
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> wat i lose my mc accs if i dont convert huh didnt know
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yep
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> can i get them back later?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't play until you converted though
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~mojang account isn't really feature complete with basic authentication options~~
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Microsoft in a nutshell: extend embrace extinguish
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> ye EEE classic
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~but yeah they could've made it better instead of nuking it~~
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think EEE applies. EEE is about standards IIRC
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> so pls dont sell to ms
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences in order to strongly disadvantage its competitors.
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> we can get paid staff via donations instead :D
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk: ~~imagine closing donations~~
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ms had the data before this move, but its annoying to always get intetgrated into some eco system
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion:greenthing: 
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> making dummy  Shared :feelsamazingman: to players
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> able to move it more than a player👨‍💻
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> damt
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Good that you asked before implementing it 😄
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> really or  you kidding:saddo:
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really. it's a waste to implement a feature that no one wants
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> again a crash when someone joined a server 😄
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if its related to the decompress issue
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can i run an executable with automatic crash dump, without any huge perf loose? i have debug symbols on
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what do you mean by automatic crash dump? I get a core file if something crashes, 0 performance impact
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how do i enable that
