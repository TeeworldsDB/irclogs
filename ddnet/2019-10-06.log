14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Why dont you pass the MapIndex also from gamecore?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut because afaict the position of the tee is used in all other places
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1915/files#diff-0d0221c586efbe7eda89b6e5075098fdL127
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can see that it depends on the tee's position `m_Pos`
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the `MapIndex` overriding only happens because at that call site, it didn't depend on the tee's position, but some arbitrary other map position
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, but just to have it completed? Maybe someone bases on DDNet, and changes something in the core and uses m_Pos there
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or someone uses m_Core.m_Pos from the character class
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then everything breaks anyway(?) â€“ it's not only the center position that's used in `GetMoveRestrictions`
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `GetMoveRestrictions` checks the current tile and tiles in all four directions. only that center tile is being overridden at the changed call site
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why does it get overriden?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. it checks the specified "center" that is given, and the four directions depending on where the tee is, not the specified center
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it got overridden before, I tried to not change the behavior
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But it works without it

14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rip IRC
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, I dont need to pass the Extra stuff from my mod from the core?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for the room thing
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could just not include this behavior, because it's braindead
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wym
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why the fuck does the stopping of the stopper tiles not depend on the actual position of the tee? ^^
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but only for the center check
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug to me
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, I'd like to keep it as ddnet
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But still, do you remember the room, where I pass the Extra stuff to check whether the tee can enter or not?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do I also need to pass it from the core?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> m_Extra or the new parameter?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Mine, not yours
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> currently i do, and it works
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then continue to do it I guess
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am unsure if it is not useless
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because your new parameter is also not passed from the core, and obviously works
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> argh
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just an override for the center position
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> usually, the the tee's pos is used and some positions in all four directions
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should I draw a picture?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd maybe

14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in gamecore.cpp, where the character is not passed, the code checks the five marked positions for stoppers
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you pass the parameter, like character.cpp does, the center is no longer checked, but another random tile somewhere else on the map is. the tee's surrounding is still checked though
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut is that clearer?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't get how you go from that to not passing extra in gamecore
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah lol
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry for my dumbness at this point
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what kinda behaviour is that??
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which center did the stoppers use before your fix?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it iterates over every tile which it passed, and uses that as a center
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Weird, I dont even remember reading anything like that
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, it's nicely obfuscated
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 wait how is GetPureMapIndex different then the index HandleTiles gets?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> HandleTiles gets an array of tiles that were encountered during the tick
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `void CCharacter::HandleTiles(int Index)` am I missing sth here?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks more like HandleTiles is called for each tile
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sorry
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I looked at it for a while, but I didn't quite get it, what was the old behaviour that you replicated
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I basically just looked at the old code ^^
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has `TileIndex` as a parameter and uses that as the center tile for the stopper calculation, but gets the directional tiles from the tee's position
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the stopper calculation
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> HandleTiles is still called for each and every tile passed through
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooh, your new stopper code only checked the actual position
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in the past it was handled with the map index passed to handletiles?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, I seem to be unable to explain it ^^
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> when talking about physics code and `CCharacter::HandleTiles`
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> what about removing these lines and the corresponding checks below:
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/112d0432e2c47526bf6324a608f808f3cd002871/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1369-L1380
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> 
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> they increase the radius for end and begin tiles... but only when HandleTiles is actually called, so only when you already touch some ddnet tile
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> this is inconsistent and just bloats the code
