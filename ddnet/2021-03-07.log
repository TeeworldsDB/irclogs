02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can you tell me where's the relation between the Snap items and the SnappingClient
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How does the server know which snapitem belongs to which client? I dont see where or how the client id is passed while creating the snapshot
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In CAnyEntity::Snap
02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ohh, nevermind lol
02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I found it already, works as i thought
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> waiting for multiworld xd
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there a way to check teehistorian files for integrity?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> EU anti planned obsolescence law when? My phone keeps getting shittier and shitter each update :P
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 buy a new one for 120~â‚¬ on amazon
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> more like 1000â‚¬
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A 120â‚¬ phone would last even shorter and would have android from 1980
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ur wrong
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bought it for 130â‚¬ and has android 10
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> redmi 9
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or bring the chinese into my pocket :P
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only use my phone to play chess and whatsapp every now and then
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can always install a custom rom
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I take a lot of pictures with it when I can't take my camera for whatever reason, so I cant go too cheap
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well then ye i guess
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho the camera i have is not bad
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is the speed for the redmi 9 btw?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have any speed issues
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont play consuming games
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so idk
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nowadays most phones work well for casual use
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean as in general ui responsivity, keyboard responsivity etc.
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its good
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With this "flagship" s9 I get random ui lockups, keyboard not responding/responding late
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm this never happened to me xd
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and does redmi come with MIUI or vanilla android?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> miui
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has some apps installed ye
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you get ads in your ui? Heard the chinese love to do that nowadats
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nowadays*
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I saw a guy with an unskippable 30 second car ad on his tv on boot :D
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is one stupid app tho
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it check for virus when u install an app
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and usually shows and ad there
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats all i found
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the add is not a unskipabble ad
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have to look into custom roms
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wanted to try this
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im 2 lazy to fck it up and lose stuff
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's fairly good. Pipe all your traffic through a vpn and filter out the beaconing and you get a decent phone at a decent price
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should buy an iphone
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I considered that a lot. But while they respect your privacy (mostly) they also do planned obsolescence AND I've really gotten used to android, not sure if I want to go back now
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> +they removed the damn headphone jack....
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I absolutely despise apple for even coming up with that stupid idea
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> for what do you need headphone jack if you have airpods
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't :P
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would I want airpods when I already have a collection of great IEMs the airpods could only come close to
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> you can get 10euro xiaomi bluetooth headphones
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> so its really your choice to keep the shitty cable
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> removing the headphone jack was stupid
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and then other companies started to do it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which is even more annoying
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its the future
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in 10 years you wont have cable at all
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like i can see why they remove usbs on the macbook, it makes it a lot more slick
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they kinda removed headphone jack rly early tho
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they didnt remove it entirely
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u still have the adapter
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m true
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> forgot abt that
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i mean its a premium phone its for people with money
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> just because normal people buy it its not meant for them
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if you have a newer car you will have bluetooth in your radio
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if not you dont buy an iphone which is probably nearly worth the same money as the car
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> in america theres like an apple "cult following"
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with all the memes abt android vs apple
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> iphone is a really good phone
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> and i really think its probably better then all android phones
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> but do you really need that phone if you just a normal person
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> iphone sux
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye its good but not relative to price
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i just dislike apple in general a bit
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if you cant afford something its not the products fault
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not abt that
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they just do stupid things and everyone still buys their stuff cuz its apple
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like they try to stop ppl from repairing their phones cuz they are greedy
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats capitalism
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @Learath2 ur ref for ano's profile is broken
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> forgot to add the / before players
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/818185143164207184/unknown.png
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sopinha> lol Nice point of view
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sopinha> :twinbop:
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 there's no checksum or so for teehistorian files, sorry
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could run through them and see if it parses
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you want to achieve?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling I synced some incomplete ones
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @SPYRES thanks, fixed
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw did you know that you need to pass --compression to the curl command line if you want compression for the response?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought stuff like that would be automatic
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> --compressed*
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently wget also doesn't automatically request compression ðŸ˜®
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L56-L58
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> Guys, how is this even supposed to work?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> If it is short
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whats so special about it?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.h#L46
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 16k is ok for short
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> So this is correct? To assign a value to a short that exceeds what it can have?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt exceed it
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> MAX_IDS is 16384, the maximum value of short is 32767
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> short in c++ is 16bit
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if its not somewhere else
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the standards people are about to hunt you ðŸ˜‰
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast on our archietexturres ðŸ˜„
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast on our architectures ðŸ˜„
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> Okay then, no question, but that's what  clang-tidy is swearing at xD
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you post the output of clang-tidy?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> Then it would probably be correct to specify short instead of int
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> I use clang-tidy as a supplement to ReSharper together with the Visual Studio add-in in Windows. I think it should probably be short instead of int
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it maybe fail to include the header and just assumes a wrong value or smth?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or does it actually say like 16k is too much
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe it complains about assigning an int to a short?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> Well, I'm picky about code in general and in case I needed to increase the value if I were a newbie, I wouldn't even look in the direction of what's short xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd suggest to use sized datatypes if possible anyway
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Well, I'm picky about code in general
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're going to have a fun time with ddnet code
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> xD
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> It complains about the conversion and the last element xd (32767 - 32768)
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> Okay, those are my changes sry xD
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> then only conversion
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <æ‹“çœŸ> By the way, there is a dead code.  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/base/vmath.h#L124.  If need save the logic there, probably need to use type_traits
