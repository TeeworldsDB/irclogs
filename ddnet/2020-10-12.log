00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well since we can't change the signature of strncpy, it's reasonable  that our wrapper for it should mimic the signature
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 huh? I think that's precisely what a wrapper function can do for us, change the parameter type
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it can, but should it? it's unnecessary complexity imho
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we get size_t from sizeof, we truncate it down to int, we pass it to our wrapper, which pads it with zeros and passes it to strncpy
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the wrapper can shield the complexity from us
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sizeof is constant, so the truncations isn't really real. but yea, it creates an unsigned integer that can be used in unsigned comaprisons 😦
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> also i run clang-tidy with clang-analyzer*, output: https://0x0.st/iGMI.txt
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest: :justatest:
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides, who cares what google thinks, they've created one of the messiest programs I've ever seen in a decade with their "guidelines"
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 which one? xd
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why chromium ofcourse
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > Because of historical accident, the C++ standard also uses unsigned integers to represent the size of containers - many members of the standards body believe this to be a mistake, but it is effectively impossible to fix at this point.
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there is anyone not to be trusted with anything, it's the C++ standards committee 😛

01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > They can't use OpenGL to accelerate Qt Quick, no. Which is a pretty severe drawback. Unfortunately the status of OpenGL on Windows is a nightmare. The "average" Windows computer will have an Intel-based GPU with ancient drivers, which are buggy enough to cause Qt not even try to use any 3D at all (OpenGL nor Direct3D). NVIDIA and AMD are usually better, as at least they tend to be more up-to-date.
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds a bit like the issues we're running into

01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should copy one of these lists and warn the user to update their drivers in the DDNet client
06:43 <+Obiwan> Hey @deen
06:43 <+Obiwan> What is "sixup connections"?
06:44 <+Obiwan> I googled it, but found a site for study in europe
06:44 <+Obiwan> nothing more about programming or network main
07:37 <@deen> Obiwan: It's our way of providing Teeworlds 0.7 net protocol compatibility in DDNet Server
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Unsigned let's you think about the math u do. They nice
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Google doesn't even give a reason. So thumbs down on that
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Bjarne Stroustrup says that unsigned ints are error prone and lead to bugs"
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ the creator of c++ says things too
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In my mind the main danger comes from the very common value 0 being one-off to an underflow. much higher chance of going wrong than with int64_t
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well teeworlds is the best argument against this.
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unscalable, full of undefined behaviour, negative array accesses that arent checked
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> int to floats, floats to int without thinking
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ever wondered why we dont have a full 360° cursor in teeworlds
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wdym 360° cursor?
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     m_HookDir.x = pObjCore->m_HookDx / 256.0f;
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     m_HookDir.y = pObjCore->m_HookDy / 256.0f;`
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs we just kill the precision
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if that would be 1024, tw would be much nicer already
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o_o
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> move ur cursor very slowly
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with hook line
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and u'll notice
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that why some hooks thru corners from far away dont work well
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because of precision
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if the hook is long enough probably,
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wow
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u just saved me
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> alot of time thanks
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u cannot change this
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client uses it for network
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes thats why it saved time xd
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok xD
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought i messed something up
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> didnt consider that it could be limitation of tw protocol
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> one thing is true tho, try not not mix data types
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i dont see an argument against unsigned
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if unsigned underflows u are fucked
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so u need to care much more than with ints
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> signeds*
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> array[-1] and array[2147483648] will both crash
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah bcs -1 is probs converted
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but (ptr - 1) might be a legit memory address
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh true
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and thats undefined by your source probably
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not invalid read write, but undesired
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and undefined ye
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765114263575461928/unknown.png
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we prefer todo this instead of not program like this xd
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> ~~wizard~~
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The bounds checking on gcc is absolutely shit, we are in the right to silence it
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno std::array for example typedefs its size_type to size_t, so the [] operator would require unsigned
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (what i am just saying is, the compiler probs prefers to warn than to create user undesired behaviour)
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 To be fair, C++ standards commitee is in an impossible situation. They want 100% backwards compatibility, new features without any cost, and modernize the language at the same time.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, it's clear to any sane person that they have to give one up
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But they wouldn't be C++ if they did that. Other languages fill the other niches
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I'd give up the backwards compatibility, with one major revision of time to fix deprecated stuff)
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hello Python 3, my good friend
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but isnt backwards compatibility what makes c++ stay for so long
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unmaintained code can be compiled with old compilers
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The idea in C++ is instead to use something like clang-tidy to enforce modern stile in new code bases and to try to clean up old ones
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pythons upgrade was such a mess because they didn't want to commit to it. They let the userbase draaaaaag it on
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and that guy the benevolent dictator for life, he was just too benevolent
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, they wanted to commit. But the user base was strongly against it, and the same would happen in C++ but much stronger
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ fanatics
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like learath
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are you on about? I don't even like C++
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you like the C right
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you like C right
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen users don't know what's good for them, that's why we have committees making decisions
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially the average python user
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not that it says much, but I was a bit shocked to see C move to number 1 on TIOBE Index: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder why it is first
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mostly because Java went down, not C up, but anyway
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I wonder where the java devs went
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Js maybe?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> PHP going up :justatest:
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn wordpress
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think java went down due to oracle
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing that paid thing
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did they do?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you have to paid to have a LTS version
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something like that
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pay*
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [4:25 AM] deen: Not that it says much, but I was a bit shocked to see C move to number 1 on TIOBE Index:

11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> c best
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they are speeding up java development
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Starting with Java 9 most Java version will only have a lifetime of 6 months. Updates won’t be provided for the version after this period. Even if you have a commercial contract with Oracle you won’t get any additional updates for Java 9 or 10 after these 6 months. Plus, all 3 years a LTS (long term support) version of Java will be released. The first version with LTS support will be Java 11 that is scheduled for fall 2018. This LTS v
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as u know companies want stability
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so they seek LTS versions
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u have to pay
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk maybe i misunderstood
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> > PHP going up :justatest:
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> i know some php
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> it isnt really good
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The most important fact is that updates for LTS versions can only be accessed and used by people that buy commercial support at Oracle. My experience is that today most companies that develop Java based software do not have commercial support since the release train of Java was quite „friendly“ and an adoption of the newest version was easily possible.
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this ^
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt the commercial support being paid is an issue
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> before new java releases were rare
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Java 11 is soooooooo stable
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but now they are speeding
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even the open source version, pretty much everyone uses that
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw i think java 15 is modular or smth
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but those wont receive updates
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u donth ave commercial
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> support
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> multiline strings were added with ` in java
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> multiline strings were added with ` in java 12
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> lol
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Oracle JDKs may only be used in production if you buy the commercial support. I
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also this
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> what do you expect from oracle than wanting money
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can no longer use oracle jdk freely
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> well that commercial thingie really sucks
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most minecraft stuff is still java 8
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish they updated
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coding spigot is quite fun
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> java 8 is enough for a java dev i suppose
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well do you really need updates to java 11?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my son will rise up and conquer the world
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765145021636018186/unknown.png
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> i have both 8 and 11 but 8 still does my stuff
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OpenJ9 maintains LTS releases too and you can use them
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are good featurs in new java versions
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> getting stuck in 8 is n ogood
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> its just enough
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> i dont say its bad
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> nor good
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Java's streams are so nice to work with
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> java 9 intoduces modules
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> maven exists
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They really made functional programming quite palatable and usable
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> i agree with that
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like ppl who are content with "enough"
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weak mindset
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> it just does what i need
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> i wouldnt need a higher version than 11
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah why software gets updates
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid developers
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> to get better ofc
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Intelligent Cat> but i see no reason to update while there is no need
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen can you put in the readme the dependencies needed for videorecorder on debian atleast? they arent there 👀
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what are the dependencies? ffmpeg?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> libx264-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-extra
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> libavutil-dev
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im finding them
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then you make a PR
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah, i thought u knew all them tho
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cmake complains this By not providing "FindSQLite3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but then it says
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -- Checking for module 'sqlite3'
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> --   Found sqlite3, version 3.27.2
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -- Found SQLite3: /usr/include
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which makes no sense to me
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (this on debian)
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe @heinrich5991 knows better about cmake problems ^
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ryozuki.xyz/ddnet-scan/
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i set this up
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill make daily scans
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not a big fan of daily scans. I think we should fix them and enable clang-tidy with those checks in github so we notice on the PRs directly
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and not only after they are merged
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah but we should fix all first
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise the prs will get a x tick right
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its not their fault
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but you could also mark all existing ones with an exclude if you don't want to fix them immediately
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `// NOLINT(clang-analyzer-core.DivideZero)`
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont know much about configuring the CI and stuff
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make it work locally and we can get it done
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> basically just copy the normal build and run it with clang tidy on
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and in the .clang-tidy file set WarningsAsErrors: '*'
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And `Checks: -*, clang-analyzer*`. You could test if that results in the same failures you're seeing with clang-analyzer
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html#prop_tgt:%3CLANG%3E_CLANG_TIDY
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like cmake has clang-tidy integration
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, so -DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY=ON -DCMAKE_C_CLANG_TIDY=ON should work
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that variable doesnt work like that
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u set it in cmake: set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY clang-tidy -checks=-*,readability-*)
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then when u run ninja
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows the warnings
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and there are quite a lot
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> set it just to `clang-tidy` and use a .clang-tidy file as I described
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not all checks make sense for us, start with the clang-analyzer ones
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> treating it as error wont show all the warnings tho
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> src/game/collision.cpp:1030:2: error: Variable 'f' with floating point type 'float' should not be used as a loop counter
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well this makes sense
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the CI doesnt have clang-tidy installed
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, we could grep for warnings in the output or use `make --keep-going`
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just add it in the installation at top
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where do  put keep-going hm
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in the call to make, but I think we don't call make explicitly but make cmake call it
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cmake --build <dir> -- --keep-going`
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so just add the `-- --keep-going at the end`
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen why put .clang-tidy in src?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think cmake detects it fine in the base dir
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I guess it's fine
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur github comment was a bit weird formatted
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just thought it's more specific in src, but we don't really have other source code around anyway
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks to markdown xd
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, fixed
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen its full of unknown warning option
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can give it a look, is your pr up-to-date?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean the CI btw
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> localy it shows warnings correctly
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why did you set clang-tidy always on for every build?
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im testing
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think the idea is to have a separate clang-based build
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where are the errors then?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when u compile
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or what errors u mean
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you said locally it works, where are the failures in CI
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt recognize the warnings added by clang-tidy i guess
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what doesn't?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where can i find the failures?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3075/checks?check_run_id=1241803867
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> build debug
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anmd scroll down
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its full of unknown warning option
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That is a clang-tidy warning
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> localy it looks like this to me
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765171208563982346/unknown.png
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also, is it building with gcc? we should be using clang for that I guess
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think heinrich can do this better
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im no cmake magician
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can also try to finish it up if you want
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go for it
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nice
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Float as a loop counter is a first for me
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 wdym by first for me
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as in top priority? or as in u never saw it
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Never saw it before
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope we don't actually use it to index anything 😛
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try to fix the clang-tidies we have for now
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like lot of work
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See my update in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3076, mostly all the same
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, we should probably exclude external stuff too
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see 1 warning in wavpack atleast
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, will try
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Failed to finalize filesystems. Ignoring" Thanks systemd
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always prefer corrupt filesystems over waiting a couple seconds or actually troubleshooting
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/407308363031117832/490150878934990850/765175509142470666
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🍷 :frozen:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if anyone can hep :(
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After spending almost a year with systemd and archlinux, I have to say, I'm quite unimpressed
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's all packaged for even a goof to be able to use linux, but it's a rolling release. A rolling release always has issues and archlinux gives you no way to fix them
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have yet to find a issue tho
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im using it since a year too
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well do you get the failed to unmount oldroot on shutdown?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also ur quite wrong usually when there is a problem with a package update they post a news
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.archlinux.org/news/ghostpcl9532-2-and-ghostxps9532-2-updates-require-manual-intervention/
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They decided the best course of action, is to try to unmount and if it doesn't work, ignore it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It tries to synchronize my filesystem fails, just ignores it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> During boot I get like 10 driver issues, none of them have been fixed even though they've been reported for weeks
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah and that is systemd fault?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it wasn't a PITA, I would just build the kernel without the overzealous drivers trying to attach to hardware that they are not for
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in what way are driver issues arch fault
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it wasn't a PITA to build an initrd with systemd, I would just fix the stupid script that's trying to unmount filesystems that aren't even mounted
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and "weeks" is a small time imho
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's a rolling release that gives me no way to fix it myself. It would never happen in debian, because even though they give you no way to fix shit, they follow the kernel sooo slowly it doesn't matter
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On gentoo it's absolutely trivial for me to just not build these drivers I don't need
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg man
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just install the lts kernel
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> how can i increase the fps
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have solutions
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just dont know them
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cl_increasefps 1
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux-lts
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My solution is to use an old kernel on my rolling release distro?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hell
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use linux-lts44
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from aur
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u want
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is a new kernel driver bug arch linux fault?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur insane
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> noby biggest stalker
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u wish
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was reading the chat
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> stalker
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> of who
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> thats what a stalker would do
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not their fault that the driver is broken, it is their fault that they provide no way for me to not have the broken driver
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they do proivide one
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use a older kernel
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and wait until its fixed
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can also make ur own aur package
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, some people just don't care about any of this and they are free to use archlinux and shit over other peoples opinions online
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and configure it how u like
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Learath2 you can try void linux, install older kernel series https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/kernel.html#kernel-series
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know u can configure and use pkgbuild files to ur own liking?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> also runit really fast
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @nori xdd
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not his problem
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just go back to gentoo where I can just build my system however I want
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i actually told him about using older kernel
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do that
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fact that u dont know or arent willing
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is urs only
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am not willing to spend time building a whole package to customize my kernel, yes.
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_module#Blacklisting
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do i even talk ur just set in stone already
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use ur allmighty gentoo and done
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i go back to watching anime
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, I don't get why you are throwing stuff at me. I tried, I don't like the unflexible nature of this distro. Opinions are opinions
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it triggers me u say u cant when u can
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just dont like t he way u can
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly, It's very inconvenient IMHO. It might be convenient enough for you
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also why are u even using arch linux if u have systemd
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u a masochist
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hate*
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because people tell me I'm not allowed to have an opinion about systemd before trying it
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah sure its that
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IMO that's like saying I'm not allowed to hate on nazis before being a nazi. You can disagree with something without trying it, shocker
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, now that I'm done with my experiment and I can freely rant. I'll be heading back to gentoo
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not sure ithats
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe I'll try one more on the way
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt use a distro just to prove someone wrong
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't do it to prove someone wrong. I just geniunely wanted to know what people saw in systemd and a binary rolling release distro at the same time
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use this 4Head
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's just too much work. Gentoo gives me almost the same level of customization without spending half a decade putting together my own distro
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well cya when u finished compiling
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well cya until u finished compiling
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know what with a well configured kernel, you can even use the computer while it's compiling?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah im joking
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> idk if its already reported, but: http://prntscr.com/uxqr1n
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> when i spec and my time is over 1hr, hindus skin is over his time
14:36 <@deen> yes, fixed
14:36 <@deen> will release fix now
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Am I the only one who has to double-tick "borderless window" every start of a non-fullscreen 15.0.5 DDNet client?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> As it starts as border windows regardless of the setting is loaded correctly to an ui.
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765218627371663420/Screenshot_from_2020-10-12_17-25-31.png
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Weird, sounds like an SDL bug
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh wait
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we only create borderless window on mac, that seems wrong
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No, in linux borderless windows works fine. It's just it ignores the setting on load.
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean it loads setting in UI but doesn't apply it to the game window @deen
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If uncheck/check it after load it applies.
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah bcs its only ignored when initialized
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Exactly. Please don't remove borderless windows from linux build 😅
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he did the opposite
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I cannot use full-sized as they give me more problems.
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he added it again
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice, thanks for adding it
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So... please leave borderless windows as it is. I will just silently leave 😅 no need to remove it.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will tolerate this small bug. k thanks bye
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> As I understand you were going to remove borderless window functionality from linux build.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Please don't.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dude
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> read my sentences carefully
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> i don't know who did the oppisite and what. Still don't get it
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see the github popup xD
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah... my brains filters github popups
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> thanks!
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > if unsigned underflows u are fucked
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ if you use something to index into an array, it doesn't really matter whether it's an unsigned or not, right?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think -1 and MAX_INT behave the same for accidental out of bounds reads/writes
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> MAX_UINT*
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they both access the array element before the first one
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ what do you think about blacklisting opengl drivers like chromium does? https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/764996392300707851
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure? MAX_UINT would probably go over
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, array indexes are signed aren't they
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually not really sure, the standard seems to just say "integral type"
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> c style arrays should be ptrdiff
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 i only mean, that -1 might not crash while 2^64 will crash for sure
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 generally ok, but i dunno if we even require this anymore, the fallback catches everything rn i think
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ why will 2^64 crash for sure?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2^64-1 will access the previous array elemetn the same way as -1 as far as I can tlel
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh yeah converted to ptrdiff probs
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho, e.g. for iterating
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will crash for sure xd
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for iterating, -1 actually does the sane thing
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while with signed it might not even enter the loop
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `int i = 0; i < -1; i++`
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats bad, might create undesired things
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok fair
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's unfair to say that the problems in teeworlds come from signed integers
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not directly
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i still would use int for alot of stuff
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problems in teeworlds come from missing bounds checking or from C/C++'s problems of not automatically bounds checking
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats fair too
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc rust would be nicer in general, but the question is, how would other devs react to that
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or better: with infinite time, c is never better than rust
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and yeah, scalability is something else too
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know it might sound crazy to have support for 16k textures, but we laugh about this now, not in 20years xd
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most any compiler I know of will catch the infinite iteration because unsigned btw
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gcc, clang, icc and msvc all have warnings about it
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it cannot predict user input
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> load a tw map, make the camera go somewhere insane
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like this
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure there are compilers/settings that can make this even more paranoid to cover for the user input case
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or negative zoom lvl
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth that isnt really expected
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gcc already does a lot with trying to predict the range of values a variable can ever be
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we had a bug
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with the camera going outside the kill borders
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Avoiding a data type because people used it wrong back when gcc4 was current is a bad idea imho
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2768
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we caught it bcs it uses unsigned, and crashed bannzays game
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc this wouldnt be insanly critical with signed
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would just not render something at all
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like learath still havent seen jupstar ui pr :justatest:
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> war incoming
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki i made it as simple as the tw gui btw
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is unsigned there anyway? `m_Zoom`?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i havent added something insane, and the old ui is still in tact
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i know
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im ok with it
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 it renders a unsigned amount of tiles
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did it crash the game anyway?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, wait gonna look into the code
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3076/commits/f0807845e8ee762182a3085bc752992a2dbd5916
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can this for some magical reason
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change game physics?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish github links didnt include a fcking massive image embedded everytime
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so annoying
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I welcome a UI cleanup, it's been in a horrible state for so long
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I am a little concerned about a capturing lambda in the hot path 😛
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i also thought about that
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it me or github also shows the tabs however it wants?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Compilers are actually great with them nowadays, gone are the early days of wasteful captures but still, needs investigation and thorough review
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its dark theme fault
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki github does that, you can set it to a value with the dark theme though
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in `RenderBorderTileEmulation`
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i implemented the bordertiles in a loop, just like a opengl driver would do it, so it creates a specific amount of tiles to render
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > @Ryozuki github does that, you can set it to a value with the dark theme though

17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> this happens a lot in china already, not a good sign.
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought its just curl does support https xD
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohhh
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has customization
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn this is good
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> happened to me in windows debug mode
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I assumed cloudflare would mitigate the effects of the great firewall 😦
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe add a mirror in a china server
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think cloudflare are heavily restricted already
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not really very familiar with how one routes based on geolocation
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when that happens, can you ask them to go to the URL manually?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a browser
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> which one
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i don't know the full url  😄
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://info2.ddnet.tw/info
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> also does the client retry?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it does when you refresh, not sure though
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> might just be outbound QoS by ISPs at high stress.
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but it is 11pm so might not be. anything outbound is slow between 6pm - 9pm i think
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what QoS outright blocks the request to a HTTPS page with low traffic?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> by outbound i mean out of china
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does cf not have servers in china?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: they might dropped it, not blocked completely
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tcp retries if packets are dropped
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> then i have no idea
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :doggo_lol:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> they didn't respond, it might be fixed itself
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I'm not really very familiar with how one routes based on geolocation
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 some months ago i got millions of traffic from china to my website and i had to geoban them
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.cloudflare.com/network/
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like it does have servers in china
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think china servers are handled by Baidu, don't know how it works. let me check.
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki in this case we'd need to route before it hits our servers, that sounds impossible
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really know how CDNs do it, the clients don't have a way of choosing the closest server
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> yeah, you need to call cf as a enterpirse customer to use china server
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://www.cloudflare.com/network/china/
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > An ICP license is issued by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof, plus you need a ICP
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i have one tho
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it is outdated, but i can renew it
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are a licensed internet content provider in china?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Guys, how do you fight spam on your forum? Do you have some kind of extensions or automatic solution or it's hand labor of post-moderation.
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> ye
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i combat it by not having a forum
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it is content provider, not internet provider, i have it for teeworlds.cn
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > You can choose to place your private SSL keys in our China data centers
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess what will happen to your private keys 😉 <a:baidu_wink:734775918064828437> 😉
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk:
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck Premoderation on registration
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats since the forum is not active
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as much*
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cloudflare business is 200$/m
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cloudflare enterprise is contact us/m
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably more than business
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> tbh i can try mirroring some of ddnet on teeworlds.cn if i get my shit together
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Contact Us/m is usually businessspeak for way out of your budget unless you have investors
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie 🌈 mirroring isn't really possible, it's dynamic content
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you could mirror the static content and use the dynamic one if it's contactable
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If ddnet was popular enough I bet they would let us have it for free as a PR stunt. "Helping the open source community"
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> thanks, @Learath2
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they quoted us 5k$/m for game ddos protection IIRC
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: info.json is probably fairly static, maybe a short cache
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's different per player
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it contains your finished maps
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so basically no way to cache
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> rip
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we just don't give them enough exposure at this size. It'd be a waste to help us for cheap
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: then..
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i'll let them restart the client then, that worked so far
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> lol
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i'll let tell them to restart the client then, that worked so far
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You see how they instantly took in brian krebs for free after akamai dropped him, who were carrying him for free too?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's all about exposure for these businessppl
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: or maybe made a warning a banner with a retry button instead of a full-on popup.
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it scares ppl i think
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and it is red too
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it bad to be red
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could attach a severity to the warnings and color the popup accordingly
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent chinese very red
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the flag
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet-info.json failing to download is definitely not as fatal as red warning would imply 😄
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk: but you don't stare at the flag every day on your pc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> why would you
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 they can just refresh on the ddnet tab btw, that should retry getting ddnet-info.json
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i see
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u love ur country
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but still, probably change it to some other color
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :doggo_lol:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I'll add it to my TODO
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> and possibly no popup
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No popup would make it a tad hard to indicate the warning in a generic way
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> true.
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you create an issue about it so I don't forget and someone else can take a whack at it if they want to?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :saddog: or you can make the refresh button red or something
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought the exact same thing, but keeping that generic is quite hard
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd need to check the warnings list before rendering any component
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since components don't really exist until rendered I don't see any other way
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> is github really slow right now or it is just china
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> works for me
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works for me

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i have a proxy, but both proxy and direct connection is pretty slow

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it does look like a avatar ngl
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> nvm, github isn't going through my proxy because it is technically not blocked
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it works now. thx
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Moderator Robert blocking on ger1:8312
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://releases.llvm.org/11.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clang 11.0 out
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > clang’s AST now improves support for representing broken C++ code. This improves the quality of subsequent diagnostics after an error is encountered. It also exposes more information to tools like clang-tidy and clangd that consume clang’s AST, allowing them to be more accurate on broken code.
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have clang 12
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ how x
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> d
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://apt.llvm.org/
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can add devel source
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah 12 is in development
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes xd
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use arch btw
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does arch not have dpkg and apt ?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao no
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has pacman
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean optionally
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and AUR helpers
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can install that version im sure
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with clang-git pkg or smth like that
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765256575425708072/unknown.png
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but why u want the dev version
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u test new llvm stuff?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well c++20 features, and also i had a bug some day and i was annoyed xd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since then i didnt deactivated it xd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 u obviously know that, but, if you not use size_t(on 64bit) there is ofc still a case where unsigned int is different
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but to be fair, i'd probs use size_t most of the time when i work with ptrs directly, and then this ofc is equal to -1
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/765261212509929503/unknown.png
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, with 32bit integers on 64bit platforms, -1 as an index is different between signed and unsigned
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> makes me wonder if a 128bit compiler(emulated) would find some very rare bugs 😄
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mokielBRKS> Alguém BR
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen u dont know the shotgun bug? XD
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats funny
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its used in brainduck i think
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there are no physics bugs
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xDD
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everything is as it is supposed to be
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho we could think about fixing it like heinrich did with grenade
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the shotgun bug is the one where u get speed to one side with spec
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or when u go one direction and shot a side
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are used in maps
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also shotgun bugs are fun
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pls dont remove them
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://youtu.be/aYCpB0v4Mcg?t=97>
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fun
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hes trolling xd
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen always trolls xD, he just makes it so perfect that u think hes not
23:08 <+ChillerDragon> deen is a unkown troll
23:08 <+ChillerDragon> omg a typo
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> and btw stop "fixing" features
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> whats next fixing the wallhammer?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> NaN = not a number, so, basically this is non existing
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it never existed
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what shotgun bug?
23:17 <+ChillerDragon> @noby im legit and no :robot: confirmed by duck.com https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602537337.png
