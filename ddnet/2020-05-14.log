08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki nope
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is it possible to echo config variable?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just enter the name
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `sv_name` prints the name of the server
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i mean i wanna print a config variable to chat, like echo $cl_dummy_resetonswitch
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we don't have a way I think. What would that be good for?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nori use cfg files, just like me (and i believe many others). I use it for dummy hammer and dummy copy for example, or also deepfly. when i turn it on, echo will print Dummy Hammer: ON to chat, otherwise OFF of course
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @fokkonaut it's kinda spaghetti but ok :d
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> @nori oh boi i feel your need for $cl_dummy_resetonswitch also in combinations with if statements would be awesome o.O but overkill :D
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut `bind <key> "cl_dummy_reset_on_switch 2; echo cl_dummy_reset_on_switch set to 2"
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut `bind <key> "cl_dummy_reset_on_switch 2; echo cl_dummy_reset_on_switch set to 2"`
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yes @ChillerDragon :D

21:15 <+ChillerDragon> is it only me or is this issue confusing? i dont get what u want
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> The only way to reset a dummy or main is by having to actually switch to the other tee, there is no other way currently
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> I'd nice to have a function to reset dummy/main just by a keypress rather having to switch back and forth
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> It's somewhat possible to reset a dummy or main by turning on and off dummy_copy but then again, you have to click twice and not press any buttons
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> It's somewhat possible to reset a dummy or main by turning on and off dummy_copy but then again, you have to "click twice" and not press any buttons
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> as an example: if you hh with your dummy and accidentally held hammer while switching, you can't hammer with the dummy/main thus possible die because you didnt react fast enough
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> as an example: if you hh with your dummy and accidentally held fire while switching, you can't hammer with the dummy/main thus possible die because you didnt react fast enough
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> and that can be fixed by simply having a command to reset your main/dummy everytime you toggle back and forth between your main and dummy
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> ^ I know this is basically resetonswitch but I am bad at remembering if I have resetonswitch turned on or off
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> thats just one example, there are many other benefits having a command to reset dummy/main without switching.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi aka murpi> ^ I know this is basically resetonswitch but I am bad at remembering if I have resetonswitch turned on or off - imagine it was still accidentally on, and I hung on a ceiling above fail parts and bam, dead. -
