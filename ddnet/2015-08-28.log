01:29 <@deen> ^ if anyone has a better idea, pIDs just has 4 addresses for each, not sure if we should use a static variable since there can be 2 popups on screen

02:09 < nuborn> I timed out from a server, and somehow I cant join it again, but I can still join other GER servers
02:11 < nuborn> wait, it worked after restart
03:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vGIpd

08:10 <@EastByte> "nuborn: I timed out from a server, and somehow I cant join it again, but I can still join other GER servers"
08:10 <@EastByte> I hope he wasn't using ddnet client :/
08:48 <@EastByte> I found the issue!!!!!
09:05 < Learath2> how do we find out if a server is >16 players on the serverbrowser 
09:05 < Learath2> ?
09:07 <@EastByte> it's parsed in the server name
09:07 <@EastByte> [x/64]
09:07 < Learath2> ew thats ugly
09:09 <@EastByte> also if gametype is DDRaceNetwork I think
09:09 <@EastByte> well but that was the original approach
12:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vGtXp
12:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d1c0551 east: Don't reset timeout state on rejoin
14:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: off the top of your head, do you know a map which uses sounds?
14:13 < uchar> heinrich5991, you know Mario Maker?
14:13 <@heinrich5991> no
14:13 <@heinrich5991> what is it?
14:13 < WolfAlex> uchar: mario maker <3 in two weeks
14:14 <@EastByte> no off topic pls
14:14 < uchar> is for ideas
14:14 < uchar> can be define sounds to actions
14:14 < uchar> very crazy xD
14:15 <@deen> heinrich5991: they're marked on http://ddnet.tw/ranks/novice (etc)
14:15 <@deen> So: Spooky, Xabier, Little Forest
14:15 <@deen> oh, and some solo maps that no one marked^^
14:16 <@deen> UpNDown and UpNDown2
14:23 <@heinrich5991> deen: it seems the old sound format is detected and then treated like the new one (?)
14:23 <@deen> old sound format?
14:23 <@deen> we only support one
14:23 <@deen> the old one was there for a few days or weeks and then we replaced it and all maps
14:23 <@deen> all maps that used it have been fixed
14:30 <@heinrich5991> yea ok
14:35 <@deen> EastByte: huh? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/313
14:37 < o_be_one> hellow :)
14:40 <@deen> hi
14:43 <@EastByte> double clicking, yeaay
14:44 <@EastByte> works for me aswell, but maybe I forgot something
14:44 <@EastByte> nuborn: have you had such a timeout before?
14:44 <@EastByte> (not being able to join again)
14:50 < nuborn> hi
14:50 < nuborn> EastByte: no, not that I remember. and it worked after I restarted DDNet again
14:51 < nuborn> I could connect and play again
14:51 <@EastByte> I'm trying to reproduce such issues for two weeks now
14:53 <@EastByte> nuborn: could the timeout be caused by your connection or was it just a timeout by no reason?
14:55 < nuborn> it could be my connection, but usually I don't time out because of it
14:56 < nuborn> Im not sure since I just got a new internet connection
14:57 <@EastByte> okay, thanks
14:59 < nuborn> I can try to check if it happens again
15:04 <@EastByte> would be nice
15:20 < Sadale> o_be_one, this time I give you a special offer. You may highlight me as much as you want this morning :)
15:24 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: hey ... seen 10 days for game servers :D ? available !

15:25 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: thank you! i'll order one now

15:30 < o_be_one> on 15 september i think
15:31  * o_be_one look at the sky ... :p
15:31 < WolfAlex> it says 10 days :D so 07.09 ? :D
15:32 < o_be_one> ahah, idk, we'll see :p
15:33 < o_be_one> just be one of the first to order it, cause there will be many many many orders
15:33 < o_be_one> and OVH is known to be late, sometime, to give ordered server (i remember with my KS2G, 1 month to get it .......
15:34 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: i've orderd it already :)
15:34 < WolfAlex> and also already paid 
15:36 < o_be_one> awesome hope you'll get it soon :)
15:36 < o_be_one> i'll get one too, so i'll work i think on GAME DDoS (i'll do my best to get acces to manage it asap) so let me know if there's some game to add/improve ; idk if its in priority but if i'm able to do it i'll do my best (my first goal is TW :D)
15:37 < o_be_one> (i want to own stupid ddosers 8-) and i'll do it !)
15:40 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: you are hopefully doing a great job! otherwise i'll blame you :p
15:41 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: I suppose you're the o_be_one who added me on steam?
15:42 < o_be_one> yes heinrich5991 , ive added deen too
15:42 < o_be_one> and added a vote to DDRaceNetwork :p
16:03 <@deen> i don't use steam, so i hope no one is mad that i don't accept those friend inviations
16:40 < o_be_one> i'm mad ! :(
17:13 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: :o?
17:13 < o_be_one> ? :D
17:14 < o_be_one> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2142&p=23084#p23084 boring complaing player for nothing -_-
17:14 < o_be_one> i don't like when a player just don't realise that it's not cause of admins if no players likes him ...
17:15 < WolfAlex> ow so much text
17:15 < o_be_one> i always take the time to read and answer to my players
17:16 < o_be_one> and try to be the most comprehensive i can for them ...
17:16 < o_be_one> every player is unique for me ^^
17:17 < o_be_one> btw he is just angy to be hated, and doesnt understand why ...
17:33 <@EastByte> I couldn't write so much text in my lifetime
17:34 <@EastByte> https://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/game/ did they change the design?
17:44 < Chairn> using 32 bits version of ddnet sdl2 on windows crash
17:44 <@deen> Chairn: when doing what?
17:44 < Chairn> just starting it
17:45 < Chairn> im downloading code and comp√Æling ind ebug to see where
17:45 < Chairn> it crashes after loading servers
17:45 <@deen> thanks
17:45 < Chairn> its branch sdl-try3?
17:46 <@deen> sdl2-try3
17:48 < Chairn> ... it doesnt crash on debug mode
17:48 < Chairn> but this mousesens change is really weird :D
17:49 < Chairn> neither in release, seems like your download is corrupted
17:49 <@deen> or my build system does sth wrong
17:50 <@deen> let me rebuild
17:50 < Chairn> oh wait
17:50 < Chairn> i think i know why
17:50 < Chairn> it crashed
17:50 < Chairn> when i pressed a key
17:51 < Chairn> okay, it crash whenever i touch keyboard
17:51 <@deen> same on 64bit?
17:51 < Chairn> crash in input.cpp segfault
17:51 < Chairn> i try 64 okay
17:52 <@deen> input.cpp ,line?
17:52 < Chairn> 237
17:53 < Chairn> update function
17:53 <@deen> oh, hi bye bumbumeq
17:53 < Chairn> key int is above 1 billion
17:53 < Chairn> thtat's why
17:54 < Chairn> m_aInputCount[m_InputCurrent][Key].m_Presses++;
17:54 < Chairn> here key = 1964787427
17:54 <@deen> that's not line 237 for me
17:54 <@deen> line 239, right?
17:54 < Chairn> 237 for me :o
17:55 <@deen> and in 64bit version it works?!
17:55 < Chairn> On branch sdl2 Your branch is up-to-date with 'upstream/sdl2-try3'.
17:55 <@deen> well, you could "git fetch upstream" and "git merge upstream/sdl2-try3"
17:56 < Chairn> doesnt crash on 64
17:56 < Chairn> great, now my git is crashing as well...
17:56 <@deen> haha
17:56 <@deen> so your system is just broken :P
17:57 < o_be_one> EastByte: i think yes
17:57 < Chairn> cant find entry point proecdure in dyn lib libeay32.dll
17:57 < o_be_one> you can see the old design here : http://ovh.com/ca EastByte 
17:58 <@deen> Chairn: hah, crashes for me on linux 32bit too!
18:01 < Chairn> Key = Event.key.keysym.scancode; set key to this value of 2 billion
18:01 < Chairn> when i press 'a'
18:01 <@deen> yeah, which is weird, because the scancodes should look like this: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDLScancodeLookup
18:02 < o_be_one> oh the old page was updated on ca too ^^
18:02 < Chairn> maybe wrong include or a wrrong define?
18:08 < Chairn> merged, now its line 242
18:11 <@deen> then your code is not the same as mine
18:12 <@deen> :P
18:12 < Chairn> fetched and merged : up to date
18:13 < Chairn> now 239 indeed
18:13 <@deen> eh
18:14 <@deen> i think i know why
18:16 <@deen> there you go, fixed
18:16 <@deen> just a break missing...
18:16 <@deen> can you set a spanish keyboard and test √©√® etc
18:19 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?p=23042#p23042
18:20 < Chairn> hum, cant do ^¬®~on a letter
18:20 < Chairn> it writes it directly
18:20 < Chairn> normally it waits for next key
18:20 < Chairn> so, cant √™√Æ√ª√¥√¢, √§√´√Ø etc... √£√± etc..
18:21 <@deen> yeah, we have to add SDL_StartTextInput()
18:21 <@deen> when a textinput is expected
18:21 <@deen> and SDL_StopTextInput() afterwards
18:21 <@deen> so chat, console, text fields
18:21 <@deen> you could try settings SDL_StartTextInput() at the start, maaaybe it always works
18:21 <@deen> (on linux it does)
18:26 < Chairn> at start? i tried in init function of input, but didnt work
18:28 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: ive followed you, just ordered 1 MC32 ahah
18:28 < o_be_one> next week i'll start my DDoS training 8-)
18:29 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: :)
19:10 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: what location did you choose?
19:28 < Nimda> Verification 3.3 by Silex just released on Solo at 2015-08-28 19:26
19:33 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: Strasbourg
19:39 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: ha!
19:40 <@EastByte> sbg best location ever
19:40 < WolfAlex> EastByte: no! gra!
20:20 <@deen> Yes, Strasbourg is right next to me, best location :P

20:52 < o_be_one> ahah maybe i'll host a GER DDNet part in this server :p
21:02 < o_be_one> im lookin ddnet staff webpage
21:02 < o_be_one> and i'm thinking about seeing east as maintener with you deen ::D
21:10 <@deen> o_be_one: maybe "maintainer" is the wrong word
21:10 <@deen> i just want some overseeing role, so i can overwrite bad decisions :P
21:12 < o_be_one> Project Manager ?
21:13 <@deen> dunno, just someone who oversees the admins
21:13 <@deen> but i don't want to make so many decisions myself
21:13 <@deen> at least that's the direction we're going into
21:13 <@deen> right now I do have some time, so it's no problem to do some stuff myself
21:14 < o_be_one> you seems to share more decisions with East
21:14 < o_be_one> thats why ive said that you can maybe add East with you in top
21:14 <@deen> i also share more decisions with the other admins
21:14 <@deen> they were just added, all of them
21:14 <@deen> but east is the only programmer
21:19 < o_be_one> oh ok
21:22 <@EastByte> yea, I'm the nasty programmer
21:23 < o_be_one> without programmers we are nothing :o
21:23 < o_be_one> maybe it will happen a time when i'll ask if i can be officialy admin of DDNet :p. Sometime i'm thinking about it
21:28 <@EastByte> o_be_one: I'm still working on my tw filter rules, today I tested them on the ifcity servers and only a bunch of people got timeouted :p
21:30 < o_be_one> oh ? awesome :o
21:30 < o_be_one> iptables EastByte ?
21:30 <@EastByte> no that's not awesome xd, actually all tw packets should go through
21:30 <@EastByte> yes, I'm using bpf via bytecode parameter in iptables
21:31 <@deen> o_be_one: you can talk to and advise the current admins, no need for an official position for that
21:31 < o_be_one> you think they'll have no problem with that ?
21:32 < o_be_one> EastByte: good to know :), i'll let you know if i'm able to do awesome things with tilera/arbor etc
21:32 <@EastByte> okay :)
21:33 <@EastByte> unforunatly the tw protocol is hard to characterise
21:33 <@EastByte> everything is so damn packed
21:33 <@EastByte> matricks didn't waste one single bit
21:35 < o_be_one> oh :(
21:36 < o_be_one> are we able to get more information about this with matricks, EastByte ?
21:36 <@deen> that's good, some of us have to pay for those bits :P
21:36 <@EastByte> no need for asking matricks I think, the protocol still is pretty simple
21:37 < o_be_one> ok but simple and hard at the same time ?
21:38 <@EastByte> only hard to characterise
21:38 <@EastByte> I mean to distinguish from other traffic
21:38 < o_be_one> oh ok
21:38 < o_be_one> but isnt like all udp packets ?
21:38 <@EastByte> hm?
21:38 < o_be_one> i mean ... hard to distinguish from other traffic ?
21:38 < o_be_one> i'm mostly noob with network :/
21:39 <@EastByte> e.g. to distinguish from malicious traffic
21:40 <@EastByte> well, I hope you'll learn a lot at the ddos training? :p

21:51 <@EastByte> I want this
22:03 < o_be_one> OVH has tilera but can handle mutch more :p
22:11 < o_be_one> Tilera 46 to 64 cores
22:12 < o_be_one> just found information, at ovh
22:12 < o_be_one> well and they actually can handle 460gbps of ddos
22:22 <@EastByte> must be fun to work with such machines (on a 1tb internet link)
22:36 < o_be_one> ahah sure
22:36 < o_be_one> btw ive just read that OVH was thinking for a 5tbps network for 2014
22:37 < o_be_one> i dont remember how much today they have
