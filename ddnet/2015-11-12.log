00:57 <@deen> any new ddnet client+server releases planned?
00:57 <@deen> because I guess I'm the only one with the build infrastructure for that right now
00:58 <@deen> but it's pretty simple and takes just a few minutes now because it's all automated
00:59 <@heinrich5991> I think there was a release planned
00:59 <@heinrich5991> but I'm not sure what blocked it
00:59 <@heinrich5991> either the mac build or some outstanding PR that should still get in
00:59 <@heinrich5991> don't remember
01:16 <@deen> well, would be nice to have a release
01:16 <@deen> especially with the sdl2 stuff at some point, because that seemed to work better for most people
01:20 <@heinrich5991> the comments in the pull request indicate that it's not complete enough to get merged (?)
02:12 <@heinrich5991> fstd: do you know about best practices wrt following the xdg specification on *bsd or not?
02:18 < fstd> no idea, sorry
02:19 < fstd> but coincidentally i had to trouble myself with xdg today on lunix, at work
02:19 < fstd> so my current stance on it is 'kill w/ fire' :)
02:20 < fstd> "A full installation requires at least 31 Megabytes without X and at least 81 Megabytes if the X sets are included."
02:20 < fstd> w/c
02:20 <@heinrich5991> fstd: dunno, I like that all the configs go into ~/.config instead of cluttering the home directory directly
02:20 <@heinrich5991> and similarly, that you can safely delete an application's ~/.cache
02:21 <@heinrich5991> oh I'm also w/c'ing :D
