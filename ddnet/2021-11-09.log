03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i hate it that my vpn changes something in my network/firewall settings and everytime i want to play on ddnet servers i have to restart pc
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: ouch the sql decline is a bummer. I thought it was a neat if not my best pr. Can't you just merge it in without using it in ddnet same as GetInt64? .\_.
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or at least a public getter for m\_pStmt so one can self craft it without conflicting with ddnet code
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: so you want the allow zoom flag in two places? In the capabilities and in the gameinfoex2 flags?
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i feel like allowing dummy or not does not really sound like a server capabilitiy
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good ol 2006 remix
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why use a vpn at all? Seems really dangerous to give some shady company access to all your internet data
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I find my isp and my government more shady than a well known and trusted vpn provider
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we don't use it, we shouldn't maintain it
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which vpn provider btw?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then just use https? nowadays nearly everything will be through tls
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Surfshark
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > well known and trusted vpn provider
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :admiralGOTTEM:
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I don’t like showing my ip to everyone
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Little is known about the company that owns Surfshark. Their contact information is vague and their phone numbers aren't listed.
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://woofresh.com/surfshark-vpn-review/
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, no thanks 😄
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyway, find out what their software changes in your network settings and ask them to fix it?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> why pay a service when you can do your own vpn
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if hiding your IP is the only thing, it's easy af
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Because i have money but don’t habe the time, easy as that
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You get money for a reason
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it takes 2min
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> to setup
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> So you can pay people that know what you dont know
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> A vpn brings several features tho
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you are concerned about "security" and "private info" thus paying others to manage it will never be enough
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> The main feature for me to unblock region locked stuff
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless u do it urself imho its not worth
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> quick google https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Never heard any complaints about a vpn not being secure
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hahaha
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @joji well just even nordvpn is an example
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Thats why i dont have nordvpn
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> doesn't mean it can't happen to others
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I never heard anything bad about my vpn provider
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + you don't know what they do with your own data
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> They say they don’t log it
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah, now ask them some proofs
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats so naive
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> because "saying" is nothing, it doesn't proof anything
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Like i said, i find my isp and government more shady than a vpn provider
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then do your own vpn, that's all, easy to setup, there's available scripts to do it, or even wireguard it takes 2min to easily set it up
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sayin' that you don't have time isn't a good reason x), everyone has 5min at least to do something else
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> :yes:
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You don’t get the flexibility of having multiple servers across the world with one own server
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if you're here to google, play tw, watch videos
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's useless
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I’m here to avade taxes
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @ReiTW I'm not quite sure what you mean, wouldn't you need to rent a server somewhere first to 'create' your own vpn?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I agree that for privacy a vpn doesn't help significantly
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well if he wants to join vali's server for example without getting ddosed by him, a simple vpn is enough, at least vali doesn't have his IP
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And yeah I meant that
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> A vpn does help significantly
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's why I said, why pay a vpn service if you can just pay a server & do it yourself
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> For?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> And what about the server hosts???
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You don’t know how private that is
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Your vm you manage it
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Literally hiding your ip, that’s one huge privacy part
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and you think you can't do that with your own vpn? xD that's the same
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> That’s not what i was saying
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fair hiding your ip is something
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @ReiTW renting a server will take more than 5 mins I think ^^
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well renting it maybe, but setting up the vpn doesn't take long
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you ensure u dont log stuff
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Listen i don’t do illegal stuff, i just don’t want people and companies directly profiling me online
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> If you do illegal stuff then sure you want as much privacy as possible with own servers erc
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well just having a google, fb, microsoft, instagram, etc.. account, a vpn won't save you from that
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You can minimize it tho
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you use a different browser for each account?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or contained containers?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know uare fingerprint is what they use
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You’re saying just because you can get tracked online, it’s not worth taking it to a minimum?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they can match you
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whether u use vpn or not

11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😂
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can be sure facebook google etc use this
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Bro im not a famous person that need to be private at all cost, a vpn is more like a multi tool for me
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no im just saying that u think u are doing something but not at all
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially for the big corps like google
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You can’t avoid everything without a cost of something
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/907579462722392074/unknown.png
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the last line is the only reason to do it yeah, and avoid some skids also
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i only use vpn to connect to bombay
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so they cant ddos me
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :ReiTroll:
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well don't do that since a long time, now focused to protecc against those noobs who keeps attacking

12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> @Learath2 https://github.com/kurosio/Teeworlds-Mmotee-Old
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> that client has clicking sfx built in
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Clicking sfx?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As in clicking makes a sound?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> and when you hover to all intectactive bubbles
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> and when you hover to all interactive bubbles
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> <a:whooo:631548554267328514>
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> asmr client '-'
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need a sound designer
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know a guy
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :pepedead: 📣
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> action
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> finally I can make my custom main menu
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we need that button click sound that makes u want to click things
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some games have this
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, should we get a new menu music I wonder
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that must live on forever
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGNiOJ3i5AE
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im fine if we use this
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a banger honestly
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> soldat soundtracks are banger
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> our soundtracks are just sad
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Borderlands 3 sanctuary |||
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :monkaT: something similar to that
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/907593618695553054/20211109_123235.jpg
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A book to ur liking @Learath2
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heretics! HolyC is God's programming language
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the teeworlds menu theme has too much nostalgia to it
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> needs to at least be an option even if new menu music gets introduced
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Also that camera function is a bit... not customizable.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> like where the camera should go after clicking on the browser for example
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> replace music_menu.wv in ddnet/data/audio :greenthing:
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> yup 👍
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> (remember to use WAV to WV export)
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :pepedead:
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know a guy doing music for games, I can ask him to remix the old music, see what we get :P
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can set the locations in the map
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with checkpoints i think?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> does the camera's movement being affected by para values?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> checkpoints???
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you don't need to use the default locations, those are just fallbacks
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> ya need to use entities to set camera position?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you make a menu background map, you can set checkpoints for the locations
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :monkaS: haven't thought about that
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, we might have forgotten to document it
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menu_background.cpp#L283-L287
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the teeworlds menu theme has too much nostalgia to it
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> original needs to at least be an option even if new menu music gets introduced
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> holy shit
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> the cia glow in the dark
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And the positions are https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menu_background.h#L34-L59
