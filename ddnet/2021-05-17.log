00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar âœª about the tee drawing thing: the values 0.125 and 0.1 seem to be the values which define the circle around which the eyes rotate. But I'm not able to figure out the position around which the circle is going (0.125 looks okayish, is guessed tho). The other thing I can't figure out right now is how the feet move. (do they move in a circle?, how do they rotate?, etc.) They seem to be somehow stored in `m_aAnimations`, though I'm not

07:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Patiga BodyPos is where the eyes rotate around

12:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea i wans't able to figure out what `BodyPos` is assigned to, it also seems to end at `m_aAnimations`, just like with the feet
13:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you mean?
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I want to find the value that BodyPos is assigned to, however I struggle to find exactly that
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, i suppose i could print it and see if i can make sense of that

14:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :SeemsGood:
14:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you need a ===
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> == in php is for people who reeaaaaallly know what they are asking for :P
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Stumbled across this and was very confused, but this is fixed in php 8 luckily
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah sure, but its still wrong
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it is completely according to spec actually
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Works as implemented
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Php8 just changed the spec so it's what more people expect
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The php8 one also suffers from something I despise about newer languages. Contextful operators
14:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The new == will depending on the contents of the string behave differently
14:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hm okay thats weird, but I'll stick to triple comparision anyway
14:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I like some of the new features
14:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/843828794230046730/unknown.png
14:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> e.g
14:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah that's the safe bet. But the new == atleast works closer to how humans expect it to work so there will be less bugs
14:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> And we almost have full type declaration support! :kek:
14:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbf php8 is bringing a lot of great changes and I love most too
14:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> JIT is probably the one thing I really am looking forward to
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And maybe the nullsafe operator
14:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I am currently rewriting a little project of mine from php 7.4 to 8 and it had already better performance it feels like
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I am currently rewriting a little project of mine from php 7.4 to 8 and it has already better performance it feels like
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Code just looks so much cleaner
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> There are doc updates aswell
14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh they also took rusts match stmt, pretty nice to have guarantees about handling all possible options
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I wonder if they took rusts match semantics or just the keyword :P
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently just the keyword. So it's just switch with strict comparison
17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What does == on php 7? By ref? I do t think how the example u sent makes sense
17:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe php 8 is good enough to try to learn it really, when i started i got rly off by the random nomenclature they use on standsrd functions, they arent predictable, it feels like a language carrying the awful of past times, imagine having to write $ for vars, 2 key presses wasted everytime
17:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Enough rant :greenthing: :pepeH:
17:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> == in php7 does type conversion based on some rule table that I dont have memorized
17:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Numeric is higher than string, so the string is converted to a number. It contains no leading digits so it's a 0. After type conversion a strict comparison is done 0 === 0 which is true
17:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 does the client use an old serverlist after opening? the usa person said, that the server list was the one from 2h ago, when the client was last closed
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, likely a problem from my side
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm @Jupstar âœª list looks up to date
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what might cause this effect
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the person said it happened a few times, not always
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can also just say what that person tells me, so dunno ðŸ˜„
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it might be some cloudflare caching inconsistency
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª can they enable `dbg_curl 1` and send back the log once it happens?
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i guess dbg_curl has to be enabled every time the client is started?
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also is the log inside the logfile then, or f1 or smth? ðŸ˜„
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yes, it has to be enabled every time or in the autoexec.cfg
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it need a "real" logfile?
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's in the console or in the log file
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not in f1
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah no, only in the console :<
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like this:
