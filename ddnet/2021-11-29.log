00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> i think itd be best to have option to choose either color or symbol signal for strong/weak
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> cause i'm not sure that red/green as only indication is great for accessibility, and also some people may just prefer the symbols
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> i admit i say this as someone on an old version so maybe thats already the case
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> I do agree red should be those u have weak on and green should be those u have strong on
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> hmm, also, take my first "or" inclusive or, not exclusive or lol
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> symbol doesn't help since you want to know for all combinations of players who has strong on whom
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> well how does that work with the colors then
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> I agree thats useful info but i feel the best way to convey that kind of ordering will always just be a number
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it doesn't work with colors
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> numbers are fine, easy to tell apart
