08:51 <+ACTom> hello~
08:54 <+ACTom> I found when change to dummy mode in CHN server, server's name has no changed, how to fix it?
08:55 <@deen> ACTom: hi, let me look into it
08:56 <@deen> someone forgot to set the name on CHN :)
08:56 <+ACTom> deen: thanks, and could you upgrade DDNet zCatch mode in CHN server?
08:57 <@deen> Should be fixed now
08:57 <@deen> we don't run zcatch in CHN, do we?
08:57 <@deen> you mean you want me to start it?
09:01 <+ACTom> I remember we have a DDNet zCatch server in CHN, but now I can't find it.
09:01 <@deen> well, then someone else ran that, not me
09:02 <+ACTom> ok, I saw "DDNet zCatch", so I feel that you do it ,sorry.
11:49 <@deen> ACTom: so, you want an official DDNet CHN zCatch server or not?
12:07 <+ACTom> deen: yeah, I'd like a official DDNet CHN zCatch server
12:41 <@deen> ACTom: I can't test, but it should be running
12:43 <@deen> I'll assume that means the zCatch server crashed his computer
