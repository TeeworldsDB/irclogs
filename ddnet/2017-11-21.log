00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have to say, that firefox looks great
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I will test it
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but first look, make me feel good
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Firefox has different engine chrome yea? it's not chromium xD?
00:06 <+nemo2> firefox forever!
00:06  * nemo2 has been a mozilla fanboy since mozilla was a thing
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Great, now i have to install firefox on android
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and all will be great
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I love Sync thing
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's why i used google
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> chrome
00:26 <+nemo2> eh. firefox sync has been around a looooong time
00:26 <+nemo2> firefox worked awesomely on my ancient android 4 phone
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okok, fanboy
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
00:26 <+nemo2> was the only browser that did GPU acceleration so scrolling worked ok. was funny to see people freaking out over smooth scrolling when chrome finally added it üòù
00:26 <+nemo2> I was like. eh. have had this for years on my PoS phone
00:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> chrome since 41 could do it too
00:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but.. you had to enable it
00:28 <+nemo2> but... yeah, I was doing firefox sync against android like... 5 years ago.
00:28 <+nemo2> and. had local encryption back then
00:28 <+nemo2> Google only added it recently due to pressure and still isn't default
00:28 <+nemo2> so everyone was happily uploading their wifi passwords to NSA
00:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like, it does matter in this times
00:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We can't do much about this üòõ
00:29 <+nemo2> eh. make 'em work for it at least ‚ò∫
00:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Btw. i used firefox, but then firefox worked like a dinosaur
00:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> were very slow
00:29  * nemo2 shrugs
00:30 <+nemo2> no browsers were great back then. not even chrome
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so i switched to chrome, which were fast then
00:30 <+nemo2> and... depends on what you used it on
00:30 <+nemo2> Chrome was fast on google properties, no shock
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but now I started lookin for new
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> browser
00:30 <+nemo2> but... consider nacl.  google was pushing nacl due to limitations of their own JS engine
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and you told me that firefox were rewritten
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and tbh, it works like a boss
00:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Can i somehow, limit Ram usage of firefox?
00:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/JIZUOgT2103244
00:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or it's standard? :D!
00:32 <+nemo2> there are ram settings sure
00:32 <+nemo2> for one thing, latest firefox is now using content processes, like chrome did before it
00:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like wherE? Can't find
00:32 <+nemo2> you can reduce # of content processes
00:32 <+nemo2> the fewer you use, the less ram
00:33 <+nemo2> one interesting thing in nightly BTW is hovering over a tab shows process ID
00:33 <+nemo2> so you can see when tabs are unloaded too
00:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Im not really familiar how browsers works
00:33 <+dezzer> wood pcs
00:33 <+dezzer> confirmed
00:33 <+nemo2> about:config 
00:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, inside
00:34 <+nemo2> I wouldn't recommend screwing w/ 'em too much
00:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i like to know how CSS is rendered and structure
00:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thats all üòÑ
00:34 <+nemo2> is intended to be dynamic based on system capacity
00:34 <+nemo2> dom.ipc.processCount;4 ‚Üê  default number of content processes. cranking it down to 1 or 2 will save ram 
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It will make browser less effective?
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I bet yes?
00:35 <+nemo2> eh
00:35 <+nemo2> not thaaat much
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> don't screw around in `about:config`:D
00:35 <+nemo2> stuff gets unloaded pretty aggressively anyway
00:35 <+nemo2> and you'll still have content process so rest of browser should be responsive
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> at least if you want to blame the browser later
00:35 <+nemo2> but up to you
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, it's more like for testing purposes
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i have enough ram
00:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Xd
00:35 <+nemo2> you can always try it in a test profile
00:35 <+nemo2> firefox -no-remote -P test
00:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay i understand now, it create 7 process by defaul
00:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay i understand now, it create 7 process by default
00:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for web, extensions, files and... one for general i guess
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I will try with 3, I don't run much tabs at once
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> a lot*
00:37 <+nemo2> there's a bunch of things that make processes. browser interface, rendering process, web workers, content processes...
00:37 <+nemo2> that config entry is for the content processes tho
00:38 <+nemo2> btw, about:memory  if you're curious what sites are being greedy
00:38 <+nemo2> about:about for all about pages
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh shit
00:38 <+nemo2> oh. also. did you ddnet guys notice we did a hedgewars release?
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> are you from hedgewars devs?
00:39 <+nemo2> yesssss
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I tested that game, while using OBS haha
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> beceause we had a problem with Radeon carts
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, more like we thought it was problem with game
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, then we figure out, that OBS has troubles with SDL hooks
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and crashes
00:40 <+nemo2> what is OBS?
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Software for streaming video
00:40 <+nemo2> ah
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Free and open sourcce
00:40 <+nemo2> interesting
00:40 <+nemo2> we finally fixed our video encoding this release BTW
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://obsproject.com/
00:40 <+nemo2> only thing I've ever used is gtk-recordmydesktop
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its like, best free option.
00:41 <+nemo2> and have never tried streaming
00:41 <+nemo2> but good to know
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know any good alternatives
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> only paid one
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, that almost every twitch/youtube streamer
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> use OBS
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because of plugins and easy configuration
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> also good performance
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway.. üòÑ
00:43 <+nemo2> why would streaming software need SDL hooks/
00:43 <+nemo2> ?
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No idea, maybe to catch somehow scene
00:44 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: no, didn't see you did a release
00:44 <@heinrich5991> link? :)
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm just user, but saw crash log
00:44 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: https://hedgewars.org ? ‚ò∫
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was crashing on sdl hook
00:45 <@heinrich5991> Savander: if you want to be able to complain about the browser, don't change stuff you don't exactly know in `about:config`
00:45 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: well. doing it in a test profile should be fairly harmless ‚ò∫
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> heinrich, i revert changes
00:45 <@heinrich5991> good :)
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't worry, I was just curious üòÑ
00:45 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: "There's no Mac OS version this time, but we hope to release one soon."
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you know, children's curiosity
00:45 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: can't find anyone to do the build ‚òπ
00:45 <@heinrich5991> I suppose that's due to no macos machines being available?
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> does hedgewars is opensource?
00:46 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: well. unc0rr's coworker has one. and was trying to do build. but ran into some SDL lib loading error
00:46 <@heinrich5991> have you thought about cross-compilation? I recently made it possible to cross-compile ddnet to macos
00:46 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: heh. even more work that
00:46 <@heinrich5991> not in the long run :)
00:46 <+nemo2> hum. p'raps
00:46 <@heinrich5991> or you could build on CI and use that artifact, that's a good idea anyway
00:46 <@heinrich5991> (CI, I mean)
00:46 <+nemo2> I remember setting up iOS toolchain under linux and that was super painful
00:47 <+nemo2> and, Savander, yes, of course it is
00:47 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: you need to change where the executable looks for its libraries
00:48 <+nemo2> Savander: https://hg.hedgewars.org  or use our download page for the release tarball
00:48 <+nemo2> Savander: there's also https://hedgewars.org/kb/BuildingHedgewars  but most of the non-linux build instructions are pretty sucky right now
00:48 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: if you want to help... would be appreciated
00:48 <+nemo2> esp by the OSX users ‚ò∫
00:51 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: hedgewars uses hg? I wasn't able to wrap my head around that one :(
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Qt isn't paid library?
00:51 <@heinrich5991> no, it has an LGPL license IIRC
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> On their website, i see big button
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Buy QT
00:51 <+nemo2> on what website?
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> qt.io
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www1.qt.io/buy-product/
00:52 <+nemo2> Savander: BTW, if you're into privacy and maybe speed and don't mind totally ignoring heinrich5991's warning, I have some about:config settings I like to turn on - some are visible in Prefs too sooo
00:52 <@heinrich5991> the URL sounds fishy :o
00:52 <@heinrich5991> although it probably isn't
00:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, i found it in google
00:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> first link
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Qt | Cross-platform software development for embedded & desktop
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And obviously, i can start Free trial (yea)
00:53 <+nemo2> Savander: privacy.trackingprotection.enabled;true  turns on tracking protection always, not just in private browsing - may possibly break sites although I've never encoutnered this.  You get a warning in URL if it is blocking things
00:53 <+nemo2> Savander: speeds things up too obv
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, i saw that options
00:53 <@heinrich5991> just install ublock instead
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i enabled it ! üòÑ
00:53 <@heinrich5991> or access the option via the actual options, not about:config
00:54 <@heinrich5991> "ublock origin", that is
00:54 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: it used to not be exposed in settings so I have no idea where to find it there
00:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> now there is privacy and security
00:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tab in settings
00:54 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: btw, ublock/umatrix have a super annoying bug that's been driving me bonkers while I wait for the noscript port to be completed
00:54 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: <noscript> tags are not flagged to be parsed, by them.  bz seems to feel this is fail on their part
00:54 <+nemo2> breaks a ton of sites
00:55 <+nemo2> (breaks their fallbacks I mean)
00:55 <@heinrich5991> ublock isn't about blockign JS
00:55 <+nemo2> NoScript thankfully still works, in legacy mode.  I'm following the bug on the full port.  He made a webscript version too, no idea if it is more sensibly setup
00:55 <@heinrich5991> it's more about blocking trackers etc.
00:56 <@heinrich5991> you can use it in the script-blocking mode as well
00:56 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: eh. toma-toe tomahto
00:56 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I was more interested in script thing. ‚ò∫
00:56 <@heinrich5991> but since that's not their main business, there are bugs, apparently
00:56 <+nemo2> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1214733  the noscript bug I'm avidly following
00:56 <@heinrich5991> I currently don't like having to unbreak every website I'm visiting
00:56 <@heinrich5991> ublock doesn't break the websites ^^
00:57 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: vast majority of sites I use work well enough w/ script blocking
00:57 <@heinrich5991> well, not for me
00:57 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: in fact on mobile I leave Js off most of time
00:57 <+nemo2> good for security, privacy, bandwidth and battery
00:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Firefox has cool feature, a CLI
00:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> pref set privacy.trackingprotection.enabled true
00:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cool command
00:57 <@heinrich5991> I usually browse a lot of different sites
00:57 <+nemo2> eh. me too
00:57 <@heinrich5991> security meh
00:57 <@heinrich5991> since you're gonna enable it anyway if something breaks
00:57 <+nemo2> surprising how many of them have usable fallbacks
00:57 <@heinrich5991> privacy okayish
00:58 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: well... sometimes I just fix their stupidity in stylish
00:58 <@heinrich5991> bandwidth and battery ok
00:58 <+nemo2> for example SMBC comics after-comic is JS toggled, so I made a stylish rule to always show it
00:58 <+nemo2> minor things like that
00:58 <+nemo2> I'd say I pretty much never toggle it on
00:59 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: security.mixed_content.block_display_content;true  blocks more sites for me actually
00:59 <+nemo2> aforementioned SMBC for example ‚òπ
00:59 <+nemo2> if you use https everywhere they forcibly serve the comic as hardcoded http
01:00 <@heinrich5991> \o/
01:00 <+nemo2> hm. interesting. pipelining was removed. "not useful to maintain" boo - still lots of non http/2 sites out there
01:01 <+nemo2> but was funny to me how those "http2 speed test demos" rendered exactly as fast, or even faster in http 1.1 with pipelining enabled
01:01 <+nemo2> ah well
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> firefox uses GPU by default?
01:02 <+nemo2> depends
01:02 <+nemo2> windows, linux or OSX?
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> windows
01:02 <+nemo2> also about:support should tell you
01:02 <+nemo2> in that case probably GPU use
01:03 <@heinrich5991> I thought it uses the GPU by default everywhere
01:03 <+nemo2> it should
01:03 <+nemo2> but...
01:03 <+nemo2> actually these days coverage is darn good
01:03 <+nemo2> also. GPU everywhere doesn't always mean same efficiency in acceleration
01:03 <+nemo2> there's different levels
01:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Cool: WebGL 1    Google Inc. -- ANGLE (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0)
01:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Google is like everywhere
01:04 <+nemo2> https://m8y.org/tmp/testcase429.xhtml  ‚Üê  years ago I made this page to replace this awful awful effect someone was doing in JS updating CSS gradients 30 times a second
01:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even in WebGL renderer driver
01:04 <+nemo2> and...
01:04 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: do you have the mac builds by your coworker?
01:04 <+nemo2> it ran with 0% CPU usage in Safari.  200% CPU usage in Chrome on OSX, 150% CPU usage in Firefox on OSX.  0% CPU usage in Firefox on Windows
01:04 <+nemo2> 0% CPU usage in IE on Windows
01:04 <+nemo2> 200% CPU usage in Chrome on windows
01:05 <+nemo2> depending on what you're doing you can get wildly different results
01:05 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: by unc0rr's coworker? yes
01:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I tested it on chrome now, its like 0%CPU usage
01:05 <+nemo2> Savander: also there's the new quantum work being rolled out in windows first. I can dig you up a link on it
01:05 <+nemo2> yeah. this was years ago
01:05 <@heinrich5991> do you know the error message?
01:05 <+nemo2> it also rendered with ugly banding at the time
01:05 <+nemo2> both of those were eventually fixed in skia
01:06 <+nemo2> but at the time it was frustrating due to chrome market share
01:06 <+nemo2> was hoping for an easy win on the effect
01:06 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: sure. hang on.  you could also drop by our chat if you're feeling helpful
01:06 <@heinrich5991> where is it?

01:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÉ Goodnight!
01:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> night
06:51 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> ddnet doesnt work at all on mac osx 10.6.8
06:52 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> the newest version says it "cannot be opened due to a problem"
06:52 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> and the older versions crash quickly after joining a server
06:52 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> pls fix
15:33 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: you awake?
16:28 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: yup
16:29 <+nemo2> had a question for you on other channel ‚ò∫
18:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> have you tried Visual Studio Code?
18:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm looking for replacement for PHPStorm
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> If only we had some developer with a mac
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> HMH ?
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and noby is dev too he should fix himself lelel
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh?
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> no u
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> if i didnt have a newer computer and had to fix this myself i would just try to port ddnet antiping to vanilla client cuz its the only part i use anyway
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no hoook coll?
19:11 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> no point, it gives away ur position to the enemy
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's usefull in ddrace
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, if you want only antiping üòõ
19:14 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> yeah but i was replying to the sugestion of me fixing the problem and im not a ddrace player :p
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> is there an xxlddrace linux version?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> get source and compile it by yourself
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Take source and compile it by yourself
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/AdVetter/XXLDDRace
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think it's that
22:09 <+nemo2> antiping?
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's feature in DDNet Client, that gives you ability to predict grenades, shots, movement
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> based on your ping
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <ezy> when ur server gets ddosed ._.
