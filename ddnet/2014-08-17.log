08:24 < EastBite> good morning deen 
08:46 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen: my client last night get crash :) http://uppit.com/msfmhyh2mgiv/Capture.JPG
08:46 < GoJEGrEEN> i was in server then chat get hiding idk why but after i dissconnect from server client give crash :/
10:30 < EastBite> deen: can't connect to :8308 :/
12:05 <@deen> EastBite: good morning
12:05 <@deen> EastBite: 8308 is one of those that didn't restart yet because it never emptied
12:06 <@deen> so the fixes from yesterday aren't in yet
12:06 < EastBite> that's good I gues
12:07 <@deen> well, I hoped the servers would go empty at some time...
12:07 <@deen> Some servers don't go empty for days
12:07 < EastBite> :D
12:09 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/pppro2.webm
12:09 < EastBite> I'm soo done with this map
12:09 <@deen> ^^
12:09 <@deen> hahaha
12:09 <@deen> that is a typical mapping fail
12:10 <@deen> we have a warning about this in our testers tutorial^^
12:10 < EastBite> the mappers seem not to care ^^
12:10 < EastBite> but it's an old map
12:11 <@deen> It's a really old map with a weird history
12:11 < EastBite> ddmax iirc
12:11 <@deen> wellllllll
12:11 <@deen> Moses made the map
12:11 <@deen> some other guy made graphics for the map and put it on ddmax forum
12:12 <@deen> then that other guy didn't respond anymore and Anqel from ddmax remade the design again and released the map under her own name^^
12:12 < EastBite> wut
12:12 <@deen> So now it says "by Anqel, thx to Meow" on the map
12:12 <@deen> but Meow did the design that was removed
12:12 <@deen> and Moses did the actual map^^
12:13 < EastBite> ah
12:13 <@deen> and Moses is pissed at everyone because he never got credits
12:13 <@deen> it's the most popular map on ddmax by far
12:13 < EastBite> sure
12:16 < EastBite> the is in ddnet not that long right?
12:17 < EastBite> the map*
12:17 < EastBite> did Moses/Anqel/Meow not accept this map to be added to ddnet?
12:19 <@deen> not that long
12:19 <@deen> it was often requested, so i finally asked Anqel
12:20 <@deen> couldn't find the other 2 guys, but they can come and complain if they want
12:20 < EastBite> ah
12:28 <@deen> EastBite: ddmax has trouble with ddos attack
12:28 <@deen> if they get one the next time they have to change servers
12:29 < EastBite> poor Tsin
12:30 < EastBite> does noother still want to host ddmax?
12:31 < EastBite> iirc he is experienced in hosting
12:33 <@deen> I think noother hosts ddmax on a company server
12:33 < EastBite> eww
12:33 <@deen> i don't know who would have to buy another server 
13:15 <@deen> EastBite: I see you in another channel
13:16 < EastBite> nimrod?
13:17 <@deen> yes
13:17 < EastBite> 20:58:59        EastByte_ | hi def-
13:17 < EastBite> I already found you :P
13:17 <@deen> oh, irssi doesn't like me
13:17 <@deen> sometimes my name doesn't get highlighted
13:18 < EastBite> :)
13:18 <@deen> or wait, that was a few days ago
13:18 < EastBite> one day
13:18 <@deen> ok
13:18 <@deen> How's it going with Nimrod?
13:19 < EastBite> the first thing I do when I learn a new language
13:19 < EastBite> code something teeworlds related :D
13:19 < EastBite> I like do recode some of the network stuff so I can learn more about the teeworlds protocol aswell
13:20 <@deen> I thought about translating all ddnet scripts to nimrod
13:20 <@deen> Ah, I did that in Haskell once =)
13:20 < EastBite> ddnet scripts?
13:20 <@deen> reimplementing teeworlds networking protocols
13:21 < EastBite> eww never did haskell before
13:21 < EastBite> I need to go to lunch
13:22 <@deen> alright
13:46 < EastBite> deen: and I finally found a good reason to use spaces for indentation^^
13:46 < EastBite> I just was too lazy to switch
13:52 <@deen> EastBite: haha

19:33 < Savander> Hi
19:33 < Savander> ;)
19:34 <@deen> hi Savander 
19:35 < Savander> let's make only HookFly map for pros
19:35 < Savander> yea, 
19:35 < Savander> i want it xD
19:35 < laxa> Savander: go on Just HookFly.
19:36 < Savander> I'm going to create my own xD
19:37 < laxa> deen: why you quitted skype oO ?
19:37 < Savander> recently behaves strange.. :X
19:43 <@deen> laxa: i'm busy and people always want something
19:54 < laxa> deen: have you changed the speeders in the last week ?
19:54 <@deen> laxa: i think i removed the prediction because it was buggy in some cases
19:55 <@deen> but the actual behaviour did not change
19:55 < laxa> lady saavik is saying to me that the part I was blocked can't be done like it's suppose to be done
19:55 < Savander> i have a question, how to disable only hammer hits? (And sometimes enable for a second)
19:55 < laxa> But, I don't even know what's the proper way...
19:56 <@deen> Savander: use hit off on switch layer
19:56 <@deen> Savander: and set as number or delay 1?
19:56 <@deen> i don't remember exactly
19:57 < Savander> but, look
19:57 < Savander> i can disable only one weapon?
20:05 < Savander> deen:  idkk why
20:05 < Savander> but when i frozen
20:06 < Savander> i don't see "stars"
20:06 < laxa> deen: [SI] DOMNICA is bugged, impossible to do one part.
20:12 <@deen> Savander: i think that sometimes happens, with every client
20:12 <@deen> Savander: yes, you can disable only one weapon
20:12 <@deen> laxa: really can't look into it now
20:13 < Savander> but how
20:13 < Savander> :x
20:15 <@deen> Savander: use hit off on switch layer
20:15 <@deen> Savander: and set as number or delay 1?
20:17 < Savander> so when i set number to eg. 1 i will disable only hammer?
20:19 <@deen> yes
20:21 < Savander> lol, okay, thanks
20:21 < Savander> :)
20:51 < Savander> don't work for me meh, maybe i do something wrong..
20:51 < Savander> i set delay on red hammer to 1, number to 1
20:51 < Savander> and nothing :P :D
20:51 < Savander> i try set to 2,3,4,5 .... 
20:51 < Savander> same 
20:53 <@deen> Savander: look at the end of Light Grey
20:53 <@deen> I used the tile there
20:54 <@deen> not exactly end, but from end you find it easier^^
20:54 < Savander> ok, its novice/moderator or brutal map?XD
20:54 < Savander> btw i have idea
20:54 < Savander> somethink like "search box" in vote 
20:54 < Savander> tab
20:54 < Savander> ;p
20:58 < Savander> ok now
20:58 < Savander> i know how
20:58 < Savander> ;D
20:58 < Savander> thanks deen  :)
21:05 <@deen> Savander: just write /map Light Grey
