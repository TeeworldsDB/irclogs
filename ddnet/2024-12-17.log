00:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato ddnet clients can join 0.6 and 0.7 i dont think there are still users running around with teeworlds 0.6 clients so all players from teeworlds.com can only join 0.7 servers
00:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so if you implement only 0.7 you should be able to receive connection from pretty much every player
03:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> changed my mind again 0.6.5 is trash
03:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unlike the name suggests it is not backwards compatible to 0.6.4 because of a bug in 0.6.4 also it is wasting 512 null bytes on every connection on reflection attack protection client side which is not even checked server side
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if using semver logic havinga 0 before all that means 6 is shifted to major and 4 is shifted to minor, which can have changes like that
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i think
03:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the way i understand semver 0.1 to 0.2 is version breaking but 1.1 to 1.2 is not
03:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and teeworlds seems to use it the same way 0.6 to 0.7 is version breaking because of the leading zero
03:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but 0.6.4 to 0.6.5 should not be breaking
03:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was also not  planned as breaking it just happend that 0.6.4 interprets a bit as part of the ack number which was thought to be unused and is now used for a 0.6.5 flag bit
03:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so that can then break the sequence number check and the server will drop the connection because of that
08:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
08:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> pretty much says any version change may break. I personally also try to increase the minor version when introducing breaking changes but that's up to every individual to decide.
08:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> also, often security fixes are considered as patch version updates which may still break existing code.
08:18 < bridge> <totar> Teeworlds uses ZeroVer
08:18 < bridge> <totar> https://nesbitt.io/2024/06/24/from-zerover-to-semver-a-comprehensive-list-of-versioning-schemes-in-open-source.html
08:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> Version 0.0.1 of ZeroVer was published by Mahmoud Hashemi on 2018-04-01.
08:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> self referencing joke
08:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> and too old to be used in Teeworlds
08:53 < bridge> <totar> Its definitely older than 2018, and doesn't need a publication lol
08:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> and too ~~old~~ young to be used in Teeworlds
08:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> you are indeed right, I assumed that it would be the first time that versioning was mentioned, highly likely nit the case.
08:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> you are indeed right, I assumed that it would be the first time that versioning was mentioned, highly likely not the case.
09:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:NOTED:939903620168691722>
09:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Teeworlds even made it into the official ZeroVer specification https://0ver.org
09:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lua developers hate this versioning trick
10:07 < bridge> <learath2> There is a caveat though. The bridge layer is pretty darn janky. It works(tm) but it has many bugs
10:17 < bridge> <isowner> idk, because i‚Äôm using old version
10:18 < bridge> <isowner> but now I'll try to transfer it to the new version
10:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Name one bug
10:29 < bridge> <Assa> your project is linked in the ddnet wiki in the automapper section, if you want to add text or change something feel free to do so: <https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Automapper#Tools>
10:29 < bridge> <Assa> That's the reason i pinged chillerdragon in the first place üòÑ
10:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> Also @patiga you said you reimplemented automappers in twmap, I don't know if I should link this as well (because I don't understand the extend of your automapper support)
10:31 < bridge> <Assa> :GG: :OO: :OO: :DD:    :MM: :OO: :RR: :NN: :II: :NN: :GG:
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> whoever made this emojis is a genius btw
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> whoever made this emojis is a genius btw, easy to use, no need to search, nice to look at
10:44 < bridge> <k2d222> Thanks! you could add that it has support for rules++ too. Also twwe uses Patiga's twmap automapper on the server side and has a javascript implementation on the client side.
10:45 < bridge> <k2d222> I think twmap deserves to be listed here too
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> The readme states, that it's checking and running automapper files. In the tooling section I tried to list tools helping with the creation of them
10:52 < bridge> <Assa> But I guess by this logic your tool doesn't belong there, too ü§î @k2d222
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> or does it? At least from the video you are either choosing predefined automappers or uploading .rules files
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> Nevermind it does, just needed to watch ALL of the video
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> sorry I need more coffee
10:55 < bridge> <k2d222> you can create and edit automappers with the editor
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> Also great video @k2d222 üëç nice tool
10:58 < bridge> <Assa> I should do that as well for my tool üôà but video creation is so meh
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> I believe twmap deserves it's own wiki page there. Its a bazooka for developers who want to create a map
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> I think 0.7 skin translation still has bugs in it e.g.
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller u here
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> Damage indicators are unfixably behaving differently between the two versions is another I can think of
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller i put all my non existing video editing skills to the test
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318538245117710416/proj-3000.mp4?ex=6762afee&is=67615e6e&hm=9024f6a2a542417605ad1dddc88b7240ab67610808c3d7d915bc939a95a44a08&
12:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> What editor did you use, Kdenlive?
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
12:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> Good editor, I tried writing custom (√ºberg√§nge) but i failed miserabley
12:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> I did my first video using devinci resolve and it was great, but I wanted a FOSS alternative and Kdenlive is really damn good
12:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> Good editor, I tried writing custom transitions but i failed miserabley
12:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, Saskia
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> random things i found in my room
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the vr headset isnt even mine xD
12:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> I think the thought process was something along the lines of: Must look as natural and human as possible, because I'm an alien >:D
12:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> I beliebe Saskia to be pretty human. Humans need water.
12:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> believe
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my thought indeed was something like:
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> normally you have water and maybe some food (the nuts on the right) on your table
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why i included them xD
12:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
12:35 < bridge> <pathos3005> Super cool -- I don't understand the ordering part though even though it should be my domain üòÖü•≤  how does this work? My understanding is that it's actually not ordered, but instead random???
12:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't either. there might be some proof that it is indeed one to one mapped, but it didn't really go into that
12:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but to be fair, as long as it is one to one mapped then it is ordered.
12:40 < bridge> <pathos3005> So I have a question about demo -> video rendering.
12:40 < bridge> <pathos3005> Would I be able to convert a demo to video using an `.sh` or some kind of terminal script/file?
12:40 < bridge> <pathos3005> And my guess is that I would need some kind of (compatible) graphics driver, correct? How does/would GPU/hardware assigning work for video rendering?
12:41 < bridge> <pathos3005> I guess I don't understand why it couldn't just simply be +1 +1 +1 in index, render 10 or so, then have 100 ready. I understand that it tricks the viewer by it not being a real list, but yeah, still confused about why it would be random
12:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh, no reason at all, the guy just want it to look random
12:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can understand it really
12:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's like adding a layer of mystery just to be cool or soemthing
12:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean it's not like the website is made to serve any purpose to begin with
12:43 < bridge> <pathos3005> I mean, it may serve a purpose to someone, but I get what you mean
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> iirc, it is done by simply taking screenshots in game to stack them as video frames with ffmpeg so i think you'll definitely need the game running in a GPU.
12:43 < bridge> <pathos3005> I just don't understand the constraint 'We should display every UUID exactly once'
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: the guy want to build a joke website to display every UUID
12:44 < bridge> <pathos3005> Ah yeah, I remember seeing the `ffmpeg` library, and I guess audio is just pasted on to the video file hmm
12:44 < bridge> <pathos3005> And 'game running in a GPU' meaning I have to have the DDNet client open?
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably?
12:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not exactly sure if you can render a frame without ddnet client.
12:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is just taking screenshots tho, cuz the game had codepath to hide UIs when rendering video so it is just taking the framebuffer of the currently running game
12:45 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah I want to do it with commands, that's why
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly our current way of rendering stuff for ffmpeg requires a window.
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a vulkan first ddnet engine could handle complete offscreen rendering and could even work as terminal app
12:47 < bridge> <pathos3005> But yeah I understand, I guess then I will have to somehow run a desktop on my server, have some macro that renders it through the client
12:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> does vulkan do software rendering too
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on linux there are software rendering drivers yes
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> called lavapipe
12:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's cool
12:48 < bridge> <pathos3005> !?
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i even use it on my vps
12:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so you might be able to do it
12:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it would be nice if someone could move the rendering to an offscreen context tho. just for displaying progress and not tied to the current resolution
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this was done exactly as you say
12:53 < bridge> <pathos3005> Do you have script for this!?
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this isnt ddnet
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thanks my phone crashed
12:54 < bridge> <pathos3005> Then what was it?
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> an alternative client that uses a vulkan first engine
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's not compatible to ddnet in almost any way
12:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so ddpg
12:58 < bridge> <pathos3005> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-headless-clients
12:58 < bridge> <pathos3005> 'Compile with `-DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON` to get a ddnet client without graphics'
12:58 < bridge> <pathos3005> Doable?
12:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think no
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is just a hack, but really can't render anything
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said in current ddnet there is no way
12:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you need a window and renderer running. maybe just try to use a software renderer
13:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~imagine building a rendering backend to render to davinci resolve projects~~
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would be cool if obs has a plugin to directly render to a obs screen.
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we could provide proper support for streamers to hide chat for the stream, while the streamer still sees it
13:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> prob easier to just use two windows?
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that doesn't overload the graphics output sure
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a offscreen canvas would be kinda more flexible tho
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (e.g. can windows even deal with 2 fullscreen apps?)
13:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe not idk
13:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> speaking of fullscreen, a lot of games stopped supporting exclusive fullscreen now
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddpg even doesn't work with it rn.
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if ddnet cpp only works bcs of the windows 7 manifest file
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3124
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's just such a stupid windows thing
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this os is just so bad xD
13:10 < bridge> <sqwinix> Hello everyone! I have a couple of questions about the community tab. What are the criteria for getting into it?
13:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> iirc currently we are not accepting any new entries
13:12 < bridge> <pathos3005> Just to double check, just running LXDE or LXQt should be fine for running DDNet client + rendering video, right? https://wiki.debian.org/DesktopEnvironment
13:12 < bridge> <sqwinix> Oh... okay, what are the general criteria, for example: open source or something like that?
13:12 < bridge> <pathos3005> #questions
13:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the ones that exists currently is there before any security concern is brought up
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> worth a try, but ig nobody ever tried it
13:13 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah I understand, thanks üôÇ üëç
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i read you can somehow make virtual monitors and have real desktops, but i never really tried it
13:13 < bridge> <sqwinix> Sad
13:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> #9262
13:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9262
13:16 < bridge> <pathos3005> What about instead of SSH, just use something like `X2Go` or some remote desktop?
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Never used any of those, but maybe it works
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but keep in mind vps cores are super slow
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt u have a good experience xD
13:21 < bridge> <pathos3005> I would assume DDNet client would run 1080p (maybe even 1440p?) 60 FPS fine on 1 core CPU, no?
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no üòÑ
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my 16 core desktop cpu can manage around 300 fps while using map design on 1440p maybe
13:22 < bridge> <pathos3005> DDNet can multicore? üòÆ
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well lavapipe does it
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rendering is very threaded
13:22 < bridge> <pathos3005> But hmm, I think rendering waits for each frame to finish rendering anyway, so I think it should be fine
13:22 < bridge> <pathos3005> I see
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you are on linux
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318554040342417408/image.png?ex=6762bea4&is=67616d24&hm=52c1c6abc3ee3a16c66e923d9a6559d64d10416f81e8e4873f4d66d317c13130&
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just try it out yourself
13:23 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah, will have to experiment few things discusses here, thanks for the tip on `llvmpipe`also

14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guys did furo rq?
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or why is ddstats down and bro gone
14:13 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think furo rq
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good thing you can't rq ddnet forever
14:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can
14:17 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i should have
14:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> its a discord video so i first have to find the right client that can receive it
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> download it so i can delete xd
14:25 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> i dont think it ever arrived on matrix
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok wait
14:26 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> why did you cut something i just need a short clip with some camera swing :D

14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro you asked me for video
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i give you full movie
14:26 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> ok sure just saying you really didnt have to cut
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you download with that link?
14:27 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> no
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
14:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bro cant visit a link
14:27 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> wait i can
14:27 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> how wtf?
14:27 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> since when do links work?
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the download link
14:27 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> you manually phished that out somewhere?
14:28 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> how does it work without discord cookies?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the discord cdn doesnt want any
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i simply downloaded the vid and gave you the download link xd
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nothing special
14:28 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> nice video!
14:29 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> thanks
14:29 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> weird because i cant even view images from the discord cdn anymore
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice time to delete evidence
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should work
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe matrix gets wrong urls

14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's my img xd
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> weird wait
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you send a image on discord rl quick?
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its me stripping query params that used to work
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318571303933841498/screenshot_2016-11-11_03-59-54.png?ex=6762ceb8&is=67617d38&hm=397e3b3a6ad99325cbefedbae3ce11ce5d3d6ada3dcd7b4d62b443288a1e6178&

14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg finally no more matrix booting
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> irc pro mode
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all this time i actually locked my self out. Because 7 months ago it was possible to strip off all the tracking query params and it would still load then they changed it and i thought they require discord session cookies but they just require the spyware url
14:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> which spyware url? the discord one?
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``?ex=6762bf09&is=67616d89&hm=adf8be98817d539be297c3077892c1b6e9ac1b7b3d807c8fe191786417f741e1&fav=hentai&gender=helicopter&location=28.12818818,8.172812&age=21``
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this part
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> urls that contain more than the unique identifier for the relevant ressource are sus
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure somewhere in the long hex string is enough information to figure out jupstars political orientation
14:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its literally just a string to prevent images to be views outside of discord for more than 24 hours
14:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> for... some reason
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> There is a bug on my server that no "trails" work
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> for example, when I write infAtom and idi shows that it works, but there are no flying things
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> although the rainbow works with the same ID
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> and also with all the bullets
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg chiller still helping
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> legend
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless maybe you are out of snap items <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653> InfAtom works on my local server
14:57 < bridge> <woidless> Maybe I did something wrong
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im joining you sec
14:58 < bridge> <woidless> Ok
14:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> chillergpt
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless omg there are no projectiles on all of your servers wtf?
15:03 < bridge> <woidless> I'm hz
15:03 < bridge> <woidless> don't know
15:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> btw did we ever fix the problem where a really long hook might get network clipped
15:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i fixed it before in moment cap but i don't remember why i thought it wouldn't make sense for ddnet
15:16 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
15:16 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible to keep records with TestCMD enabled?
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless no they are for testing on test servers not for cheating on production servers
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is "moment cap" @tsfreddie ?
15:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the photoshoot event thing
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a

16:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @jupeyy_keks is this channel the only place you talk about your client project
16:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or is there a dedicated server

17:41 < bridge> <woidless>     for (int i = 0; i < SIZE;) {
17:41 < bridge> <woidless> Is the code normal for a C++ beginner?
17:41 < bridge> <Ewan> looks normal from my phone
17:41 < bridge> <woidless> Here I used pointers , and there is also a function for filling the array with random unique numbers, as well as a function for
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> you can just put your whole random function before main and you wont have to forward declare
17:42 < bridge> <woidless> It's more convenient for me
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> factorial if statements might be changed to n <= 1
17:42 < bridge> <woidless> I compiled it through Visual studio 2022 so the code should work
17:43 < bridge> <Ewan> in main, defining size for that array is redundant
17:44 < bridge> <Ewan> but these things are not important for rn and will be optimized away
17:44 < bridge> <Ewan> nice job
17:44 < bridge> <woidless> To program over ddnet, do you need to study object-oriented programming?
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> using SIZE for a const just defined as such in a fn arg (and not a constexpr or preprocessor constant) is a little unusual, same as Here being capitalized, but that‚Äôs just preference
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Not really study but at least understand the basics. It‚Äôs used heavily in the overall architecture of the game
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> specifically you should understand interface vs implementation classes, RAII, and probably SOLID principles if you were to write your own objects for it. ddnet itself handles much of this kind of sloppily too
17:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i also just noticed your using namespace std at the top of the file. not inherently objectionable but unusual and not actually seen often in real code, afaik I mostly only see it in learning scenarios where ppl are bothered by typing std over and over
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i‚Äôd at least move it into the scope of the function where you need it
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it has a genuine use but it pollutes the global namespace
17:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> free CS courses?
17:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sign me up
17:50 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
17:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i was bored in a meeting :nouis:
17:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> worker gang
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah imm curious why in ab you add that all to 0. that doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything
18:28 < bridge> <woidless> In what sense?
18:29 < bridge> <Ewan> 0+ rand() % 10
18:29 < bridge> <Ewan> 0+ is redundant
18:30 < bridge> <Ewan> rand()%10 would do the same thing
18:37 < bridge> <woidless> you need to ask me who wrote it so that it works from 0 , if by default it already works from 0
18:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you write this yourself @woidless ?
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> it's not half bad, some redundant code and it could be improved in a few places, but all in all it's decent.
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> you could refactor certain things, for example:
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```c++
18:41 < bridge> <melo∆û>  if (n == 0)
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û>         return 1;
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û>     if (n == 1)
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û>         return 1;
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> could be refactored to:
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```c++
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û>  if (n <= 1) //smaller than or equal to 1,
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û>       return 1;
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
18:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> these are just common practices you often see, they remove boilerplate code and increase readability
18:42 < bridge> <Ewan> :troll:
18:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's time to implement `Display` trait for ir because it's already annoying debugging when it infers wrong type üò¨
18:42 < bridge> <Ewan> why not debug trait
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> oh, for IR
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought you said it.
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont understand
18:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> god i love rust so much...

18:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> ive been waiting 47 years!
18:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanna get sccache set up on my network
18:43 < bridge> <pioooooo> Can someone explain to me why #9396 is not merged?
18:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9396
18:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> The test seems wrong
18:44 < bridge> <Ewan> to me, it‚Äôs not super obvious what it does just at a glance
18:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> lol is the build CI borked?
18:44 < bridge> <Ewan> and maintainers may not test it unless you put up more of a fight
18:45 < bridge> <Ewan> says checks are fine for me, but that‚Äôs on github mobile
18:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> on ubuntu-20.04
18:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1318635176456228875/image.png?ex=67630a35&is=6761b8b5&hm=8d743388e2bacf0ed67e5772cf77562980be2540dddb0ff75c4d644c0ebd3daa&
18:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> But I see other prs merged without any problem
18:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> :greenthing:
18:46 < bridge> <Ewan> probably ppl havent seen it
18:47 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh lmfaooo
18:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs in the merge queue
18:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> deen added it to the merge queue already :kekw:
18:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> Shouldn't be my job anyway :owo:
18:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> roby is on it
18:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> i see your every move roby :Staree:
18:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like the clone for googletest failed with HTTP 503, which later causes this cryptic error
18:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> interesting
18:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> me neither
19:00 < bridge> <woidless> Yes, but to make it more convenient for you, I translated the entire output in cout into English through the neural network
19:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> the first one is more readable tbh :justatest:
19:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ```return n <= 1```
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```c
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for (int i = 10; 0 <-- i;) {
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>   //stuff
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> }
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is how C loops work, right?
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```c
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for (int i = 10; i --> 0;) {
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>   //stuff
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> }
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
19:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> has slightly different behavior and also quite useful :troll:
19:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cursed but also kinda cool
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> what am i looking at lol
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i-- > 0
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i like this pattern tbh
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> though it‚Äôs misleading
20:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :WW:
20:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Sadly
20:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```c
20:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> for (int i = 0; i ++> 10;) {
20:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3>   //stuff
20:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> }
20:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
20:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> doesn't look nearly as nice
20:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and also isn't nearly as obfuscated lol
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Luckily in C++ we can make it work both ways through operator overloading :) :) :) 
21:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Nothing wrong with that, right?
21:03 < bridge> <teero777> That won't work xd
21:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh whoops got the direction wrong
21:03 < bridge> <teero777> i is 0 and you're checking against i > 10 xd
21:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> clearly we need to write operator overloading magic :D
21:32 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> Developers, please add a list of server stories to the game and update the design ‚Äî it looks too harsh and distracting.
21:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> A story server wouldn't make much sense in the community tabs, but maybe in the Internet tab.. sounds actually reasonable.
21:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> What do you mean with "update the design"? I for example like the server browser design, what would you change? And how?
21:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> A server history wouldn't make much sense in the community tabs, but maybe in the Internet tab.. sounds actually reasonable.

21:36 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> (nice joke)

21:38 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> (nice joke)
21:38 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> i mean a game (my love game DDraceNetwork)
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Developers, add battle pass please
21:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And lootboxes and hats
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and pay 2 win features
21:38 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> say "Please"
21:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Please
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> laser for $9.99 at any moment in the run
21:42 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> Well, if they don't answer, then they don't know how and can't do it for the word "Please"
21:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wdym harsh and distracting?
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9398#issuecomment-2549047444
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> is there even anything done with rust in the codebase?
23:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the master server
23:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some basic cxx bridge
23:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the next network protocol will most likely be in rust too
23:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh no
23:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not the networking
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?xd
23:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> After a chat with Freddie earlier I'm considering working on it, but like, I'm not learning Rust for this
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and what do you plan to do?
23:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess the main part of it would be in prediction instead of really networking, and there's plans for that going on, so I should probably go along with that instead
23:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but general idea is that you can get away with sending a whole lot less over the network if you rely on prediction more
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i believe it when i see it xddd
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah i meant like the network backend
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not how the game interacts with the server
