01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> is it possible to code teeworlds clone with lua? anyone know
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> basically no
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> oh. what abt lua + game engine
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> dang i needa learn a lot
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh sorry, I misunderstood your question
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know if there's a game engine that works with lua, but if there is, you could probably reimplement teeworlds in it
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> realistically speaking, teeworlds is a medium-sized project so you can't just rewrite it entirely
02:11 <+breton> https://www.openhub.net/p/teeworlds
02:11 <+breton> > took an estimated 17 years of effort (COCOMO model)
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> i think i'm going to try rewriting a basic teeworlds with visual studio and SDL at least
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess something easier would be to pick a small problem field from teeworlds and try to implement that
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> no my plan is make a new game lol
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> teeworlds code is too much for me
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @louis bad plan
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yeah
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Cause you  are making a completely new game with not that much knowledge nor experience
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> how the fuck are you gonna remake teeworlds without even knowing its original code
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :GWchadThonkery:
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> reset bruh when changing active layer
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> "hacky mouse editor"
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> ü§î
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üòÑ
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @lvl 35 Boss when u know the game u can recode it
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> i'm not recoding teeworlds i'm making a new arcade platformer that's basically 90% teeworlds
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> also, even though i may not have that much experience, i'll learn.
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> lol
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> even if it takes 5 years. I have that much time since I don't even turn 18 until 4 years
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> that's a nice way to learn
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> üëç
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ``` pData->GameServer()->SendChatTarget(pData->m_ClientID, ""); ```
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Why does this not make a empty line?
14:25 <@heinrich5991> look into src/game/client/components/chat.cpp, empty lines are dropped
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is it just liking reasons or does it come with problems?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> c++ is so weird sometimes coming from other languages
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ``` if (foo == "bar") { } ``` does not work
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ``` if (strcmp(foo, "bar") == 0) { } ``` does work
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Simple string comparision not working
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> even with ===
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In C++ you need 4 = signs for comparisons: `====`
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the strcmp thing is C anyway. In proper C++ you'd use std::string and they work just fine with `==`
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Looks like you can't copy layers in the new client version :saddo: that was actually **very** useful
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Lol dont update client
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ye about to downgrade and hopefully someone brings this back
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when you havent told anyone you still use 9.0 in 0.4749 seconds :konsti:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cmon kosnti say it again
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Im 'corneum this means you can't use autofiller anymore
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> dont need it atm
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie well, it fixed a crash so that's even better üòÑ So the only useful case is to copy from non-game tile layer to other non-game tile layer, right?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> actually, no
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can copy game layer onto a tile layer and use an automapper on it for exmaple to only keep unhookable tiles
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and then you just automap it and unhookable layer is done in 3 clicks
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, but not other layers like tune/tele?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well if you want to autoplace tele you would do that too
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and I guess any other layer if you need to design it
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, didn't think of that
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we need to find a better fix for that
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6450&p=64502&hilit=autofiller#p64502 here it's explained how to use this "trick" and also how it's useful
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And here'S the bug: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/485
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure when I have to time to fix this, anyone else want to give it a try?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> fps counter is broken
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> any prooves ? works totally fine
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lvl 35 Boss> whats a prooves
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> any proves ? works totally fine
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im no native english speaker, i can call it as i want
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Did you mean: `any proof`?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i think
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no i meant proofs, wrote it with a v, then this troll came
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie 11.7.2 has the old version again btw
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks for the quick report
