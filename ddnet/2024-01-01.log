04:12 < bridge> <rafael8192> Guys, which method calls on the server side when player hook?
04:26 < bridge> <Ewan> 🤖 🚨
04:28 < bridge> <rafael8192> ON THE SERVER SIDE
04:28 < bridge> <rafael8192> Not on client bro
04:28 < bridge> <rafael8192> I want to make an anti bot
04:29 < bridge> <rafael8192> Or maybe try :/
04:29 < bridge> <skystrife.> To test how good your aimbot client is?
04:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> never trust someone who just joined the discord asking about this stuff :justatest:
04:59 < bridge> <rafael8192> Its cringe
04:59 < bridge> <rafael8192> For what i need it?

08:00 < ChillerDragon> jopsti got sister reveal
08:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> when i building on linux it gave me this ?
08:01 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin lookg good no errors
08:01 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin but it is recommended to not use the root user for those kind of activities
08:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i thought it said fails written to ............
08:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> putty text size is killing me
08:04 < ChillerDragon> dont use putty in 2024
08:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a way to make it bigger ?
08:04 < ChillerDragon> dont use putty
08:04 < ChillerDragon> use the "windows terminal"
08:04 < ChillerDragon> type in "ssh root@yourserverip"
08:04 < ChillerDragon> and done
08:04 < ChillerDragon> then you can increase font with ctrl and +
08:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i couldn't connect with the terminal on windows
08:04 < ChillerDragon> why
08:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't give me don't gave me permission or something
08:06 < ChillerDragon> well im sure in putty settings you can also change the font size
08:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and i couldn't install wsl ether
08:06 < ChillerDragon> but i would recommend you to not use putty since it looks ugly and its additional software you do not need since your operating system ships an official ssh client already
08:07 < ChillerDragon> the windows terminal is much more polished when it comes to looks and functionality. For example copy and pasting is also much smoother
08:07 < ChillerDragon> windowsdragon momment
08:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok. i will change
08:07 < ChillerDragon> also pls on your server create a user and use that instead of root
08:08 < ChillerDragon> root has full access to your server and if you ddnet server has bugs those bugs also have the power to do everything
08:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and my code is full of bugs 😂
08:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> at least i managed to not spam the broadcast tho
08:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's an step ahead
08:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> didn't gave me permission or something
08:27 < ChillerDragon> what command did you run what was the exact error?
08:29 < ChillerDragon> ``CCharacterCore::SetHookedPlayer(int HookedPlayer)`` @rafael8192 will be called on hook on client and server side if i am not mistaken
08:29 < ChillerDragon> ``ANTIBOTAPI void AntibotOnHookAttach(int ClientID, bool Player);`` but you should probably use this
08:29 < ChillerDragon> and implement a proper antibot module
08:29 < ChillerDragon> ofc you do not have to. Alternatively you could also check in any tick function for the hookedplayer id
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
09:33 < ChillerDragon> new year
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> true
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> damnnn apparently xbox one and ps4 are being discontinued
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> no more games for them
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> they always still feel like the new console even tho they’re 10 yrs old at this point
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it is hard to enjoy this game rn
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> all of the usa servers are lagging like crazy
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> idk where usa3 went
09:54 < ChillerDragon> Ewan u just old
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> we got a ps5 for christmas so my bedroom tv inherited the ps4
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i have been using it for tv and a little bit of fortnite
09:55 < ChillerDragon> i mostly gamed on ps2 xd
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> ps2 was awesome
09:56 < ChillerDragon> the uneven ps are irrelevant right?
09:56 < ChillerDragon> nobodi cares ps1 ps3 ps5
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yea ehhh
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ps3 still rly respected but definitely the worst of all of them
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> so i would not say so
09:56 < ChillerDragon> its like windows 8 and 11 :D
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ps1 was great but it was way better once the games had standard joystick support
09:57 < ChillerDragon> ps1 wot
09:57 < ChillerDragon> u rly old
09:57 < ChillerDragon> ps2 rlsd in 2000
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish they still made joysticks like the ones on the dualshock 1 and 2
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> im not old i just had games
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ps1 big innovator for games on disc. you can't really deny that
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> ps3 was pretty powerful for the time
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and ps5 is cool.,.. just seems like the ps4 but new
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i havent used it much. all i rly notice that's different is that it's more powerful and it has a different home menu and stuff
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> home menu has very scary sounds for some reason
09:59 < ChillerDragon> lol
09:59 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlYKY7in934>
09:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it would have given 5 yo me nightmares
09:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i used to be scared of the computer at my grandmas because of the windows xp sounds
09:59 < ChillerDragon> minecraft cave sounds
10:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> morning
10:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i miss the wii tho
10:00 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
10:02 < bridge> <Ewan> mourning rather
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> not a day goes by where i don’t miss the simple joy of playing a wii game
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> don’t have to worry about people being jerks online or anything
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> or even people existing online
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> people suck
10:06 < ChillerDragon> xd
10:06 < ChillerDragon> offline sucks ngl
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it has its benefits
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i think today i will try and get vscode to play nice
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> with cpp
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> how do u do it
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when code mario party teeworlds mod
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How long password do you generate for websites? 😄
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> well there's teeware
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> it's sorta similar
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Websites usually throw weird errors on 20+ chars
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i set keepass to 20 chars
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if u want to hack me
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now you know my pw length
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good to know
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I learned 30 chars master password
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nuts
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When i upload the file u can try to guess it :justatest:
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro i recently forgot my VPS root pw
10:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not even very long xd
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good luck remembering 30 chars
10:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good to know
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller i give u even more tips: my master pw is not 30 chars
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's less
10:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oh, also u need a picture:p
10:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> U basically pwnd at this point
10:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Holly hell, u can also upload files in there :poggers2:
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> jup how did u set up ur vscode to comply
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to comply with what? 😄
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/caeebaf4a0e08b96336ef9ac52e6a2dac2011359/other/vscode/README.md
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> follow this readme, then start the workspace in same dir
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> install suggested extensions
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and have epic gamer moment vscode experience
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not ddnet specifically
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> just any cmake projects
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in fact after i installed all stuff that i installed for ddnet, it also just works for every other project xd
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the cmake extension also ask to setup the project for you
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a lot of setup
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's one apt call, but sadly i didnt put it like that there xd
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> ok lemme just get apt on windows
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> troll
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> not just the pkgs which are the issue
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of manual setup of paths and things on windows
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, but mold is optional
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and clang-format is not required on other projects (maybe)
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> cant use mold on win
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> sadly
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep ignore that then
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not needed
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan>  *  The terminal process failed to launch (exit code: -1). 
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan>  *  Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it. 
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan>  *  Executing task: CMake: build client 
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what this is about
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno either, it's missing some info xdd
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> expecting things in the path is the biggest issue
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont use the path on windows
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i use msys's path
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> and vscode has msys integration but not enough i guess
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191322633623568454/image.png?ex=65a504a9&is=65928fa9&hm=918786602c997541b6f1c2ac2b80f1f4c2694f0a02b025d4af735420798b1b69&
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> so broken
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use linux btw 😏
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but what is expected in path?
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all stuff is optional that should be in path
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> also expected paths for executables
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> vscode doesnt work :justatest:
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191322955377033297/image.png?ex=65a504f6&is=65928ff6&hm=2ecd60c99c0ad9b84ac145afc6cbb8e0facce49413f2bca0969bb7c8dc9bc8d9&
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> clangd clang clang-tidy lldb cmake rustup...
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chads use vscodium
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
11:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use neovim btw 😏
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also buy tab completion 😏
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but cant u install them over msys
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but how does code know which shell you want to use
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt msys in path?
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s not how it works
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno, but most of the extensions i mention also download binaries anyway
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I can’t seem to differentiate between e.g. /mingw64 and /ucrt64 sysroots
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, for me it also just works on windows, last time i coded there
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask robyster
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he uses windows
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i will just throw all my drives into the bathtub instead
11:23 < bridge> <robyt3> I never touched the ucrt64 folder in MSYS2, I added `/mingw64/bin` and `/usr/bin` to my PATH variable. Also, I installed standalone cmake instead us installing it with MSYS2, no idea if that makes any difference.
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> too late
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> already soaking
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> werent u on gentoo anyway?
11:23 < bridge> <Ewan> who
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> for about 5 minutes
11:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xd
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more than me
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and then i was pissed off by gnome/wayland's asinine fractional scaling support
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> and i was away from home when i was installing it
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> so idk i just felt like i didnt wanna use the computer
11:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use it at least for 44 mins 😏
11:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191326131081728000/image.png?ex=65a507eb&is=659292eb&hm=dbb65aae776e2448eab5b565edf4e390f1c5388ced806f49d440ec9f7d61e0ff&
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow u alsmost use it for the whole current year
11:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yup
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller: do you use the closed source nvidia  drivers on laptop btw?=
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing is happening

14:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i fix my problem with this ?
14:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ?
14:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> any suggestions ?

15:18 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Reading this has made me second guess how we've been going about ddnet lately. Are we the libinput people? The libinput people sound annoying
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's the tl;dr?
15:23 < bridge> <learath2> In pursuit of a more testable simpler input driver the libinput people removed all options, which combined with the experience they provide being suboptimal made the driver feel worse than the ancient supposedly worse synaptics driver
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think our problem is a bit different.
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we merge every pr that nobody needs bcs someone did it and we dont want to close it, leading to lot of features that only like 5 ppl use.
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and since our code base is not really designed to make these feature be lone modules, we have huge functions bloated with lots of if statements nobody understands
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and are hard to debug
15:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i did it but u didnt merge :feelsbadman:
15:31 < bridge> <learath2> I can't quite think of many features like that except that one editor brush thing I did like 5 years ago that I think no one uses 😄
15:32 < bridge> <louis> what editor brush thing
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> You can save your selections as a brush
15:34 < bridge> <louis> oh 😅
15:34 < bridge> <louis> the thing where you keep a brush between maps?
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember if you can keep them between maps

17:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> help your bro
17:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i managed to download them manually, where do i need to put them ?
18:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean heinrichs war against adding config variables?
18:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> bros, ive made perfect piece of ~~shit~~ software. Milk Lang!
18:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191428083329286195/image.png?ex=65a566de&is=6592f1de&hm=7e4d760c83814bc1f10533f8481f4afb2b1e2431634be144730835df83a312dc&
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i finished the book :feelsbadman: no more cool features
20:15 < bridge> <ar1gin> feels like python tbh
20:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in linux where  do i need to put my maps to get automatically added when i running a server ?
20:17 < bridge> <ar1gin> im not an expert but have you tried putting them right next to the server binary or here -> `~/.local/share/ddnet/maps/`?
20:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i did not see a map directory there
20:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me make one to see if it works
20:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> feels like js :justatest:
20:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> or lua
20:18 < bridge> <ar1gin> nothing stops you from making one yeah
20:19 < bridge> <ar1gin> the `let` keyword tops it off
20:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it doesnt even have for
20:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> loops for weak
20:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> you can also reference the official ddnet map repo <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps>, just look into the config files
20:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> who needs a turing complete language anyways, right?
20:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> now add a few syntax features from zig for the seasoning and it'll shine like a diamond
20:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> id like to make a language in something and then make interpreter or compiler for that language in that language xd
20:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but that way too much wokr xd
20:24 < bridge> <ar1gin> there is a word for that i think...
20:24 < bridge> <ar1gin> bootstrapping is it?
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
21:10 < bridge> <stnwtr> May I ask a general C++ question here? Or search for help ... ?
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> Ask away
21:19 < bridge> <stnwtr> nvm, I found that stupid bug that did not add the .cpp file to the cmake project ...
21:20 < bridge> <stnwtr> Now I know you cannot add a directory recursively with just the name. (`add_executable(name src)`) <-- does not work 🥲 
21:20 < bridge> <stnwtr> (hpp files got added ... cpp not, idk)
21:26 < bridge> <sedonya> Чи можна додати кнопку до активності Discord?
21:27 < bridge> <sedonya> Is it possible to add a button to a Discord activity?
21:29 < bridge> <chairn> i think there's a function for that in ddnet's cmake
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is there no disconnect dummy protection? He lost a 6hr run .\_. https://youtu.be/fWevn4CHt1s?si=srpbuUv7bh5N32ZU
21:49 < bridge> <cyberfighter> making ddnet stupid proof real
21:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> DreamBerd moment
21:53 < bridge> <devinci24> Why would we need that tho. unless you can somehow bind a key to dummy disconect it seems quite impossible to disconnect it withouth actually wanting to do it ^^'
21:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: imagine making a real compiler for dreamberd :justatest:
22:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, utf8 is the right choice. unfortunately, all of windows, .net, java, javascript made the wrong choice, so the wrong choice is here to stay 😦
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on how much entropy was used to generate the password. if the password wasn't generated automatically, you should probably not upload it at all
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it does
22:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i used some random ass website to generate master password 30 chars long
22:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but also u need a file to open the database 😄
22:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even without. if you're concerned, add another word
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> header files not added as sources. they are just included by the sources
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually a password with words u come up stringed together is stronger than a human trying to make a hard to remember password
22:43 < bridge> <learath2> But without any you are vulnerable to dictionary bruteforce, no?
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why passphrases are words
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot the blog post
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it was interesting
22:43 < bridge> <learath2> Makes the search space much smaller if you only use words
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> tldr u can make ur password easy to remember for a human and hard for a machine without trying to do 0 for o and stuff
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is where the  machine is good at guessing
22:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but words are easy to remember
22:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> so you make ur password bigger
22:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/936/
22:46 < bridge> <learath2> 6 dictionary words you pick would be from a much much smaller search space. If you have even one special in there you are invulnerable to it
22:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is this good or not :justatest:
22:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1191497925352763493/image.png?ex=65a5a7ea&is=659332ea&hm=46d33b59e1a3d58750061bd3043252212402f9efbc0c24a0177e62a1ffacabd0&
22:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's bad btw, now the website might knw your password
22:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> whats the chance they know where to use it :thonk:
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, because there are enough words
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> If you pick from the oxford dictionary completely randomly, sure
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> use a word list from diceware
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> But if you are picking from more common words it's much smaller
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has 7776 words
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 6⁵
22:49 < bridge> <learath2> Especially if you are picking words in an order that makes sense as a sentence
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> use `shuf -rn 6 wordlist`
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> never choose a password
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let the computer choose it for you
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> keepassxc can make passwords for u
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on how it was generated. password quality generators cannot work by definition
22:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh, dats good
22:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> password managers can generally do that
22:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think about security so much even tho nobody will ever try to hack me lel
22:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to have one that stores the encrypted passwords on some server, I'd suggest bitwarden
22:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has nice browser extensions as well
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> just not reusing passwords makes u 99% more secure than most ppl already
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have same password on 100 websites :justatest:
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah everybody does that
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> use a password manager ^^
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont for stuff that matters
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont mean its the good thing to do, but its what common people do
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you said everybody, I don't
22:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have same password for google account and some website which can be hacked in a few days
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok no need to be pedantic
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and I bet many more don't. especially people using password managers
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> u overstimate the tech saviness of ppl
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I used to do that before I had a password manager. it's a lot simpler to just generate a random password than typing a common one into each website
22:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm open to be convinced by data. population: people using password managers
22:54 < bridge> <learath2> The layperson far overestimates the difficulty of using password managers. I couldn't get my parents to use one for the life of me
22:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> question: do they reuse passwords on hundreds of websites
22:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> question: do they reuse passwords on hundreds of websites?
22:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> question: do they reuse passwords on hundred websites?
22:56 < bridge> <learath2> Only issue with password managers is devices that don't have a plugin or convenient input method
22:56 < bridge> <learath2> The truly random passwords are so annoying to type on a shitty smart tv remote
22:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea. I really like password managers like bitwarden for that
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes this xd
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 but lately tv apps use a web u can use from pc
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example twitch
22:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can choose to generate passwords that suit your keyboard though
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a code
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> it shows on the tv
22:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, authenticating another device, basically?
22:57 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah that or a qr code on screen that lets you log in on your phones browser instead
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
22:57 < bridge> <learath2> Oh there is another really cool thing I found a couple years back
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw tv software is incredibly slow
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its insane
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> they just need some cheap arm cpu
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> like from a rpi
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and its 500% faster
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> than the shit they use
22:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on how many layers of shitty code you put there
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> Some tvs have a very very high pitch broadcast sound that lets your phone associate with them
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> samsung tv uses some weird ass OS
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> Tizen OS
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/mboard/rc-custom/thread.cgi?39266
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> Researcher calls Samsung's Tizen OS "the worst code I've ever seen"
23:02 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if it's the shit code or shit mcu's they cut costs on but smart tvs and cars are soooooo slow
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm happy I don't use them (yet)
23:03 < bridge> <learath2> It's getting harder and harder to avoid sadly. I couldn't find a dumb tv to buy last time around
23:05 < bridge> <learath2> I usually have my tv on either my chromecast or my rpi entertainment thing
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://j3s.sh/thought/fail2ban-sux.html
23:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting post 🙂
