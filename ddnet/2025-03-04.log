01:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the change is just to make sure the behavior is logically unchanged if m_Tuning is not set by any outsider. and the "fail safe" is basically what make the code behave identical to the original code.
01:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is made so client can override the tuning so yes the change was made for client only even tho it is in the shared code
01:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if sometime server start setting `m_Tuning` after this change then ye, it is completely useless. i didn't check whether server is doing that, but it probably wasn't doing that when that PR was made
01:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if sometime later server start setting `m_Tuning` after this change then ye, it is completely useless. i didn't check whether server is doing that, but it probably wasn't doing that when that PR was made
01:25 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea it works fine without it, I would like to remove tuning from world class since it's flawed
01:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then do it i guess
01:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and it is probably good that shared code won't rely on `g_Config.m_ClDummy` at all if you could make that happen too
01:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not sure if it is related tho
01:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not sure if it is related to what you are doing tho
01:26 < bridge> <kebscs> This is exactly why I want to remove it,  and it's also confusing because it's not world tuning but current player's
01:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean it is just left over from adding dummy to begin with
01:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Which this "world tuning" isn't used anywhere anyway
01:26 < bridge> <TsPiggy> someone just doubled up everything
01:26 < bridge> <kebscs> There's one in gameclieny
01:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea I guess
01:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> remove world tuning is probably a good idea tho. i remember it being quite useless but i didn't dare to touch it back then
01:29 < bridge> <kebscs> It's values are copied over from gameclient and the fail safe is the only place it's used rn that's why I asked
01:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just double check on server i guess
02:44 < bridge> <patiga> @tsfreddie heyo can you help me out here? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blame/aecae3f7e51c0a44e45fa94d62bccf8bbfc155f2/src/game/server/player.cpp#L535
02:44 < bridge> <patiga> this flag appears to be 1<<2, but thats the same as the flag `PLAYERFLAG_CHATTING`(?)
02:46 < bridge> <patiga> and those flags are checked right after each other, maybe my ide is just broke? ^^
02:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/datasrc%2Fnetwork.py
02:54 < bridge> <patiga> is that an answer in some way? please elaborate
02:55 < bridge> <pioooooo> You can check this file, the flags belong to different fields
02:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ?
02:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1346300020604796949/image.png?ex=67c7af19&is=67c65d99&hm=0f166d658c1a62800c0de9cd75485cbac85b177ffe074de603757adf2f96ce41&
02:55 < bridge> <patiga> hrmpf my ide is broke I suppose :c
02:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1346300150968225936/image.png?ex=67c7af39&is=67c65db9&hm=51ed70ade7be59448eb24b7cadd79c54c001e87a94a0c028e6fe07732c198cc5&
02:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> or the generator broke
02:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> this is part of the code gen
02:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> are you sure your code gen ran properly
02:56 < bridge> <patiga> that wouldn't make much of a difference here
02:56 < bridge> <patiga> ig not :/
02:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> can you check src/game/generated/protocol.h
02:57 < bridge> <pioooooo> :nouis:
02:57 < bridge> <patiga> well the ide is kinda arguing with itself, saying "well this value doesn't exist" and "btw this value is 4" at the same time xd
02:57 < bridge> <patiga> will do
02:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> might just be you haven't ran the code gen since you pulled yet, since it only run on build, so it doesn't exist. ~~and your IDE is invaded by AI and hallucinated~~
02:59 < bridge> <patiga> huh I don't have that file
02:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then you haven't built yet
02:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just build it once
02:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think
03:00 < bridge> <patiga> wait I do have it, I didn't look in the build idr
03:00 < bridge> <patiga> *dir
03:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ah
03:00 < bridge> <patiga> its not in there tho
03:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 😬
03:00 < bridge> <patiga> I'll rebuild and check again
03:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> have you built
03:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> python error?
03:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe
03:01 < bridge> <patiga> *building*
03:02 < bridge> <patiga> got it 🎉
03:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
03:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what happened before then
03:02 < bridge> <patiga> weird, I thought I built the client just yesterday
03:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> weird
03:03 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe the we all had AI in us now and we hallucinated memory
03:04 < bridge> <patiga> maybe its also tired Patiga who's weird here :pepeW:
03:04 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :GreemDev:
03:05 < bridge> <zerolacqua> hey, i'm using vscode on ubuntu with cmake and the c++ extension to debug the map editor. i set some breakpoints, and when one got hit, the game froze. now i want to check the variable info in vscode, but my mouse is stuck too. anyone know how to fix this or any other ways to handle it?
03:06 < bridge> <patiga> @tsfreddie btw how severe is that CAM commit for input handling?
03:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wdym severe
03:06 < bridge> <patiga> like, in which cases does it handle input differently to before?
03:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the handling is unaffected.
03:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nothing changed client side afaik
03:06 < bridge> <patiga> but server side
03:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then ye, when you unpause it might take sometime for server to start processing input
03:07 < bridge> <patiga> like, I reimplemented your commit like 3 weeks ago (and did the flag correctly 🫨 )
03:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but if it start process early the input are wrong anyway
03:07 < bridge> <patiga> ah, so it should only affect the end of the pause, not the start of it?
03:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i can't remember
03:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe not?
03:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> backwards compat check is needed tho
03:09 < bridge> <patiga> alright, thx
03:09 < bridge> <patiga> I think I get it now
03:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> basically all you need to do is making sure viewpos doesn't update if the input type is cam and player input doesn't apply to character if the input type is not cam
03:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> and you need the version check to make sure cam and not cam state is correct and not just non-existence-defaults-to-not-cam
03:12 < bridge> <patiga> the client stops sending usual player input as soon as it hears from the srv that the pause has started (sending inputs which will not be processed immediately by the srv). the server now applies those inputs later, not as soon as the srv says the client is unpause, but when the client replied that too
03:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i didn't get it
03:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i thought client always send input
03:12 < bridge> <patiga> no, not during pause
03:12 < bridge> <patiga> not normal input at least
03:13 < bridge> <patiga> you cant hook for example
03:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> let me check
03:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> eitherway the change only tags what type of coordinate it is of the target
03:14 < bridge> <patiga> in the line I referenced it also stops input from being transfered from player to tee
03:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yes
03:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is possible that character ignored hook and fire input due to not expected coodinate type
03:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe movement should be passed anyway but idk about fire and hook
03:16 < bridge> <patiga> can I see somewhere on which server version this change started?
03:16 < bridge> <patiga> does the server have an incrementing number like the client maybe?
03:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> check the whole commit
03:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it is the standard version check we do
03:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wait no
03:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it didn't live in the same commit sorry
03:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> let me dig the pr
03:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wait it is the same commit. why can't i find it
03:18 < bridge> <patiga> I'm also confused rn, I swear I saw smth before
03:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i am confused too
03:19 < bridge> <patiga> but I suppose the clients that use it do this
03:19 < bridge> <patiga> > // force send spec cam flag on first tick to let server know that it is supported
03:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> no
03:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> heinrich vetod
03:19 < bridge> <patiga> ah
03:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i shouldn't be accepted if i didn't change it but i can't find the code where i did it
03:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it shouldn't be accepted if i didn't change it but i can't find the code where i did it
03:20 < bridge> <patiga> `VERSION_DDNET_PLAYERFLAG_SPEC_CAM = 18090,`
03:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh it is a separate commit
03:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think deen merged it before i could change it
03:20 < bridge> <patiga> but that is the client version, no?
03:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yes, you check whether client has that flag
03:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yes, you check whether client supports that flag
03:21 < bridge> <patiga> but wouldn't I need to check if the server has the flag?
03:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> client shouldn't care what it receives
03:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> server send character the client does the character
03:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it doesn't need to know about the coordinate type
03:21 < bridge> <patiga> but I'm reimplementing the physics server-side
03:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you check client version in server
03:22 < bridge> <patiga> did older clients also send that flag for some reason? I see some weird replay here where that flag is set the entire run o.o
03:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 3rd party client and bot
03:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> tater also had some non-standard scoreboard flag behavior
03:24 < bridge> <patiga> okay, so the version check it is 👍
03:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> also demo might be bugged, i should heck
03:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> also demo might be bugged, i should check
03:24 < bridge> <patiga> nah
03:24 < bridge> <patiga> shouldn't be, don't worry
03:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean even if it is bugged, check client doesn't really care about the flag
03:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean even if it is bugged, the client doesn't really care about the flag
03:24 < bridge> <patiga> wait but then I do need the server version, right?
03:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> no, you can send the flag to the server always
03:25 < bridge> <patiga> like I'm implementing physics in twgame to reproduce teehistorian files
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> old server doesn't use that bit
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so it'll just ignore it
03:25 < bridge> <patiga> yes and how do I detect old server?
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> idk
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we didn't feel the need to do that so we didn't check
03:25 < bridge> <patiga> fair
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> old server doesn't use that bit so sending that bit on and off make no difference in physics
03:25 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm pretty sure
03:27 < bridge> <TsPiggy> btw is someone doing input fingerprinting to check for invalid race
03:28 < bridge> <urg_> quick question whats the reason for taterclient being frowned upon? or looked at as bad
03:29 < bridge> <patiga> not that I know of
03:29 < bridge> <patiga> (answer to ts)

07:43 < bridge> <kiler94> What to do infinite loading of resources
07:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> why do you keep sending this everywhere
07:46 < bridge> <hectavoxel> do you have any like-   4k tee skins in your skin files?
07:47 < bridge> <kiler94> I don't know.
08:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use the vscode workspace in other/vscode (read the readme) and x11
08:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then it will unrelease mouse
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 is `rep movs` ok for copying structs or is it better to manually move each field in a register and move it into dest?
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 is `rep movsb` ok for copying structs or is it better to manually move each field in a register and move it into dest?
08:40 < bridge> <zerolacqua> thanks, that's exactly what I needed.
09:20 < bridge> <rainonwires> Hey, im hoping this is an appropriate channel to ask this; is there a nixos guide to building ddnet? i'm missing some packages & haven't found some of them lol
10:06 < furo> @rainonwires NixOS has a package for DDNet, so you can look at its dependencies. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-24.11/pkgs/games/ddnet/default.nix
10:06 < bridge> <rainonwires> Thanks
10:33 < bridge> <learath2> Why bother going field by field?
10:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe it's better, idk
10:35 < bridge> <learath2> I can't think of a reason. If you can't either I'd go with rep movsb
10:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Reminder that Nixos has an awesome feature called InputsFrom - which allows you to fetch dependencies, buildinputs etc from an existing package within a dev shell
10:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> Most dependencies are listed in the readme - the rest should be fetched using pkg-config and inputsFrom
10:40 < bridge> <rainonwires> i love nixos, but i haven't used it all for development and i haven't really branched outside of the configuration file, still trying to get my grasp on flakes lol
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> outputs = {
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ>     nixpkgs,
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ>     ...} : let
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ>     system = "x86_64-linux";
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ>     pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ>   in {

10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
10:40 < bridge> <rainonwires> so yeah, didnt know about that, appreciate it !
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> That is basically all you need ^^
10:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> And then ofc, gcc/clang
10:40 < bridge> <rainonwires> how does it work?
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's a nix dev shell within a flake.nix
10:41 < bridge> <rainonwires> a dev shell for ddnet?
10:41 < bridge> <rainonwires> nix-env?
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yep ^^
10:41 < bridge> <rainonwires> like nix-env?
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> No!
10:41 < bridge> <rainonwires> xD
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Go into your ddnet folder, create a file called flake.nic
10:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Go into your ddnet folder, create a file called flake.nix
10:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> Man phone hard - 1 sec I can't copy

10:47 < bridge> <rainonwires> what server is that if i may ask?
10:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> Eh I think that comes from the unofficial nixOS discord
10:47 < bridge> <rainonwires> okok  !
10:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Idk I dusted that off just now, been in my gallery for years :kekw:
10:48 < bridge> <rainonwires> ahahaha i see xD very useful to keep stuff like that
10:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> Alright I need to go - hope you figure it out :owo:
10:49 < bridge> <rainonwires> bye bye
11:59 < bridge> <rainonwires> Still messing with this on and off, im having some issues with the nix develop command working.
12:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> hmm
12:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> CHN servers other than 1 and 4 disappeared from master
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
13:05 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> :)
13:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> norming
13:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i do `nix develop path:./.dev` and put a `flake.nix` file into a `.dev` folder under the project directory. this way nix won't copy the entire project into store somewhere.
13:17 < bridge> <01000111g> akschually
13:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if you just use `nix develop ./.dev` the `.dev` directory need to be a git repository and commited with the flake.nix. i don't really like that way so `path:` is kinda needed.
13:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if you just use `nix develop ./.dev` the `.dev` directory need to be a git repository and commited with the flake.nix. i don't really like that way so `path:` is kinda needed for me
13:18 < bridge> <rainonwires> ahhh
13:19 < bridge> <rainonwires> mine tries to find the flake in /nix/store after i use the flake in the ddnet directory i setup
13:19 < bridge> <rainonwires> lol
13:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it might make sense to put flake under a project root if you somehow want to install the thing as a package i think? i don't really know.
13:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i just do the weird workaround with `.dev` folder
13:20 < bridge> <rainonwires> i just want to build the project, would like to work on some of the issue tickets on github
13:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> also check out `nix-direnv` once you figure out the develop thing. which basically does it for you when you cd into a directory.
13:20 < bridge> <rainonwires> ahh
13:20 < bridge> <rainonwires> i cant get it to find vulkan etc
13:20 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the same flake file will work with both nix-direnv and nix develop so you don't need to redo anything.
13:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> let me check my flake.nix for ddnet
13:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> one sec
13:21 < bridge> <rainonwires> my flake i run with nix develop doesnt work xD
13:21 < bridge> <rainonwires> i have to nix-collect-garbage to try again

13:52 < bridge> <murpi> Not something I'd able to fix
13:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sadge
13:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yes - either as a provided dev shell or when using `nix build`
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I would highly appreciate to get https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9787 and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9386 merged. Is there a way for me to speed up the process?
14:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the github influencer is influencing again
14:12 < bridge> <rainonwires> ahaha chiller is the reason i am trying to build ddnet
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Still broken?
14:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yep
14:31 < bridge> <learath2> Did you check whether they can ping the master? Might be a firewall incident
14:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't have access to those servers
14:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't host servers anymore
14:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 😬
14:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wait, my proxy basically died today too.
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon, ur prs touch sensitive code to physics or speedrunning so its normal its harder to get in
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> im unsure about how spawners affect speedrunners and if the way u made it works nice
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon i reviews ur interesct pr, looks gud but i wait for others
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> Be brave
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> I can't seem to connect to them hm
14:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ah
14:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> tomorrow is the congress meeting.
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Wait but the main server can connect to them
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @essigautomat https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9795#pullrequestreview-2657647218
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, let me tunnel through and see
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like this feature
14:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think we get bad internet around these time
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> well it looks ok to me but maybe heinrich wanted tot say smth
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but he seems not active
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> I seem to have broken something in my kernel :pepeW:
14:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i got this
14:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> *ahem*
14:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i'm thinking about adding a new cl option into ddnet
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u know if there has been a poll about slide tiles?
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like em but i want a poll
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @murpi can u poll this feature pls https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9795
15:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is this the average gentoo experience
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, haven't broken a kernel in years. It was just too large an update at once
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, no poll
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Feels more like a stopper than a slide somewhy 😄
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 go do it
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe it needs an animation or sth to look better
15:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> stopper 2.0: 360° version
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it pushes right
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe some air effect
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, it seems I forgot to rebuild my gfx driver
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> merging https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9763
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i changd the pr title
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz it doesnt add a t uning
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> "fix new speedtiles: add speeder limit "
15:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ✨
15:26 < bridge> <Assa> nice, missed this 👍
15:28 < bridge> <Assa> what? xD
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> You discussed a better visual in the meantime
15:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> cc @essigautomat @learath2 @jupeyy_keks @patiga i opened the first rfc in ddnet
15:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ryozuki fried chicken
15:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> yum
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i wanted to name it
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> deed, or tfc
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> deed = ddnet enhancement proposal
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ded?
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> like python pep
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> tee fc
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> these, I think these are cleaner for this tile, maybe even borderless
15:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet enhanced proposal
15:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> DEP
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> maybe, but id have to see how clean they'd look in-game
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh yeah idk why i added a d at end
15:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet enhanced epreposal n
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> There is no timelimit on this @hectavoxel , in the end we can do asset swaps later. The current ones look a bit like car bumpers xD
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> I'd propose a fadeout under the line showing which direction is "down"
15:37 < bridge> <Assa> I'd propose a fadeout under the line showing which direction is "down", or a 50% transperency line directly below
15:42 < bridge> <Assa> You can download the build-client and just asset swap. If you need any help just PM me 🙂
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> deen: ddnet entity enhancement nomination
15:43 < bridge> <Assa> @ryozuki any opinions about #9767 ? This is quality of life for me xD
15:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9767
15:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea fair
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> I still like the current ones, still better than the triangles
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> I like the current ones, still better than the triangles
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> finally a meaning for deen
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok to me, but idk some ppl around here dont like too many config options
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> heinrich isn't around, quick sneak in some customization
16:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> still getting pings about missing servers :pepeW:
16:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> @tsfreddie some chinese servers be missing yo
16:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 😬
16:01 < bridge> <Assa> please at least decouple cl_text_entities in ingame and editor :tear: as this is actually an issue
16:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks @ryozuki 
16:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki the spawner pr is now behaving like ddnet on run maps. The more controversial change is what I only proposed and did not do yet
16:04 < bridge> <Assa> I can also collabse all of this options to one with bit flags, but this is pretty unintuitive
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> oh, seems the chinese servers changed ip somewhy
16:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> huh?
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> actually
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> make sense
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> all missing servers are tencent servers
16:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'll check whether there's a announcement about that
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> I'll re-whitelist them all
16:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't see any announcement about it
16:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> weird that it would just do that
16:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'll ask every hosters to check their console
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> chn5 seems to be back after I whitelisted the new ip for it
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 are u a investor? do u know why some stocks allow trailing stops and others not?
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> how is status still showing the servers
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i invested in Rheinmetall and it allows that but others not
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is it a self report type of thing instead of an ip list?
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> war coming so atleast ill play the capitalist game a bit
16:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> noted
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/04/von-der-leyen-pitches-800bn-defence-package-ahead-of-eu-leaders-summit
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> It depends on the broker and the rules of the exchange. On DEGIRO it's allowed on Xetra and NDQ iirc
16:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what's the current ip for chn5
16:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> >war
16:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> is that a mf ddnet block reference?
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had stock on howmet aerospace (murica) and it netted me like 500 euro, but now its going down so i sold cuz murica is cooked
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> and now im into eu military
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye degiro
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> 1.13.79.127
16:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oooh, starting with 1, fancy
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> did you also change the dns for chn5.ddnet.org
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> idk who changed those, that's what is confusing to me 😄
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> @0xdeen did you?
16:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> what happened
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> idk someone fixed the dns entries but not the whitelist
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> arent 1. ips in china common
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz china numba one
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> or did deen redo the whitelist and somehow copied the wrong IPs :justatest:
16:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't see tencent server randomly changing ip being a thing
16:16 < bridge> <louis> stock markget gonna crash
16:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> we are so back.
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> thx
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> anyway, re-whitelisted them, they should be slowly coming back up
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> already did
16:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> how will this affect the trout population
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> I'll have to ask deen what happened there because the dns couldn't possibly fix itself if the servers just "changed ip"
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye
16:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> my bet is on the copy pasting error
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'm deeply invested in chinese tech companies, made like 30% profit
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i hope i can invest in something
16:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh my god the stock market really is crashing
16:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> thanks trump
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> all of which I lost on stupid nvidia stock tanking again
16:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i can't buy normal stock, i can only buy chinese stock which is just ran by satan.
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep i sold all my s&p500 and howmet
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> if nvidia doesn't recover I'll never be able to retire
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> im at 900 euro profit
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why the mac with us keyboard has no euro symbl
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> btw how do you do your taxes on capital gains?
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent done them yet, ill do it this year
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well its just the web
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> form
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> degiro has a thing to download a pdf with ur account statement and other stuff
16:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there shouldn't be any complicated about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9787 @ryozuki if you say there is and it will take a few months to get merged then i might just fix it downstream 
16:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i keept it as unintrusive as possible and provided clear videos of the tests
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> If I was smart I'd actually liquidate all these positions, the entire market is on the downswing, but I really don't want to bother with taxes 😄
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> I'm such a bad trader
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1346502915707113492/image.png?ex=67c86c0f&is=67c71a8f&hm=39617b2be5c2e268051832fbad5a19a8c826369f060a1850b0c2c6a53c3c40c0&
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do non residents get less taxes
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> Because they benefit less from govt services is the understanding iirc
16:22 < bridge> <totar> the weekly crypto charts are really funny "trump announces crypto reserves" 📈  "trump announces tariffs" 📉
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> I did liquify all my crypto positions like a week or two ago, saved me a lot of loss from the tariffs announcement
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to get more info on this, but do u need to bother on all sells or just tax the end result if u gained more than lost?
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but what u sell now u will put it on the tax form next year
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> total net capital gains
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> so why u not selling
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> Well I haven't sold any position this year, so my capital gains for this year is currently 0 😄
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> u wont have to bother till 2026 when u do the year 2025
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ig xd
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish all this was automated
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I should stop being silly ngl, I'll let it settle for a day or two then sell out of everything except nvidia which I feel would recover some day
16:26 < bridge> <learath2> well it can be "automated" you can just give your money to someone to manage for you, but they take a cut
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if u gain a lot and dont bother spending like 25 maybe smth like https://tax-wizard.eu works
16:26 < bridge> <learath2> and you need to have a lot of money 😄
16:27 < bridge> <totar> why is nvidia down? just cause?
16:27 < bridge> <learath2> I should also get into some eu military now that eu is thinking about re-arming
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> fuck knows, it's one I just don't understand the market on, maybe chatgpt 4.5 not delivering expected improvement?
16:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> consumer product releases
16:29 < bridge> <learath2> yeah the 5070 was shit too ngl
16:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> who cares about consumers, we need more AI servers
16:30 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I'll just quadruple down and get even more nvidia stock on the cheap, just gamble away what I earned from xiaomi
16:31 < bridge> <totar> I guess nvidia's current position hinges a lot on near term investments in AI which won't happen as much if the economy is doing bad in general. Just a guess
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> also tarifs
16:32 < bridge> <totar> yeah but the tarifs aren't targeted at them, so all else equal they shouldn't be falling more than others
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds sensible, with ai models proving not to scale that well with more gpu power it makes even less sense
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but tarifs affect base products
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> which they use right?
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> like the tariff may not be directly ur product but needed to build ur product
16:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> any gamepad remapping tools on linux?
16:34 < bridge> <upolla> Дарова
16:34 < bridge> <totar> does nvidia even do any manufactoring in the US?
16:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i tried steam input on a 3rd party game but the game won't recognize the steam input
16:34 < bridge> <totar> does nvidia even do any manufacturing in the US?
16:34 < bridge> <upolla> Как дела?
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam input
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam is best
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> put ur game as 3rd party
16:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> launch the steam big picture
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye already tried that
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the game just won't do anything with steam input
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> try again
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> reboot the pc
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sure
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :greenthing:
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean the game works without steam input, but my ab and xy are swapped
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot but maybe remap ur controll to xbox or smth
16:35 < bridge> <unkweal> Парни кто шарит как узнать через ркон через какой клиент человек играет?
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> depedns on game
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
16:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> with steam input the game just doesn't do anything when i press start

16:36 < bridge> <unkweal> Guys who knows how to find out through rcon through which client a person plays?
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant
16:36 < bridge> <unkweal> Only w mod?
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot but iirc u cant and its not reliable
16:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyone can fake a client name and version
16:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye we can't really tell
16:37 < bridge> <unkweal> sad
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> sp somoene used to play with version 9999
16:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> even dummies and player looks the same
16:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> holy, steam big picture ran at 3fps or something
16:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think it tried to run at 12k or something.
16:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> imma gamescope the mf
16:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> doesn't work, too laggy :justatest:
16:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok i gave up
16:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> steam deck time
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> Idea: color switch laser ans button by ID and indicate which button belongs to which id
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> opinions?
16:45 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know how much you can color the laser entities and also this feature is not possible on older clients, but it's backwards compat.
16:45 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know how much you can color the laser entities and also this feature is not possible on older clients, but it's backwards compat. since client only
16:46 < bridge> <kebscs> you can color it anything you want
16:46 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1346509079425843331/image.png?ex=67c871cd&is=67c7204d&hm=35f642c872479a2add53bcd1e4f1bcc06f0603786d2e28dd73dd83875db1f388&
16:46 < bridge> <kebscs> but thats the problem i guess that it already was any color
16:47 < bridge> <Assa> So I'd remove an existing feature :justatest:
16:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> I suggest implement a flagged image or smth
16:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You've perfected a design not when there's nothing to add, but when there's nothing to remove
16:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :greenthing:
16:49 < bridge> <pioooooo> Only show when some flags are on or off
16:49 < bridge> <pioooooo> Only shown when some flags are on or off
16:50 < bridge> <Assa> and we have a freezing laser which could collide in color 😦
16:51 < bridge> <Assa> I don't think this is perfect, but changing this would cause more issues
16:56 < bridge> <louis> can already do this in design
16:56 < bridge> <louis> idk how u could do it in entities, idk if its necessary
16:57 < bridge> <Assa> it's about the default [here](<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9767#discussion_r1979650240>), what is your opinion @louis.place ?
16:58 < bridge> <louis> default should show numbers, should it not xd
16:58 < bridge> <louis> entities is not really meant to be pretty, its supposed to be informative
16:59 < bridge> <Assa> So many players are playing with entities only and it tends to spam you with all shit of information. But okay, I'll turn it on by default
16:59 < bridge> <Assa> So many players are playing with entities only[zitation needed] and it tends to spam you with all shit of information. But okay, I'll turn it on by default
17:00 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place same for the speedtiles?
17:01 < bridge> <louis> they probably play with entities only because they can see and confirm speedup tiles, tele numbers etc.
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> switch numbers are useful info
17:02 < bridge> <louis> and having pretty design is secondary-i think its enough to judt give them the option to didable
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> just dont make it default off
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can off it urself
17:03 < bridge> <Assa> tune layer is fully missing btw, how am I supposed to debug my tune tiles outside of the editor? /s I may add this in a followup but disabled by default
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> wait until I tell the players that removing text overlays improves fps 😛
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> wait until I tell the players that removing text overlays improves fps :kek:
17:11 < bridge> <louis> why not make a vote to see if people would like to have new defaults or no
17:12 < bridge> <louis> also wasnt tunes always disabled
17:12 < bridge> <Assa> I think i am the only voice for turning stuff off by default so fair
17:12 < bridge> <Assa> I think i am the only voice for turning stuff off by default so far
17:12 < bridge> <Assa> tunes is _not implemented_
17:13 < bridge> <Assa> maybe it was at some point but removed
17:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> my laser colors :frozen: :frozen: :frozen: :frozen:
18:37 < bridge> <Assa> tested another design, this looks aweful tbh

18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeworlds existed before AABB kekw
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont quote me
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> im joking
18:51 < bridge> <Assa> PeterPleaseExplain
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> AABB = axis aligned bounding box
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> An axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is simply a rectangular parallelepiped whose faces are each perpendicular to one of the basis vectors. Such bounding boxes arise frequently in spatial subdivision problems, such as in ray tracing or collision detection.

18:52 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure that this was invented earlier
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh yea i was thinking of doing exactly that
18:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this portrays what it does so much better
18:53 < bridge> <Assa> you can probably do it 10 times faster then me, who did a python script in pillow for this ...
18:53 < bridge> <Assa> you can probably do it 10 times faster then me, who did a python script with pillow for this ...
18:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 😭
18:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i make all my shit in inkscapr
18:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> tile cloning came in clutch for stuff like this
19:11 < bridge> <Assa> I mean almost everything has an AABB in teeworlds. Can't think of anything which doesn't except projectils and the flag
19:12 < bridge> <Assa> I mean almost everything has an AABB in teeworlds. Can't think of anything which doesn't except projectiles and the flag
19:12 < bridge> <Assa> shields and hearts, probably, and players to each other 🤔 okay maybe some more
19:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> can we add an AABBCC in ddnet
19:40 < bridge> <kebscs> whats m_ReckoningCore in TickDeferred?
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> it used fake world so tuning in it was always wrong, but when its right its broken
19:42 < bridge> <kebscs> so i dont understand
19:55 < bridge> <zhn> here
19:55 < bridge> <zhn> and here
19:56 < bridge> <zhn> and this
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> The client and the server need to 100% do the dead reckoning in the exact same way for it to work properly
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> If you want to mess around with it, be careful, I had to make 5 oops commits to fix the last time I messed around with it
20:06 < bridge> <kebscs> well dont want to mess with it but idk if its right
20:08 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess il just reset tuning for it like it was before im too tired to understand it
20:13 < bridge> <kebscs> if i put hook_drag_speed 0 and dead reckoning matches real core it keeps teleporting back when hooking something
20:14 < bridge> <lamininbh> Can't connect to any server

20:16 < bridge> <lamininbh> im in ukraine
20:17 < bridge> <learath2> Here is how it works, the server reckons (makes a guess) as to where the character will be by simulating it in a fake world. If that reckoned core matches the real core emulated in the real gameworld the server won't send the core and the client will make the exact same simulation to derive the new core
20:17 < bridge> <learath2> So if reckoning is done in a fake world, where the tunes are wrong, nothing really happens, the actual non-reckoned core will just be sent for every snap
20:19 < bridge> <learath2> If you only fix one half of the wrong tune (e.g. on the server), now the server is not sending cores, the client makes the reckon, but the reckon is wrong since it uses the wrong tunes, so the client puts you in the wrong place, this goes on for a couple ticks (iirc a second or two max), then the server sends the actual core again, which snaps the client creating the teleporting effect
20:31 < bridge> <kebscs> so the server predicts hooking wrong to always send snaps?
20:33 < bridge> <kebscs> client knows i have dragspeed 0, but still drags me and only snaps back when received actual core
20:33 < bridge> <kebscs> even with cl_predict 0 it still drags me

20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning
20:40 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ngl dead reckoning sounds like a ubisoft game
20:44 < bridge> <alw5> no way
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The inventor was probably... Gutemberg on 1440. Or probably the Chinese inventor Bi Sheng around 1040.
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> ok ty i get it
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> the problem was the reckoned tick just doesnt detect that hook is pressed
20:49 < bridge> <kebscs> i think at least, otherwise no reason why it couldnt predict it
21:05 < bridge> <patiga> any input changes must be immediately sent by the server, as dead reckoning can only work with predict from past inputs
21:05 < bridge> <kebscs> well then idk 😂
21:05 < bridge> <kebscs> hook is landed and i didnt press anything
21:07 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1346574670467694804/hook.mp4?ex=67c8aee3&is=67c75d63&hm=b90bccb3e3289124de7ace48be802309f708e34bd71e461166271df766f4bcf9&
21:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Btw, a successful recon prevents data being sent so it kinda have to be teeworlds compatible (a.k.a. ALL CLIENTS compatible) so no one actually touched it I think.
21:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Maybe it is broken now, but a broken recon is still better than a successful recon that only work on one client
21:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Maybe someone sometime can get around making recons for every client versions.
21:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Actually if somehow we could move physics to twgame rust code we could also make multiple versions of compatible recons, saving so much bandwidth in the process. (assuming twgame has one to one physics to every version existed which may or may not be true courtesy the continuous hard work of patiga)
21:17 < bridge> <kebscs> i think that part of code is compatible with all versions
21:17 < bridge> <kebscs> just tuning broke it
21:19 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye, because no one dared to touch it while implementing new features I think. Just be sure to go back to test teeworlds if you really want to fix it? I don't really know what's the right way to touch it either
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> i wont be fixing it since idk why client predicts it wrong
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> when it has the correct tune
21:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It is possible that we straight up have deviations from og teeworlds physics from some point
21:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wait I think I read that wrong
21:23 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ehh, idk
21:24 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I can't tell what's happening in the video tbh
21:25 < bridge> <kebscs> i have hook strength 0, so when i hook the wall i should stay in place
21:25 < bridge> <kebscs> but it drags me and teleports me back sometimes or when i release hook
21:25 < bridge> <kebscs> that happens if reckoning core has correct tunes
21:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I see
21:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :GreemDev: no ida
21:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :GreemDev: no idea
21:33 < bridge> <kebscs> server predicts it right so it doesnt update the snap constantly
21:33 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why client doesnt
21:41 < bridge> <learath2> It's not intentional. Just that the mis-reckoning (notice I don't use the word prediction) does not cause an issue because the recknoned core wont match the real core, so the server will fallback to just sending it
21:44 < bridge> <learath2> because the same reckoning on the client is also using the wrong tunes
21:45 < bridge> <learath2> the only way that can be fixed is if the client and the server agree on a "character core version", so they both use the correct rules
21:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> @learath2 did you see my DM
21:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis:
21:45 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, let me check
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> I see you want to use the slide tiles xD
22:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ah yes a good idea
22:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> proprietary translator inside of ddnet :troll:
22:48 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i mean it is a good idea
22:48 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it is, but i dont know any FOSS translators, nor if ddnet can even handle it
22:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> whats a FOSS translaytor?
22:49 < bridge> <Assa> Free open source sexy
22:50 < bridge> <teero777> *software
22:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> software ❌ 
22:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> sexy ✅ 
22:50 < bridge> <hectavoxel> (32k likes on youtube shorts)
22:51 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> found one already https://libretranslate.com/
22:52 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> just from looking up free open sourse translater on google
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://portal.libretranslate.com/
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not so free
22:52 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh it said it was
22:52 < bridge> <Assa> technically you could also download deepseek and integrate it .... but yeah that's probably all overkill
22:52 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> true
22:53 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> thats if you want them to run it themselfs
22:53 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> not you running it
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only realistic thing we could do is add an API.
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and users could load some translation modules like google translate or a AI model and have to setup it manually
22:53 < bridge> <Assa> "just enter you openai api key into your ddnet client"
22:53 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> good idea tbh
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have 10x rtx 5090 for us to run it?
22:54 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> no i have a Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 though
22:54 < bridge> <teero777> nice
22:55 < bridge> <teero777> Now you can run 1/year
22:55 < bridge> <Assa> just use it on  cpu  :kek:
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even teero laughs at you
22:55 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> (yes its integrated)
22:55 < bridge> <teero777> UHD for ultra-high-definition?
22:56 < bridge> <rainonwires> new to ddnet stuff, ... rcon is admin? how do admin commands work ? :)
22:56 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> idk
22:56 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> probs
22:56 < bridge> <Assa> you type in the command and it executes
22:56 < bridge> <rainonwires> real
22:56 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this worked btw, heinrich is alive now
22:56 < bridge> <teero777> rcon stands for remote-connection. So basically yes, it's admin rights.
22:56 < bridge> <rainonwires> but uh,,, how does one get to that step im so sleep deprived
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> remote console
22:57 < bridge> <teero777> No wya
22:57 < bridge> <teero777> I have been lied to
22:57 < bridge> <teero777> My entire life
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chatgpt, why did you do this to teero
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> does the output go to the server console or the game console? xd
22:58 < bridge> <Assa> both
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> If you start a local server without any config changes a password will be printed to the console
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> hmmm...
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> right, i set the rcon password
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> i can auth myself just no commands like ban, bans etc work
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> or at least im too stupid to work them
22:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> do you need the list of commands?
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> i have the list of commands
22:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ok cool
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> yes
22:58 < bridge> <rainonwires> give me a moment
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> https://ddnet.org/settingscommands
22:59 < bridge> <Assa> I mean you could paste the list into chatgpt and ask it how commands work, but I am sure the tooltip is good enough?
22:59 < bridge> <rainonwires> i think i may have messed up the building process somehow and maybe messed it up somehow? lol
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks remote console is just weird to say. fk u
23:00 < bridge> <rainonwires> okay so rcon reload works uhhh but bans yields nothing i think i am just missing something in the open
23:00 < bridge> <rainonwires> sorry 😅
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> f1 console = local console
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> f2 console = remote console
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> oh...
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> i was using f1
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> gg xD
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> i truly am blind
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> gg
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> i think its time for a nap ;)
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> gn :v
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wasnt even talking to you but gg 😬
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gn8
23:01 < bridge> <rainonwires> lol
23:02 < bridge> <rainonwires> either way helped me out ^^
23:50 < bridge> <rainonwires> 😬
23:50 < bridge> <rainonwires> hopefully im coherent enough to have done that correctly..
