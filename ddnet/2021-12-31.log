07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> Koule 3 is 2p map
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> ddrace_loop is 3p map
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> https://ddnet.tw/maps/Steff-32-III-32-peace/
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> should this map be counted as 3man,only the first part drag part requires a 3rd person,rest can be done as 2p.map still has 2p teamrank finishes
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> 
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> https://ddnet.tw/maps/NUT-95-hardcore-95-bestof/
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> on the map it says 4tees required but we finished from start to finish as a 3p team and the teamrank was deleted
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> 
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> https://ddnet.tw/maps/NUT-95-hardcore-95-race6/
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> on the map it says 3tees required but you can go from start to finish in a 2p team,map still has 2p teamrank finishes
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> posted these maps seperately in #general  but could get lost in the chat so I put them together here
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> First one is done, second and third are in discussion
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> https://ddnet.tw/maps/Koule-32-4/
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> @Brokecdx- this map can also be done from start to finish as 2p right?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Ofc
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> That setting should be a mappers choice no where is my rank
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> And only applying to new maps if so
18:24 < ***> Buffer Playback...
18:24 <+bridge> [12:50:07] [ddnet] <n000b> No, then nobody understands why you can get 2p teamranks on 1 map and not on the other
18:24 <+bridge> [12:51:30] [ddnet] <n000b> It is sad for the people who speedrun those maps, but it is a good change and i agree this should be for all maps
18:24 <+bridge> [12:52:41] [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Or just basically losing time spent for some ranks even if legit eg.: koule 4 due to bad mapping
18:24 <+bridge> [12:56:11] [ddnet] <n000b> Well there are a few questionable maps where they will put some extra attention on
18:24 <+bridge> [12:56:36] [ddnet] <n000b> And teeworlds is lost time anyways lol
18:24 <+bridge> [13:00:18] [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: who is hosting eastbit.net? i get some ssl warnings there
18:24 <+bridge> [13:00:39] [ddnet] <Learath2> probably eastbyte ðŸ˜„
18:24 <+bridge> [13:00:48] [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that east?
18:24 <+bridge> [13:00:58] [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i only know east no eastbyte
18:24 <+bridge> [13:02:07] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, east
18:24 <+bridge> [13:02:13] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @eastbit
18:24 <+bridge> [16:31:30] [ddnet] <Robyt3> @deen Do you mean you don't want to fix the issues with external pnglite? I removed the pnglite commit from the PR for now.
18:24 <+bridge> [16:31:52] [ddnet] <Robyt3> I don't think upstream https://github.com/dankar/pnglite will receive updates again
18:24 <+bridge> [18:02:05] [ddnet] <louis> why is transferring files from a phone to a pc so hard
18:24 <+bridge> [18:05:34] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because you use windows
18:24 <+bridge> [18:05:54] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
18:24 <+bridge> [18:06:01] [ddnet] <louis> im sure linux is 20000x harder
18:24 <+bridge> [18:06:36] [ddnet] <louis> "oops u dont have the software to use a single usb port pls go terminal and do `sudo apt-get install grep git bash 2000 usb-port -j -p -x`
18:24 <+bridge> [18:09:09] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
18:24 <+bridge> [18:09:13] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works out of the box for me
18:24 <+bridge> [18:12:44] [ddnet] <louis> :greenthing:
18:24 <+bridge> [18:12:49] [ddnet] <louis> not in my experience
18:24 <+bridge> [18:13:07] [ddnet] <louis> well i used some less popular distros
18:24 <+bridge> [18:13:10] [ddnet] <louis> might be why
18:24 <+bridge> [18:13:31] [ddnet] <deen> the problem is that debian/ubuntu/fedora will ship their own pnglite. So if we fix something in our own distribution, we won't notice it breaking in theirs
18:24 <+bridge> [18:14:13] [ddnet] <deen> we had a bug because of this with our json lib already
18:24 < ***> Playback Complete.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I see, so we'll just have to move away from pnglite
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have a change for that, do you want to revive it and make sure we have a warning for files not supported by pnglite (for backwards compat.)?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3407
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I might take a look after I fix all the datafiles bugs
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that was the only part missing
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Otherwise it seemed to work
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ISAAC ãƒ„> L- Louis... Is that you???

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i was never dead, the element browser app for some reason saved my security keys as password, so i lost the password xdBut yeah pretty inactive lately
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Ryozuki)
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> come back to discord :D
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am pretty happy with all these bridges from matrix, they have telegram bridges too, so i have all chat in one place
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need a bridge to #bugs
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # bugs
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet 90% of the bugs are broken drivers xd
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 10% SDL bugs xd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only OS without SDL bugs is KDE/kwin\_x11 no joke
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never had any weird black screen when alt tab, or mouse goes out of window, or anything
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> therefore KDE has trillion other bugs xd
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have any bugs with arch i3
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but heinrich had one
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with the mouse update, that isnt in anymore
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just use google drive
