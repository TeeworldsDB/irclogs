01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> yeah if they're saved to different files, then you could just merge them manually with a python script `set(server1Banlist.readlines() + server2Banlist.readline())`
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @deen any plans to keep the current site theme as a third option after Halloween? i really like the contrast :feelsamazingman:
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the current site theme is the dark theme
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm im not sure what you mean, the link colors changed
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye cuz i changed the old theme
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no new theme
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u probs never knew about the dark theme before right
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it always existed
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess not? I thought the halloween theme was just adapted as the "dark theme"
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the dark theme was originally made for halloween years back too
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just keep it cuz its a cool dark theme
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, im happy with this so im fine to not have the lower contrast "halloween" theme
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :DF
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it lacked lot of contrast
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :D
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> looks great
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> does the color match the brand orange? cant tell
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the logo orange
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> okay cool
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry web dev term
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im also a web dev lol
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "the atc cta is not flush with the bottom of the fold"
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill start talking like that xD
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> atc = add to cart
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cta = call to action (dumb way to say button)
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this looks more specific things to u than in general xd
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> fold = visible area without scrolling
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i mean maybe it's more specific to e-commerse.
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i mean maybe it's more specific to e-commerce.
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the way i remember this one is like a newspaper, without opening it, you can only see the front "fold"
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> After Halloween we just switch the default back from dark to bright theme, but anyone that explicitly set the theme by using the "Switch Theme" button will stay on their choice
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ðŸ‘»
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> ðŸ¤–
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> There is some script to recompute points right? I migrated all my .dtb files to the new sqlite (poggers) and now it would be nice to add the points after the fact.
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for ddnet we do it with scripts/ranks.py
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that also generates the ranks websites
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> whats this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/recalculate-points.py
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah its all mysql connect scripts
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, it's called recalculate, but it just reads the values calculated by ranks.py and fills the db with them
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok so i gotta get ranks.py running
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lemme see what i have to edit
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I wish i could pr against scripts did i mention this already? \:D
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon>   with Cache('/home/teeworlds/servers/players-cache', eviction_policy='none', sqlite_auto_vacuum=0, sqlite_journal_mode='off') as cache:
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```for example using a relative home path would be a start to not force using the username "teeworlds"
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think you want to get it running
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it does so many things
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> better code your own points recalculation
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> creating a bit of html shouldnt be so bad right?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So what do you suggest? Rewriting my own script to recalculate points? \:c
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oky
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks \:)
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, this crash is so bizarre
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_pGameWorld seems to have ended up null in the entity, however that should never really be possible
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if this is somehow a stale entity wrongly considered a CCharacter due to ub
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, asan didn't catch anything weird
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that excludes most of the error sources I would have expected
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Okay that script seems to work fine \:) 
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/kQ
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can/should i pr that against some ddnet repo?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Can not only be useful for .dtb migrators but also for users that run the new sqlite servers for a while before inserting the map records that define the points
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is insane is pEnt can't possibly be null, which means the entity is still inserted in the gameworld, but such an entity cant possibly have a null gameworld pointer, but it does
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems the entire character object we are ticking for is nulled for some reason
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one could certainly test valgrind locally, which might find uninitialized values
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Else its probs a critical section issue or a logic error
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [Zwelf](https://matrix.to/#/@zwelf:matrix.org)\: Am i allowed to touch the ddnet-server.sqlite file? I replaced it with a new version but points where not picked up until i restarted the server. Are points chached or was it an issue with me replacing the file?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> the file is only opened once when starting the server and kept open as long as the server is open. The server is still using the file from the startup, even if you removed/moved it if I understand the linux file systems correctly
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> if you are touching it with the sqlite executeable, you are fine (or the sqlite python library)
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> so just replacing it while the server is running doesn't work
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh okay so that was the issue then nice. But when two servers write via sql connection it syncs live. Ye linux somehow keeps some zombie files \:D
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But yea good to know one shoud not replace the dtb file

19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hi! my friend have some problem: when he set cl_refresh_rate 0 it's ~4k fps
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but when he sets 2000, he have ~1000 fps
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hi! my friend have some problem: when he set cl_refresh_rate 0 it's ~4k fps
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but when he sets 2000, he have ~1000 fps
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> how to explain that?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_refresh_rate at 0?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i'll ask
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> yep
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> it's 0
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> exactly, it was 1500, but he set 0 and it's the same
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> graphics thread might have to sometimes wait for cpu thread, so it's not that unexpected
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> he says when he set cl_refresh_rate to 1000 it's like V-Sync is on

20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is it arm-only though? x86(-64) is usually the odd one out, IBM's Power CPUs have a similar memory model to ARM
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> Is there a way to go past the zoom out level in the editor?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think so
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> :feelsbadman:
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could make it respect the cl_limit_max_zoom_level
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> would be nice
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> i cant select the whole map at this zoom rate
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> and i cant move my mouse while selecting
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> lol why tho
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> further encourages repo maintainers to just close everything now smh
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> further encourages repo maintainers to just close everything prematurely now smh
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen concern about zooming in editor: it'll enable people to crash their client by zooming out too far or too fast. I guess you considered that?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean they have to change config for that
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah right
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, I think I'm out of ideas for this crash
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just dont see it happening ever, let alone frequently :/
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2\: do you now the commit before these crashes happened?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been digging into the coredump
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it makes no sense to me
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i remember the bug i introduced once
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and from there i read all commits
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most suspecious are the ones i dont fully understand, the removale of volatile and the teehistorian stuff
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> The rest looks pretty harmless, tho i only read the history of the src/game/server history
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The volatile removal should change nothing where a single thread is involved
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats what i wasnt sure about, if something like the database is async somewhere and writes to the log
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that is unless ub is involved actually
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i also didnt find anything
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was antibot updated?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember some ubsan warnings about ccharacter alignment
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alignment or about using it  even tho the destructor was called
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think we got the API change in
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if it has sth to do with the virtual destructor
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its bcs of the order how destructors are called
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it uses a character feature in the destructor call of ientity (in the world call) but at this point its not a character object anymore
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast the character part could be considered destructed  already

21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is also the last issue of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3050
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and the fix is rather hard
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried it, but it relys on so many things, kinda annoying design
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (ok in this case its the prediction code, but i think its pretty similar to the server code) cant remember if that was fixed in the server code or even happened
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, thats clientside
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> did the server bug always happen on the same line (Collision()->IsSwitch)? Found that a bit strange since there are many other calls to GameContext/Collision before this one
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> but dont'
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> but don't really know how to debug these kind of things
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entity.cpp#L28
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> server uses similar code tho
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i doubt that this causes the bug
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but if this was smth different can you post the bt? or add it in the issue
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sad that the thread sanitizer is so hard to use \:D
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh nice with  TSAN\_OPTIONS="ignore\_noninstrumented\_modules=1" it works quite well nowadays
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no idea how much it disables, but i tested it on a small program with a datarace and it detected it \:D
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> possibly the volatile buffer or smth, so maybe safe under x86 but not all hardware, but didnt dig deeper into it
