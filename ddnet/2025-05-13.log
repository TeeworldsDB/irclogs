13:11 < bridge> <sans._.> I recently switched to linux and I noticed in game that my mouse is noticeably laggy(er) than on windows, I tried changing through all renderers and it didn't fix it, anyone know what's going on?
13:12 < bridge> <sans._.> It feels like I have vsync on even though its off

13:41 < bridge> <sans._.> yeah
13:41 < bridge> <sans._.> just game
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats ur cl_refresh_rate
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and gfx_refresh_rate
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw ur display doesnt have display port?
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can reach higher hz :D
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> 0 for both
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> it does
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> i just dont have a cable
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> get a cable asap
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> nah, not worth
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> how many hz is ur display
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> it cant pull more than 75hz anyway
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm okay
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho for me dp tends to break less
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats ur renderer

13:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> so ur using amdgpu which is nice
13:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk rly why u feel that :/
13:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks maybe u know
13:45 < bridge> <sans._.> even in menus the mouse feels laggy
13:45 < bridge> <sans._.> its extremely subtle but noticeable
13:45 < bridge> <sans._.> its extremely subtle but still noticeable
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess vsync is off in game
13:46 < bridge> <sans._.> yeah
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> the desktop thing can force vsync btw
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> picom for example forces vsync if not turned off manually
13:46 < bridge> <sans._.> desktop thing?/
13:46 < bridge> <sans._.> desktop thing?\
13:46 < bridge> <sans._.> desktop thing?
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> picom for example forces vsync if not configured to be turned off
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> idk what xubuntu uses
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> wait
13:47 < bridge> <sans._.> DE?
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> y
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> picom is a compositor
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> what compositor does xfce use
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> teerom means the compositor
13:47 < bridge> <teero777> ik
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it uses xfwm
13:48 < bridge> <teero777> > Turning off the compositor: Go to settings->window manager tweaks->compositor and uncheck "enable display compositing".

13:48 < bridge> <sans._.> that uhh
13:48 < bridge> <sans._.> breaks my desktop
13:48 < bridge> <sans._.> xd
13:48 < bridge> <teero777> uh what
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:49 < bridge> <sans._.> Before

13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> disable vsync
13:49 < bridge> <sans._.> where bg
13:49 < bridge> <sans._.> xd
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> yea uh
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> well compositor manages the bg iguess xd
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> enable it back
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there some vsync option?
13:49 < bridge> <teero777> are there more options?
13:50 < bridge> <sans._.> nop
13:50 < bridge> <teero777> send screenshot of settings xd

13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> :D
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> :d
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would change compositor xd
13:51 < bridge> <sans._.> :heh: I tried to replace thunar with nemo and that broke my system, u sure I should try that
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is why i love gentoo
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> its way easier
13:51 < bridge> <teero777> XYDDD
13:52 < bridge> <teero777> have you tried the different fullscreen modes ingame?
13:52 < bridge> <sans._.> ngl now Im sort of regretting the xfce choice
13:52 < bridge> <teero777> the compositor might turn off vsync if it sees the correct window mode or smth xd
13:53 < bridge> <sans._.> yeah
13:53 < bridge> <sans._.> still no luck
13:55 < bridge> <sans._.> btw just to test it i did try turning it off
13:55 < bridge> <sans._.> works nicely
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> i mean you could disable the compositor and use nitrogen for the bg
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> xd
13:55 < bridge> <sans._.> but i'd like my desktop back :/
13:55 < bridge> <sans._.> nitrogen?
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> google
13:55 < bridge> <teero777> or use variety directly
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> it has nice things
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> like fetching wallpapers over api and stuff
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> very good program
13:56 < bridge> <sans._.> hmm
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> or use `variety`
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> as for compositing you can install picom but it's kind of heavy ngl
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I know that all window managers that aren't kde are always a bug festival and thus i never recommend them :deen_star:
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use picom
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i3
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> no problems xd
14:23 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Does anyone know why we don't use size in protocol structures to painlessly change them rather than create new ones?
14:23 < bridge> <0xfaulty> for example it would be nice to add int m_Flags to CNetObj_Pickup or CNetObj_DDNetPickup so that the server could explicitly tell the client whether to predict this entity or not, but now it is impossible to do it without creating a new protocol object?
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I3 is defs too buggy for me xd
14:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Picom never used
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> how so lol
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Always some annoying mouse capturing problem
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have that
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:26 < bridge> <sans._.> I tried kde though
14:26 < bridge> <sans._.> it sucks
14:26 < bridge> <sans._.> (the customizing part of it )
14:26 < bridge> <learath2> Ditto for bspwm. Never had an issue
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think u could add a new field
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> Are you on arch? Did you try actual sdl2 instead of sdl2-compat?
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Too much customizations or what
14:27 < bridge> <sans._.> i cant install a theme without being bombarded by errors
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'm on Debian and that was few months ago
14:28 < bridge> <learath2> It's just a design decision made early on, matricks probably never even considered extensions
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There was no sdl2 compat
14:28 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, then idk. I only remember a couple people having issues with sdl3 pretending to be sdl2
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh k
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> im not kidding
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> fresh install
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> errors when installing a theme
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> whadafaq D:
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes kde6 is still new. Maybe some themes got incompatible
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> oh well
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I use the manjaro theme xd
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> oobe was really nice though
14:30 < bridge> <sans._.> looked clean
14:30 < bridge> <sans._.> and the task bar (or whatever its called in linux terms) was very windows-like and easy for me to adapt to
14:30 < bridge> <learath2> Actually dynamically sized netobjs do have their sizes at the start iirc. So there is at least that
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah heard that quite a few times already from arch users
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hope i never get sdl2 compat xdd
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> I just don't understand why arch would replace a library that is still getting updates with a compat layer
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah xd
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> At least provide both as an alternative
14:35 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Maybe you remember an example? I haven't found any structures in the protocol.h that look like dynamically resizable
14:35 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Maybe you remember an example? I haven't found any CNetObj structures in the protocol.h that look like dynamically resizable
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> i used bspwm for quite a while but in the end i liked the configuration system of i3 more. also multi-monitor setups are a pain on bspwm
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> I would use i3 but I just love how simple bspwm is, especially sxhkd
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> i like that i3 does keybinds in itself and doesn't use a 3rd party like sxhkr
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> i like that i3 does keybinds in itself and doesn't use a 3rd party like sxhkd
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> Let's see if I can find it on phone
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> its more comfortable to have everything in 1 config file
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> its more comfortable to have everything in 1 config file for me
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> For a while I used sxhkd with i3 😄 I kinda just love how bspwm embraces the unix philosophy. Does one thing, does it well
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> The only thing I used to miss from i3 was the stacked layout
14:40 < bridge> <0xfaulty> if needed, as it generated file
14:40 < bridge> <0xfaulty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1371829340916158484/protocol.h?ex=68248f22&is=68233da2&hm=caababa4b0344c22b92fd97280013db5969191bc1d0ed028714aa6143d159e76&
14:40 < bridge> <learath2> Btw, I don't know if any of the original objects are dynamically sized, their sizes are statically known
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> But all our extended netobjs should be dynamically sized since vanilla clients can handle and skip them just fine
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> look like it because of size in CSnapItem
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```c++
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     class CSnapItem
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     {
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     public:
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         int m_Type;
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         int m_Id;
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         const void *m_pData;
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>         int m_DataSize;
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     };
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> So vanilla client just do 
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```c++
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty>     CNetObj_Pickup *pPickup = (CNetObj_Pickup *)pData;
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> ```
14:45 < bridge> <0xfaulty> and read less then whole snap item size
14:53 < bridge> <0xfaulty> I'm not rlly sure, on server side looks easier, but it's a bit difficult for me how it processed on client side, bcs it split snap data to data and CNetObj_EntityEx maybe there are some difficult to map it directly
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> That DataSize is iirc only ever used for dynamically sized objects. Give me a couple minutes, ordered my coffee, will dig around a bit
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src%2Fengine%2Fshared%2Fsnapshot.cpp#L568
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Check this out and `CSnapshot::SetStaticsize`
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src%2Fengine%2Fshared%2Fsnapshot.cpp#L568
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> 
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Check this out and `CSnapshotDelta::SetStaticsize`
15:06 < bridge> <0xfaulty> so it takes constant size from defined structure in protocol, so if I add new field to any structure but keep current Type id it became broken with old server, as I'm understand
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Only servers send snaps, so "broken with old server" doesn't make much sense
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> If you add a field to a static sized netobj, it'll break old clients
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> All our extended netobjs are dynamically sized, so adding a new field to those don't break anything, but old clients will just ignore your new field. And you can only add a field to the end
15:09 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Hm, I'll check it, thank you

15:18 < bridge> <0xfaulty> wow, I just found that kebs already added flags to DDNetPickup in his, PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10098
15:18 < bridge> <0xfaulty> so I should wait until it will be merged in order to add more flags
15:26 < bridge> <0xfaulty> @kebscs btw, why rotation to just 4 direction instead of angle?
15:26 < bridge> <hectavoxel> or reddit
15:26 < bridge> <hectavoxel> same quality of jokes
15:27 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs its how tiles work
15:28 < bridge> <0xfaulty> you prevent mods to rotate it each tick to some angle xd
15:29 < bridge> <0xfaulty> and play "you spin me right round" with map sound
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> weapons are just game tiles
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont want to overcomplicate the code
15:44 < bridge> <0xfaulty> yes, it's true, but you anyway applied QuadsSetRotation, that it's more about flexibility, but I think that if you did that it might not be liked by maintainers because it's not used in pure ddnet = it doesn't need to be added, so yes, minimum changes are easier in this case 🙂

17:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> also I might try bspwm now
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> It is very barebones. It'll do exactly one thing for you, manage windows
17:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah as it should be
17:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i like sxhkd already too
17:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (you can still install sdl2 onarch)
17:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (grr arch )
17:59 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i dont even know how but the SDL stuff has broken stuff down the dep chain where now adwaita is broken and some things dont even open XD

19:46 < bridge> <teero777> which side looks better?
19:46 < bridge> <always> teero cutie
19:46 < bridge> <always> why do i tell no diffrence
19:46 < bridge> <always> except with the tp
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> the zoom is different

19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant compare texture filtering and whatnot
19:47 < bridge> <teero777> yes ik xd i dont have the same zoom levels
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds like something I'd say. I like this guy already
19:48 < bridge> <teero777> okey here is better zoom xd

19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> why does it say it as if Vec<T> does have stuff like locks
19:49 < bridge> <learath2> Gpu vendors often provide symbols for their drivers btw. It can help debug these kinds of things sometimes
19:50 < bridge> <teero777> ah yea no. i just get thrown out of xorg no qestions asked
19:50 < bridge> <teero777> idk how i'd debug that xD
19:50 < bridge> <teero777> it happens when you segfault at the wrong address
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> like passing a nullptr where vulkan expects smth
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, if it's actually segfaulting you should get a dump
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> haven't checked. but i already fixed the issue, its fine
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> Validation layers are also extremely useful for stuff like this
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks It works (with various issues). WIP branch at https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/Emscripten-Main-Loop with these main changes:
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Switch to main loop based rendering instead of blocking in main function.
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Increase stack size to 1 MiB. It was only 64 KiB by default which is way too low and caused random stack overflows.
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Disable networking, HTTP and waiting for threads.
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Other issues apart from the stuff that needed to be disabled:
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Loading screen doesn't work, need to wait for a few seconds until the client launched.
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Console rendering doesn't work and opening the console breaks rendering until restarting client.
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> - Graphics settings show renderer as `custom (Vulkan 3.0.0)`.
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> - Warnings about incorrect GL shader usage are shown in console on launch, e.g. `glUniform1f called with a nonexisting location ID -1!`.
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1371909319003603187/image.png?ex=6824d99e&is=6823881e&hm=4de3f4273cfaa65d7cd44051fd0b1c241b1f6db7a8a27a66da5c3b03cf89298d&
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> Can't believe you actually spent the time to fix the emscripten build that is not even used anymore 😛
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAICT the main loop based rendering is also required if we ever want an iOS port
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> Could be, I remember having issues with that even on macOS
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That means its bound to sdl events?
20:34 < bridge> <robyt3> To the browsers's render loop I guess
20:34 < bridge> <robyt3> To the browser's render loop I guess
20:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am surprised it works worse than earlier emscrippten versions tho
20:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The old version has no bugs xD
20:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not sure if the main loop was really necessary though if it worked before. The main problem was just the stack size being too small now. Maybe Emscripten also broke something though, the guides also suggest reverting to a different version at some point.
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I think console rendering also changed a lot from the old version though, so maybe that broke something with the WebGL rendering
20:45 < bridge> <Assa> I honestly don't see any difference
20:46 < bridge> <teero777> well exactly thats the point xd
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> is your rendering more performant and more performant than ddnet-rs?
20:46 < bridge> <teero777> i don't know
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> or twgpu xD
20:46 < bridge> <teero777> but it works. vulkan is an achievement for me
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> 👍
20:47 < bridge> <Assa> I also build a custom pipeline in vulkan once, but it was like 2000 lines for the serpinsky triangle
20:47 < bridge> <Assa> could do the same thing in python in < 100 xD
20:54 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> why is opening the emote wheel disabled if spectating? is there a specific reason or just cause?
20:55 < bridge> <teero777> are you emoting while spectating?
20:55 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> sometimes yes
20:55 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> just because im spectating doesnt mean my camera isnt close to myself
21:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same problem with bindwheel for tclient, i use it for drawing so its a bit annoying that i cant open it (bindwheel is emote wheel copied)
21:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think its a bit weird if you can open emote wheel outside of when youre inside your body (you could be spccing someone else), but it would be useful
21:05 < bridge> <teero777> he baited you into answering. he knew it
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i also have shift bound to the spec ui which i do use
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> 1line change no?
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i also have the same bind to the spec ui which i do use
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 3 line removal
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 5 line removal
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(m_pClient->m_Snap.m_SpecInfo.m_Active)
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     {
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         m_Active = false;
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         m_WasActive = false;
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     }
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> now i just need to do skin rendering and animation
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wa
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> horrifying stuff
22:01 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> did you change the bindwheel recently? When i copied ur stuff over to my side [this](https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1371926681308102746) was not there
22:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah i removed it
22:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bindwheel can be used anywhere now
22:02 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> No, i mean did you add that somewhere in the last few months? I never had this Issue
22:02 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i find it odd that you guys have it on tclient meanwhile i dont but i literally copied everything
22:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe u changed it when u copied it
22:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> btw it now animates :D
22:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> along with the emote wheel
22:09 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> thats awesome i actually like the way it looks:bb_thumbs_up:
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> YES
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CONFIRMATION BIAS, THE ANIMATION EVERYONE LOEVS
22:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> WOOOHO
22:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the emote wheel has also been modified
22:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for this
22:30 < bridge> <broso56> the animation looks clean but i kinda hate it since i only extremely briefly open up emote wheel
22:30 < bridge> <broso56> the animation looks clean but i kinda hate it since i only extremely briefly open up emote wheel most times
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but if its briefly it doesnt even show
22:37 < bridge> <broso56> feels weird with it not showing personally lol
22:37 < bridge> <broso56> but i also see its configurable so thats nice
22:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ah wait is there easing with an animation for emote wheel now
22:42 < bridge> <broso56> tclient
22:42 < bridge> <broso56> i think
22:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> aww :(
22:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> seems useful for ddnet though
22:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a customization that quite a few people dislike
22:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i highly doubt it will be adfded
22:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hmm but if you can design it with very low ms
22:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think it would look nice
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> u can already change the animation time
22:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> eh? I'm stupid?

22:51 < bridge> <blazulite> any idea to make this look more ddnet-y without losing it's "importance"?
22:51 < bridge> <blazulite> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1371952926435709118/image.png?ex=6825023b&is=6823b0bb&hm=a2b7617a576a4025defc9be5c1211ef7f906f6f57c5c4af0797a999c9f549589&
22:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> no I mean in ddnet....
22:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh no
22:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> very opaque
22:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> what do the other buttons look like
22:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> less contrast imo
22:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or less bright blue idk
22:54 < bridge> <blazulite> that's the thing
22:54 < bridge> <blazulite> there's no "Other buttons" atm😭
23:01 < bridge> <hectavoxel> heres my take
23:01 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it doesnt need to be flashy or anything, no glows or very harsh gradients. it just need to stand out against the bg and look functional
23:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> look at the editor UI and see how simple everything is
23:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1371955658982948895/image.png?ex=682504c6&is=6823b346&hm=172e4943510ebc6c6788efeda429d9dcfde6078431e88a02d19a2315251ca39b&
23:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> idk why i had to stop my emo bit just for this but
23:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yep I do like this
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i’m partial do a download combo box
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i’m partial to a download combo box
23:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm actually not a fan of using the user agent to show some specific download
23:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you dont know what I'm doing, maybe I'm going to use USB to put the apk on my phone
23:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> maybe an "Other downloads" dropdown thing
23:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 19.2:
23:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> scrolling through serverlist using arrow keys will load player skins delayed
23:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (becomes most obvious if you go through different servers after each other, not bound to arrow keys)
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i was thinking smth more like this (from a figma i made yrs ago)

23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> the user agent would just determine the default
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> if it’s indeterminate then windows
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz most popular by far
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> the user agent would just determine what’s shown by default
23:47 < bridge> <Ewan> obv ddnet doesn’t have an installer like that but humor me
