00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i'm saying instead of   ddnet use the name 
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like account to save points, 
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we can  creating  place on settings to writing  there the name/account 
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  and use the name   that appear when you play like just name (no points or anything)
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> .
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> of course to not become complex to new players if they not use this thing use that (the name appear when you play) like points
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then xlient should have something like timeout code section where you can put that nickname
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> good idea tho
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that will be so hard xd
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> imagine to switch each points of every current players
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i feel you guys still not understand me XD
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> the goal of idea just to can use any name you want without lose your points
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ofc i did, you just want to have the possibility to change your name and have the points on ur main name
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yes
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that not that easy xd
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its easy if server-client know about it
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and make other one appear when you play
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/confused-white-persian-guardian-why-gif-11908780
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk i not know anything about this thangs
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ita really hard to understand you xd
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk i not know anything about this things
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes xd
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> XD :think_bot:
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (XD gif)
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> what the fuck you mean by Â«Â switch place the name for the accountÂ Â»
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you saying you want switch everypoints to the new place
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i just saying take the old place and put it in settings XD
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and make other one without points
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you have box and inside the box points
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we will make other one but not need put all points in the new one just switch place the boxs
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/mr-bean-thumbs-up-doctor-gif-11640776
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> do it
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> lol
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you do it
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no you, not my idea
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> whatever that just useless
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> everything useless guys just delte this group
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe i am still doesnâ€™t undrstand u, that mean you will need to login to an account everytime you join a server
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye, actually
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> something like /timeout
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it just me or is it insanely hard to follow this conversation
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> lol
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no idea what you're talking about
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> literally neither of you are understandable
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there are three non-native english speakers, what did you suppose to see xd
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i just noticed it
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i like this idea (in my way tho), so i will make an issue and maybe even pr
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> he is talking about stocking points of users to an accounts for have the possibility to change name whenever we want
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok there is way easier just delte the name than servers and make new one and add other one (just name without points)
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i am
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ðŸ™‚
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe we just need to sleep a bit
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can delete the name of servers right?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean we can't really guarantee points for names
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> delte and make other one
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you are? im sorry xd
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think maybe we can keep some well known players
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not everyone
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we can only really verify using discord
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> the old one (with points exist but hidden)
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or maybe the forum
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whatever the oldest account is for the forum that claims the name
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whatever the oldest account is on the forum that claims the name
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hidden the name and make other one.
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  to you can change your name without less points
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i think it's clear now and easy to do ðŸ˜›
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> but why
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hidden the name and make other one.
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  to you can change your name without lose points
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> there is a lots people play with more than one name
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and ppl want change name but not want lost points
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this will fix everything
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 99 percents of new players
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> there is old players too
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> make closed source network of such servers and make money to use random nicknames with static main xd
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it's fine if we just start a new server network with fresh accounts
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> players with 3k points can transfert they points to another bame
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anyone who cares about old points is weird imo like wouldn't you want everyone to have the same playing field as you, not just because you were an old player?
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i want to do seasonal points too
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like 3 month periods
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whoever got the most points then gets some award maybe idk, or listed in their account that they were rank 1
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> to be clear, you would be able to repeat maps (so if you already cleared ez maps for points you could still compete)
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> why not add ads to ddnet
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i not understand all but no i not like it
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add vip things will be better
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont really care for points right now
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> since it's just farm really
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least if you dont have many maps cleared its just farming
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if it was an actual indication of skill i would be more interested
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cough make ddmax + race + some oldschool worth no points
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> will be great if was something like list skills like 
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> do 50/500 hammerfly parts
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 20/300 hammer hit parts
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ...
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> XD
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> will be great if was something like list skills list like
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> do 50/500 hammerfly parts
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 20/300 hammer hit parts
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ...
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hussain go make your own game xd
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :justatest:
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> xdd
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ddnet is weak shit for you i think
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i hope but i can't XD
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> learn to
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> after finish study maybe XD
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> without any knowledge and only some idea you wont creat smth
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i like this more honestly
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> instead of making weird categories based on time it should actually be related to skill
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's a problem when you try to categorize based on time and then skill, because... uh yeah it's completely arbitrary for how to rate ddmax / oldschool at that point
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then it goes to make mapper's work really hard
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just stop supporting ddmax...
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> because you should make achievement zones xd
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok so here's my idea
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> actually before i say it let's go to offtopic
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we took the dev's channel away fro mthem
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there was idea to rerate every map
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> google tables or what
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @louis
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ja only novices
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> what about make 100 parts/maps offline to learning every skills and write above everyone he did 20/100 or 100 ....
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do it
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> every year there comes person to say make tutorial map xd
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like the others games you have to do educational parts before play
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do it bro xd
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> sadly creating maps so much complex
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> it's not complex. a tutorial good be a dummy map where you get forced to do the most basic stuff (like double jump or dragging dummy through freeze). there are alot of options to keep it simple for the player.
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway i will fasting tomorrow
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i have to eat bb
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i hope if was every things in one list (blocks -deep-teleports-endless-.....)
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> you can add a menu button for tutorial, starting a lan server and having a list of multiple maps for different stuff
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> no i want everything ready and in one list:feelsbadman:
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> what
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> should be just drawing
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like this (but images) and click above block example to change the desigan
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/863926489379504128/unknown.png
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and just choose and draw
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why not like this XD
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its like this now
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> did you touch editor
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i will see later
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar âœª\:  does that mean time\_get() can not be used anymore? \:(
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Why
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> It's just that tw uses global variables instead of making components part of the game client, which would make much more sense
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> How to find out players points fast? Like https://ddnet.tw/players/SomeoneNickname?points
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> How to find out players points fast and not receive tons of information about him? Like https://ddnet.tw/players/SomeoneNickname?points
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> *them xd
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> uh you can always do /points in a server or do something like curl https://ddnet.tw/players/lynn | grep points
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> i need to do fast request
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> $profile
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/864067947404460033/profile_lynn.png
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> fast request using curl
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think there is an API which seems like what you're asking
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but sounds like a great idea to me
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `curl -sS 'https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=lynn' | jq '.points'`
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> Almost what I was looking for, but it will work too
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whoa what

11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> #bot-cmds
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shaikhun> Oops
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> i haven't played in 7 months, i went to the website wanted to check my rank, points and stuff like that, i typed my name in "Boci", and nothing came up.
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> ok so i was like i'll go in game and check, i went in game did `/points Boci`
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> got a result of 3200 points, fine
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> then i went back to the website and i appeared after searching for "Boci"
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> is this normal that the website forgot that i exist?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe u had a typo the first time
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon ^
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that's how i'd fix it in a more general approach
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can also do what std::cout does and add a constructor class
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> smth like CSystemInit Init
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho it's generally better if global constructors aren't used, or if they used, they just do trivial stuff ðŸ˜„
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> no i directly went to ddnet.tw/players/Boci
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> it returned player not found
19:22 <+Learath2> I just spent an hour implementing a 2 bit counter on a breadboard just to check if my solution was correct, not sure if it was a waste of time or not
19:26 <+Learath2> maybe I should get a fpga in the future
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u learned smth, it wasted wasted ^^
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the best xd
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that shouldnâ€˜t happen. tell me if you can reproduce it
