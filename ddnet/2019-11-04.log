12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> First of all: Hey all, and yes, I'm not dead yet :boo: 
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> And the reason why I'm here:
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Great that now unsupported clients are kicked from the servers, but now it also does kick the old Android version of DDNet Client (9.3.1), which was no longer updated due to the SDL2... so is there a chance to let it not be kicked and allow further spectating?
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu heh, I didn't know anyone still uses the android client
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> isnt there an older version of mobile client
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> the autokick is because there was a bot client going around with that same version number
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.2.apk should work
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen I still do when work gets to boring (like literally now) ^^
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Yep, works, thanks :brownbear:
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> [12:21 PM] TearlessAbyss46: When you disconnect on a server it still shows you are connected
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> intended?
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 looks like you forgot the leaving event
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I'm outside, could you add a call there?
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sure
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> @Soreu Good catch! I often use android client to spec players too. Is android client open source ?
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it is apparently
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i think
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi , i added a button to menus_browser.cpp and wanna set a url on button that opening  default browser with that website , can someone explain it to me ?
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @mohsen7s yes, it's the same client as normal one, but we haven't updated to SDL2 android and removed all the android specific code by now
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we removed it because no one was maintaining it anymore
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
