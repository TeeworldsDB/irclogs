00:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if winit handles it better, they seems to use a different way to clamp the mouse inside the window üòÑ

00:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I am trying to cross compile right now and get the following error message: "could not find ssp paths" a quick google search couldn't help me, I guess a dependency is missing?
00:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> `cmake .. -D...`
00:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try searching the source code for "could not find ssp paths"
00:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you downloaded the git submodule?
00:23 < bridge> <AssassinTee> argh thank you I should go to bed
00:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> We should ask the active mobile gamers how they like the old controls. We should not break their workflow with a new release that has different controls.
00:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> cross compiling with mingw, needed to install rust first, needed to set mingw to posix, all in order to compile for windows. STILL EASIER THEN USING VISUAL STUDIO
00:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cross compile from windows to windows? xd
00:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are you crossing then?
00:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> cross compile from ubuntu to windows
03:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is mingw on ubuntu? o.O
03:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 can i turn off this spamming message? `2024-05-09 09:27:40 D stun/6: couldn't send stun request` i am having a hard time reading my debug prints with scrolling logs
03:53 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs just gcc that targets windows lol
03:53 < bridge> <Ewan> yea mingw is anywhere u need it

07:28 < bridge> <teero777> anyone know why the rendering bounces with the window resize but only in x direction? xd
07:28 < bridge> <teero777> am i doing smth wrong or is this common place with opengl?

07:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think that "bounce" looks more of a center alignment for me
07:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> on second look, the scale is off by 80% on the horizontal axis??
07:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> on second look, the scale is off by 80%~ on the horizontal axis??
07:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> does the TextureWidth account for the current size, or the default size of the window?
07:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Something's fishy beyond line 24
07:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think that "bounce" looks more of a center alignment for me (wrong call)
07:40 < bridge> <teero777> i fixed the scale of the characters. but thats not what im talking about. there is no center alignment.
07:41 < bridge> <teero777> i fixed the scale of the characters but thats not what im talking about. there is no center alignment.
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> that's your window manager's frame?
07:41 < bridge> <teero777> yea
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> just seems like the wm is painting a black brush behind as it waits on your app to respond
07:42 < bridge> <Ewan> if you move it slowly does it jiggle
07:46 < bridge> <teero777> it doesn't happen with other applications
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yours might just be slow
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
07:47 < bridge> <teero777> xD
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> or more likely you're not  pumping events frequently enough
07:47 < bridge> <teero777> but that shouldn't make the whole rendering scene move xD
07:47 < bridge> <teero777> if i was slow then it would not do anything
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> this is my resize callback
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> void framebuffer_size_callback(GLFWwindow *window, int width, int height) {
07:49 < bridge> <teero777>     glViewport(0, 0, width, height);
07:49 < bridge> <teero777>     glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
07:49 < bridge> <teero777>     glLoadIdentity();
07:49 < bridge> <teero777>     glOrtho(0, width, height, 0, -1, 1);
07:49 < bridge> <teero777>     glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> }
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```
07:59 < bridge> <Ewan> iunno
08:03 < bridge> <teero777> anyone know why the rendering bounces with the window resize but only in y direction? xd
08:03 < bridge> <teero777> am i doing smth wrong or is this common place with opengl?
08:03 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1237999678184886312/2024-05-09_07-26-36.mp4?ex=663db08c&is=663c5f0c&hm=02d42eda2a995d445620eba7f927f1812f8fb70a942db39f81d9a00270e37a42&
08:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:04 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
08:04 < bridge> <teero777> morning ‚òï
08:04 < bridge> <teero777> idk if i3 is messing with me or why it only affects one axis
08:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚òï
08:26 < bridge> <zhn> can you do it slower? seems like compositor makes its work
08:37 < bridge> <teero777> when going slower the bounce is lesser too.
08:37 < bridge> <teero777> compositor? Do you mean smth like picom or OpenGL related
08:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my dumbass guess would be something to do with drawing leftrightbottomup
08:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure if there is even a possible way to fix it tho. cuz i have no idea if different window compositors behaves differently. i mean it can even be the compositor being the one drawing leftrightbottomup so it could also be possible that it wasn't even something you could fix in application.
08:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you are not making Windowkill i think you should just ignore it. <a:yep:1232334814447669268>
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean you could try flipping your framebuffer and see if the problem goes away. and if the window problem goes away, you can figure out how to flip your content so it was the right way up again.
08:55 < bridge> <teero777> I will try ‚ù§Ô∏è
09:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
09:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm no graphic dev so....
09:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just guessing
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think this happens because there are old frames still stored in the WM's frame queue and it uses the current window dimensions to rescale it or smth.
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if u can fix it, do other apps not do it?
09:11 < bridge> <teero777> none that i know of
09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so ddnet works with opengl?
09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without bounces
09:12 < bridge> <teero777> dunno i can't resize it since my cursor is captured xdd
09:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> f1
09:13 < bridge> <teero777> lol i just found a bug
09:13 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238026137314136074/image.png?ex=663dc930&is=663c77b0&hm=34d0f0c956aaaa069b92a7e284f8d7a88b5b91d6a38bfa146532436e018035b9&
09:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's no bug, it finally stops rendering that ugly chess field, that's a feature :lol:
09:15 < bridge> <teero777> my eyes can't tell if ddnet is bouncing since there are so many moving parts xd
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, ddnet does this:
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - gets resize event
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - halts the backend
09:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - sets the new viewport via glViewport
09:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - continues rendering
09:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume ur program is single threaded?
09:16 < bridge> <Ewan> opaque resize
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
09:28 < bridge> <teero777> ohh. since i invert the projection it thinks it resizes correctly but it does not xdd
09:28 < bridge> <teero777> nvm that didn't fix it
09:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: easiest way would probably to get an IPv6 address ^^
09:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how much is "spammed"?
09:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could add a `grep -v --line-buffered "stun request"` to the command line?

10:14 < bridge> <teero777> i have some question. im making a 2D pixelart game.
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> Should the text be embedded into the sprites for buttons or should it be dynamically rendered onto them?
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> Should the buttons be extensible and split up into parts so you can scale the axis independently or hardcoded?
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> Is a ui system like ddnet has a good option or are there better ones?
10:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1238041446284529674/image.png?ex=663dd772&is=663c85f2&hm=292bfae70fedd4ad0a4b381867daeeef77740ca56bde63ab84e130a0b1fff68b&

10:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> embedded text is useful if the text never really changes
10:16 < bridge> <teero777> i kinda don't want to make 25 sprites for 25 buttons tho. does it have any other advantages?
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> better ones please jesus
10:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
10:17 < bridge> <teero777> huh? xD
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> use something like 9 slice for buttons
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it's very generic
10:17 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet ui pretty good xd
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> no
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> works for any kind of rectangular primitive
10:18 < bridge> <teero777> yes that was what i was planning
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> then what q about buttons
10:18 < bridge> <teero777> but for positioning
10:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> :dab1:
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> probably use a layout system with proper margins and such
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc pr
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> the math isn't complicated even for multiple kinds of size policies
10:19 < bridge> <teero777> okay im going with ddnet ui :D
10:19 < bridge> <teero777> other sounds too complicated xd
10:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> :dyingmonkey:

10:20 < bridge> <teero777> xDD
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> it's gonna be good xd
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> teero have u ever seen any other ui code
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ever
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> not really lmaoo
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet ui is
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> so good
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> so goddamn convoluted
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's not really performant
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> especially since you have to rebuild and render your entire layout every frame
10:21 < bridge> <teero777> yea thats a shame
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> some kind of dirty/damage/retained mode rendering is needed for a performant game ui
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> which isn't rly possilbe with ddnet system
10:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> chillerdragon when use prebuild binarys so i dont have to remove the cmakecache of each single dep if i wanna play around with generators in Craft >:(
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> why would you want that
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> use a competent package manager and then he doesn't need to provide anything
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> shared libraries...
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i have 0 sympathy for VS users in 2024
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> if u missed the msys2 bus it's probably over

10:26 < bridge> <teero777> no idea how to make ui code properly. ik i don't want to use ddnet code
10:27 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet draws on a virtual canvas and then scales to the real resolution right? so everything fits
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet just transposes coordinates based on the nearest integer scale factor
10:28 < bridge> <sedonya> morning
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> you most likely want object oriented
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> every unique control inherits from a base control which responds to particular events that are propagated by its parents of the same type
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> events like render, mouse, resize, etc
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> every unique control inherits from a base control which responds to particular events that are propagated by its parents which inherit the same type
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of working with rectangles manually you can have properties for all of your controls which define size, and they can either be placed absolutely or they can be in a layout system which also receives the resize event and decides where to place its children based on their properties
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> and then for custom behavior you reimplement these event handlers
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> you don't need very much for a system like this

15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 ill make a c api library
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> for tablegen
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then a rust crate using it
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Even patching out the line is easier than just getting an ipv6.
16:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It printed like 3 times in a row making me confuse lines in my debug mess every time
16:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I look at the local console too. It would be nice if there was a config to turn it off or it would only print once. The master server also does some logging client side. It all seems a bit polluted.
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> Who is a tablegen?
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Interesting, so why does it need a C api? Looks more like a standalone tool that one invokes
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> nope
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its used as a library
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> The TableGen front end parses a file, instantiates the declarations, and hands the result off to a domain-specific backend for processing.
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/BackGuide.html
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 you can make a rust macro backend to make rust files from tablegen
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm makes c++ files from tablegen
17:04 < bridge> <bebraa> .
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see, and why don't you directly wrap the C++ api instead?
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you think u like c now more than you did before you started your job? :lol:
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> no xd

23:19 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't be surprised with the state of the turkish economy üòõ
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> Some people are just broke
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> $4 can be the difference between eating and not eating
23:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> is there a way to mute whispers right now?
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cl_showchat 0
23:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - no i meant specificly only whispers
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> You can mute the person
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> another chat filter setting for chiller üò™
23:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> i thought about it more as an addition the streamer_mode
23:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> teamchat only, disable whispers, etc
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> but locked behind streamer_mode, useful for stormax, stepfunn, cendren, rqza, me, and a few others that i cant recall atm
23:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> stepfunn HAS to turn his chat off and peak at it through the damn console because he's constantly getting harassed :D
23:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lol fucked up
