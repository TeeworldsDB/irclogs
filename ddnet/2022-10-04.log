00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't even need multiple threads, you can probably get all the way up to the limits of the network just by optimizing the physics stuff
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A space hashing solution or maybe binary space partitioning should turn our O(n^2) algorithms into O(nlogn) iirc

02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Not Keks https://youtu.be/IsHuOnq92Ec
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this got reccomended to me fsr
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Doom Slayer> Legends always comeback
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why tho xd. What do you learn by watching someone code something you don't understand
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you'd be in the topic it might be cool and that guy seems to explain his stuff. Maybe then it's worth it. But i dunno what he's doing so dunno what it should give me other than some motivation to not be lazy ^^
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I recommend blog posts insteas of vids

09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Would anyone know all the tee skin Creators I want to earn money on the sales of these skins they are the original creators
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And also would be nice to have these people on board for more future skins
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Please let me know
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anthonyderk22> Thank me later https://t.me/+UI7SZ3fhpUkyMjg8
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah sent him already
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> had it too lmao
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anthonyderk22> Thank me later https://t.me/+UI7SZ3fhpUkyMjg8
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> You basically want to make nfts off of tee skins?
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> See if the skin being uploaded has common creative licence attached to it
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Bro I could make a ton of avatar like stuff made with free to use Tee skins and then make it as a Logo service on Teeskins
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that would be more profitable, than ntfs
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @heinrich5991 are skins licensed as CC BY-SA ?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which skins?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe the skins we ship have different licenses
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> skins from either on ddnet's skin database, on teeworlds' forum and on ddnet's forum
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> on teeskins' forum, we have some compromises about it, most of the Assets are modified, but being accepted anyway
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> skins that are not included in the client usually have a sketchy license
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or none at all
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> pf, this won't help then, if there's no source to determine a tee skin's license, then it's not really legal to just monetize off of it
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> without a source to proof that you can
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not even legal to host it
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> At least people who uploads their original Assets on teeskins are being disclaimed, that what they upload will be under CC BY-SA 4.0
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that is something at least
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but then, most of the skins there aren't contributed as licensed, this is problem I know.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can only do that if they're the original creator
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Of course, I know it heavily, this is why I reject most Asset submissions there, but nexus and others don't give a shit
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Also reaching out other creators who eventually got bored off the game is not possible now
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @heinrich5991 Sooooo, about having access to some skins from ddnet's skin db:
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> after we publish our beta release on the reworked database with Nexus, may we use the Assets from ddnet's skin db to be published to the beta as a starting point?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I ask you for permission, since you are head of the roles of skin manager on the ddnet forum
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I ask this early to get ourselves prepared for a proper release
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I ask this early to get ourselves prepared for a proper release and testing
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> About that info, until we have actual source for some skins being licensed as free to use or monetizable, you really cannot use any random skins in that matter, unless some skins have proof of licensing, and that depends on the creators.
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> If any creator gives you a thumbs up for their skins, then you can go for the creator's skins
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and remember, nfts are literally for giving away ownership
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have no relation to the skin db
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> do ravie has relation?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think the skins in there have a clarified license
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> does ravie has relation?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> does ravie have relation?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clefairy and louis have the Skin Database Crew role on this discord
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well as I see on the forum pages, people just ask the skin manager to be uploaded without licensing, so yeah, those don't have licenses
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well as I see on the forum pages, people just ask the skin manager for the skins to be uploaded without licensing, so yeah, those don't have licenses
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you going to delete all the collected skins in the skin db?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can I have a backup first if that's the case?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Should I ask them about how they handle licensing?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the answer is "not at all"
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> most, which has licensing and have no authors or watermarks
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Pretty much all skins in our db that say unknown for the licence column have none ^^
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so any "unknown" skins
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so any "unknown" assets
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or didn't specify one
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> mmmm, we don't like that üòÑ
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> we have a bias for unknown authorizing
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> we want to appreciate every asset
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well thank you two for the infos, this genuinely helps

11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I'm a couple of hours late
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki where do you get your rust news üòõ always faster than others ^^
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> On the rust reddit
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> reddit, fitting for ryo
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> He writes the news let's be honest. All in for rust
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is rust
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> rust is in his blood
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i just thought youd be interested since its vulkan related
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> recommended for me too
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the guy don't do shit for 20 minutes, only speaking with chat
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1026848439222407249/unknown.png
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x526f6d656f> i have some 10+ year old skins, lots of ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù skins from the ictf community back then, do you want those as well?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://youtu.be/9G3DWHf1xX0
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :issou:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> anime version when?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah thought you want to watch it to learn Vulkan xdd
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> And i have to say if it is worth it
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my game crashed while selecting "vanilla skins only"
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Which client version?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> current
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since when does it load and unload all skins LOL
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Master?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that definitely was not the case before
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rls
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 16.5
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 16.4
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Try if nightly also crashes
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Later, but anyways it shouldnt load/unload all skins
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I'm surprised this feature is in the rls
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it didnt before, who implemented that
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I did. It doesn't reset downloaded skins list else
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you please revert this or make it not affect normal skins? I use this for filtering a lot, if i wanna select vanilla skins I turn it on, and later turn it off again. I have like 2k+ skins and that sucks now
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then don't use 2k skins
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is no need to fill the ram if you want vanilla only
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Implement a better filter instead
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1. thats not a solution to the existing problem.
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2. if you read correctly, i dont use vanilla only.
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Please explain the problem that you fixed by this
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Read my message and you will understand
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did not understand
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you mean what I think:
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why can you not make it affect downloaded skins only?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or: why do you not handle them as normal skins for this setting?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You know that a solution to an existing problem is not "then just dont do it"
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, there is a ddos problem? just dont play during ddos
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Skin prefix
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Community option
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Cannot explain all mobile
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just improve the filter
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> skin prefix was meant to work during vanilla skins only.
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not if not in client
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Only community db
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> last time i saw you asking heinrich to fix something, cuz he did it. Well, this time the same goes to you, please improve the filter that you seem to have broken
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> It was no filter
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then fix it
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dude
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Read
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Think
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Stop being so offended
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just improve the search filter
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doesnt fix the loading/unloading lag/crash problem
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> This isn't a search filter it affects run time
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nighlty
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno why release is broken
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Will nightly lag?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Didn't even know it's in this rls
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is your problem u use it as search filter
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, you could at least make that happen in a thread
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I haven't created non lazy loading
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> How about u do it;)
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :sendhelp:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <anthonyderk22> Thank me later https://t.me/+UI7SZ3fhpUkyMjg8
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut btw u found another bug, thx for that
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> skin prefix must also refind skins
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ghost, chat & kill msgs skins must be updated
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since they might cache the result of findskin
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least the code calls it for them
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ghost, chat & kill msgs skins must be updated
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ty discord
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> YESSSS
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait but where are favorited skins stored?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> config, just like friends and favorite servers
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I have a profile system in my custom client, maybe it's a bit overkill for ddnet
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1026924133927374878/unknown.png
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> if you want it or some part of it feel free to steal
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. no guarantees that I'll host them though
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today i learned, using  ddnet on ur resume and talking about it helps in interviews, also having a blog is smth that helps a lot too
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i checked and i think my blog gets somewhat visits for the little  care i put xD
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1026931302437498992/unknown.png
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not bad
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice!
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, interesting. Did it come up during the interview?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i was also told for my academic career to have a blog or at least a personal page where i can list all the project i worked on, even personal ones (such as ddnet)
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i have it on my resume
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and my blog talks bout it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/categories/ddracenetwork/
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think having a blog is kind of a must
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u should make one, im sure u got interesting stuff to say
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also kinda gives me some imposter syndrome, as if what i blog about is not interesting xd
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't wanna buy a domain, so maybe ill just create another github account and do it there
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well there is always someone better than you
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of rly good bloggers use github gists
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even pages xD
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> often, i have a problem (code or tex mainly), and i cannot find the answer on stackoverflow or stackexchange
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its valid
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yeah thats good stuff to blog about
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i'd like to post the solution somewhere so that other people might benefit from it too
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or how u solved something
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i htink, we need some website, intermediate between github and stackoverflow
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/zstd-streaming-in-rust/
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this was me solving running out of memory when decompressing the master server jsons to parse them xd
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where you post your problem, your reasoning and your solution with lots of keywords
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a blog honestly
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but a generic one for everyone
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Substack might be great
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> billion dollar idea there @Erik van Velzen ^
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always rly good quality stuff there
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://substack.com/
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> never heard of it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see it a lot on hackernews
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blog posts from peopel using that
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its great iirc
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i prefer self hosting
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a bit of touch of your own
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and as is must
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my blog uses zola
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rust site generator
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.getzola.org/
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> make a blog on how to make a blog üòâ
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are plenty
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I liked your specifically tho
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I liked yours specifically tho
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> but I guess you've given enough information to make a similar one :D
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i made the design myself :D
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly simple and minimal
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1026941783306928208/unknown.png
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> does anyone knows all the dependencies needed ?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I don't really want to install vs community rn
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (new fresh windows install)
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think a recent update made it so u only need the compiler thing
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try option 1
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows.html
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " This will require the Visual C++ Build Tools 2019 or equivalent (Visual Studio 2019, etc.) to already be installed. "
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think pressing 1 does that for u
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/visual-cpp-build-tools/
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks like this works fine
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look
