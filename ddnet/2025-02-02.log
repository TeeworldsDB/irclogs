02:28 < bridge> <teero777> Quick question does veto apply per tee or per IP?
02:28 < bridge> <teero777> For example if my dummy has veto and I press F4 while the main tee is selected and the main tee doesn't have veto is the vote going to be aborted?
02:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've tried voting as both tees before and it didn't seem to do anything
02:29 < bridge> <teero777> Since there is only 1 vote per IP I think this should be the case but I'm not sure I haven't tested
02:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but that's just looking at the vote bar
02:30 < bridge> <teero777> That's not my question tho
02:30 < bridge> <teero777> I know you only have one vote
02:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wait, is "having veto" some fancy mechanic I don't know about?
02:31 < bridge> <teero777> Google veto xd
02:32 < bridge> <teero777> If you are longer in the race you can abort any vote
02:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> pulling a chiller and afking in a map midrun 
02:53 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i have all the power now
02:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you could have a veto by vote
02:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> by like, a minority
02:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> instead of a singular person
02:57 < bridge> <teero777> man I don't understand my question
02:58 < bridge> <teero777> man u don't understand my question
03:14 < bridge> <zhn> never tested, lemme check da code
03:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I do understand, I just have no idea
03:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm more confused over what I thought the veto message in chat meant because my ass was misunderstanding in some really stupid way
03:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> I also wanted to look into this thing before since the vote UI is sometimes buggy
05:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Nevermind, I don't think I can do guide layers for automappers.
05:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> The current layer structure makes it reaaally hard to dictate how it should work.
05:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Sucks because I have to revert a lot of code. It was a really solid idea, but it's almost impossible to set it up properly without having to take several sidequests
07:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ^ needs the `incomplete` label
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hectavoxel what needs incomplete and why?
11:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> nothing now, the issue i was talking about got closed by the author
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robyte how would remove a file from cmakelist? the glob wants all of the files
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can only think of ugly solutions
12:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I meant the same as heinrich5991, create set without the server main for the tests
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes that much i understood
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but in our cmake we glob directories for file listings
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i remove a file it throws an error
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i remove the glob we dontr have a glob
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have some idea but its not nice
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg ``mold: error: undefined symbol: IsInterrupted()``
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the compile definition was already working :c 
12:56 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, I guess you'd need a server main stub which defined `IsInterrupted` since it's used in `server.cpp`
12:56 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, I guess you'd need a server main stub which defines `IsInterrupted` since it's used in `server.cpp`
12:57 < bridge> <robyt3> technically also `FetchAndroidServerCommandQueue` for Android, if we'd ever try to compile and run tests on Android
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye figured that out
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> got it to build and pushed
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but imo its not very nice
17:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> @tsfreddie Any idea why the index would be wrong in merge.py even though I have total_tile_x and total_tile_y set correctly?
17:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> Clearly I'm doing something wrong. Maybe the screenshot dimensions on macOS are wrong because the borders of the application somehow matter?

18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ohno did #9638 get stale? i was speedrunning feedback
18:30 < ChillerDragon> omg where chilerbot go #7777
18:30 < chillerbot2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> #7777
18:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ???
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is your problem again chiller
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your bot responded correctly
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it ignored #9638
18:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> from webchat
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only works from irc
18:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or matrix
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you probably checked "is name == chillerdragon"
18:32 < ChillerDragon> ``if (!isBridge) {
18:33 < ChillerDragon> omg paste is hard
18:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh jupstar since you are here can u merge my pr 
18:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can not emotionally handle another pr thats stale for months

18:49 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9638
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> too much activity from other devs
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont want to deal with that xD
19:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fair
19:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i responded to all ._.
19:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> prs is like missing people
19:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if they dont get merged within 74 hours they are probably already dead
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> that's a quick way to ruin a codebase
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> nothing should escape proper review just so we meet some arbitrary timeline
20:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @davide55 should this open a client? http://45.141.57.52/

20:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do the buttons do something for u?
20:23 < bridge> <oxyzo.> it opens ddnet client
20:23 < bridge> <oxyzo.> when it tries to join i get sent to main menu

21:30 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> @robyt3 it should be done. always helped me with this oneüëç
21:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe name a commit better?
21:30 < bridge> <robyt3> that doesn't look correct
21:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 14 files changed :pepeH:
21:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> xD
21:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> commit squash commits
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Do I have to merge #9640 by bypassing restrictions? Somehow Github wants an non-existent CI run to pass
21:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9640
21:38 < bridge> <oxyzo.> hi melon
21:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> maybe just temporarily disable the 20.04 build or update the rules temporarily so 20.04 isn't needed to merge
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> hi üçà
21:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkalaugh:
21:45 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> isnt it correct?
21:45 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> works in game but maybe stupid
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> look at the diff
21:45 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> alr
21:45 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> did it via cmd
21:46 < bridge> <robyt3> it contains a lot more changes than yours
21:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> what you did was accidentally pull master into your feature branch
21:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> there are many ways you could recover from that, but they all require some git magic#

21:48 < bridge> <zhn> github memo'ed 2 my dead prs killed that way xdd
21:48 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> no clue how the squash works.
21:48 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> :)
21:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> let me see if i can guide you through it in the easiest way possible
21:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> `git log` -> shows the last commits and their hash, you want the hash from the last commit you did on your branch
21:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> you'd then want to hard-reset the state of your feature branch via `git reset --hard <commithash>`
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> let me see if i can guide you through it in the easiest way possible
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û>

21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> then you'll force push, i guess you should force with lease to be a little bit safer
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> `git push --force-with-lease`
21:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> that should theoretically reset the state of your PR - after that you can clean up your history by squashing it again
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> also dont worry, if you somehow manage to bork it completly, the history is never fully gone and can be restored :p
22:01 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1335716658567844000/image.png?ex=67a12e93&is=679fdd13&hm=55d722e13ce5d9fbd02ba2708d32a9c82b5931e24b6cc59524bd72f1071e4c3a&
22:01 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> just showing that
22:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkalaugh:
22:03 < bridge> <alw5> isnt there a way to fetch more commits
22:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> the problem is he overwrote the history by forcepushing the rebase
22:05 < bridge> <alw5> well that cant be good
22:05 < bridge> <alw5> any GG(Git Gods) here?
22:06 < bridge> <alw5> might be easier to just start from scratch
22:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> it was like 5 LoC - not hard to just create new :p
22:07 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> yea I have most of the code saved
22:07 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> beginner mistake:justatest:
22:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```cpp
22:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> MainView.HSplitTop(20.0f, &Button, &MainView);
22:07 < bridge> <melo∆û>     if(DoButton_CheckBox(&g_Config.m_ClShowfps, Localize("Show FPS"), g_Config.m_ClShowfps, &Button))
22:07 < bridge> <melo∆û>         g_Config.m_ClShowfps ^= 1;

22:33 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> its swedish translate
22:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> do a clean rebuild
22:43 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> everything should be fixed now. I did a swedish translation

22:44 < bridge> <alw5> GG(Git God)
22:49 < bridge> <zhn> next time keep in mind 1 pr 1 feature but probably its fine for the first time
22:49 < bridge> <zhn> maintainers will decide your faith :]
22:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> it was accepted already, and having the translation in it doesnt hurt, tho.. we kinda need you to do a squash again because we're supposed to change the translation header <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>

22:54 < bridge> <zhn> does anyone know of some kind of ascii art generator that can generate it even based on variable width font?
22:55 < bridge> <zhn> im cooked im searching for it like 3 days and tried to mess up with 2-3 projects that claim they can do this and end up doing the same ascii art for any other font
22:56 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> 1 pr 1?
22:57 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> another squash???? hell naw
23:00 < bridge> <zhn> per pr per feature
23:21 < bridge> <alw5> i had a good website
23:21 < bridge> <alw5> but i fogor
23:23 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> Could you give the commands again so always doesnt always mess everything up again as always
23:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> `git rebase -i HEAD~{number of commits you want to put together}`
23:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> set the first line to `pick` the other lines to `squash` or `s`
23:25 < bridge> <teero777> pin this
23:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> after saving the opened prompt, another one will open with all commit messages, you can just keep them for history - or change them up
23:25 < bridge> <teero777> pin it
23:25 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> I fix it tomorrowüëç ty man. What would i do without you
23:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> after saving the opened prompt, another one will open with all commit messages, you can just keep them for history - or change them up
23:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> then you need to overwrite your git history, you do that with `git push --force`

23:57 < bridge> <zhn> seems like no one did it
23:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> offsetx and offsety are pixel values iirc, the merger didn't take camera zoom (based on the aspect ratio) into account. i would just use smaller tiles and guess and find an offset then commit to merge the final big image.
