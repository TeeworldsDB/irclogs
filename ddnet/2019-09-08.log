15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Can someone recommend a tool to check pdfs? Like a web tool where i can upload something.
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Check for virus..
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (i installed some random stuff xd)
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> google chrome
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye if i send stuff via gmail it does check automatically huh?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Uhm guys is it possible that if you join and directly connect a dummy that 1 timeout code gets lost in spamprotection or somewhere else? :c
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah wait or if you join and chat
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems like timeoutcode is not always succesfully sent :c
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>

16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> random af @Ryozuki xd
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¤¡
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon.*

16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you can't really scan pdfs, most pdf exploits rely on bugs in the pdf viewer, so your best bet would be to use one that you trust is relatively well tested and free of bugs
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think some av vendors do have signatures for a couple of the classic pdf exploits
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i am at starbucks and some random fishy looking guy walked to me and said "dO yoU hAvE gOoGle?!" and i wanted to be nice and let him click around on my laptop and a few secs later he had this pdf installed xd
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some italien stuff about god. Im not sure if he is just jesus or some leet haxx0r.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess that he just wants you to be a devout christian
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What could be so urgent about god that he had to use a strangers laptop to read about it? God's been waiting 6000 years, I'm sure he can wait a little longer
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya hope so
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no clue what he wanted he was kinda weird
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he said i should spread it xd
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and he hated on my duckduckgo :c
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, definitely some religious nut
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> spread it here please, so we can finally read about the truth
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload would be my best guess for known exploits
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ty
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> currently uploading there
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to spread potential maleware :c
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> *DISCLAIMER*
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no clue what this is. Please only click if u know what you doin xd
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://c.web.de/@634333531530592560/PU-ilGIhSuO5UEb1CE1eDw
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> deen any comments about timeoutcodes getting eaten by something?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> take a screenshot of it and upload the screenshot to make sure ðŸ˜„ creating a pdf which happens to encode to a png screenshot that uses a vulnerability in your libpng sounds rather complicated
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they might be sent without a resend-on-failure?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its multiple sites
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya i think timeoutcodes are sent only once
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and if you chat they get blocked by something
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by the spam protection probably? ðŸ˜„
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> use vm
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i installed a vm now @Jupstar âœª xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i already launched my pdf reader on my main machine
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but in case another dude walks up i have a vm xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why do u even deal with dubious pdfs
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wanted to be nice :c
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant u get the information somewhere else?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he seems to have no deigital device
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe not even a shelter
17:22 < chiller> seems like a win https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/05d50c7f3d8bf7d064d3dd3d5e0ab4a5a43d5074968106beae9fc3cb818b705a/detection
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> should we resend timeout codes?
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> since the server doesnt respond its hard to check for failure
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but we could just send it twice
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or keep track of last chat and wait
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> That might explain the few cases where people were unable to use their timeout code. Which can be really sad on long races .c
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u let some random dude at starbacks use ur laptop
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he has 200wpm he can type sudo `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` in a term before u notice :monkaS:
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AmÉ¨nÃ¸Ã¸ ä¹¡ ðŸ‘»> #developer  hi i wanna bind a key to display multiple emotes ... for example when i push right click it shows 3 emotes "angry'happy'wtf"
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AmÉ¨nÃ¸Ã¸ ä¹¡ ðŸ‘»> is it possible ?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> you cant even do that normally
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AmÉ¨nÃ¸Ã¸ ä¹¡ ðŸ‘»> i mean one by one
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AmÉ¨nÃ¸Ã¸ ä¹¡ ðŸ‘»> not at once lol xD
20:32 <@deen> no, there is no sleep function
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @AmÉ¨nÃ¸Ã¸ ä¹¡ ðŸ‘» upgrade your client to version 0.7 to do multiple emotes at once
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> fake
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> emote 15 is two emotes xd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> due to professional clamping
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/63060807-95bc8080-bef3-11e9-99ac-c6c7182ec503.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just 0.7 things... update today ðŸ™‚
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :GWfroggerHyperXD:
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can i pass a commandline arg to client to send a passwd to server?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon emote 16, and it only works if both, server and client havent updated
