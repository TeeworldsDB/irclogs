13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaisi> regarding  the quads.... why don't you simply implement a force-quads flag in the map and in the server. if the map really needs quads, the server will know and send a flag to the client which force-enables quads.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can we do something about the latest merge of the Afk indicator? I am not very happy with that Pull request.
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The indicator itself is not too good, and also it does belong to the DDNet Player, not to the normal Playerflags
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The first PR was better I think, with colored names, also for paused players.
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Or maybe a seperate skin
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Which isn't a great thing but if it would be possible to add a skin overlay it would be good
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> http://v2.ddnet.tw/WIP/
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dot5> looks like shit
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> yes @archimede67 xd
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> old rework they said
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> from latest news i guess it was back in 2016
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it can be good with better background
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut there is no way we can please everyone
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure there is atleast one person out there who runs their fonts through a tool to remove exclamation marks because exclamation marks distract them
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the flag thing should be fixed yeah
