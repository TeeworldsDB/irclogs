03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> YouTube has to compete with Facebook/Twitter/Reddit etc for screen time. They all just show stuff to keep you on their site as long as possible to get maximum ad revenue. Impossible to find quality content anywhere now because quality is less enticing than cringe/outrageous/negative dog-poo.

08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hah! :p
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen where do you load state of player on timeout reconnect?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't "load" any state. We just swap the fresh tee with the stale tee
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> where
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think i showed you a few days ago
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was in some network cpp file
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes, I forgot
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> me too üòÑ
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen in what measurement 0-9999 times in server settings are?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> seconds / milliseconds / microseconds etc.
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> different per setting
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> NICE
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sometimes seconds makes sense, sometimes minutes
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> how do I get seconds from server time
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what you mean
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I have 
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `pSelf->Server()->TickSpeed()`
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and `pSelf->Server()->Tick()`
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some internal times are in ticks
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so 50 / second
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tick / TickSpeed
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and I have let's say `m_SavedTime`
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so I need to add several seconds to saved time
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and check if it passed
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> m_SavedTime += Seconds * TickSpeed;
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check ddracechat.cpp::ConTimeouz
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Timeout*
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats where it starts, then make your way through the SetTimedOut functions
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (one in server.cpp, one in network_server.cpp)
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I recently worked with it to support timeout in my server, also for 0.7 clients :D
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 btw, any idea why timeout from a 0.7 client to a 0.6 client doesnt work correctly?
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I saw, in ddnet it works that way too
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I cant seem to get that working, for now i have 0.7 to 0.7 and 0.6 to 0.6 only
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no crossed
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/791600860407791646/unknown.png
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `if(pSelf->Server()->IsSixup(pResult->m_ClientID))`
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 also, does ddnet client change port after timeout to be able to reconnect again? Because in fclient i need to restart the client to get a new port
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same problem in ddnet i think
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> How do I check if the client with ID (X) is the same client that it was 9999 seconds ago?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen ok thanks
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are timeoutcodes
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> timeoutcodes are sent using /timeout xyz
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or in ddnet, it happens automatically
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is cl_timeout_code and cl_timeout_seed
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it will send a /timeout <code> based on the code and the seed
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you set seed to "" it will just send the code unchanged
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen what we might need is to save the seed, if seed is set to "" it will get a new random seed on client start
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The cross thing just worked out of the box for me. Be careful about preserving stale sevendown state
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'm halfway on making /swap
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> But I don't know how to check if someone who asked for swap left the server
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember having to add a sixup = false to reset and a m_sixup = sixup to join
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Should be the same for me
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just with sevendown
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RudolfMonekey> Hello,
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RudolfMonekey> I'm a Discord bOt dEv
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Nvm I found the solution
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh btw it needs to be at a specific part. Maybe you have it on the wrong reset function?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nope
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont think so
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It should all be correct
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well ok, I‚Äôm out of conpletely random guesses. You‚Äôll need to elaborate on ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äù
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait, what? Advent of code has day 25?

12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep üôÇ
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> does one know how vscode extenions work? I often find extensions on marketplace.visualstudio.com but not in vscode it self. I just lost my vscode-input-sequence extensions and cant get it back :/ how do you guys sequent numbers? Or is there even an easy way in vim to do that?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just noticed if we are far enough away from the origin it can become impossible to stand on the edge of a kill tile
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how far it is until we lose 1/32nds of precision
14:41 <+ChillerDragon> ah found it in vim ``g`` ``ctrl+a`` in visual mode is bae
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> how far @Learath2?
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> ah u wonder xd
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> do the maffs
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> or make a big map lol
14:43 <+ChillerDragon> i remember mapping a 10k big map some years ago but it crashed my client consistantly
14:43 <+ChillerDragon> lmao far lands in teeworlds :D
14:44 <+ChillerDragon> almost as impressive as in minecraft
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479 this is a decent read
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Learath2 did u read "The Art of Exploitation" ?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, is it any good?
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> yes very :)
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> its too basic for u tho i think
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> it starts by explaining what if statements are and ends in exploit writing
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> this dude also calls C a high level language in the book :D
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess the arguments are different though
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might give it a read, I love exploits
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> its a rly fun book
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> i only knew the gdb command "bt" before and copied a hello world assembly from a yt tut and i leanred a lot about gdb c and assembly in the book
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> but ur a decent reverse engineer already so yeah
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> also the book is like super old
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> perl instead of python scripts etc
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> but c and assembly and gdb didnt change too much
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> but most exploits are not possible anymore due to all the newer protections like ASLR etc
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> perl > python anyway
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> i see ur a man of culture
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea maybe u might enjoy the book
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> do you read books? like physical ones? or just ebooks and articles?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there is stuff I read on physical form, like history and literature. Academic stuff I usually read ebooks, mostly because the physical books are so expensive you'd need to be a saudi oil baron to have any decent collection of them
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> i can afford it because i read 1 book a year max
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is there a limit how many quads can be seenw hen you use opengl3?
21:34 <+ChillerDragon> as the name implies
21:34 <+ChillerDragon> 3
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> xd
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for real tho its pretty annoying when some users cant see half of the design of the map
21:38 <+ChillerDragon> never heard of it
21:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 merry xmas pls fix SDL xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608842119.png
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That‚Äôs one I haven‚Äôt seen
21:39 <+ChillerDragon> its reproducible :)
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wow, thats a first
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Create an issue
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> on it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> end character might count as 2 "slots" and run out of memory somewhere
21:49 <+ChillerDragon> ye
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i discover strange thing if i want change color the body i have to change feet too ???why:bluestripe:
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/791795201260912680/unknown.png
