03:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @murpi was wondering why don't we just make it auto rescue that plays a death effect (so it looks exactly like a death but it puts you back to rescue)
03:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what was disabling killtile trying to solve to begin with :justatest:
03:23 < bridge> <totar> that was proposed but denied because it could cause a loop with certains maps or something
03:23 < bridge> <totar> but tbh idk why it matters because /r can also cause a loop
03:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> since you can just tp. i honestly think being killed is not even that big of a deal
03:35 < bridge> <totar> tp is much much slower than pressing a /r bind
03:35 < bridge> <totar> which I assume is the entire motivation
03:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i see
03:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> making /r works after a kill is probably an option too
03:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably*
03:38 < bridge> <totar> /r works by saving the last time you were grounded and unfrozen afaik
03:38 < bridge> <totar> so respawning resets it instantly
03:38 < bridge> <totar> idk how you fix that in a clean way
03:39 < bridge> <totar> kill tiles also give you a longer respawn than ``kill`` for some reason I think?
03:39 < bridge> <totar> it's like a whole second or more
03:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we can reset it when passing beginning line
03:39 < bridge> <totar> then you can't use /r on noob filters
03:39 < bridge> <totar> or anything before the start
03:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that is trun
03:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> true*
03:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, probably it is good as-is
05:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are you on macOS or did windows stop looking ass?
05:04 < bridge> <kebscs> It's android ðŸ˜‚
05:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah I remember android way more ugly too
06:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> android is not even a single thing anymore
06:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> AOSP itself doesn't even function properly:justatest:
06:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> AOSP is still ugly tho

08:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wat
08:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you have some `define`s above, don't you? xd
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yea the spoiler is in the paste i sent
08:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @milkeeycat TIL C has some really cool pointer type safety that C++ does not have. But as of right now the C++ tests die on C only features in the lib.
08:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> We have this right ``PacketKind *decode(uint8_t *buf, size_t len, Error *err);`` it could be ``PacketKind *decode(size_t len, uint8_t *buf[static len], Error *err);`` and then the compiler can throw a warning if the buffer is NULL or of wrong length
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ops without the * ``PacketKind *decode(size_t len, uint8_t buf[static len], Error *err);``
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are your thoughts on C++ compatibilty in general?
08:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in the C++ tests you include with ``extern "C" {}`` does that mean that users of the library form C++ should also do that? What about some pure C headers with all the shiny C only features and then dedicated C++ headers with bunch of ``#ifdef __cplusplus``
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to include C header in C++ program you have to use  `extern "C" {}` because otherwise C++ compiler will mangle symbols' names
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but we can do
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```C
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #ifdef __cpluplus
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> extern "C" {
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #endif
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> blah blah
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #ifdef __cpluplus
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> #endif
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to not make c++ lib users write this extern thingy each time
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i didn't know about `uint8_t buf[static len]` trick
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye its crazy stuff
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also do ``unpacker_init(Unpacker unpacker[static 1])`` instead of ``unpacker_init(Unpacker *unpacker)`` to catch null pointer dereferences at compile time also for the lib users!
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it works well only if I have integer literal in front of static
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea we have to change the arg order
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> when I use `uint8_t buf[static len]` it doesn't show a warning when the buffer is smaller
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> only if it's null
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you use clang or gcc?
08:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> clang
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need bleeding edge gcc i think
08:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also C23 added booleans lol
08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and auto keyword like in C++
08:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> - Mom, can we have boolean?
08:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> - We already have boolean at home.
08:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> - Booleans at home: `typedef enum { false, true } bool;`
08:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea ikr i just figured out today that C23 is a thing and there is new stuff blew my mind
08:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> - Mom, can we have booleans?
08:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> - We already have boolean at home.

08:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> could you merge https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet_protocol/pull/56 ? 
08:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice thanks
09:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat 108 commits without spawning a tee ._.
09:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because half of those just me merging your commits xd
09:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> true

16:05 < bridge> <chairn> what's wrong ?
16:07 < bridge> <chairn> if i'm making numeric class in c++, i.e. one that holds valid numeric data, do i have to right operator overload for all int and float types and for right and left operand ?

16:54 < bridge> <vadim670543> What should I do if everything is shaking in ddnet?
17:02 < bridge> <chairn> afaik, 18.3 is the last version to work on win 7
17:02 < bridge> <chairn> other versions don't even compiles
17:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> interesting
17:02 < bridge> <chairn> other versions don't even compile
17:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he implied 18.7 works
17:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he didn't say it tho, it was just implied
17:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Try a different server, the server you're on is probably experiencing a DDoS attack
17:03 < bridge> <chairn> maybe not 18.3, i don't know why i thought about this one, but i know some changes introduced beginning or first semester of 2024 broke game on win 7
17:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unless by "everything" you mean more than just your camera jittering about
17:03 < bridge> <chairn> recently, i had to change something in log.cpp to compile on win 7
17:48 < bridge> <isowner> hi, how can i get m_World in server.cpp?
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he is free to update to win10
20:41 < bridge> <Solly> gameserver has m_World which "sits" ontop of server, so you cant get it there. you probably want to implement whatever you are doing in gameserver
20:41 < bridge> <Solly> ^ also cant find objects

23:17 < bridge> <totar> Is this something wrong? what changed?
23:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you guys will get used to it
23:18 < bridge> <totar> browser company redesigned their website? unprecedented...
23:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> everyone always complaisn when anything changes
23:18 < bridge> <totar> Is there something wrong? what changed?
23:20 < bridge> <totar> I actually don't understand, did they change some policies?
23:21 < bridge> <totar> wayback shows their homepage changes pretty often so idk
23:51 < bridge> <Solly> no but it always gets worse
23:51 < bridge> <Solly> they changed the logo of mozzila to a green flag
23:51 < bridge> <Solly> next they are gonna turn firefox into a orange F
23:52 < bridge> <totar> idk, I don't think it's any worse than ``Moz://a``
23:53 < bridge> <totar> their logo before was just an M? right
23:53 < bridge> <totar> their logo before was just an M? right?
23:53 < bridge> <totar> I don't know what their logo is
23:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i thought the `://` was the old logo
23:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> now the new one looks like a flag
