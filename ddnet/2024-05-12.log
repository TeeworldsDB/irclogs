00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> good afternoon
02:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 can we not let the teehistorian tests spam stdout somehow? I have to scroll every time to see my failing test output
02:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1715472272.png
02:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that could be stderr for example so that while running i can silence stderr or it should be not printed at all especially if `GTEST_BRIEF` is active
02:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh or is that @zwelf s stuff?
04:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 how long are you staying up? can we hop on a call now? 
05:27 < bridge> <totar> 20 weeks for ocean shader super easy, you can do the worlds most advanced ocean shader in 20 weeks xd.
05:27 < bridge> <totar> :o I have purple name
05:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no ur name is white
05:33 < bridge> <totar> I think you underestimate how convincing it is.
05:36 < bridge> <totar> Is this the company that raised a bunch of money for their game and then never finished it after forever years?
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried to apply with my open source projects, but apparently it does not help.
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno how hard i want to try tho, 2-3 applications per year sounds a lot for me already... I'm rather lazy in that aspect :lol:
08:53 < bridge> <totar> now is a pretty bad time for all jobs related to games industry but under normal circumstances I think graphics backend dev is fairly high demand role with not many qualified applicants. 2-3 per year is not many tho lol, idk how many available listings there are in your area I guess.
08:54 < bridge> <totar> I've seen a lot of job posting which are like "knowledge of opengl/directx11, required, vulkan/dx12 is a plus"
08:55 < bridge> <totar> like idk, is it really that hard to apply? I feel like you can do atleast 10 applications if you just spent a whole day xd
08:59 < bridge> <totar> I'm pretty confident you're qualified enough for many companies
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in my area there are exactly 0 :lol:
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried in bigger cities
09:09 < bridge> <totar> yeah that sucks
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i could and maybe should try harder
09:09 < bridge> <totar> could try remote but those are competetive
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly often the descriptions sound better than the actual job tho
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep remote is preferred by me anyways, but not _too_ many give remote jobs yet
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> esp. not in germany
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> other countries are already bit further in such regards
09:10 < bridge> <totar> hmm yeah
09:10 < bridge> <totar> a lot of companies don't like to hire out of country
09:12 < bridge> <totar> you could check if nvidia amd or intel has an office in germany, they are always hiring for cpp devs probably
09:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its in alpha.for 11 Years now :KEKW:
09:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> mornin btw
11:04 < bridge> <remakepower> Hello everyone, i built a android version of DDNet that from Robyt3's fix. And I have a problem now, Will ddnet add some buttons for android's actions? (I didn't see any controller on android ddnet now)
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno, will you add support for them?
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then ddnet has support for them
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> Android’s actions?
11:12 < bridge> <remakepower> player actions on android
11:12 < bridge> <remakepower> Hello everyone, i built a android version of DDNet that from Robyt3's fix. And I have a problem now, Will ddnet add some buttons for player actions on android? (I didn't see any controller on android ddnet now)
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> like
11:12 < bridge> <remakepower> Sorry for my bad English
11:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> we currently dont have on-touch controls, and we're unsure what to use
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope u use controller
11:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> @mpft did you see the dude in showroom i believe who played 5* moderates with tablet?
11:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> dude had better aim than me >:(
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> cool superp or something
11:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s this player on usa that’s just superp
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> very confusing
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> and weird coincidence

11:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> this one
11:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe ask him if he'd like to keep the controls or has other suggestions lmao
11:14 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh
11:14 < bridge> <remakepower> That's person
11:15 < bridge> <remakepower> I remembered that i watched his videos some days ago
11:17 < bridge> <remakepower> (Though i don't think ddnet must have players that on android)
11:22 < bridge> <remakepower> I had a new question now, we didn't have any ddnet android release vesion after ddnet 9.3.1 released, so why there's still have some players that only play ddnet on android.
11:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ppl don't have pc but wanna play the game?
11:25 < bridge> <remakepower> So that's strange, isn't it?
11:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> That they dont have pc or that they like the game?
11:26 < bridge> <remakepower> No,  i didn't say your words strange, i just said them
11:27 < bridge> <remakepower> I tried use ddnet 9.3.1 android to do a job of afk bot
11:28 < bridge> <remakepower> But there's many problems of it
11:30 < bridge> <remakepower> So do we truly need an android vesion?
11:31 < bridge> <remakepower> So do we truly need an android version?
11:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> ^ i think roby enjoyed doing it as far as i can tell :D
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> I love that guy

17:50 < bridge> <yrrr_> who pulls the pull requests
17:50 < bridge> <yrrr_> how is ddnet development organized
17:55 < bridge> <gumbatw> :jaouis:
17:55 < bridge> <yrrr_> the only project i ever contributed to before the dev would immediately pull PR or comment on them within a day and my ddnet PR is sitting there rotting away for 2 days
17:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> which one? - the bot correctly links it if you specify it using a #
17:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> #1111
17:55 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1111
17:55 < bridge> <yrrr_> in the only project i ever contributed to before, the dev would immediately pull PR or comment on them within a day and my ddnet PR is sitting there rotting away for 2 days
17:57 < bridge> <yrrr_> #8344
17:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8344
17:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> and you call that "rotting away" ? :P - 
17:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> look at #5949 for example
17:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
17:57 < bridge> <gumbatw> he is ungeduldig
17:57 < bridge> <yrrr_> well i said "rotting away for 2 days" :PP
17:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> reminder that, if all maintainers just decide to not use their free time for this anymore it would rot away for many more years! - be patient, a maintainer will check your implementation soon enough.
17:57 < bridge> <yrrr_> i contributed to another project before and i guess the dev didnt have anything better to do than working on that project so he would always reply in 8 hours max xd
17:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> depends on the time aswell, i've had PR's be accepted within 5 minutes
17:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
17:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> some took a few hours
17:58 < bridge> <gumbatw> 🍆
17:58 < bridge> <yrrr_> https://tenor.com/view/horse-farthyun-gif-20829962
18:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> @yrrr_ your PR lgtm tho - if you want you can squash the commits so as soon as a maintainer finds this good aswell they can immediatly merge it
18:01 < bridge> <yrrr_> what does "squash the commits" ?
18:01 < bridge> <yrrr_> mean*
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're using a shell
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can type: `git rebase -i HEAD~7`
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> to "squash" the latest 7 commits together
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> you get a prompt with all 7 commits you did, and all of them will have `pick` and the commit hash + the commit name
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you keep the `pick` on the first one and change the rest to `s` or `squash`
18:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can then do `git push (remote) --force`
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're unsure in what you're doing, i wouldnt bother tho, as `git push --force` can accidentally break stuff if you're not careful ^^
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're using a shell
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can type: `git rebase -i HEAD~7`
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> to "squash" the latest 7 commits together
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> you get a prompt with all 7 commits you did, and all of them will have `pick` and the commit hash
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you keep the `pick` on the first one and change the rest to `s` or `squash` and save it, you get another prompt with all commit names, delete all except the one you want to keep
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can then do `git push (remote) --force`
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're unsure in what you're doing, i wouldnt bother tho, as `git push --force` can accidentally break stuff if you're not careful ^^
18:04 < bridge> <yrrr_> so it merges the diff into one new commit
18:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> it merges all 7 commits into one commit, keeps git history clean
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're using git with a shell
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can type: `git rebase -i HEAD~7`
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> to "squash" the latest 7 commits together
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> you get a prompt with all 7 commits you did, and all of them will have `pick` and the commit hash
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you keep the `pick` on the first one and change the rest to `s` or `squash` and save it, you get another prompt with all commit names, delete all except the one you want to keep
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can then do `git push (remote) --force`
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
18:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're unsure in what you're doing, i wouldnt bother tho, as `git push --force` can accidentally break stuff if you're not careful ^^

22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just don't want open prs rn
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too much stuff in my head
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> $ git branch | wc -l
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> 90
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> :justatest:
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git branch | wc -l
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 113
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```

22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i have much more on my gh
22:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
22:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> $ git branch | wc -l
22:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 11
22:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
22:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> >:(
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, most things I pushed are open PRs
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git branch -r | wc -l
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1865
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that are all
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now i gotta find out only the ones on my acc
22:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Only 80 remote branches, most of them are stale teeworlds PRs
22:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> i wonder why that is! :justatest:
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 447 apparently
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i never delete branches xD
22:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> sometimes i delete it after it gets merged, but most of the time i just let them sit there lmao
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my gh is meant to be a graveyard for prs
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i think you underestimate how far open source experience goes to most people
23:47 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as you make yourself a more functional resume and sell yourself the best you can then you have a legitimately chance at getting a position like that
23:48 < bridge> <Ewan> also see if there is any kind of small business directory around you, see if they're hiring. jobs at big companies are usually more competitive
23:48 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as you make yourself a more functional resume and sell yourself the best you can then you have a legitimately good chance at getting a position like that
