00:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You have to understand that the example allows you to modify the original source code and hot reload it. It's not meant as modding or plugin base. It's basically a full replacement. I have to go off tho. I dunno if u can figure out the idea of it by just looking at it
00:33 < bridge> <patiga> nice list of references!
00:33 < bridge> <patiga> you might also like the list in the wiki :) https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Resources
01:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes browser extensions are amazing and I build them frequently to combat annoying tasks on websites at work. Like replacing mouse clicks with shortcuts.
01:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What ddnet extensions do you have in mind?
01:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait do you mean extensions as in add a plugin system to ddnet or build browser extensions that are ddnet related? :D
01:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We already have extensions in ddnet: antibot
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s furos website? Got some url?
01:36 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: https://ddstats.qwik.space/
01:37 < bridge> <patiga> maybe its down right now o.o
01:37 < bridge> <patiga> ah, maybe just slow
01:39 < bridge> <patiga> oh wow @furo321 you are quick :heartw:
01:39 < bridge> <patiga> @corneum furo has now already implemented the better-than percentage on their site
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ok now u should make him purple 😃
02:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga ah i know that one. I somehow thought ryo made it lol
02:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @swarfey whats the name of your js lib now? The repo is called teeworlds-client and the readme calls it tw-chatonly. https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/#tw-chatonly
02:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are listed as tw-chatonly here and it seems wrong https://github.com/tee-community/awesome-tee/tree/bbc4e04a4c7a53de3b2ba218948f7fb74fcf79fb#javascript--typescript-
02:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds like underselling since you can also do snaps
03:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is https://strct.cc/
03:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye right i knew i know the domain. its the ddnet discord archive
08:31 < bridge> <teero777> xd
08:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Full already :(
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller its zwelf domain

08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> join up @blaiszephyr
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> trios now
09:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye got it
09:03 < bridge> <swarfey> ChillerDragon: yeh i renamed it when i moved from github to gitlab
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller join up
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> play fortnite
09:03 < bridge> <swarfey> And i didnt change anything
09:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ah gg i didnt See and i have Work now :saddyteddy:
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan i do not plan to start playing more closed source games. Bad enough i play csgo and minecraft
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @swarfey so the readme is outdated then? https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/#tw-chatonly
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao chiller ahead of his time
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> fun games
10:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Damn
10:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> This Guy OS's
10:31 < bridge> <patiga> yo ChillerDragon wanna play cs sometime?
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i kinda rq since the new update feels like 2fps but sure we can play in december when im back in the same ping zone :D 
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga *
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> wanna play minecraft sometime
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sure
10:35 < bridge> <patiga> Pog
10:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah rip i turned off my server
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my mc server was home hosted
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i never had issues on my vps when using paper so i just did that
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had two issues with vps
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> one was cpu and the other was disk
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah shared cpu really blows
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just can not afford 2tb ssd vps with 4ghz cpu
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and if you wanna do a lil minecrafting without rules you need those specs quickly
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not to mention the 32gb ram
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i could host on my pc  tbh
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i got the 64g ram and ryzen 7900x
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lets meet on 2b2t
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im only a few mil out
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i played on it one time
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the best server
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kinda cring they started to do some rule like shinanigan troling 
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but still the best place for online gaming
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> should someone set a server up
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i really do wanna play
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> love minecraft
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont see my self playing much rn tbh
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> fair enough
10:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna cross of a bit shit from my todos while online and also am doing some offline things
10:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but in a few weeks i might be done for a few days of 24/7 #developer vanilla gaming
10:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> down*
11:04 < bridge> <cyberFighter> 2b2t is mid
11:05 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @edrub
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit scrumplex i didn't realize you signed the prism builds (?)
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i just see ur name pop up on my screen when im trying to do entirely ddnet unrelated shit
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> setting up a minecraft...
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707215120.png
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan yes scrumplex is fakin minecraft famous
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter name anything better than 2b2t
11:28 < bridge> <scrumplex> lol
11:28 < bridge> <scrumplex> Don't worry! You won't have to see my name anymore for the next releases because my codesigning certificate will expire in a few days and getting a new one will cost us like 300 USD
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> messed up
11:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> I hate Apple's anti-consumer and anti-competitive practices
11:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> But their code signing is so easy and cheap compared to Windows
11:29 < bridge> <scrumplex> But their code signing and notarization for macOS is so easy and cheap compared to Windows
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> actually the ms store will sign your code for you if you publish there
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but you would still have unsigned regular builds
11:30 < bridge> <scrumplex> we might do that
11:30 < bridge> <scrumplex> but yeah this sucks
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> no way around it unfortunately
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> need let's encrypt but for app signing
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> dfodes that exist
11:31 < bridge> <vertal2256> й фдд
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is this even english?
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707215489.png
11:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> GithubPT
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol making problems out of nowhere
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use gpg like everyone
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> and provide a checksum
11:53 < bridge> <cyberFighter> literally everything else
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fck im banned on github ... again
12:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon what did u do?
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> create a fresh account and then use it to open 50 pullrequests within 2 minutes
12:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> deserved
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was legit
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> uhhh
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> why do that
12:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not finished since i am banned ...
12:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i rather not share it until i get it to work xd
12:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i thought ur main got banned
12:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes my main
12:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that would be realllly bad
12:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just fork all your projects and youre good
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fork where?
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fork when?
12:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can you see the account when its blocked? :thonk:
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its shadow banned rn
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see all from within the acc from outside its 404
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but you can also get proper locked out also had that already
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same thing happend also to swarfey
12:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I opened a ticket with the support if they do not get it sorted within 24h I will increase my efforts to become less dependent on github
12:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to host own github
12:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> to create as many account as you want
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > create a fresh account and then use it to open 50 pullrequests within 2 minutes
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't sound legit
12:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i created a bunch of forks to github.com/ChillerDragon2 and a bunch of them to gitlab.com but they are always outdated
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yes i totally understand how the ban kicked in seems like a working spam protection
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i mean my use case was legit it was not spam, malicious intent or harm in any way
12:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what did you want to do?
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg do i really have to spill the beans now?
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> yea pls very curious
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no\
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you gonna hate the idea anways xd and then you manage to discourage me so far that i never finish it
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt wanna cause any secrecy here just wanted to blow off some github steam xd
12:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm betting on chat via openingn PRs
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had the idea once to add a /issue command to my game server still think its a cool idea :D 
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich why do u have to be so difficult?
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for non technical users to do quick bug reports in game
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan wats difficult
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> #7691
12:26 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7691
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh ur first pr?
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> no
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "I think this feature is a bit hard for a first-time pull request."
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it's neither
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> hard or my first pr
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send first pr
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6727
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it technically works very well
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's not feature complete
12:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you think accounts will be a bit hard for a first-time pull request?
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich can indeed be a bit of a pain in the ass if you wanna contribute to ddnet <:justatest:572499997178986510> but he is also the reason i can sleep during the night knowing nobody will add garbage to the ddnet codebase xd
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> he's just being intentionally backwards
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> declaring things a certain way but not elaborating
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan the trick is you need to wait until heinrich sleeps then ping deen to check if he is here. Quickly open the pr. deen merges on average in under 24 seconds and maybe heinrich never notices it axaxax
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the best i can hope for
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but i do not want to have to undermine people
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i just want everyone to have the best interest of ddnet in mind
12:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :kek: sneakydragon
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works 7/10
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich obviously does not
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep, I agree
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I explained why I consider the current state of the PR a hack
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> your explanation makes no sense
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> namely that it touches a physics routine deeply down in order to create a "rescue on kill"
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that should really not be necessary
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> how else do you expect it to happen
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also explained that
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> your only explanation there was that you never thought about that
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in addition to that, I also explained why I don't want the feature at all
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (in its current form, I gave an alternative that could be implemented)
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> your alternative idea sounds much worse
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Besides the problems on the PR. Most ppl don't want to press additional keys to respawn. It simply sucks
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I thought its mostly me arguing with you @heinrich5991 you so seem to do it more than i expected. How are you holding up? Please do not rage quit ._. or can you handle it well?
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think you are the only one wanting it that way
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Practice is really just to not take the game serious
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd assume you mean the high-level think, @jupeyy_keks? I'd assume you also don't want the high-level feature to be implemented in a way that doesn't touch the low-level physics component?
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd assume you mean the high-level thing, @jupeyy_keks? I'd assume you also don't want the high-level feature to be implemented in a way that doesn't touch the low-level physics component?
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As said not judging about the code
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, didn't read that note, sorry
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> also there's not even a rift like you're saying
12:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> I would Just call it a day when roby/Heinrich and or deen say they dont want the Feature, or request Things to be Changed - keep in Mind they have been overlooking ddnet for a Long Time, they know what theyre talking about. Why are people so demanding about certain Things :pepeW:
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Just Change it or call it a day
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> why do you capitalize random words in the sentence
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> it makes it very hard to read
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> German autocorrect
12:36 < bridge> <kaffeine0> "nobody will add garbage to the ddnet codebase" and then we got public `CCharacter::m_MoveRestrictions`  which violates basic OOP ideas and led to bugs which we now have to keep (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5259).
12:37 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I mean that personally I strongly tend to develop a software rather than making a game, and better code review and code quality will payoff by less bugs and easier features implementations. There is a lot of inherited issues, we don't need to contributes to that.
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the thing it replaced was much worse 😅
12:37 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Yeah, I clearly see it ❤️
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> What was the problem for this PR anyway? It looks rather simple
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't understand how else you would want me to implement this
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro, ddnet server code is the worst code base in existence :lol:
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich has an issue with the in-game effects even though literally everyone else i've ever heard talk about it feels differently
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea wopsies happen sure @kaffeine0 but ddnet is the most bug free software i run. Maybe with or after the linux kernel.
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> OOP is a scam perpetrated by satan in order to decrease code quality
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nothing else is that stable
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Code wise I agree with Heinrich
12:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> Why Not Just 100% riir
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> about what
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I thought u meant only the feature itself
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't see what's wrong with the way it's coded right now, nobody has suggested an alternative so i'm kind of lost there
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its haters
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> there's no rift between high level feature / low level spot in code
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That we shouldn't make bad code even less intuitive by hooking random stuff. I'd not blame your code tho
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just the way it has to work to not skip a tick
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not hooking or random
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it's completely unobtrusive
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> did you see the code
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes but the problem isn't your pr
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The problem is that the code sucks now
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> It's not the cleanest but it is quite simple, when touch killtile if practice rescue else die
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes that's how all features are built
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Until it some day breaks
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in `CCharacter::HandleSkippableTiles` you call `Die` or `Rescue` depending on some team state. instead of handling it in the kill routine itself
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> the only other thing that would have to happen for it to be completely functional and light on the servers in every circumstance is to change the rescue behavior to not rescue if the tee is in danger of being killed by external forces
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> why would i handle it htere
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> we are only intending to handle kill tile related deaths
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because then you don't have to handle every call site of it
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> and there is no descriptor for kill tile deaths past world hazard
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> so we can't detect it in that routine
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did it get lost in replies or did you ignore my question on how you are? @heinrich5991  -.-
12:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Im fine thanks
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> he has selective hearing
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> he only hears what he likes
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: thought you were talking to Ewan
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no i meant you
12:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ewan you tend to get aggressive when people disagree with that
12:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ewan you tend to get aggressive when people disagree with you
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i tend to get aggressive when people act irrationally
12:42 < bridge> <learath2> You could probably add a death reason enum and wire it up to die. But honestly it's overengineered, we only want to handle 1 kind of death anyway
12:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (we already have a death reason enum, I think)
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we need to store deaths in a redis queue
12:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yes and the entire point is to avoid triggering any sort of dying code
12:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> Store them in sqlite, i agree
12:43 < bridge> <Ewan> as to,,, not die
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> No, we should send them to a central server through a message queue and mods can rescue remotely if they determine the death reason to be a kill tile
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke ima go to the beach i just ask you later again :p @heinrich5991 
12:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I'm holding up well, I think. sometimes I think, we need better moderation of some things. something you disagree with
12:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: was just typing
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still saw it
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice to hear
12:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hf chiller ;)
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> Gl chiller, dont get to Brown
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> lol what does that mean
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> where's brown
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> Its a Sunny day on the beach, dont want His White ass to get sunburn
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> too brown
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf in this case, it's always a single if, the question is whether it happens in `CCharacter::HandleSkippableTiles` or `CCharacter::Die`
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft 
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I honestly haven't read your full pr:
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - for me a death event always means that the character is gone. That's my intuitive understanding
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you want other logic for kill tiles you should handle it in a function that makes clear that this isn't a death.
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `WEAPON_WORLD` seems like the appropriate death event to catch
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> Or I guess another level of indirection, sure. But that's even more complexity for such a simple thing
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd make even sense for the other call site that @mpft didn't convert
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> what about /kill?
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> im not trying to have it rescue on any world weapon death
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> just kill tiles
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> You need a new `WEAPON_KILLTILE`, which would get translated back to `WEAPON_WORLD` :/
12:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's `WEAPON_GAME`
12:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why?
12:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> WEAPON_WORLD seems appropriate
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait wat
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> I don't have the code up, but is `WEAPON_WORLD` only killtiles?
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok then i agree with ewan actually
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i missunderstood what your idea was vs ewans
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should ofc not be handled inside Die
12:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yes! because you are not dying
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sry @mpft
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I checked. there are a couple of more call sites, most make sense for the rescue on practice thing
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the ones that aren't should probably not be `WEAPON_WORLD` anyway, because it's not the world letting you die
12:49 < bridge> <learath2> Well, if you think of `Die` as a command to the tee that it can refuse, it might make sense 😄
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's like `Freeze`
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you don't handle super in every call site of `Freeze`
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you handle it inside the `Freeze` function
12:50 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the only call site we want to act on
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep that's why super how it is build sucks
12:50 < bridge> <kaffeine0> WEAPON_WORLD has 3 reasons: KillTile, "age" (Character StartTime > Server()->Tick()), and StartTile in certain Team states.
12:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> AGE, and StartTile while saving should be `WEAPON_GAME`
12:50 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if rescue would work after tick restart 😄
12:50 < bridge> <Ewan> no you die instantly
12:50 < bridge> <Ewan> that's why this is basically the only way to do it
12:50 < bridge> <Ewan> without major surgery
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym, you can change the reasons
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not major surgery
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I feel like I'm being ignored 😦
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont want to make you feel that way
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> IMHO the problem is:
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we handle tile events directly
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead we should return a list of events that happened to the tee and then handle it cleanly all at once
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the kill tile should not decide if it actually kills
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> if you can guarantee that changing the weapon won't cause a behavior discrepancy across versions i can go for that
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can think of those "events" as the method calls to the character
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then the die call knows about the character
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is already bad imo
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it should only know about the shape of the caracter and it's own shape and what event it can cause
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> modularity for the win
12:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in OOP speak, calling methods is actually "sending messages" btw
12:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> (Infclass actually uses such "refuse to die" trick and it works well; https://github.com/infclass/teeworlds-infclassR/blob/19ba18f65f98ee3f95ab0d301b7d84a801aa4a39/src/game/server/infclass/entities/infccharacter.cpp#L1837)
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah OOP sucks, if done like that 😂
12:53 < bridge> <learath2> I think you mean `HandleTiles`, `Die` has to know what a character is and which character it's acting on to kill it
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> think hierarchically, think modular
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a character can know about kill tiles, but then a kill tile can't know about character
12:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think changing the death reasons will not cause problems
12:54 < bridge> <learath2> This is like the one part of OOP that doesn't suck wym? 😄
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends, i don't directly mean that Die should not know it, but the kill tile logic should not know about die
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it's extremly bad
12:55 < bridge> <learath2> Methods?
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in dd-pg that's the main reason i struggle to adopt vanilla code
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, the way all logic knows about every other logic
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with that you can very hard to read code
12:56 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> black penis
12:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> any `Die` function should be responsible for character deaths, but should stay decoupled
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is how I would do it if I was the one making it
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see what you mean. Yesh that is not great
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i prefer to sometimes take the black pill and push events to an upper component to let this decide
12:56 < bridge> <Ewan> real
12:56 < bridge> <Ewan> :(
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> Nooooo
12:56 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> 😦
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> He was contributing to the discussion
12:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> mod striked again :(
12:56 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> 😭
12:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it wasnt hurting nobody
12:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm out for now, other stuff calls
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> This is also good design. But changing the entire tile handling is a little out of the scope of this PR. And is very risky, we can break physics
12:58 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> black pencil
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, that's why i told ewan it's not his fault xDD
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbh i compltely missread the whole convo from start xD
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one thing is clear: i hate mobile devices
12:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> rule nr. 69 on DDNet = even while fixing physic bugs or similar physic related things is fairly easy and can be done fast - we do NOT touch physics - ever - under any circumstances (atleast not before ddnet 2.0 comes out)
12:59 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Nope, there is another option. KillTile does not have to know about the character. There is a third object (GameController) which knows about the character and about the tiles, and then it can inform the character that it is dying for a reason R. I do it like that in Infclass (https://github.com/infclass/teeworlds-infclassR/blob/19ba18f65f98ee3f95ab0d301b7d84a801aa4a39/src/game/server/infclass/infcgamecontroller.cpp#L529)
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, could work
12:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> isnt that a thing already? where functions like `die` dont know about the actual player's identity or state, but rather knows about his physical presence? or am i confusing myself
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if handle tiles is nice in character is a different topic anyway 😄
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe other entities want the same logic 😄
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to me if i'd mod, i'd expect tiles to know about shape of itself and some entity. then it can say "yo bro, i got hit"
13:01 < bridge> <exosphere__endosphere> 🩷 🩷 🩷 ❤️
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 💚
13:02 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Note: in teeworlds-0.7 the kill tiles handling is moved to Collision: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/4880ec002fc8bdc41022ea486f68681317b7f256#diff-d76009083687ba43c59dc7bb2c7357457c999c2eb9d913967d598e913c6fd01f
13:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think Ewan's feature will be a great addition and QoL when the discussion about code hierarchy is set, and it can be changed accordingly (if even neccessary) - because that's what seems to be worrying heinrich the most(?)
13:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> well, my break is over since 30 minutes, back to work i guess
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like the feature too, but i don't review ddnet server prs and don't want to judge about them generally xdd
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my brain can't handle it
13:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> just RiiR and Ryo will take over
13:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> ez
13:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> no more python scripts, no more C
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> am i in heaven?
13:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:pepewiggle:1106645566819147856>
13:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> ddnet 2.0 is set to be 100% Rust, ddnet 3.0 will be 100% Edlang
13:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> letsgoo
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly voxel rq, he was team ddnet 2.0
13:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> team ddnet 2.0 while he hated on rust infront of me an ryo? damn maybe i shouldnt have bullied him away
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now only teams left are:
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - heinrich & learath
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - robsterbyte & me
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - zwelf & patiga
13:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> you forgot me and @nouaa
13:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> (he promised)
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
13:07 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is it true that ddnet 2.0 come with account system ?
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we'll see
13:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what's the prize for winners?
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on which team finished first
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> endless pride & glory
13:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> i feel like we have 20 contributors, and we're just waiting for an initial commit XD
13:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> in other words nothing?
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to win bcs of this awesome prize
13:08 < bridge> <diariesvexar> which team are in account system side ?
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am generally in, but not high prio
13:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh god please dont start an account discussion :monkaStop:  not again
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> realistically, if learath would just do centralized "normal" account system, then this is most likely
13:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if you win ill have ur tee skin above my bed
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that motivates me by 300%
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0 * 300% = 0 tho
13:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah gg
13:09 < bridge> <diariesvexar> after account system ddnet database get reset am i right ?
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i mean it will be there coz you will be famous
13:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> that's not set either
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> reset defenitely not. maybe a season 2 would come, if at all
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think that once was the original plan
13:09 < bridge> <diariesvexar> hmm make sense
13:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> the thought about it was there, and so many people f4'd on deen's announcement about it the idea got dumped immediatly
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, deen simply forgot he has a child and wife and life
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think many ppl actually wanted smth like that
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have a link to the original announcement?
13:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> i was just looking for it, but i forgot deen's wording and forgot when he said that lmao
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> same xdd
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or he deleted it
13:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> could be xD
13:20 < bridge> <nouaa> lol
13:20 < bridge> <deen> Season 2 was planned to be all set up before my kid was born, but then I got lazy again
13:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek: thats totally understandable
13:20 < bridge> <nouaa> :kek:
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
13:21 < bridge> <nouaa> congrats tho
13:21 < bridge> <deen> Thanks
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to his child which was born exactly on the day when ddnet was released?
13:21 < bridge> <deen> I also started a new job around that time, now that I think about it
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes congrats to planing it this accurately xdd
13:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> aw yeah, everything's coming together
13:23 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I have an idea for ddnet 2.0 let me send it
13:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I actually remember there were much more f3 than f4

13:24 < bridge> <diariesvexar> ok
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Subset of mkv
13:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> add it onto the github discussion :) #3411

13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> respect for the music, but was.. that.. your suggestion? :P
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
13:28 < bridge> <diariesvexar> able to see each other gameskin and emoticon in case that exist in assets otherwise show as default
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dd pg will have it
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> ^
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Support team robyte and me then
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
13:29 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is it possible to ddnet have it ?
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sure
13:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> can we have ddnet run doom @jupeyy_keks ?
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think that will work yes
13:30 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that client that i test it is old version before ddnet add it's own assets tab in settings
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> With the unsafe graphics modules you could also create a 3d game I think
13:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> I created this card in 0XF todo list about a year ago xd

13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> trying to make a native paper image for the fun of it
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> building is borked on windows
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> so i had to bust out the wsl to apply the patches
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> fingers crossed
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @chairn can u remind me what u were researching? (hardware related)
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> if you want to help build authentic DDNet in Rust, you could help @zwelf2 at https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame with reimplementing the physics accurately. Zwelf has extensive tests (more than 1000) for all kinds of physics interactions, even for many components which are not implemented yet. Easiest way to start is probably dming Zwelf directly or opening an issue on how to best contribute :)
14:25 < bridge> <learath2> I think it was related to voltage glitching
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ do you know BeaR/cinaera ?
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think he told me once he was working on vulkan stuff but not sure.
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I've heard of them
14:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Have you heard of ChillerDragon?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No, only ws-client
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ @patiga pls build something like this for tw ui https://jsfiddle.net/ I wanna update this float and see live updates in my browser ``View.VSplitRight(15.0f, &NumberPicker, &FindEmptySlot);`` thanks
15:34 < bridge> <patiga> I'll let jup take this one
15:34 < bridge> <patiga> 🏃

15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rust is no script lang. But ddpg offers hot reload
15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye hot reload is nice and all
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So u can at least see changes without requiring to restart
15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i want fiddle
15:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i u want do, do it :santatrollet:
15:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: if u want do, do it :santatrollet:
15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want only 4 lines of code and share snippets in here
15:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: if u want it, do it :santatrollet:
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then write rust scriptlang
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just hotcompile wasm with wasm
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cant be that hard
15:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
15:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat dude im not wgpu wasm whatever rust in the browser C++ in the browser pro like them
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> write it in js :gigachad:
15:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i would do it i would fake it with html classes that emulate the tw ui code
15:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes in js xd
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why do you even need it
15:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to play with ui code
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707230532.png
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> look at this big F
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna quickly fiddle around to manage to get it into row 3
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or wait actually the N
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude everything is messed up fk it ima go sleep

22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> The Ubuntu workflows are hanging in the CI after the line `http: task done: https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json` in the log :monkaS:
22:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does hot reload mean in this context? does it keep the state or is it more like a map change?
22:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and they're still passing?
22:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like they make no progress, not sure if merging is possible :/
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd consider it a problem if they still passed ^^
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that depends on how you code it but for ui it doesnt keep the state
