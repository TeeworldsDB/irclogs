21:16 < GamerBoy> oh ok thank you
21:16 < GamerBoy> its not this important that you have to stop working :D
21:16 < o_be_two> sure but i know how its frustrating to get stuck on these kind of stupid players and not be able to do something ^^
21:17 < o_be_two> and for DDNet it's important that you enjoy you gaming time :)
21:18 <@EastByte> GamerBoy: looks like we currently have no one moderating the zcatch servers (Savander left recently)
21:18 < GamerBoy> ok thank you :D
21:19 < o_be_two> EastByte: is it same access for zcatch and ddnet ddrace ?
21:19 < o_be_two> or is it just not the same staff ?
21:20 < o_be_two> And why Savander left us :( ?
21:20 <@EastByte> zcatch is running on GER with a seperate config
21:21 < o_be_two> oh ok

21:22 <@EastByte> not sure why he left
21:26 < o_be_two> ok
21:27 < o_be_two> i cant access to this link EastByte 
21:27 <@EastByte> oh right, that's internal
