00:24 < savander> good night guys
05:07 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
05:08 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:00 < pause> Hello guys
10:16 < laxadedi> Hello pause !
10:27 < pause> laxadedi: sup my nigga ?
10:31 < laxadedi> pause: not much, still doing some sys admin for the school :)
10:34 < laxadedi> what's difference in shell script between "cat toto; cat titi" and "cat toto && cat titi"
10:37 < pause> a ; b means exec a then b
10:37 < pause> a && b means exec a then b _if_ a process return value === 0
10:37 < pause> Can do the opposite with ||
10:43 < laxadedi> ok nice
12:17 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
12:24 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
13:29 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
13:30 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
13:31 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
13:35 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
15:21 < Savander> hi
15:24 <+o_be_one> hi
16:23 <@EastByte> deen: we should protect ddnet servers against being used for reflection (e.g. storing dst ips and limit out data)
16:25 <@EastByte> would be horrible if ovh decides to cancel the service because of udp flooding from our servers
17:15 <@deen> hi
17:16 <@EastByte> hey
17:16 <@deen> EastByte: i don't think the attackers would notice how to do that any time soon, but yes, it's necessary
18:23 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
18:24 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
18:25 <@deen> laxadedi: no more videos for Hall of Fame?
18:25 < laxa> Nop :(
18:25 < laxa> Need more advertising for it I guess
18:25 < laxa> or people just don't care
18:26 < laxa> I have tab open on the upload, checking everyday
18:32 < KinG_> hi all
18:32 <@EastByte> hi
18:34 < KinG_> EastByte: i want to order a new vps i don't know how to fill these host field things can u help me?
18:35 < KinG_> hi xRoThx  u here too :P
18:35 <@EastByte> if it's english yes
18:35 < KinG_> host name
18:35 <@EastByte> it's just the name of your hostsystem
18:36 < KinG_> ddnet.tw?
18:36 < KinG_> i want vps for deen
18:36 <@EastByte> ddnet.tw is a domain
18:36 <@EastByte> you can use any name you want
18:36 <@EastByte> deen: MOAAR servers
18:36 < KinG_> ns1 prefix
18:36 < KinG_> ns2 prefix
18:37 <@EastByte> hm not sure
18:37 < KinG_> :|
18:37 < laxa> dunno too
18:37 < laxa> ignore
18:37 <@EastByte> fill in random stuff
18:37 < laxa> anyway
18:37 <@EastByte> always wrks
18:37 < laxa> you can change it later
18:37 < KinG_> so i use irn.ddnet.tw
18:37 < laxa> no
18:37 < laxa> if you need to configure reverse
18:37 < laxa> yeah, you can use that
18:37 < laxa> but otherwise, don't use it I guess
18:37 < KinG_> i don't have domin
18:38 < KinG_> can any of u call deen to come here?:|
18:40 < KinG_> hello anyone here?:|
18:41 <@EastByte> it doesn't really matter what yuo type in there
18:41 < KinG_> okay
18:52 <@deen> hi
18:52 < KinG_> hello deen 
18:52 <@deen> KinG_: enter nothing, doesn't matter
18:53 < KinG_> it says u have to enter something
18:53 <@deen> enter something useless
18:53 < KinG_> i entered and guess what NOT ENOUGH MONEY :| and we can't find bor :|
18:54 <@EastByte> you usually buy a service knowing whether you can affort it :P
18:55 < KinG_> in iran servers are so expensive and we are 3 guys paying for it and bor didn't pay and he is offline for about 3 days
18:57 <@EastByte> nice of you
19:03 < KinG_> !peak
19:03 < Nimda> Current channel peak for #ddnet: 26 users online at 2014-10-07 22:44:23 (14 days, 20 hours, 18 minutes and 59 seconds ago)
19:03 < KinG_> !ddnetpeak

19:03 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
19:12 < xRoThx> Yo 
19:13 < xRoThx> Sorry, was busy a bit ^^^
19:13 < xRoThx> How is it going? 
19:13 <@deen> hi
19:13 <@deen> how's what going?
19:14 < xRoThx> DDnet, servers, ddos, 
19:14 <@deen> still some ddos
19:14 <@deen> GER will be cancelled in 8 days
19:14 <@deen> instead we're trying out the EUR server now
19:14 < xRoThx> Oh? 
19:14 < xRoThx> Should I host them? 
19:15 <@EastByte> also attacks are likely 99% efficient against gameservers
19:15 <@deen> xRoThx: how can you host them?
19:15 <@EastByte> do you have >10gbit/s bandwidth?
19:15 < xRoThx> EastByte:  Does that matter? 
19:16 < xRoThx> I don't think so
19:16 <@EastByte> well the attacks can't be blocked
19:16 <@EastByte> and seem to be cheap for the attacker
19:16 < xRoThx> deen:  I could probably try
19:17 < xRoThx> We will see
19:17 < KinG_> deen:  can't u just make a botnet and use it to block attacks i mean reverse proxy them so the attacks will go on the botnet instead of ddnet servers?
19:17 <@deen> no idea how that would work, KinG_ ^^
19:17 <@EastByte> distributed hosting yes
19:17 < KinG_> deen:  in iran someone did it it was called PersGame they had a GTA server
19:22 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
19:25 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
19:44 <@deen> apparently nfoservers really has some ddos protection
19:54 <@EastByte> they have multiple locations right?
20:02 <@deen> who knows!
20:02 <@deen> apparently they're in frankfurt, but internap has 2 more locations in europe
20:17 <@deen> xRoThx is installing Debian on his server now, guess we will see a ddos soon on it
20:17 <@deen> especially if i let the next tournament run on it
20:19 <@EastByte> give it a try
20:19 <@deen> yours as well
20:19 <@deen> i have 2 tournament maps ready
20:19 <@deen> both are kind of solo
20:20 <@deen> one is a 1 min map, that would be played for 30min - 1hour to get best time
20:20 <@deen> the other is a brutal 1 dummy map
20:20 <@EastByte> so running one tournament on both servers or each at a time?
20:20 <@deen> definitely on all servers at once
20:20 <@deen> people always complain about ping on FRA
20:21 <@deen> so EUR and GER2 could be better
20:21 <@EastByte> well, maybe start GER2 tournament server first
20:21 <@EastByte> and EUR later
20:21 <@deen> why?
20:21 <@EastByte> so we can primary see GER2's stability
20:21 <@EastByte> and eur as fallback
20:22 <@deen> i'd have guessed that you want to see EUR tested^^
20:22 <@deen> nfoservers is so expensive
20:22 <@EastByte> well eur can't stand the hallowed faker's attack anyway
20:22 <@deen> oh?
20:22 <@deen> he attacked already?
20:22 <@EastByte> nah
20:22 <@EastByte> but no firewall rule can handle his attack
20:22 <@EastByte> fra3.dump
20:22 <@deen> ah
20:23 <@deen> yes, indeed
20:23 <@EastByte> should I enable permanent mitigation?
20:23 <@EastByte> did you do that on HH?
20:23 <@deen> and it's the OVH network so we have tested it against this attack a few times and seen that it fails
20:23 <@deen> permanant mitigation is always on on HH i think
20:23 <@EastByte> ah
20:23 <@deen> (from what i understood in french)
20:23 <@EastByte> ^^
20:24 <@EastByte> I'll get a closer look at the ovh api
20:24 <@EastByte> maybe they have some hidden feature
20:24 <@EastByte> like deep packet inspection (dropping all packets with 'HTTP' at the beginning would be nice :P)
20:25 <@deen> haha, would be too nice
20:32 <@EastByte> ah CBanPool has a hash table
20:32 <@EastByte> so it should be really efficient
20:32 <@deen> nice
20:33 <@deen> i failed the hash table question at my exam today :P
20:33 <@EastByte> haha :P
20:33 <@EastByte> how did it look like?
20:33 <@deen> it was an oral exam
20:33 <@EastByte> oh
20:33 <@deen> about how to optimize the hash tables in van embde boa trees
20:34 <@EastByte> everyone having oral exams^^
20:34 <@deen> (in practically efficient implementations of vEB trees)
20:35 <@EastByte> hmm
20:37 < eeeee> omg that looks horrible
20:37  * eeeee glad CBanPool is not a vEB tree
20:37  * EastByte has no idea about vEB tree's :)
20:37 < eeeee> yeah i just read the wiki article
20:38 < eeeee> never heard of it before
21:01 < Savander> lol
21:01 < Savander> weird
21:01 < Savander> something block me connection to my vps server ( only VNC worked)
21:01 < Savander> blocked*
21:02 < Savander> but when i reboted server, all back works
21:02 < Savander> ahm?..
21:03 < Savander> poeple didn't see servere too :c
21:03 <@EastByte> is it a windows vps?
21:03 < Savander> linux
21:03 < Savander> debian 7
21:04 <@EastByte> okay
21:04 <@EastByte> just was confused because of vnc
21:04 < Savander> filemedia
21:05 < Savander> Every VPS has
21:05 < Savander> VNC 
21:05 < Savander> in filemedia ofc :PP
21:05 <@EastByte> if it's kvm I can understand
21:05 < Savander> i guess
21:06 <@deen> Savander: sounds like your network was dead?
21:06 < Savander> don't know, but ye
21:06 < Savander> sound like that
21:06 < Savander> when i send ticket to support
21:07 < Savander> "Hello,  then something blocks the connection to the vnc server. Check your settings, browser, firewall and java settings. Your vps is running on the node, vnc connection works and shows the debian login.  No issue related to us."
21:25 < xRoThx> bye
21:26 < xRoThx> Have a nice evening
21:26 < xRoThx> :)
21:26 <@EastByte> cya
21:35 <@deen> nice performance on nfoservers
21:36 <@deen> 8 seconds for compile
21:36 <@deen> don't know how to call the server
21:36 <@deen> we have too many^^
21:43 <@deen> wow, nice server
21:43 <@deen> better ping than on datafabrik
21:43 <@deen> only icmp is 10 ms slower, but doesn'T matter
21:44 <@EastByte> icmp is slower?!?
21:44 <@deen> yeah, i guess they throttle it somehow
21:44 <@deen> oh, now it's fixed
21:44 <@EastByte> hmkay
21:44 <@deen> maybe they just had an attack
21:58 <@EastByte> so ddnet currently has 11 servers
21:58 <@deen> ^^
21:58 <@deen> temporarily
22:00 <@deen> we have to decide soon which to keep
22:05 <@EastByte> hmm
22:07 <@deen> I'm not moving over the ictf servers and so on
22:07 <@deen> just ddrace
22:07 <@deen> too much work, need to decide first
22:08 <@deen> also, I'll just let EUR and FRA run as they are
22:09 <@EastByte> well the website should run on a server without gameservers
22:09 <@deen> it does
22:09 <@EastByte> and the acc server later has to run on a server with unknown ip
22:09 <@deen> yes
22:09 <@EastByte> and you can't change the ip in kimsufi
22:10 <@EastByte> isn't the kimsufi one too expensive only for website and irc?
22:10 <@deen> yes, it is
22:11 <@deen> I'm just letting it run out
22:11 <@EastByte> okay
22:11 <@deen> unfortunately i paid for it 1 day before hearing about HH^^
22:11 <@deen> but i think we should let HH run out too, ping is too high for my taste
22:11 <@EastByte> don't forget the downtime
22:11 <@deen> yes
22:12 <@deen> they're not that professional
22:12 <@deen> weird stuff happens
22:12 <@EastByte> soo only ger2 will be left
22:13 <@EastByte> and eur
22:13 <@EastByte> in europe
22:13 <@deen> don't know what will happen with these 2 in ddos
22:13 <@deen> i want just 1 server for europe actually
22:14 <@EastByte> I would like to know how nfoservers react if the ddos gets too heavy
22:15 <@deen> apparently they shut down the server
22:15 <@deen> http://www.nfoservers.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=4931
22:15 <@EastByte> yea but how do they do it with other gameservers
22:16 <@EastByte> I mean, an opensource game the main target of ddos attacks, they will be like "what is this"
22:16 <@EastByte> tiny kirbys dragging each other
22:16 <@deen> I like their suggestion
22:16 <@deen> "In order to reduce attacks, we strongly recommend avoiding confrontations with troublemakers. Instead, be polite and direct; if you need to ban them, let them know why in simple terms, then do it. It is important to completely ignore them after this -- if they try to initiate a chat, don't respond, and if they try to post on a forum, delete the post and ban the user there. Ensure that everyone associated with your server ignores them in the same way; if someone refuses to, that person will need to also be banned."
22:17 <@deen> oh wow
22:17 <@deen> "We now have a "Firewall" page for all game servers and VDSes that can be used to examine the traffic hitting an IP and to apply filters. For Linux servers and VDSes, these filters include string-matching and length-based rules, allowing for a powerful way to stop most (D)DoS attacks that are small enough not to overwhelm the 1 Gbps physical network adapter on the machine."
22:17 <@EastByte> yea that's the common rule against trolls
22:17 <@deen> String-matching!
22:17 <@deen> ah wait
22:17 <@deen> that's iptables^^
22:17 <@deen> should have read to end
22:17 <@EastByte> hmm would have been crazy^^
22:18 <@EastByte> I can write my own netfilter modules :P
22:18 <@deen> but this is what I've heard before about nfoservers: "If you go over 20 gigabits per second on a attack, they'll nullroute your IP but won't shut down your server."
22:18 <@EastByte> okay
22:22 < laxa> https://www.roxservers.com/gameservers.php
22:22 < laxa> but you don't have full control of server, apparently it's on windows
22:22 < laxa> not interesting for ddnet
22:22 < laxa> but still wondering how they can offer unlimited ram and such a good CPU for 3euros/month...
22:23 < KinG_> unlimited ram? :O
22:24 <@deen> oh, i was at university today
22:24 <@deen> and i overheard some guys talking about teeworlds :P
22:24 <@EastByte> :D
22:24 < KinG_> u talked with them about who u are? :P :D
22:24 <@deen> of course not
22:24 <@EastByte> ask them whether they know east :)
22:25 < KinG_> why not? :D
22:25 < KinG_> everyone knows u in teeworlds :D
22:25 <@deen> i think they were just installing ubuntu and saw teeworlds in the installer^^
22:25 <@EastByte> haha
22:27 < KinG_> :D
22:28 < KinG_> what when u are installing ubuntu "TeeWorlds" is shown there?!
22:28 <@EastByte> yea
22:28 < KinG_> WTF
22:28 <@EastByte> since quite a long time
22:28 < KinG_> :|
22:28 <@EastByte> well it's the best opensource game :P
22:29 < KinG_> :+|
22:29 < KinG_> :P :D
22:29 < KinG_> i want to learn c++ :((
22:29 <@EastByte> just do it
22:29 < KinG_> i don't know where to begin i know c# and it's pretty simple to learn and work with
22:29 < KinG_> but c++ ...
22:30 < KinG_> i think i should just ask my programming teacher ^^
22:30 <@EastByte> to understand c++ you should get into lowlevel programming
22:30 < KinG_> like what?!
22:30 <@EastByte> otherwise you won't understand why it's more complicated then other langs
22:30 < KinG_> Visual Basic?!
22:30 <@EastByte> basic is high
22:31 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
22:31 < Nimda> New server detected : DDNet GER2!
22:31 <@EastByte> languages like C are lowlevel
22:31 < KinG_> "C" ?!!!!!
22:31 <@EastByte> yea
22:31 < KinG_> i heard somthing about it
22:31 < KinG_> it's machine lang
22:31 <@deen> no^^
22:31 <@EastByte> learn how a cpu works, then learn C
22:31 < KinG_> not the C
22:31 <@EastByte> maybe some asm at the beginning
22:31 <@deen> that's the bottom up approach, EastByte =)
22:32 < KinG_> the "lowlevel" langs ^^
22:32 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
22:32 < KinG_> :|
22:32 <@EastByte> deen: much easier then vice versa
22:32 <@EastByte> you don't get frustrated and so no
22:32 <@EastByte> so on*
22:32 <@deen> i don't even remember how i learned all that =/
22:32 <@EastByte> I do :D
22:32 < KinG_> u guys know a website for basic c++ programming? ^_^
22:33 <@EastByte> I started with html, got to php (understood common programming things) and went directly to C
22:34 <@EastByte> and plain C is really simple if yo understand memory things
22:34 < KinG_> like what?
22:35 <@deen> hm, shit
22:35 < KinG_> just tell a website that teaches how to work with "C" :P
22:35 <@EastByte> google for it
22:35 <@EastByte> I won't do it for you^^
22:35 <@deen> GER2 ping went up again
22:35 <@deen> this time ingame as well
22:35 < KinG_> i did and found nothing intresting ^^
22:35 <@deen> server doesn't look very stable already
22:36 <@EastByte> hm stable for me
22:37 <@deen> EastByte: where are you?
22:37 <@EastByte> was on a solo server fly out of hell
22:37 < KinG_> :|
22:37 < KinG_> u want to finish it?:|
22:37 <@deen> you have same ping as before?
22:37 <@EastByte> yea
22:37 <@EastByte> 64 bytes from 95.172.92.151: icmp_seq=2 ttl=54 time=32.7 ms
22:38 <@deen> mine is up to 42
22:38 <@deen> from 20 before
22:38 < KinG_> 246 for me
22:38 < KinG_> and it's stable
22:39 < KinG_> so much stable :| it pings only 246 WTF:P
22:40 < nuborn> hi
22:40 < KinG_> hey
22:41 < KinG_> EastByte:  what editor should i use for "C" is it possible to compile it with Visual Studio?!
22:42 <@EastByte> don't use an ide like visual studio
22:42 <@EastByte> first you should learn how to command a compiler manually
22:42 <@EastByte> just write programs in notepad
22:42 < KinG_> it's hard :|
22:42 <@EastByte> and install mingw
22:43 < laxa> lol EastByte
22:43 < laxa> crazy man
22:43 < laxa> 'notepad'
22:43 < KinG_> :D
22:43 <@EastByte> what?
22:43 < laxa> notepadd++
22:43 <@EastByte> you surely can type a hello world in it or nt?
22:43 < laxa> yes you can
22:43 < laxa> but basic windows notepad is more than total shit
22:43 < KinG_> yep ^^
22:43 <@EastByte> also by notepad I mean a simple texteditor
22:44 < laxa> and you can use VS for C
22:44 <@EastByte> KinG_: better start using linux before you dive into _nice_ development :P
22:44 < KinG_> i already wrote lots of viruses with c# :P
22:45 <@EastByte> then I guess you are a scriptkiddie
22:45 <@EastByte> C# is the most abused language in that way
22:45 < KinG_> virus? :D
22:46 < KinG_> http://s5.picofile.com/file/8147309800/WindowsFormsApplication11.exe.html
22:46 <@EastByte> used by kids for writing malware
22:46 < KinG_> i'm not a kid :|
22:46 < KinG_> i wrote good things too :P
22:47 < eeeee> cool virus.exe bro
22:47 < eeeee> why don't you show us the source code instead
22:48 < KinG_> it kills "cssrs" :P
22:48 < KinG_> http://s5.picofile.com/file/8147310300/WindowsFormsApplication3.exe.html
22:48 < KinG_> this is a calculator i swear :D
22:49 <@EastByte> "i wrote good things too :P"
22:49 <@EastByte> calculators always are good :)
22:49 < eeeee> dude nobody is gonna run any of your virus executables
22:49 < eeeee> if you wanna show off your mad c# skillz you have to share the code
22:49 < KinG_> okay
22:50 < KinG_> i don't have mad c# skils just basic to moderate :P
22:50 < KinG_> http://s5.picofile.com/file/8147310518/Form1.cs.html
22:50 < KinG_> the source
22:50 < KinG_> of the calculator :D
22:50 < KinG_> :P
22:51 < KinG_> click the big button under ads
22:51 < KinG_> now what eeeee  u saw it's not a virus?
22:51 < eeeee> KinG_: http://pastie.org/ has no ads
22:52 < laxa> 404
22:52 < KinG_> censored from iran
22:52 < KinG_> another website?
22:52 <@deen> I'm disappointed that my adblocker doesn't block iranian ads :P
22:52 <@EastByte> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/

22:54 < KinG_> 123 test
22:54 < KinG_> i'm still here?!
22:55 <@deen> yes
22:55  * eeeee faintly remembers using kerio winroute in win95
22:55 < KinG_> :D
22:56 < KinG_> http://pastie.org/private/okscwolrjgpmdxkfhplvba
22:56 <@EastByte> ehh
22:56 <@EastByte> koay
22:57 <@EastByte> you coudln't leave out the credits do you :P
22:57 < KinG_> http://pastie.org/private/1xie9f0gvsnntvowdagzw
22:57 < KinG_> :D
23:02 < KinG_> is there a way to write programs for TW in c# ?
23:02 <@EastByte> sure you just need to understand how tw works
23:02 < KinG_> i don't ^^
23:03 < KinG_> for that i should learn c++ first right?!
23:03 <@EastByte> you should learn programming in general
23:03 <@EastByte> it looks like you used C# like a pure macro language
23:03 < KinG_> i'm trying to learn (php,html,c#,VisualBasic,c++,flash) ^^
23:04 < KinG_> mostly c#
23:04 < KinG_> i like it
23:05 <@EastByte> I recommend to use php for learning purposes
23:05 < KinG_> we have 2 books for php at school i guess i'll learn it this year
23:05 <@EastByte> in C# you end up just pasting things together
23:06 < KinG_> i like c# mostly for IS i can use scripts ".DLL(S)"in mw3 to edit maps or make new mods :P
23:07 <@EastByte> if you would start learning it you even would know what dlls actually are :)
23:08 < KinG_> i know what they are it's hard to explain in english :|
23:09 < KinG_> i'm not so good at programming but i'm working on it  ^^
23:10 <@EastByte> that's good
23:12 <@EastByte> but please stick to learning the basics step by step
23:12 < KinG_> i can't just learn any more from websites i should go to a class or ask my programming teacher
23:12 <@EastByte> why not?
23:13 < KinG_> i can't find anything new from websites
23:13 < KinG_> i learned most of basic things
23:14 <@EastByte> then try to work on small projects and you'll find out where you lack of knowledge
23:14 <@EastByte> the internet has all the information you need
23:15 < KinG_> i can write a program that have some new skins in it for TW and extract them to data/skins them give the player the code to change it in console with player_skin :P
23:16 <@EastByte> well then go a step further and set the skin vars directly without player interaction
23:16 < KinG_> for that i need to know which memory does tw uses to change skin
23:17 <@EastByte> you can just change the config file
23:17 <@deen> (if teeworlds is not running currently)
23:17 <@deen> (and config file depends on the client that's used)
23:17 <@EastByte> well he knows how to kill processes, so...
23:17 < KinG_> i don't know anything about TW config
23:17 < KinG_> i use ddnet ^^
23:17 <@EastByte> open it in a notepad and you will understand
23:18 < KinG_> deen: where can i find the source of ddnet or a normal client?!
23:18 <@deen> EastByte: do you know of a way to find hosters that are colocated in specific data centers?
23:18 <@deen> KinG_: source code?
23:18 <@deen> http://github.com/def-/ddnet
23:18 <@EastByte> nope, I don't
23:19 <@deen> http://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
23:19 < KinG_> thanks
23:19 <@EastByte> hm I have some friend who knows about many datacenters in germany
23:19 <@deen> EastByte: i know 2 data centers in Frankfurt with ddos protection now
23:19 <@EastByte> wanted to talk with him about ddos
23:19 <@deen> but i don't know about any cheap hosters being there
23:19 <@EastByte> maybe because germany lacks of them :P
23:19 <@deen> internap and link11
23:20 <@deen> yes, actually i found a list of all hosters in germany
23:20 <@deen> and went through every single one in frankfurt
23:20 <@deen> ^^
23:20 <@EastByte> :)
23:20 <@deen> i think link11 would be perfect
23:20 <@deen> if you want to talk someone into sponsoring ddnet europe :P
23:21 < KinG_> deen: u know which memory address TW use to change skin? ^^
23:21 <@deen> KinG_: don't manipulate memory addresses of running processes please!
23:21 < KinG_> why?!!!!
23:21 <@deen> KinG_: look into the settings_ddnet.cfg
23:21 <@deen> that's much cleaner
23:22 < KinG_> which line?!
23:22 <@deen> search for skin
23:22 <@deen> you should find something
23:22 <@EastByte> it's a linebased config file
23:22 <@EastByte> try to read it
23:22 < KinG_> so if i want to make a program to change skin automaticaly i should make it to cahnge this line here?!
23:23 <@deen> yes
23:23 < KinG_> is this possible when tw is running?!
23:23 <@deen> EastByte: these kind of sites without any prizes always scare me: http://www.link11.de/produkte/dedicated_server.html
23:23 <@deen> KinG_: no
23:24 < KinG_> deen: i want to make a program that changes skin when the tw is running so i can't use this
23:25 <@EastByte> hm there was a 10mbit/s peak on eur
23:25 <@deen> there is no real interface to do this on windows, KinG_ 
23:26 < KinG_> deen: maybe a injector that injects the dll to proccess? that's why i need address
23:26 <@deen> that sounds really weird
23:28 <@EastByte> KinG_: you need to search for it
23:28 <@EastByte> but the address is not static
23:28 < KinG_> EastByte: where?!search for what?!
23:29 <@EastByte> :/
23:29 < KinG_> yeah.. i should learn c++ then make a client after that make a program for tw in c#
23:29 < KinG_> ...
23:30 <@EastByte> you better stick to simpler programs
23:30 < KinG_> it's easy if i know the memory address that tw use to change skin ^_^
23:31 <@EastByte> that's memory hacking
23:31 < KinG_> kinda
23:31 < KinG_> but in a good way
23:31 < KinG_> oh nvm
23:31 < KinG_> EastByte:  gimme a idea to work on a project or somthing ...
23:32 <@EastByte> well try to parse the config file of tw
23:32 <@EastByte> file management / reading lines / parsing cmd and args
23:33 < KinG_> i know how to write a program that interacts with a file but don't know how to write the line that should change A specific line ^^
23:33 <@deen> EastByte: are you going to write anything to link11?
23:34 <@deen> otherwise i think I'll try, just to see what they have to offer
23:34 <@EastByte> they really scare you ? :P
23:34 <@deen> i mainly think it's useless
23:34 <@EastByte> KinG_: first try to parse it
23:34 < KinG_> what do u mean by "parse"?
23:35 <@EastByte> read line by line and store command+arguments in memory
23:35 < KinG_> by the summary to open it in the memory right?!
23:36 <@EastByte> yea
23:36 < KinG_> going on it
23:36 <@EastByte> and easy access
23:36 <@EastByte> but it's not easy
23:36 < KinG_> it's easy to make it open the file it's so easy but to make it store the data ishould google it :P
23:37 <@EastByte> first try to imagine how it could be done
23:37 < KinG_> let me think
23:37 < KinG_> hmmmmm
23:38 <@EastByte> a command looks like this: <command name> <argument 1> <argument 2>
23:38 < KinG_> maybe
23:38 < KinG_> (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader
23:38 < KinG_> )
23:39 <@EastByte> well don't know what this class is being used for in c#
23:40 <@EastByte> just try to put every line in a string and progress on it using simple string operations
23:40 < laxa> make associative array
23:41 < laxa> settings["command"] = "arguments"
23:41 < KinG_> okay let me try it
23:45 <@EastByte> deen: well it still is nice to know about every hoster in germany :)
23:45 <@EastByte> I go offline, cya guys
23:45 < KinG_> bye
23:46 <@deen> also, accelerated is another data center in frankfurt with ddos protection
23:46 <@deen> bye EastByte 
23:48 < KinG_> laxa:  how should i use the command "open" i mean users/public      or      c:\\users 
23:48 < laxa> dunno
23:48 < laxa> search on stack overflow
23:55 <@deen> apparently link11 starts at about 500 € / month
23:55 < laxa> roflmao
23:55 < laxa> they take drugs ?
23:55 <@deen> that's why everyone hosts ddos protected servers in france^^
