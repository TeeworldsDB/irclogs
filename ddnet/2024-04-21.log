00:25 < bridge_> <murpi> Doesn't look right
00:37 < bridge_> <sans._.> you're welcome
00:38 < bridge_> <sans._.> @murpi oh btw, I found a map which has an entry in releases, but doesnt actually exist
00:39 < bridge_> <sans._.> Mapper link, <https://ddnet.org/mappers/Blue/>
00:39 < bridge_> <sans._.> the map is called Lunar Base
00:39 < bridge_> <sans._.> it redirects to <https://ddnet.org/maps/Lunar-32-Base/> but it says not found
00:39 < bridge_> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1231373788462059620/image.png?ex=6636b934&is=66244434&hm=21b8f0220c8d9e5bcaeb4f18616f423cfc19eb8720a04bb87ff4b36fbdbbdde6&
00:40 < bridge_> <murpi> AFAIK the map was removed from the map pool because it became impossible to complete
00:42 < bridge_> <murpi> (due to a physics change I believe)
00:46 < bridge_> <sans._.> ohh
01:08 < bridge_> <gumbatw> i heard about that also

14:17 < bridge_> <zwelf2> I do see some valgrind errors in my CI run (they are consistent). How can I tell which valgrind errors happen there? The log doesn't tell me https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/8772402693/job/24071298571?pr=8231
16:14 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Because valgrind makes everything slower probably
16:14 < bridge_> <0xdeen> there are actions that happen immediately and not at ticks and having a slower server will make a difference for them
