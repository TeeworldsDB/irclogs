14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird, works for as, can you upload the file somewhere? Is it the original from ddnet-scripts?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for us*
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> yes it's original from ddnet/ddnet-scripts
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> let's me redownload
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> sorry it's original
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> ```

14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, now it makes more sense. You need a releases file
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> i don't know what's that ?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> should I download something to fix this error ?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For your server you'll need a file like that which contains all the map release infos. The official one looks like this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/releases
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> Oh that's make sense now ðŸ˜„
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> thank you
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we kind of have that info duplicated, it's also in the database in record_maps. Should get rid of one of those actually :/
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> my scripts are the opposite of clean as you might have noticed ðŸ˜„
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> I remember that before i downloaded ddnet's database then import record_maps to my server database every weekends ðŸ˜„
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/commit/0127efaa84f9fc01366593730c4b743bc7a0b0e8#diff-5c8a42a95f7e79732340ce9bc407845b
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how did that end up here
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> nice dir
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao I just took everything from ddnet.tw:servers/scripts . Sorry if that shouldn't have been made public :/
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its public anyways but i dont remember putting it in there xd
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i guess that was an accident xd
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie &&|| @jao https://learath2.info/ddnet-windows-latest.zip can you give the multilayer editing a try? I think this is the best I can do
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> colors dont work
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cant change them
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep that broke somehow
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh there is a problem, which color should I display when editing multiple layers?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the one you clicked last?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> does color editing even make sense
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nvm, even for width and height this is not a good way to do this :/
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i think its very rare that you have multiple layers with the same color
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should make it so you need to confirm the edit
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently, as soon as you open the properties box it will set all the layers sizes to the max
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 I can only make all the layers black
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao did u just dox ur self? ðŸ˜„
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wat
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao can you try the last commit again?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this should work
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie https://learath2.info/ddnet-windows-latest.zip I think it's fine now
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesnt apply the color
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 seems perfect to me :D
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe change "commit" to "apply"
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It did apply the color for me, I only tested it with color even
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they both worked for me
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> commit?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the text on the button
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you have to click a button?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but you need to see a preview of the color
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> It's better to have a button imo
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> previews is whatever, you can click the button a few times and make adjustments
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whats the point of having the button if you have to do blind commits anyways
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> only if you wanna preview, it's not blind if you know what yuo want
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess a live preview would be good but then people might think it's final and not click Apply
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u can only know what u want if the tileset is white tho
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no, why?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the color of the tileset influences the result
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah, so?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so how do u know how the result will look like if its not white
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's better to have a button to commit to resizing a layer
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> does it give a preview for resizing?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you're most likely going to scale layers to the size of the entities layer, so you already know what you want
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well if u have no preview u dont know whether u cut something off so thats a blind commit too
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you already know the size of the map
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> all Game layers scale together so you just make all design layers the same size or a bit bigger
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but u dont know the size of every single layer
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if u dont use game layers
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> xD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> show me one map without game layers
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no i mean what if the layers u resize dont include the game layer
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> people will know what layers they wanna resize and how
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and you don't need a preview to imagine what 10+ tiles will look like
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you're doing a fine adjustment
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what if youre doing a bigger adjustment
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant estime such stuff for every layer
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the point is to resize all selected layers to the same size, so they're most likely already the same size
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and it starts from the biggest layer so you're not going to cut anything off unless you make the default number smaller
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think its guaranteed that they are already the same size xd
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then you will make some layers bigger
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> imo yuo're more likely to cut something off if you're doing it "live"
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> imo you're more likely to cut something off if you're doing it "live"
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but then you can at least choose to not commit
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if u have no preview ur fucked if u commit
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> by doing it "live" you commit by default
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so the preview is the final thing, same as pressing the button after every change
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i mean preview + commit
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then people will think the preview is the final thing and have to redo it and press Apply
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> unless you code a whole warning about unsaved changes which is just too much for such a little feature
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did want to do a preview, but it's extremely complicated to rework
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it'd take like 200-300 line change to get layers to get props from a temp object
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess it's a choice between "live edit" and clicking a button, each one is fine with me tbh
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> "live edit' is how it normally works when editing a layer but a button seems kinda safer
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> live edit is easy to do, but as soon as you open the menu it'd commit all the changes
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah, it would make all the layers the same just by opening the menu
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well that is crap xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, and making it not do that would be very hard
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'd just keep it how it is
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well without a preview the commit is blind
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> could have a button that shows a preview only as long as you hold it and then reverts, but it's probably a lot of work
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if it worked live and you clicked something by accident you can't easily revert it, might have to edit several layers back to what they were individually
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so it's good how it is right now imo
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if it's not useful like this I can't really be assed to make it work with a preview, so we won't have the feature
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't we have undo?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its still a decent feature how it is now
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can be improved later
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u should just not do anything dangerous with it for now xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 It's very useful, I can't think of any better way to do it that wouldn't be a mountain of work
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> just don't listen to jao xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> im not against it lol
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw deen why use zsh in a shebang? isnt /bin/sh fine enough for that script? I had to install zsh just to test this simple thing.
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/client/create.sh#L1
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i know it says use zsh in the setup instructions but.. why? ðŸ˜„
17:58 <@deen> because that's what I use, not just if bash has **
17:59 <@deen> otherwise you can replace the ** with an appropriate find command
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea that would be better i guess
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or pass it to grep directl
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/QX
17:59 <@deen> but no one ever used this script except me, so not much need to port it
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so everywhere here you use zsh features?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea but grmpf
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was just wondering and if ** is a zsh exclusive feature thats the response i wanted i guess
18:00 <@deen> it's super annoying to write everything in standard compliant posix shell, and I don't like bash, so for scripts not meant for public consumption I use zsh
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye makes sense
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no thats fine i thought you randomly slapped zsh in some scripts to annoy people ðŸ˜„
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well probably not to annoy but more out of habit
