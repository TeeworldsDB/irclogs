14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> sup heinrich
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> thanks but i already got when i needed!!
14:48 <@heinrich5991> can anyone recommend android distributions? :)
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> like, custom ones ?
15:09 <@heinrich5991> well, what else? what do you mean with 'custom'?
15:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: lineageos, aosp, copperheadOS (but it just imploded)
15:18 <@deen> and copperheadOS used to cost money, but since it's OS you could still compile it on your own for fre
15:18 <@heinrich5991> yea, I used the last one. but now I need something new
15:18 <@deen> Well, I'm begrudgingly on LineageOS, don't really have any alternatives for my phone
15:18 <@deen> what phone do you use?
15:19 <@heinrich5991> nexus 5x
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> just askin, i only knew about custom ROMs for certain models. Not really involved into this :p
15:21 <@deen> and there seems to be a few variations of gapps, some without calling home to google
15:22 <@deen> but to be honest I always just ran LineageOS with OpenGApps, so no experiences with anything else
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Is lineageos something like a custom rom or?
15:25 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS
15:25 <@deen> so yes
15:26 <@deen> At least I get Android 8.1 on my > 4 year old phone thanks to LineageOS
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah Nice i used to have cyanogenmod on my old phone.
15:27 <@deen> yeah, the company behind cyanogenmod also imploded
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This makes me curious to use this one. Always nice, you get the feeling you are using a new phone because of the new software.
15:29 <@deen> most other custom roms are just slight changes to AOSP or LineageOS from what I can tell, so I wouldn't really trust some random kid to modify my phone OS
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But lineqgeOS is trustable
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least seems more so
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> EMui is life
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O im gonna try lineageOS
