00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> it only sends the angle the projectile is directed in, instead of VelX+VelY, in order to save space and make it possible to fit all the data in an ordinary netobject (for easy demo compatibility, etc). if having different speeds is wanted it would be possible to add it though, since there is still some unused space
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn i dont think that such a change is needed, since its been like this always :) and if someone wants to do something like me he knows whats going on and will do it like me i guess
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1746
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Should i implement tee-based zoom?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> If i understand well what u were saying
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don‚Äôt know what people want
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Then ask them via a poll or something idk?

17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> name is pretty offset
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ‚ú™
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> Weapon: Gun
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut can you copy his exact name
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not the name
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Chillingo
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what else is it?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its something else, i noticed the longer the client is opened the more this happens. If i would now restart the client, its gone
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the name only consists of normal letters
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, strange
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> even reconnects dont fix it, it has to be the client timer
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs some uninitialized value
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh, hopefully it wasnt me xd
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think so tbh :P
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i patched text rendering while ago, but honestly i cant think of a timer that can influence it
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know anything about that stuff, you're alone there :D
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u have a terminal on when u play?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe a dbg msg D
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe a dbg msg üòÑ
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope, i turned it off :D
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, did it only appear lately(5 months) and only in x direction?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have another screenshot from 22nd september 2018, also shifted to the right. seems like the text starts at the center of the body, and therefore its shifted to the right
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and there is another screenshot from 20th october 2018, also the same way shifted (starts at the center of the tee)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats more strange then xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u ever experience it with other text than the one over the tee?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nope
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> theres a weird bug going on right now that i already reported once
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> when you go with you crosshair ON TOP OF YOUR TEE you completely lag out
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> you completely freeze and cant do anything
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> im also not the only one experiencing it
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> everyone on the server is as far as i can tell
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> or does it have to ddos somehow?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can't reproduce
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ddos
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> not ddos
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> i just tried it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> got it 2 times and after stopping doing it it also stops
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> just try to put crosshair in the middle of ur tee
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> yeah thats what i meant
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> when you put your crosshair very close to your tee
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut hey one last question, was it already, when he joined the server, or did it happen long time after, without changing the name/going into spectator anything like that
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> can't reproduce aswell, can you record it @Bre3kAcHu ?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> i cant record unfortunately @eNJi
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> not even on phone?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> theres not much to see really
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> the game just freezes like you have 999 ping
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ‚ú™ the player also disconnected, and connected again
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it still was like that
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But client restart solved it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> dont drink and use ddnet :troll:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Bre3kAcHu happend to me but idk why i would say its when ddos occurs cause after a while it didn't happen anymore
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut i mean when it happenend
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not after it
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know exactly when it happened, just noticed it at some poinz
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I guess looking into demos is not usefull since it re-renders everything?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, i'll create an issue for now
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i can make a video
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> done
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://archithedev.tk/files/vids/LAG.mp4
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hi Corantin
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hi Edgar
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> How do i get the value code of a color? I want to set same clan color to orange, but i dont know the value code. Does RGB code work? xd
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is hex
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you just enter the command for the color, without a vlue
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> value*
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There you see some stuff
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao dont you have that converter page on ddnet?
22:18 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/colors.html
22:18 <@deen> but the ddnet client can also convert colors
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I have a converter for old tw colors to new
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea that link
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen how?
22:21 <@deen> player_color_feet<enter> shows you the different conversions
22:21 <@deen> Learath2: where are the formats for entering colors documented?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Deathman you can set colors as hex rgb with $RRGGBB or $RGB
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you give an example jao
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> command $FF00FF
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> player_color_feet $FFFFFF
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> OK thx
