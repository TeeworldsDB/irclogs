00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There has to be a trick to move the stupid shared libs towards the end
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 32 bit = 4,294,967,296 bytes (4 Gigabytes)
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 64 bit = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (16 Exabytes)
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the difference is ridiculous
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if vmmap is open source, I could modify it to snap sooner
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my mobile is also 32bit, should test the map there xD
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it support opengl
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> im dissapointed in your dev team
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> zwelf doesnt know who nouis is
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he is not on this discord
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> yh just talked to him about biggernouis and he had no idea about it
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> and didnt even know nouis
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki even OpenGL es 3.0
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tested it few months ago on android
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what could work? Preallocating a large chunk for this kind of stuff at the very beginning
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'd call this map the worst case
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2660x1100 or smth like that
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with many layers
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LARGEADDRESSAWARE works
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I'm sure we are breaking something with that so I'll enable top-down allocation to see what breaks ðŸ˜›
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you can maybe disable ASLR to map libraries to places you want
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not a good idea though
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but an interesting exploit target)
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway from 2gb you dont get to use much if at all for your heap
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So keep that in mind next time working on 32bit stuff
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the reason for allocating 250MB btw?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a lot
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That you'll have to ask @Jupstar âœª
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe there is a way to upload it to the gpu in chunks? I honestly wouldn't know
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe a way to avoid making a copy of it
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah this allocation is just massive I see why it won't fit now that I've turned on LARGEADDRESSAWARE
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pix
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I think this is a viable(tm) solution. Forcing malloc to return memory top-down didn't break any of our libraries either
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LARGEADDRESSAWARE you mean?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well its allocating the vertices
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LARGEADDRESSAWARE gets us well large addresses
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> forcing the top down allocation lets me make sure the larger addresses that can now be returned by malloc doesn't break any library
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the largest snapshot I managed to capture but it gets a little larger than this, no way to get faster than 1s intervals in vmmap
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807028944904912946/unknown.png
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is with large addresses, with small addresses the huge orange blocks don't fit above the first purple nor is there enough contiguous memory anywhere after the first purple
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> appereantly one layer is pretty full of tiles, didntr check tho if true
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if this stupid tool was integrated into VS I could debug it even further
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, with only small addresses this is the largest heap I could capture
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807030112033833010/unknown.png
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That white block in the middle is 260M so I guess we are making a huge deallocation that's causing fragmentation
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> freezebg is 2415*1620 tiles
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> each tile consumes 4 vertices
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> each vertex 24 bytes
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, I just need more resolution, idk why that happens
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is enough space but that 260M block is just left empty for some reason
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> factorio only renders stuff near the player I think
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (given that the world is unbounded, they have to do that in some way)
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> factorio is in a class of optimization of it's own, us mere mortals can't achieve that
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think they had a blog post about that
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they render each layer near the player
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the things they come up with to cut 1ms from their pipeline really should be inspiration to us all
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then just render new stuff as the player moves
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I can code tooling to figure out why the allocator is skipping that 260m block
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe a high resolution memory map
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe dig into some very old blogs to figure out what they did back in Windows XP
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it has nothing todo with the rendering
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pre creating the buffer is fastest, what else would u do
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> really? I thought you upload information about hte whole map up-front
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> runtime creation is slower
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> factorio doesn't do that, I think
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only about tiles that exist
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the map has a layer that filles all tiles tho
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but why should that be faster?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it would use less memory ðŸ™‚
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> reallocating everything is fastest obv, but has disadvantages as RAM usage
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> preallocating everything is fastest obv, but has disadvantages as RAM usage
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably has a higher up-front cost, too
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because you need to look at every tile at the start vs only looking at tiles near the player
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we also only look to tiles near the player
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the renderer doesnt render anything not visible
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, so we only allocate that buffer for later usage?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> leaving it mostly empty?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have 2 buffers
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one that helps with finding offsets and one on the GPU containing vertices
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the one containing vertices contains info about every tile, not only near the player? so it has a higher up-front cost to build?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah thought u mean at runtime
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, should have
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in tw u alsmost always spec the whole map probably
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or huge chunks
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so wouldnt really be worth optimizing it in chunks for RAM
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: Isn't tmpTiles also on the heap?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we just had someone who couldn't run this game on that map ^^
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he can run it
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with gl 1.x
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 yes, but tmp xd
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did we tell him?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 in the end it worked on linux 32bit
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so cant be out of address space
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 yes i did
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ASLR works differently on each platform
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª linux might allocate differently, might even be a different userspace allocator
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So does malloc and the underlying kernel allocator
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats what learath tries to understand since 2 hours isnt it
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (how we can change it)
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It quite obviously runs out of address space, the largest remaining free contiguous block in the address space is 260M which is not enough
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so large address space works or what?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Large address space works and didn't break anything in my 10-20 minutes of testing
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it's a shit fix, it would work for people running the 32bit binary by mistake or on situations like the one reported
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It wouldn't work so well on an actually memory constrained 32bit computer
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ok
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno the details of that
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway i'd prefer to disable GL >= 2.1 on 32bit completly than to fix this
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Figures
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me this is also a pretty worst case
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the editor already warns at 1000x1000 tiles
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good. maybe we could also display an error message
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is like 3 times the size
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are okay with it crashing too I guess
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am indeed
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead of crashing I mean ðŸ˜‰
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> an error message to tell people to enable opengl1.1 sounds better to me
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we are using unguarded mallocs everywhere anyway, getting to an error is tough without exceptions as teeworlds code is built for crashing and burning mostly
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny how slow pcs get a slow implementation
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> almost ironically xD
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 since it's only about address space exhaustion, we can guard that single big allocation
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not about actual out of memory problems
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'd feel warmer about that
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think its better to not allow gl >= 2.x at all
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> completly disable it
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most ppl with 32bit system have a old pc anyway
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or maybe only on windows
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That I don't quite like
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll test with my mobile now, but since android is basiucally linux kernel, probs will work
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dooming people to worse performance because some very edge case massive maps crash sounds silly
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as said
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they wont have GPUs to run anything than 1.x anyway
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well at the very least the person that actually reported the issue won't be happy that we doomed him to bad performance ðŸ˜›
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you think my 2012 GPU doesn't support anything newer than opengl1.x?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it 64bit ready?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> see
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast he can compile his own tho so he is better off than most people with 32bit computers
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so u can use 64bit
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, the error message doesn't hurt
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not even in program complexity I think
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u underestimate ppl
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they never get warnings
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they read it and are like, WTF?? ERROR
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try to look into TraceProcessor later to parse xperf recordings to get a high resolution timeline. I want to know why we leave that 260M block free
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh or maybe attach a kernel debugger, that sounds fun
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 at this point just replace windows with linux kernel silently ^^
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> get microsoft dev
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should read the blog of that guy I mentioned, he does stuff like this all the time to figure out chromium performance issues and bugs
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are ways to work around the idiocy of windows
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds cool, if u have infinite time
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i'd also write teeworlds-os
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that can only run teeworlds
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should work on an asciiart renderer for the next version, for the computers with 8g of ram, because that's just of the past decade
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just saw a video of smone writing raytraced ascii renderer xd
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily with the heap growing top down the allocations actually do fit
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even without largeaddressaware
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay xperf is great
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I kinda need a workstation to run this thing, it's insane the amount of processing power it uses
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great, I spent almost an hour researching how to browse the virtual memory of a windows process, tried it `unresolved external symbol _PssCaptureSnapshot referenced in function _dbg_dumpmem`
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because it would kill us if god forbid for once our game builds without 10 thousand linking issues
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/dfc67040e79598d8551aeac382ffc79e you can not possibly comprehend how happy I was to get this working
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> an API scarcely documented, mostly used by malware developers
05:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay monkey patching native code is just too much work
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I missed these extended debugging sessions, first time I've had fun in months
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> im sure that hammerfly is just a variable you set and it is read somewhere but i cant find where its set
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> im sure that hammerfly is just a variable you set and it is read somewhere but i cant find where its read
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hammerfly? You mean the dummy hf?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> yeah
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> its all jank
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> what actually sends of the thing to make the dummy fire
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```cpp
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> if((m_DummyFire / 12.5f) - (int)(m_DummyFire / 12.5f) > 0.01f)

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> i found this but changing WEAPON_HAMMER to WEAPON_LASER turns it into a gun?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> cant find where m_HammerInput is defined either
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```sh
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> [solly@arch src]$ grep -r "HammerIput" ./*
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> [solly@arch src]$ 
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ??????
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have a typo there
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```sh
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> [solly@arch src]$ grep -r "HammerInput" ./*
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> [solly@arch src]$ 
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ```
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ??????
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also dont post such big code
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this chat is connected to irc
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> wow im dumb soz but uhh do u know how changing WEAPON_HAMMER to WEAPON_LASER changes it to gun
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know there is a +1 right
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> WEAPON_LASER + 1 is equal to WEAPON_NINJA
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> but then WEAPON_HAMMER + 1 = hamer?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> = gun
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807261958264324147/unknown.png
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> but its not gun when its unedited
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sets the m_WantedWeapon
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw do u have the laser
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont then m_WantedWeapon is prob ignores
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and thats why u get a gun
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> `m_HammerInput.m_WantedWeapon = WEAPON_LASER + 1`
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> remove the +1?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> very confusing
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u havent acquired the laser
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it prob wont work
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what this code does tho
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> dummybot
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki dont remove the +1
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> it woks
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell him not me
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works ? xd
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> i just ctrl c ctrl v the dummy code change it for laser cuz i wanted laser dummy
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @SollyBunny wanted weapon is the direct weapon selection which uses the input, and 0 means no weapon selected
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut u know that WEAPON_HAMMER + 1 is essentially WEAPON_GUN
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check the server side of the code
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> oh okay
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its weapon+1
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for wanted weapon using direct weapon selection
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0 means hammer
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not in wantedweapon case
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is always a weapon selected
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> my dummy is now capable of wall shotting me somehow
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bot
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i helped abotter
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ryozuki for me, there is never a directly selected weapon because I dont use +weaponX
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just scroll
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it stays 0 for my character all the time
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt scroll +weapon or smth
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it says wanted++ ig
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807263446151725066/unknown.png
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki scroll just goes to the next weapon, not selecting a weapon directly
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean if u think it logically scroll probs sets the wanted weapon to the next
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk i didnt look the code
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wanted weapon is something else xd
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as said

15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Idk why everything I say has to be wrong ^^
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I worked with this part of the code already
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont get offended
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its okay
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol

16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0 means no direct selection
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d21f7966b11ed010a6f9827cbc6b302ad6206d75/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L307

16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> back to rust
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 in my way towards learning rust macros i found something interesting, you can create compiler errors and tell the compiler the span of the code that makes those
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807265517403373618/unknown.png
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust master race :monkalaugh:
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to stop you because no one asks about that part of the code
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i realized it later
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I knew it the second I heard about the uninformed question, noobs only want to touch that part of the code because they want to make bots
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is very useful, I wish clang had such pretty errors and ways to trigger more informative asserts
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers: learath agreed :poggers:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iâ€™ll work on a language called definitelyNotRust taking all the parts I like ;P
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i noticed a lack of blog posts about macros doing the stuff i do
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a free path for my blogging career
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust macros
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it rly looks like black magic
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My adventures yesterday confirmed that tooling for windows is shit.
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually with this spanned compiler errors i can do really precise macro attributes
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g the input can only accept text, password, email
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chromium apparently stole my idea and made their own. They monkey patch all allocation functions by disassembling at runtime
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly epic
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i see tweets on twitter "linux is the best os for dev"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and windows normies in replies
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> telling windows is the best
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i cant laugh more
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But memory debugging tools are shit everywhere, which confirms my worst fear
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/DerekBeattie/status/1231256549408071685
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Modern programmers give no shits about memory usage
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 modern programmers directly dont know c+
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would they give a shit about memory
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they use their javascripts
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and some python here and there
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the interfaces to develop such tools are only slightly better on windows
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux**
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant u do some kernel levels stuff to debug memory or something
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows literally the only way to keep track of allocations is a monkey patched hook you can get by injecting a dll into the process, or a kernel interface soooooo badly documented that you'd cry
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> level*
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the kernel interface is only there for windows' own performance toolkit
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They only document a handful of functions to interact with it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807270770563874866/unknown.png
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im loving this
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807270870900670474/unknown.png
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> also with dummy hammer it doesnt actually point at a player but seems to be randomly up?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont ask coding help for botting
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do this to fix all ur issues
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git reset --hard origin/master
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> it was for ddrace maps
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> -.-
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> also it is just the original code which isnt aiming at me
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> or not it is?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> botters out
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> or now it is?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> idk
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nobot:
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> no its that hammer fly keeps breaking
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> like if i hook it
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> im very confused
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a 6% solution of acetic acid. I need a 12% solution, assuming only water boils off, which is true at these concentrations. Is havling the volume close enough?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @SollyBunny we think you are making a bot. We don't want to help you any further
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> its hammerfly but with laser instead of hammer
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> for ddrace maps
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Nobosaurus
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fuc
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spammer
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big sorry
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Assuming the density is relatively constant evaporating off half should work
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully I'm correct about water and acetic acid not forming an azeotrope this early on
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u making chemistry now
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pickles
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be extremely funny if I get chemical burns in my lungs because of acetic acid vapour
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you could also just go outside and buy pickles :greenthing:
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> no risk in burning your lungs
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the italian people make bad pickles
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think halving is close
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> according to my rule of 3
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if this even makes sense
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides where is the fun in that. It should make my eyes burn way before there is a risk of lung damage
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh it never even forms an azeotrope
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807280498707398736/unknown.png
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> learath making drugs
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I stopped 150ml short, i forgot how god awful vinegar smells when boiled
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @SollyBunny tools not included in the official ddnet client that automate gameplay are considered bots. if you get caught with one of these on official ddnet servers, it will get you banned
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> auto laser should be a feature then ri
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> auto laser should be a feature then cri
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing much to be made from acetic acid but pickles :P
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could use it in candy making if you are russian
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> suggest it on github then, but I don't think there'll be consensus to add it @SollyBunny
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 you are like my friend who made drugs and fireworks
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Auto laser would make some insane parts trivial with dummy
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There us no way we add that
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is*
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm just presenting the correct route for suggesting that feature, and saying that it's unlikely to get added
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> is shooting a person that hard
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you can definitely do it yourself without the help of a bot :)
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, that's called an aimbot if you automate it
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so apparently it's hard enough to get you banned in all sorts of games
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> it cant be used for fng / zcatch cuz its hitting player not anyone else
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's still a gameplay advantage for ddnet servers, which is not okay since they also host something competitive: racing
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ur never gonna be faster with a dummy than a player so where it matters it doesnt effect right
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/338779500085116938/806293647913779281
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> coradax is much faster than most any player with his dummy on just fly 1. @murpi here probably plays better with dummy than he does with ppl :D
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because other people are so bad ðŸ˜›
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is also a factor :P
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> ^
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can also probably do a hacky udp gateway to switch between having dummy and real partner instantly
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> also laser fly doesnt effect lasery.. stuff
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> and also because of the glitchiness of hammer fly can be achieved if u hit 5 on ur dummy then hammerfly then switch u get lazered anyway
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ? What is a laser fly even? It would literally just periodically laser you
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> laser fly = hammer fly without the hammer but with the laser
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is just a periodic shot of laser. What do you even want this for?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aimbotted unfreeze by laser, I guess
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was my guess aswell, but he says that's not it
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> i do it with hammerfly glitchiness anyway so
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 already possible by deepfly bind
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and dummy
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine, then use that
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> -.-
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut really? Can you get it to shoot any weapon?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the first shot only though, but you can just restart it ^^
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can already make laser shoot u
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dummy laser*
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, we keep coding the oddest of stuff. Maybe we should look for jobs in microsoft
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> its annoying for using hammerfly but can be used for laser n stufz
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 if you dont keep the fire input you dont have to reset
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it can stay on rifle
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stuff like that is why I don't like https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3552
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I can't think of many new constructs that are possible
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I also didn't know you could laser yourself with the dummy hammer for the longest time
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The most innovative thing was that access to inputstate abusing unimportant configs
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is more on our implementation of hammerfly bot
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes plus the input handling on the server, probably
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that's also an unexpected construct though
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if eval if makes teeworlds console turing complete :D
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah needs an arithmetic operation

18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^^
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think my blog will end up only being rust
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have this, idk if u read it <https://edgarluque.com/blog/rust-iterator-fibonacci>

18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ™‚
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u had a blog too right?
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only one blog post
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if it counts as a blog ^^
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the one tick unfreeze
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure u can write about a lot of stuff
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know way more than me :)
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I'll write something if something interests me and I think that it also interests others *and* I want to spend some time on writing it down
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also think about it a lot
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u would be surprised
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even small simple stuff interests others
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> potatoes
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> interesting rihgt
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> congratz for ending up in this blogpost @Ryozuki o.O
