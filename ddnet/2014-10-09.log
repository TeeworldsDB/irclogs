01:21 <@deen> hi Anqel 
01:21 < Anqel> Hey deen
01:21 < Anqel> I need some help
01:22 <@deen> yes?
01:23 < Anqel> Hm you know something about msdcsc?
01:23 <@deen> never heard
01:24 < Anqel> shit
01:24 < Anqel> So google says it's a virus which stays on your computer, changes registry etc and even one year it's doing nothing.
01:24 < Anqel> I just found it on my pc -.-! And i can't delete or stop it. It allways install itselfes again
01:26 < Anqel> I tried 4 Antivirus programs, I tried to delete it with my cmd, but nothing worked, or it says wrong parameterformat idk
01:27 <@deen> generally the right solution is to reinstall everything, but i guess you don't want to do that
01:28 < Anqel> Right ? >.<
01:28 < Anqel> I even don't know how to haha
01:29 <@deen> anyone else have an idea? I'm not a Windows guy
01:32 < Anqel> Does not seems so
01:32 <@deen> They're all sleeping
01:36 < Anqel> think so too
01:42 < Anqel> Okay i'm trying it with a 5th antimalware programm. >.<
01:45 <+eeeee> keep in mind that most "antimalware" programs you find on the internets actually install even more malware
01:45 <+eeeee> only use products from well-known developers
01:45 <+eeeee> Anqel: e.g. "Microsoft Security Essentials" did you try it?
01:46 <+eeeee> i think it's free if you own a legit copy of windows and should be one of the best antiviruses
01:47 < Anqel> There's the problem ><
01:48 < Anqel> I'm not sure, but i think this computer has no legit windows. idk
01:48 <+eeeee> in that case you should try "cureit", "avg", "avast", "avira"
01:49 <+eeeee> all of those are free
01:49 < Anqel> Okay i will look. Avira i have allready on my computer but it didnt found the msdcsc avast i tried. found nothing too
01:50 < Anqel> Im trying "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware" at the moment. It actually found 16 objects.
01:50 < Anqel> Most with this msdcsc.exe
01:50 < Anqel> Oh. i need to change. it found 25 ..
01:53 < Anqel> 319 .... wtf
02:03 < Anqel> Someone of you know a cmd command to delete files maybe=
02:05 <@deen> del?
02:06 <@deen> this site has some kind of guide, but doesn't look very serious: https://sites.google.com/site/arinerronurl/other/how-to-delete-msdcsc-exe-manually
02:07 < Anqel> I was on that site and tried the command. doesnt work
02:08 < Anqel> Ah used wrong letters but ehm. It asked me, rly delete? J/N? i type J, he wrote me; acces denied
02:09 <@deen> you have to run cmd as administrator probably
02:11 < Anqel> i tried it again as administrator now. access denied again
02:11 < Anqel> määääääääääääääh :( i'll try "cureit" now. eeeese wrote it
02:13 <+eeeee> you can tell the antivirus to scan that specific folder
02:13 <+eeeee> C:\Users\Your username here\AppData\Local\Temp\MSDCSC
02:13 <+eeeee> maybe antivirus will be able to delete the file
02:15 < Anqel> Ah okay. I just started a totall scan. But it found this msdcsc.exe. it will take a bit till its at the end and i hope i can delete it finally. and then i need to look what it changed and change it back and wtf.. i will die ;D
02:36 < Anqel> pc restart. brb
02:37 <@deen> I'm going to sleep, good night
02:56 <+eeeee> deen: i've had several back and forths with vpsflare sales but failed to extract any useful info so far
02:58 <+eeeee> deen: the latest exchange was like ME: can i whitelist only certain ips on your cisco AMA firewall and drop traffic from other apis? THEY: yes, we do that automatically for all the ips!
03:00 <+eeeee> s/apis/ips
03:04 < Anqel> eeeee - what was the name of antivir program i downlaoded last?
03:14 <+eeeee> cureit
03:14 <+eeeee> ?
03:16 < Anqel> okay thanks
03:23 < Anqel> So this programm was successfull i guess. I can't find this .exe anywhere, i made a new scan and it found 0 infected datas. So thanks for your help and i hope it's gone now

10:29 <@deen> thanks for trying
10:32 < laxadedi> test
10:32 <@deen> hi laxadedi 
10:32 < laxadedi> hi
10:39 < hannibal> hi :p
10:42 < hannibal> no party here?
10:42 < hannibal> i bet you are all playing tw :oooooo 
10:42 <+cris272> hi hannibal
10:43 <@deen> hannibal: good morning
10:43 < hannibal> oh i see :) hi!
10:44 < hannibal> i'm at work. so i thought i can at least talk about tw if i can^t play :D
10:44 < hannibal> < heavily addicted.
10:49 <@deen> yo udon't have ddnet client for android?
10:50 < hannibal> i own a iphone
10:51 <@deen> ok, too bad
10:51 < hannibal> :D
10:52 < hannibal> maybe it's for the best. if you'd ask my boss .. :p
10:52 < hannibal> btw did you get hi_leutes message yesterday? i think we saw one of the ddoser
10:52 < pause> Hello !
10:52 < hannibal> hi pause!
11:20 < hannibal> thursday........ friday.......  -> WEEKEND. :D
11:20 < hannibal> <3
11:31 < pause> hannibal: Lol, tired of work ? =D
11:33 < hannibal> oh, just a little bit :D
11:33 < hannibal> i don't want to complain. i like my work. 
11:36 < pause> hannibal: Same here
11:37 < pause> But we all know doing nothing is better than working most of the times =P
11:43 < hannibal> :D
11:43 < hannibal> yes, and i always wanted to check out this irc-channel
11:43 < hannibal> irc is so classic :D
11:46 <@deen> hi Wohoo 
11:46 < Wohoo> hi deen
11:46 < Wohoo> can you help me? i'm looking for a very short map, to test start line and finish line, without race a whole map
11:47 <@deen> just make a start line and finish line on a new map in editor?
11:47 <@deen> or do you want to test on ddnet?
11:47 <@deen> on ddnet you can do Flappy Bird on solo, you get a finish for going beyond the first pipe
11:48 < Wohoo> i want to test offline, but need also to test teams
11:48 < Wohoo> so i'll try editor
11:49 < Wohoo> i've to learn how to use :(
11:49 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/A.map
11:50 <@deen> something like this should work
11:50 < Wohoo> thank
11:51 < Wohoo> what do you prefer about console chat? "'%s' killed whole team beacuse of lock." or "Whole team was killed by '%s' beacuse of lock"
11:51 <@deen> 2nd
11:51 < Wohoo> spoiler of next commit :)
11:51 <@deen> but maybe "Your team"
11:52 < laxadedi> "Your team was killed by %s cause your team was locked"
11:52 < laxadedi> -cause+becuase
11:52 < Wohoo> yes, i'd like to read nick at begin maybe
11:52 < Wohoo> but ok :)
11:52 < laxadedi> but listen to deen
11:52 <@heinrich5991> lock?
11:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: /lock
11:52 < laxadedi> heinrich5991: you can /lock a team
11:53 <@heinrich5991> and then?
11:53 < laxadedi> wich means : no one can join it anymore
11:53 < laxadedi> and if you kill, you respawn in the same team
11:53 <@heinrich5991> why is the whole team killed?
11:53 < laxadedi> it's the way /lock works
11:53 <@heinrich5991> ok
11:53 <@deen> to restart in team
11:53 <@deen> it's for speedrunners who try a map many times
11:53 <@deen> so they don't have to rejoin team every time
11:54 <@heinrich5991> (my idea for this was: don't kill the whole team, if the whole team kills itself, stop the time)
11:54 <@deen> but then you could cheat
11:54 <@heinrich5991> not more than usual
11:54 <@deen> activating switches at the start and stuff like that
11:54 <@heinrich5991> if the whole team kills, stop the time, reset t he world
11:55 < Wohoo> and for console?
11:55 < Wohoo> "Team %d killed by '%s' because of lock."
11:55 <@heinrich5991> restart, team=%d cid=%d name='%s'
11:55 <@heinrich5991> :)
11:56 < Wohoo> Cid and name of TeamKiller?
11:57 <@heinrich5991> yes
11:58 < hannibal> because of lock does not sound good. use laxadedis version :p
11:58 < hannibal> because your team was locked.
11:59 <@heinrich5991> wrong tense though
11:59 <@heinrich5991> oh wait
11:59 <@heinrich5991> mh
11:59 < Wohoo> "You killed whole team because it was locked" is ok for personal message?
11:59 <@heinrich5991> your team was killed because it is locked – your team was killed because it has been locked – your team was killed because it was locked
11:59 < hannibal> "the" whole team
12:00 <@heinrich5991> what's the correct tense here?
12:00 < hannibal> hm. 2 and 3 are both k i think
12:00 < Wohoo> You killed whole team because it has been locked
12:00 < Wohoo> maybe
12:01 < laxadedi> I would say the 3 are different and correct :D
12:01 <@heinrich5991> I think: "was locked" implies that it's not locked anymore
12:01 < hannibal> true.
12:01 < hannibal> well
12:01 < hannibal> actually
12:01 < hannibal> 1 is correct then
12:01 < laxadedi> Your team was killed by %s cause it is locked
12:01 < laxadedi> seems good
12:02 < laxadedi> Rah
12:02 < laxadedi> because :)
12:02 < hannibal> we could find a nicer word for killed
12:02 < laxadedi> Wut ?
12:02 < hannibal> can't think of one.
12:02 < laxadedi> It's called like that in the game, no need/reason to change it.
12:02 < Wohoo> can i start an offline server?
12:03 < hannibal> lan server?
12:03 < Wohoo> sorry, too many questions :)
12:03 < Wohoo> yes, solo machine server :D
12:03 <@deen> yes, just run the DDNet-Server
12:03 < Wohoo> without send heartbeat to teeworlds.come
12:03 < Wohoo> .com
12:03 <@deen> set sv_register 0 in autoexec.cfg
12:03 < laxadedi> sv_registe r0 then
12:04 < hannibal> deen. is it complicated to integrate the vote-thing in a server?
12:04 <@deen> hat vote thing?
12:04 <@deen> what*
12:04 < hannibal> uhm if i have like 3 maps on my server
12:04 < hannibal> i don't know how to change it
12:04 < hannibal> so i'd like to vote them
12:05 <@deen> make entries for them with add_vote in your config?
12:05 < laxadedi> Going to get something to eat, brb :)
12:05 < hannibal> add_vote mapname? in the cfg ?
12:06 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-maps/blob/master/novice/votes.cfg
12:06 < hannibal> oh so easy
12:06 < hannibal> thanks a lot.
12:07 < hannibal> woot you moved simpleplay to novice
12:08 < Wohoo> i write final version of all five sentences i need
12:08 < Wohoo> "restart, team=%d cid=%d name='%s'"
12:08 < Wohoo> "You killed whole team because it has been locked"
12:08 <@heinrich5991> take "is" I think
12:09 < hannibal> and "the" whole team.
12:09 < Wohoo> "Your team was killed by %s because team was locked"
12:09 <@heinrich5991> "You killed the whole team because it is locked."
12:09 <@heinrich5991> "Your team was killed by '%s' because the team is locked."
12:09 < hannibal> "Whole team was killed because it is locked"
12:09 < hannibal> :D
12:09 < hannibal> whatever.
12:09 < Wohoo> done
12:10 < Wohoo> You are back to team 0.
12:10 < Wohoo> not hard this :D
12:10 <@heinrich5991> =)
12:10 < Wohoo> '%s' died and joined team 0.
12:10 < hannibal> xx joined team 0 
12:10 < Wohoo> this is tricky
12:10 < hannibal> :D
12:10 < Wohoo> because don't know if died or suicided or whatelse
12:11 < Wohoo> just " xx joined team 0 " ?
12:15 < Wohoo> there was also a bug
12:15 < Wohoo> in team.cpp
12:16 < hannibal> so i'll go to eat
12:16 < hannibal> cu! :D
12:16 < Wohoo> when first in team died, kill everyone in same team, but them kill again everyone of the same team (beacuse of recursive func)
12:25 <@deen> Wohoo: i've never seen that happen. how to trigger it?
12:26 < Wohoo> because was:
12:26 < Wohoo> OnCharacterDeath()
12:26 < Wohoo> {
12:26 < Wohoo> ...
12:26 < Wohoo> if(team_open)
12:26 < Wohoo> kill_every_one
12:26 < Wohoo> then team != open
12:27 < Wohoo> but kill_every_one will call again  OnCharacterDeath()
12:28 < Wohoo> just switch istruction is the way,
12:28 < Wohoo> team != open i mean set_team= !open
12:29 < Wohoo> server kills everyone multiple time at full speed, is impossible to see :)
12:38 < Wohoo> hint for title of commit?
12:38 < Wohoo> "Chat information to teammate"
12:39 < laxadedi> http://www.ebay.com/itm/221564569633#viTabs_0
12:43 < Wohoo> wow
12:43 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
12:44 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
12:48 < laxadedi> question : if I am going to compile + install irssi from sources, should I remove the package first ?
12:49 <@EastByte> depends on where you install it from source
12:49 <@EastByte> I would remove the package
12:49 < laxadedi> ok
12:50 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Wohoo-GC opened pull request #60: Teammate switching team reported on chat (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/VCMpFQ
12:51 < Wohoo> yeah :)
13:09 < hannibal> back :D
13:19 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: OS?
13:30 < Wohoo> do you know who is developing zcatch server mod???
13:30 <@EastByte> Teetime or Teelevision
13:30 <@EastByte> not sure
13:32 <@deen> the one I'm running is by Teetime
13:32 < hannibal> called teevision
13:32 <@deen> https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/zCatch
13:41 < Wohoo> deen: who is developing it?
13:48 <@deen> Teetime
13:55 <+ochristi> that "kill protection" is annoying :(
13:55 < hannibal> no it's not!
13:55 < hannibal> saved my life 2 times now - more than worth it.
13:57 <@deen> at most you have to type /kill every 20 minutes
13:58 < Wohoo> kill protection is client side and works with time, right?
13:58 <@deen> server side
13:58 <+ochristi> but it seems inconsitent across servers
13:58 <@deen> tyes, activates after 20 minutes game time
13:58 <@deen> should be consistent
13:58 <+ochristi> ah ok
13:58 < Wohoo> what do it detect? block kill command?
13:59 <@deen> yes
13:59 <@deen> so you have to type /kill instead
13:59 < Wohoo> so if i bind k say /kill, it is useless
13:59 <@deen> your own fault :P
13:59 < Wohoo> ok :D
14:00 < Wohoo> i want to do same commit for zcatch, when team leader release one, all in team should know
14:01 < Wohoo> i'm trying to figure out with lists :)
14:01 < Wohoo> deen: why do you use vectors in ddnet?
14:01 <@deen> i don't know
14:02 <@deen> i didn't write that
14:17 < pause> Wohoo: Why not ? vectors are nice people too !
14:20 <@heinrich5991> because teeworlds avoids the stdlib
14:20 <@heinrich5991> there's a vector type in teeworlds already, it's called list IIRC
14:24 < Wohoo> vectors fill useless your memory because must be greater than needed, and in this case, every time you want to find a client, you have to check whole vector (up to 64) also if only two clients are connected
14:29 <@deen> you can clean it up of course
14:29 <@deen> but if you want more performance profile it before please
14:29 <@deen> I'd be more interested in reducing the memory of ddnet server
14:29 <@deen> after a few days it takes a lot, but doesn't grow anymore
14:29 <@deen> so there is no memory leak, but something just takes some time to fill up and never gets cleaned again
14:30 <@heinrich5991> deen: how much?
14:31 <@deen> about 60 MB, but on some servers it grows to 100 MB
14:36 <@deen> i wanted to profile the memory, but can't reproduce it on home server
14:36 <@deen> and profiled server lags too much to be playable
14:43 < Wohoo> i think i can take a look
14:43 < Wohoo> however now i go
14:43 < Wohoo> bb all :)
14:46 < pause> Well you can preallocate vectors to some size
14:46 < pause> Also, with that logic you shouldn't use malloc() :P
14:46 < hannibal> god that tech talk in here :D
14:47 <+o_be_one> sup' !
14:47 < pause> And if you want to find a client, time to use an std:unordered_map !
14:47 <+o_be_one> whats new about ddos ?
14:47 < pause> o_be_one: I'm wondering too
14:47 < pause> deen: Any news about that ? Still calm ? Did we won ?
14:47 < hannibal> what happened
14:48 <@heinrich5991> pause: you shouldn't use malloc. most of the time
14:48 <@deen> yesterday BlackLine attacked a bit, but nothing too bad
14:48 <@deen> nothing since then
14:48 < hannibal> but
14:48 <@heinrich5991> pause: unordered map to find a client? when do you need this?
14:48 < hannibal> did you see the screen
14:48 <+o_be_one> maybe vali fears now ?
14:48 < hannibal> "khaz"
14:48 <@deen> yes
14:48 <@deen> khaz is BlackLine
14:48 < hannibal> was also one of the ddos people
14:48 < hannibal> ah
14:49 < pause> heinrich5991: I don't know, but he said something about having to traverse a vector to find a client
14:49 < pause> If that's the case, you're just using the wrong container =D
14:49 <+o_be_one> ok i can start again all my servers so ^^
14:49 < pause> heinrich5991: And you use new instead, but it uses malloc itself =P
14:49 <@heinrich5991> or you pass around the wrong identifcation
14:50 <+o_be_one> xrothx got all my players, fucking shit >.<
14:50 <@heinrich5991> pause: (technical details: new might actually not use malloc.) you shouldn't use heap allocation (including malloc, new, vectors, hashmaps, etc.) most of the time
14:50 <@heinrich5991> they contribute to unpredictable performance
14:51 < pause> Well, sometimes you don't have the choice, but true, using "static" memory is better
14:52 <@heinrich5991> yes, more predictable
14:52 <@heinrich5991> just a pointer bump, if on the stack
14:52 < pause> Well, the stack isn't infinite either, and if you run out of it it wont return nullptr =D
14:53 < pause> I think evaluating how much stack space your program needs is hard, too
14:54 < pause> On the plus side, writing a program without dynamic allocation is rewarding it itself, i remember it being a challenge back in school =P
14:55 <@heinrich5991> malloc() doesn't return nullptr in out-of-memory situations either (on some systems)
14:58 < pause> heinrich5991: Really ? That must suck :-)
14:59 < pause> Never encountered that, is it happening on some weird embedded environements ?
14:59 <@heinrich5991> depends whether you count "linux" as "weird embedded environment" :)
14:59 <@heinrich5991> s/depends/depends on/
15:00 < pause> heinrich5991: What, linux is doing that ?
15:00 < pause> You mean, OOM killer ?
15:00 <@heinrich5991> on linux with default settings
15:00 <@heinrich5991> malloc will never return nullptr
15:00 <@heinrich5991> first it happily overcommits a lot
15:00 <@heinrich5991> (i.e. giving more memory to applications than it has)
15:01 < pause> And when it page faults too much, time to kill stuff
15:01 <@heinrich5991> then if the applications actually use it, and use to much, the OOM killer kicks in
15:12 < hannibal> time flies <3 15:12 already
15:12 < hannibal> 2 hours and 8 hours and i'm done for the week xd
15:14 <@heinrich5991> 2 hours and 8 minutes?
15:18 < pause> i think he means, end of the day + tomorrow
15:37 < hannibal> correct
15:37 < hannibal> 2 hours today
15:37 < hannibal> 8 tomorrow
15:37 < hannibal> :)
15:37 < Qss> will ddnet go down?
15:38 <@deen> Qss: why?
15:38 < Qss> because of the recent ddos attacks
15:38 <@deen> We'll try to keep it running
15:40 < hannibal> if you need anything, tell us. i will try to set up a paypal account to use the donate option.
15:41 < hannibal> i'll be swimming in money from the 25th of this month on.
15:41 <@heinrich5991> paypal collects a nontrivial amount of the transactions
15:41 <@deen> there is no donation anymore
15:41 <@deen> heinrich5991: since a few weeks ago you can send money for free in paypal germany
15:41 <@deen> with 0 fees
15:41 <@heinrich5991> to friends
15:41 <@deen> yes
15:42 <@heinrich5991> I doubt that this counts as "to friends"
15:43 < pause> deen: Why did you stop donations ?
15:43 <+o_be_one> all r0x.fr TW is up again
15:43 < laxadedi> fuck my life, I have to compile gcc last version just to compile fucking rtorrent
15:43 <+o_be_one> with a new host
15:43 < laxadedi> pause: he even gave me back my donation I made like 1 month ago :p
15:43 <+o_be_one> laxadedi, torrent is mad <3 ! Why not Transmission ?
15:43 <@deen> because the servers aren't running properly. feels weird to accept donations when people can't even play on ddnet
15:43 < laxadedi> deen: I donated for server costs
15:43 < laxadedi> not for teeworlds servers
15:44 <+o_be_one> a,d i have many space on my 3 TW hosts ... already told >.<
15:44 <+o_be_one> all hosted in France with good ddos protection.
15:45 < hannibal> paypal for free
15:45 < hannibal> wait how do they make money.
15:45 < hannibal> ah only to friends, i should read on before i write :D
15:45 <@heinrich5991> paypal for free "friend to friend"
15:45 <@heinrich5991> that's just a marketing technique to "trick" more people into using paypal
15:46 < hannibal> just like the phone contracts with 5 free numbers
15:47 < hannibal> okay. so we can't donate
15:47 < hannibal> is there anything else
15:49 <@deen> testing, development, finding good ddos protected servers
15:49 <@deen> helping noobs on servers
15:49 <+o_be_one> hey yep there is no donation button on ddnet ? :o
15:49 < laxadedi> not anymore as deen said
15:50 <+o_be_one> how do you pay deen oO ?
15:50 <@deen> by myself
15:50 <+o_be_one> how much :o ?
15:50 < hannibal> i lack know-how to help developing & finding ddos protected servers. but i gladly help noobs and .. test?
15:51 <@deen> about 65 € per month
15:51 <+o_be_one> oh, thats not too much
15:51 <+o_be_one> where chile servers are hosted ?
15:51 <@deen> http://www.rackeo.cl/
15:52 <@deen> they're the most expensive ones
15:56 < hannibal> which ddos protection are you using right now
15:56 <@deen> OVH (kimsufi) on FRA, reg.ru on RUS
15:56 <+o_be_one> deen, ok seen it, virtualization ?
15:56 <@deen> yes
15:56 <@deen> the one with 600 GB traffic
15:57 <@deen> which is barely enough
15:57 < hannibal> i see numbers. would this protection be enough: can defend against larger attacks of 5Gbps or 5 Million PPS and more.
15:57 < hannibal> ?
15:58 <@deen> no
16:00 <+o_be_one> deen why you dont accept other host than yours ?
16:00 <@deen> i do
16:00 <@deen> USA, CHN, South Africa and Persian run on other people's servers
16:01 <@deen> o_be_one: i don't know if i understand what you offer
16:01 <@deen> i thought you wanted me to host block servers on your server?
16:01 <@deen> and you get ddosed as well i thought
16:03 <+o_be_one> deen, you dont understand, only this week ddos wins, but never before, just cause these ddos was very powerfull ...
16:04 <@deen> yes, same with FRA
16:04 <@deen> so i could host FRA on your server?
16:04 <+o_be_one> nop they got down every days, not mine ...
16:04 <+o_be_one> you have the basic ddos protection from ovh
16:05 <+o_be_one> ive the pro ddos protection from ovh ...
16:08 <@deen> and it's always problematic to host on other people's servers
16:08 <@deen> they always want something special, or just change stuff without asking me
16:09 <@deen> or shut down the servers without warning, or give away rcon password
16:09 <+o_be_one> really ? what they want ?
16:09 <@deen> cheats on ddnet^^
16:09 <+o_be_one> ok you work with kids i think ...
16:09 <@deen> yes, of course
16:10 <+o_be_one> at r0x.fr sometime we give hosting to players which have a great project to do and to offer to our community, sometime we help other projects too by offering our experiences, community or our stuffs
16:10 <+o_be_one> its the r0x.fr mind, 5 years old !
16:10 < hannibal> sounds nice.
16:10 < hannibal> btw i was wondering once
16:11 < hannibal> is it possible to ban a specific client? 
16:11 <+Learath2> hannibal: nah
16:11 < hannibal> k
16:11 <@deen> because Meskalin is spreading his ddrace bot client?
16:11 < hannibal> yes
16:11 <+Learath2> well i did have a patch for banning h-client and n-client
16:11 <@deen> so much for all the promises of not spreading it
16:12 < laxadedi> Meskalin made the zclient ? Or it's another client ?
16:12 < laxadedi> I thought zclient was made by Monsta and Tobii
16:12 < hannibal> when players with h-client or something like that leave a server it says which client they have
16:12 <+Learath2> but dont think a bot would send identifying packets when joining
16:12 < hannibal> so i thought the server knows it
16:12 <+Learath2> Quit message is sent by client
16:12 <+o_be_one> hannibal, i want to ban Fallen client, 13x37 client, vbot ...
16:12 < hannibal> ah
16:12 <@deen> the server knows the ddnet client version, but just because the client tells it
16:13 <+o_be_one> but these are made to "cheat" so you'll never be able to ban them :/ they can copy all they want ...
16:13 < hannibal> yes, i get it now, allright. it's sad
16:13 <@deen> it's not for banning clients, but for adding new non-backwards compatible features into the client
16:13 < hannibal> stupid bots really.
16:13 <+o_be_one> what the ddrace bot client does Oo
16:13 <@deen> it levitates in the air
16:13 <@deen> by hooking faster than you can see
16:13 < laxadedi> aimbot + movement bot
16:13 <+o_be_one> oh ive seen it on my blockers !
16:13 < hannibal> yes, it hooks the ceiling very fast that it seems you are standing still in the air.
16:13 <+o_be_one> what is this client with hookfly :D ?
16:14 <+o_be_one> hannibal, named hookfly feature ;)
16:14 <+Tobii> in zclient we disabled fly on all ddnet servers
16:14 < laxadedi> deen: some players could argue that ddnet is a cheat client cause of the showhookcoll :)
16:14 < hannibal> some players are doing that, yes :D
16:14 <+o_be_one> Tobii, you are the owner of zclient ? think you was the first ive seen with hookfly
16:14 <@deen> Tobii: i know, but that's easy to disable and people just write the code themselves after they see it
16:14 <@deen> HMH had hookfly earlier
16:14 <+Learath2> deen: how can a client hook so fast that you cant see iirc there was a limit
16:15 <@deen> he didn't spread it, but others coded the same and even improved it
16:15 <@deen> Learath2: apparently not! there's a limit for shooting
16:15 <@deen> but not for hooking
16:15 <+Learath2> oh yes thats for shooting
16:15 <+Learath2> could prolly enforce the same limit to hooking
16:15 < laxadedi> yup
16:16 < laxadedi> that would probably break the bot client
16:16 <@deen> for soem time
16:16 < laxadedi> and human can't hook that fast anyway
16:16 <+Tobii> deen: i think everyone who can bypass it could also make the bot himself
16:16 <@deen> Tobii: yes, but they would never have gotten the idea :P
16:16 <@deen> i told HMH not to show it anyone, but it was too late
16:17 <+Learath2> could prolly ban levitating by checking !grounded and same position for long time
16:17 <+Tobii> i had an idea like this before but never tried to do it^^
16:17 <@deen> o_be_one: ah, and i don't even want FRA. i just want a server with good ping and ddos protection in GER
16:17 <@deen> FRA is just because GER was always attacked
16:17 <+o_be_one> ok

16:21 < laxadedi> bot hosted by me :p
16:21 < hannibal> !help
16:22 <+o_be_one> Tobii, where to dl your client ?
16:22 < hannibal> *fun*
16:22 <+Tobii> there is no public download yet (i think xD)
16:22 < hannibal> i always thought that i started playing when
16:22 < laxadedi> well, depending on what you do, it has some really usefull features if you always have an IRC window open
16:22 < hannibal> teeworlds already saw it's peak as a game.
16:22 <+o_be_one> Tobii, how so i cant try hookfly ? :(
16:23 < hannibal> but if DDNet is at it's biggest atm, i started just at the right time :D
16:24 <+o_be_one> ddnet is just "the one" about ddrace servers, and deen is a good community leader, so its easy to want to be involved in this project.
16:24 <+o_be_one> Tobii, watching video of you client ... seems to be good !
16:24 < hannibal> oh i know that there is ddracemax as well, and ddforce
16:24 <@deen> hannibal: ddmax is down
16:24 < hannibal> for good?
16:24 <@deen> because of the attacks
16:24 <+o_be_one> the only one i see quality and played is ddnet x)
16:25 <+Tobii> o_be_one: its probably the old version monsta made
16:25 <@deen> tsin will try to get it back for next year or something
16:25 <+o_be_one> Tobii, 2014 09 14 ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR385p25vBY
16:25 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: zClient (Best Teeworlds Client ever!?) | Rating: 2.60/5.00 | Views: 111
16:25 < hannibal> there was a map on ddmax
16:25 < hannibal> pale
16:25 < hannibal> i think?
16:25 < hannibal> u may want to add it to ddnet :D it's novice and very good.
16:26 <@deen> make a thread in the forum
16:26 <@deen> testers will decide
16:27 < hannibal> yes, yes, just came to mind.
16:27 < hannibal> i tend to forget such things :D
16:27 <@deen> and you could try to find the mapper of the map
16:27 <@deen> and ask them if we may host it
16:30 <+o_be_one> Tobii, any way to try zClient ?
16:32 < laxadedi> this fucking shit will go public one day or another, and then it's over
16:32 < laxadedi> everyone will finish Fly to the legends 2
16:32 <@deen> laxadedi: it's over
16:32 <@deen> it's public already
16:32 <@deen> meskalin sent it to 30 people on skype
16:32 < laxadedi> there is no public link yet
16:33 <@deen> screaming around about something
16:33 < laxadedi> but
16:33 < laxadedi> meskalin made zclient ?
16:34 <@deen> i think they explained to me who made what, but i forgot
16:35 < hannibal> and there really is no way to stop them .
16:35 < hannibal> open source games suck :D
16:35 < laxadedi> thought that zclient was only made by Tobii and Monsta
16:35 <+Tobii> the old zclient was made by meskalin and monsta
16:35 < laxadedi> it's just a bad conception of teeworlds hannibal, not a problem of opensource
16:35 < hannibal> hm
16:36 < hannibal> if ddnet grows even larger, one could think again about
16:36 < hannibal> "making it it's own game"
16:36 < laxadedi> www.hookrace.net
16:36 < hannibal> and give up the compatibility with vanilla client.
16:36 < laxadedi> but I think it's not motivated anymore about it
16:37 < laxadedi> -it's+deen
16:37 < hannibal> i see.
16:37 < hannibal> but it will/would basically be the same as tw?
16:38 < hannibal> minus the problems.
16:38 < laxadedi> Isn't it what you want ?
16:38 < hannibal> yes
16:38 < hannibal> exactly
16:38 <+o_be_one> i just want to try on my own serv, i never like modified clients, the ddnet client is only one i find useful :/
16:38 < hannibal> i never tried another one..
16:39 < hannibal> couldn't find them for mac :D
16:39 <+o_be_one> but zclient seems to be fun, without cheats ...
16:39 < laxadedi> o_be_one: ...
16:39 < laxadedi> zclient without cheats = ddnet client
16:39 <@deen> no, it has "fun" additions
16:39 < laxadedi> oh ?
16:39 <@deen> monsta wanted them in ddnet client, but i said no
16:39 < laxadedi> Hallo mein lieblig !
16:39 < hannibal> how's it going with hookrace, deen?
16:40 < Anqel> xD Hello laxa
16:40 <+o_be_one> TW must keeps the fun
16:40 <@deen> hannibal: don't want to make a game for a ddosing community
16:40 < Anqel> btw it's liebliNg
16:40 <+o_be_one> ill never understand why deen you see ddnet like something totally serious
16:40 < hannibal> but wasn't the point of making it
16:40 < hannibal> to avoid them?
16:40 <@deen> no, the point was to improve ddnet
16:40 <+o_be_one> its just a game, you can make challenge but funs too ...
16:41 < hannibal> well, i get your point.
16:41 <+o_be_one> sv_test_cmds ddnet servers must have features like xxl, raimbow, etc i think ...
16:41 < Wohoo> hi all
16:41 < Anqel> hey
16:41 < hannibal> hi again
16:41 <+o_be_one> Wohoo, !
16:41 <@deen> o_be_one: i don't know. I'm just not a fan of these things
16:42 <+o_be_one> ive seen that deen ...
16:42 < laxadedi> All those things aren't for ddrace mod anyway
16:42 <@deen> i liked ddmax because it had no /r and no fun features
16:42 <+o_be_one> and ddrace people doesnt really care about fun features cause ddrace gameplay is already fun (and some features like jetpack are awesome :D)
16:42 <+o_be_one> the /r features is useful for noobs ...
16:42 < laxadedi> yes, so why merging theses into ddnet ?
16:43 < laxadedi> just make your own server and merge everything you want
16:43 <+o_be_one> i dont know how to do it ...
16:43 < hannibal> i always thought the /r feature destroys the purpose of ddrace :D
16:43 <@deen> hannibal: i agree
16:43 <+o_be_one> i disagree
16:44 < laxadedi> I am neutral
16:44 < laxadedi> It's just 2 different things
16:44 <@deen> ddrace is about helping each other
16:44 <+o_be_one> all players are not pro gamers, many are casuals today
16:44 <@deen> with /r you can help yourself
16:44 <@heinrich5991> I think one could come up with a reasonable compromise on /r
16:44 <+o_be_one> you can keep pro gameplay, not a problem, but you can offer too casual gameplay
16:44 <+o_be_one> if i havent the time, to start again waste my time.
16:44 <@deen> i think it's nice to fail for days until you can finish a map
16:44 <+o_be_one> and leave before finish the map is very frustrating ...
16:44 <@heinrich5991> but helping yourself is IMO off-limits :P
16:44 <@heinrich5991> it could maybe be a whole-team revive
16:44 <@heinrich5991> (only if everyone is frozen)
16:45 <@deen> heinrich5991: but noobs never play in team, so it doesn't matter
16:45 <+o_be_one> i think thats why you have more and more cheats too :/
16:45 <@heinrich5991> I had my solution to teams too :P
16:45 <@deen> yeah, i remember
16:45 <+o_be_one> noobs will search for cheats too dont get these problems.
16:45 <@heinrich5991> deen: I already told you? :o
16:45 <+o_be_one> heinrich5991, compromise, yes !
16:45 < hannibal> no
16:45 < hannibal> :D
16:45 <@deen> i think so, heinrich5991 
16:46 <@deen> maybe i'm misremembering
16:46 <@deen> the players you touched in the last X seconds are part of your team?
16:46 <@heinrich5991> the players you ever interacted with are in your team
16:46 <@heinrich5991> teams should be able to merge, players may leave teams
16:47 <@heinrich5991> (leave teams = kill, that is)
16:47 <@deen> such a complicated solution =/
16:48 <@heinrich5991> it's a userfriendly solution
16:48 <@heinrich5991> this way, teams are almost invisible to the people who don't care
16:48 <+Learath2> dont allow /r :/
16:48 <@heinrich5991> other people can still isolate themselves if they want
16:49 <@deen> Maybe someone should propose this in the ddnet forum so we can include a few more people in the discussion
16:49 <@deen> with 3 options: full /r, heinrich /r and no /r
16:49 <+Learath2> or atleast dont record /r ranks
16:49 <@heinrich5991> heinrich5991 /r is without ranks btw
16:49 < hannibal> no points if you used /r
16:49 < hannibal> could be something
16:50 < hannibal> but still.. someone can use it and save everyone all the time.
16:50 < hannibal> just leave it disabled.
16:50 < hannibal> let it
16:50 < hannibal> whatever.
16:50 <@deen> for example i didn't expect such a strong vote here: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=499
16:51 <+Learath2> if one in your team /r's all team is dq'd from ranks
16:51 <+Learath2> then there is the team0 problem
16:51 <@heinrich5991> there exists no team0 problem in my solution
16:51 <@heinrich5991> there exists no team0 :)
16:51 <@heinrich5991> what is that, anyway :)
16:52 <@heinrich5991> :P
16:52 <+Learath2> no /r is the best /r
16:52 < hannibal> yes but in all honesty, i would not feel the... urge to play a map if i couldn't fail while i try it.
16:52 < hannibal> yes
16:57 < hannibal> ok! i'll go home from work now
16:57 < hannibal> bb all.
17:06 < Wohoo> i'm testing my irc client, sorry for multiple connection :)
17:07 < laxadedi> use irssi if you are on unix system
17:16 <@deen> BlackLine is at it again on GER

18:09 <@EastByte> got my free vps: http://eastbit.net/priv/09_Oct-14-18_07.png
18:09 <@deen> congratulations. how is it working?
18:10 <@EastByte> seems to run fast and it has a stable ping
18:10 < pause> 128mb ram oO
18:10 <@EastByte> but kind of useless since the plan is going to run out in one month
18:10 <@EastByte> pause: would be enough for ddnet atleast :P
18:16 < laxa> pause: it's a 100% free vps thought :p
18:18 < pause> laxa: Not bad then =D
18:26 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
18:26 < laxa> wow, still haven't finished to compile GCC !
18:27 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
18:27 < pause> laxa: compiling gcc is always a pain
18:27 < laxa> I do that just to compile rtorrent :(
18:27 < laxa> gcc crash when compiling with 4.8
18:29 < BeaR_> UE4 took me around 5 hours :D
18:29 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
18:36 < laxa> UE4 ?
18:37 < laxa> unreal engine 4 ?
18:37 < BeaR_> yep
18:56 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
18:56 <@deen> oh, ddos again
18:58 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
18:59 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
19:08 <+o_be_one> rtorrent ... get transmission :D
19:08 <+o_be_one> well deen seems to not be vali this time cause my serv are up :/
19:09 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, it's the BlackLine guy
19:09 <@deen> just some noob with weak ddos attacks
19:09 <@deen> but enough  to down GER
19:24 <+o_be_one> :(
19:25 < Naa> ddos^^
19:26 < laxa> deen: you there ?
19:27 < laxa> listen, I have 2 debian 7 VMs, probably on same machine
19:28 <@deen> ok
19:28 < laxa> I need to use remotly a mysql server which is on the first VM from the second VM
19:28 < laxa> I created my user with all privileges on DB created for this
19:28 <+o_be_one> why someone comes just to say "ddos^^" and leaves ? oO what is the goal :o ?
19:28 < laxa> but when I try to connect from my VM 2, it can't connect
19:28 <+o_be_one> well did you allowed the ip too ?
19:28 <@deen> o_be_one: as he said yesterday, to get ddnet to go down forever
19:28 <@deen> just annoying us until we stop
19:29 <+o_be_one> and did the my.cnf lister 127.0.0.1 commented ?
19:29 < laxa> I saw on SO that I need to comment it out
19:29 < laxa> not to comment it
19:29 < laxa> and it was already commented out
19:29 <+o_be_one> # Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
19:29 <+o_be_one> # localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
19:29 <+o_be_one> bind-address        = 127.0.0.1
19:30 <+o_be_one> u need to comment this.
19:30 < laxa> Wtf
19:30 < laxa> they say otherwise on SO...
19:30 <+o_be_one> its the my.cnf from debian apt
19:30 <+o_be_one> well, bind-address is where you listen
19:30 <+o_be_one> so if you only listen loopback,; how other clients can connect ?
19:31 <+o_be_one> not loopack sorry, localhost
19:31 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
19:31 < laxa> fuck it, those VMs or the VPN connection is lagging as hell...
19:31 <+o_be_one> deen move you FRA and GER to my host, let me some sec to give you a user
19:32 <+eeeee> o_be_one: so you have access to anti-ddos pro on ovh?
19:32 <+o_be_one> we cant let blackline continue these stupid things.
19:32 <@deen> Also, Lggs1 = Naa
19:32 <+eeeee> can you look into https://www.ovh.co.uk/anti-ddos/firewall-network.xml ?
19:32 <+o_be_one> eeeee, yes

20:21 <+o_be_one> :D
20:21 <@deen> what happened where?
20:21 <+DoNe> i can read my name: "mode/#ddnet [+v DoNe] by EastByte"
20:21 <@deen> you now can speak
20:22 <+DoNe> you cant by default?
20:22 <@EastByte> we need to keep the channel clean from ddosers
20:22 <@EastByte> so
20:22 <+DoNe> haha
20:23 <+o_be_one> EastByte, not from ddosers ... from bulshitters ^^
20:24 <+Pups> kind schon im bett?
20:24 <+o_be_one> !de-fr kind schon im bett?
20:24 <+Nimda> Translation: déjà au lit enfant?
20:24 <@deen> Pups: so that the ddosers don't spam shit here
20:24 <+o_be_one> you are the kid x)
20:24 <+Pups> ah allright deen
20:25 <+Hallowed1986> the child is in bed now?
20:25 <+Hallowed1986> thats good to know
20:25 <+Hallowed1986> now the real people can play again :)
20:25 <@EastByte> :)
20:27 <@deen> should i call the new ones FRA2 or FRA?
20:27 <+DoNe> new ones?
20:27 <@deen> yes
20:27 <@deen> new servers
20:28 <+DoNe> but also located in france?
20:28 <@deen> yes
20:28 <+DoNe> and old ones stay?
20:28 <@deen> i just want something with a better ddos protection for now
20:28 <@EastByte> deen: is it from o_be_one ?
20:28 <+DoNe> would call them FRA2 so every1 can check if they work better
20:28 <@deen> EastByte: it's just a new host with good ddos protection apparently
20:29 <@deen> ok
20:29 <@EastByte> from where did you get it?
20:30 <@deen> can't say
20:30 <@deen> sorry =/
20:31 <+DoNe> wtf
20:32 <@EastByte> okay no problem :)
20:36 <@deen> FRA2 should be running
20:37 <+o_be_one> how many budget you give to ddnet deen ?
20:37 <+laxa> the kid is sleeping
20:37 <+o_be_one> and why we cant donate ?
20:37 <+DoNe> got better internet today :)
20:37 <+DoNe> who's the kid!?
20:37 <+laxa> the ddoser
20:38 <+Hallowed1986> if he build in the donate button nobody donate, if he cut it out all ask for the donate button :D
20:38 <@deen> DoNe: http://ddnet.tw/players/BlackLine
20:38 <@deen> That's the ddoser
20:38 <+laxa> Hallowed1986: he received few donations before, but he gave back the money when he removed the button.
20:38 <+o_be_one> when ive read about donate, it was like a "tilt" in my head, cause i always donate to project that i like ...
20:38 <@deen> laxa: your donation was still 50% of all i received :P
20:38 <+laxa> Oh :)
20:39 <+Hallowed1986> and my?
20:39 <+Hallowed1986> xD
20:39 <@deen> didn't i pay it back?
20:39 <+laxa> gcc still being compiled, that's about 4hours and 30 minutes :x
20:39 <@deen> laxa: wtf?
20:39 <+o_be_one> ive a flavours me, ive already donated to one good dev in ddrace community, ive already donate to many other projects and indies
20:39 <@deen> i regularly compile gcc and it's much faster
20:39 <+DoNe> do servers start with random maps?
20:39 <+laxa> my cpu on the dedi is really weak
20:39 <@deen> DoNe: no
20:39 <+o_be_one> deen, give paypal mail where to donate
20:39 <+laxa> and I am compiling the full GCC with all compilers I think
20:39 <@deen> o_be_one: nowhere!
20:39 <+o_be_one> why ?
20:40 <@deen> i don't want you to manipulate me with money!
20:40 <+o_be_one> lol
20:40 <+o_be_one> im sure money cant manipulate you ;)
20:41 <+laxa> o_be_one: you know ETNA ?
20:41 <+DoNe> how servers start with different random looking maps?
20:41 <@deen> i chose them
20:42 <+DoNe> ah
20:42 <@deen> the new server looks nice
20:42 <@deen> same performance as kimsufi, but less than half the price
20:43 <+o_be_one> laxa, no
20:43 <+laxa> but you don't pay for it, someone gave it to you right ?
20:43 <+o_be_one> awesome hope it will do the job :D
20:44 <@deen> i pay for it
20:44 <+laxa> Hum, then why can't you say what server it is ?
20:44 <+o_be_one> deen, serious nobody can donate >.< ?
20:44 <+o_be_one> i use your awesome client, i play on your ddrace maps often, i love what you do and i cant just give some bucks to thanks ?
20:44 <+laxa> I doubt the protection is going to be good enough if the server is that cheap.
20:45 <+o_be_one> >.<
20:45 <+laxa> o_be_one: I guess deen will put donation back when servers are safe from ddos.
20:45 <@deen> aka never
20:45 <@deen> maybe we should collect donations for the other guys paying servers
20:46 <@deen> but it's a bit difficult
20:46 <@deen> I know Broken pays USA
20:46 <@deen> i don't even know who pays CHina
20:46 <@deen> it just keeps running and i have noone to contact
20:46 <@deen> and it's rather difficult to get money into Iran...
20:47 <+o_be_one> deen, but its really cause you fear about manipulation ?
20:48 <@deen> it's because the servers are running badly and I'm ashamed to take money for that
20:48 <+o_be_one> r0x.fr has a donate button on his website, 5 years donation every month ! for 1 year we got, every month, 175€ to pay our servers (was very very very bigs servers ;......, withotu sponsor !)
20:48 <+o_be_one> deen you dont just host server, you develop a client and server bin ...
20:49 <@deen> why are there only good ddos protected servers in france and not in germany?
20:49 <+laxa> o_be_one: I truly think it would be a shame to give money for the dev part because it would be ridiculous compared to the work deen did
20:50 <+o_be_one> i dont really care about your game servers cause i just play sometime, im often on mine. But your work about client and a little about server (but i hate that there miss some funny things and features >.<) and now i know you a little better (your mind, etc.) i want to pay for that,
20:50 <+laxa> deen: I guess it's because of the bandwith cost
20:50 <+o_be_one> ive already payed a dev just cause he fixes immediately something in his server bin ... lol.
20:50 <+o_be_one> well i thing that guys that offer times and money could receive help from donators;
20:51 <+o_be_one> cause germany is noob.
20:51 <+o_be_one> ive already seen some gameserver closed by providers just cause of ddos -_-
20:51 <+o_be_one> serious, not pro !
20:51 <+o_be_one> hey if i remember well vali was one of them >.<
20:52 <+o_be_one> laxa, its just a bigger thanks than the word "thank you"
20:52 <+laxa> you know reverse proxy nginx o_be_one ?
20:55 <+o_be_one> laxa, just worked a little on it :(
20:55 <+o_be_one> laxa, what do you want to do ?
20:55 <+laxa> simple reverse proxy with remote hosts
20:55 <+laxa> but apparently images aren't loaded
20:56 <+laxa> I think I forogot to add this : 
20:56 <+laxa>             proxy_set_header Host $host;
20:56 <+laxa>             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
20:56 <+laxa>             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
20:56 <@deen> so there are honest vps providers after all!
20:57 <@deen> o_be_one: we were closed in iran multiple times because of ddos
20:57 <@deen> and now we have a bad server with lags and noone plays
21:04 <+KinG> hi all
21:04 <+KinG> deen:  hi u here?
21:05 <@deen> hi
21:05 <+KinG> hey
21:05 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
21:05 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 298
21:05 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
21:05 <+KinG> deen:  u want to see 1st part of my map ? :D
21:05 <@deen> no, sorry
21:05 <+KinG> xD
21:05 <@deen> I'm busy
21:05 <+KinG> ik
21:06 <@deen> i really like the new FRA server
21:06 <@deen> can finally get rid of the expensive kimsufi
21:06 <+eeeee> whats the new server
21:06 <@EastByte> it's a secret :O
21:06 <@deen> ingame it's FRA2
21:08 <@EastByte> 64 bytes from 178.33.191.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=0.667 ms
21:08 <@EastByte> I guess its located in GRA?
21:08 <@deen> ^^
21:08 <@deen> You detective!
21:09 <+eeeee> so much for the secret
21:09 <@EastByte> ^^
21:10 <@deen> if it was up to me i would've told you =/
21:11 <+eeeee> k ic
21:11 <@EastByte> c'mon I guess the more interesting thing is which provider is being used :)
21:12 <+eeeee> if it's cheaper then some sublease of ovh i guess
21:12 <@EastByte> or some reseller
21:14 <+eeeee> https://www.harmony-hosting.com/help/monitoring/ there you go
21:15 <@deen> mine has the lowest uptime =(
21:28 <@deen> I didn't know ddnet client was that popular: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11097
21:29 <@deen> but whenever i check about half of the people on any server are not using it
21:29 <+o_be_one> lol many players laughed about me cause i was using the original client ...
21:29 <@deen> i'd like to know why people don't use ddnet client
21:29 <+o_be_one> ive moved to ddnet one month ago i think.
21:30 <+o_be_one> ddnet is the only one client i like to use after the original
21:30 <+o_be_one> maybe cause there is no cheat and features added enhance TW.
21:30 <+o_be_one> but i hate the aimline feature.
21:30 <+o_be_one> (and its not the mind of someone whos doesnt want /r >.<)
21:30 <+o_be_one> i dont use aimline so :p
21:31 <@deen> aimline is mainly for one reason
21:31 <@deen> to save tees by hooking through corners
21:31 <@deen> for normal play i don't like it much either
21:32 <@deen> so, harmony-hosting looks awesome so far. hope they can handle the ddos
21:32 <+KinG> deen: i made a map that i can't even get to start ^^
21:33 <@deen> weird
21:33 <+KinG> so wierd ^^
21:37 <+o_be_one> deen, told them they can talk with me if they need to send you urgent message about something
21:37 <+o_be_one> i work always with them (they are on irc !)
21:37 <+o_be_one> they are my friends now ...
21:37 <@EastByte> hello Themix, east here
21:37 <+o_be_one> so if you need help too, you'll be welcome.
21:37 <@deen> nice o_be_one 
21:37 < Themix> Hey
21:37 <@deen> hi Themix 
21:39 <+KinG> deen: one thing that i couldn't find on http://ddnet.tw/rules/ is what the white DDNet tiles are the start or the black ones? like the start of a jetpack part!
21:39 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/howto/
21:41 <+KinG> but deen i use te red game tiles for start and they are correct like jetpack the red ones are start of a jetpack part and greens end why it's like this in here?!:|
21:44 <@deen> no idea
21:44 <+KinG> omg ^^
21:45 <+laxa> fuck, gcc compilation failed
21:45 <+KinG> what is gcc?:|
21:46 <@deen> gnu compiler collection
21:46 <+laxa> checking for unzip... /usr/bin/unzip
21:46 <+laxa> configure: error: cannot find neither zip nor jar, cannot continue
21:47 <+laxa> oh ok
21:47 <+laxa> need zip...
21:50 <+laxa> deen: do you know if harmony is company from ovh or a reseller ?
21:52 <+laxa> well apparently it's a reseller :)
21:52 <+laxa> I guess the guy paying for it is french, and it's not o_be_one, really wondering who it is
21:54 <+laxa> deen: you have a teamspeak 3 server installed on your VPS by default !
21:55 <+laxa> by no "no-profit" license though
21:55 <+laxa> -by+but
21:56 <+laxa> ah or maybe not, depends on your server configuration
21:59 <+laxa> Wow, didn't knew, but crontab can execute things only at start...
21:59 <+laxa> Might be better than services or upstart I guess :p
21:59 <+laxa> or rc-levels
22:00 <@deen> laxa: paying for it?
22:00 <@deen> laxa: i'm paying for it
22:00 <+laxa> how did you did, no english interface !
22:00 <@deen> i just clicked random stuff
22:00 <@deen> that sounded good
22:00 <+laxa> xD
22:00 <@deen> actually did no translation at all!
22:00 <+laxa> then why it needs to be "secret" ?
22:01 <@deen> because it has good protection
22:01 <+laxa> who told you about it ?
22:03 <+laxa> they seem nice indeed
22:03 <@deen> oh yeah, first ictf game in forever!
22:23 <+o_be_one> laxa, its me
22:23 <+o_be_one> its my hoster.
22:23 <+eeeee> i've been using proplay.de for my vps for years and they only have german interface
22:23 <+o_be_one> my provider* (im just a customer)
22:23 <+eeeee> so had to use same approach as deen
22:24 <@deen> proplay seem to be nice, but no protection
22:24 <@deen> nfoservers are in Frankfurt and apparently have protection, but would cost 55 € per month
22:24 <+eeeee> yeah i used to have like 8 cpus for 3eur/month
22:24 <+o_be_one> laxa, its my sponsor, sponsor of r0x.fr community
22:25 <+o_be_one> oh guy i have a NPL about TeamSpeak
22:25 <+o_be_one> you need a TS3 server ? :o
22:25 <+o_be_one> im allowed to host 10 servers with 512 slots ...
22:25 <+laxa> ts.ddnet.tw is NPL
22:25 <+o_be_one> i use only one of these 10 ...
22:25 <+o_be_one> oh ok
22:25 <+laxa> don't steal me that
22:25 <+laxa> :p
22:25 <+o_be_one> "<laxa> deen: you have a teamspeak 3 server installed on your VPS by default !"
22:25 <+laxa> but no NPL license
22:26 <+o_be_one> yes thats why ive said that
22:26 <@deen> i don't know why i would need that?
22:26 <+laxa> I think you don't have it anyway if you choosed regular debian 7
22:26 <@deen> yes i did
22:27 <+laxa> o_be_one: and I understand it that way : you can have up to 10 virtual servers with a max slots number being 512
22:27 <+eeeee> deen: ever thought of breifly showing some "download ddnet client" protip in the broadcast when vanilla client user connects?
22:27 <+laxa> I don't think you can have 10 x 512 slots
22:28 <+o_be_one> laxa, yes they need to share the same ip >.<
22:29 <@deen> eeeee: good idea
22:38 <@deen> any idea how quickly i can cancel kimsufi?
22:38 <@EastByte> lol, you won't get the money back
22:38 <@EastByte> so why cancel it?
22:39 <@deen> too bad
22:39 <@deen> i got the money back at KMS
22:39 <+o_be_one> no money back
22:39 <@EastByte> ah, nice
22:39 <+o_be_one> just dont pay the next month ...
22:39 <@deen> alright, figured so
22:39 <@EastByte> and give me the server
22:39 <+o_be_one> maybe you can try deen :/
22:39 <@deen> i'll wait a bit to see what happens when FRA2 gets ddosed
22:39 <@EastByte> yea, we'll see
22:40 <@deen> I'm just wondering
22:40 <@deen> i'll also have to migrate the website again
22:40 <@deen> mailserver and everything
22:40 <@EastByte> just put website and stuff on a cheap ddos protected vps :/
22:40 <@deen> sigh, where to get that?
22:40 <+eeeee> guess you could just use gmail for mail and cloudflare for website
22:41 <+Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
22:41 <@EastByte> I agree to gmail (external mail provider)
22:41 <@deen> o_be_one: do i get a message when my HH server gets ddosed?
22:41 <+o_be_one> deen, i dont understand why you dont host this fucking website + mail on a server not hosting tw -_-
22:42 <@deen> o_be_one: because i don't have anyo ther server
22:42 <@deen> any other*
22:42 <+o_be_one> deen, unfortunately no, but in the panel there is a notif on firewall setting "your server is under attack"
22:42 <@EastByte> 2,4eur ovh vps :)
22:42 <+Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
22:42 <@EastByte> and cloudflare on top
22:42 <+o_be_one> but i can ask them to give some graph when needed
22:42 <@EastByte> or somethin
22:42 <+o_be_one> EastByte, 200€ cloudflare ...
22:42 <@deen> o_be_one: hm, a mail would be nice
22:42 <+o_be_one> per month !
22:42 <@EastByte> I mean the free version
22:42 <+o_be_one> deen, sure ill tell them
22:43 <@EastByte> well but I don't like cloudflare
22:43 <+o_be_one> deen, you want a free vps to host website + mails ?
22:43 <@deen> it also needs to run the database
22:43 <@deen> and my bouncer and some stuff like that
22:43 <@deen> also, FRA1 getting ddosed
22:55 < Savander> [22:54:01] woah
22:55 <+laxa> [22:54:01] how is tmux better than screen then ?
22:55 <+laxa> [22:54:05] pause uses tmux too
22:55 <+o_be_one> [22:54:07] screeeennn
22:55 <+o_be_one> [22:54:12] pause, pourquoiiiiii :'(
22:55 <@EastByte> [22:54:19] even pause knows that tmux is much better
22:55 <+laxa> [22:54:29] o_be_one: tu sais que je suis francais au moins ? :)
22:55 <+o_be_one> [22:54:57] ok seen the vs, tmux is better.
22:55 <+laxa> [22:55:06] vs ?
22:55 <+o_be_one> [22:55:10] laxa, non du tout :D ! t'es d'où ? je suis de Montpellier mais ej vis à Montreal depuis 1 an :p
22:55 <+o_be_one> [22:55:16] http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/Screen_vs_tmux
22:55 <+Nimda> [22:55:19] DDNet Chile went back online!
22:55 <+eeeee> [22:55:26] interesting, turns out there actually are some ways to detect spoofed ips http://www.cs.wm.edu/~hnw/paper/hcf.pdf
22:55 <+eeeee> now we have to figure if anyone implements that
22:56 <+laxa> o_be_one: Paris, pause is a good friend of me, he currently uses my server as IRC bouncer.
22:56 <+o_be_one> oh ok
22:56 <+o_be_one> hes from paris too ?
22:56 <@EastByte> eeeee: I can feel a lot of fals positives^^
22:56 <+laxa> yeah
22:56 <+laxa> we both did EPITECH at Paris.
22:56 <+laxa> but I left after 2 years
22:56 <+laxa> and he is currently finishing it, in last year now.
22:57 <+o_be_one> ahah
22:57 <+o_be_one> ive made SUPINFO :D !
22:58 <@deen_> I have a feeling we'll lose chile for good tonight
22:59 <+o_be_one> deen_, you cant put all your eggs in the same cart. Your website must not be hosted on same host has your gameservers
22:59 <+o_be_one> well TCP servers must not be hosted with UDP servers i think :p
23:00 <@EastByte> let's just implement tcp support in tw
23:01 <+eeeee> or even better, make tw work over http
23:02 <+eeeee> and cloudflare it :P
23:02 <@EastByte> does cloudflare only forward http?
23:02 <@EastByte> let's see whether they support websockets^^
23:02 <+eeeee> not the free version
23:03 <@EastByte> ah
23:04 <+o_be_one> TCP is much better >.<
23:04 <+Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
23:04 <@EastByte> I wanted to implement an unreliable datagram model over tcp using multiple streams
23:04 <@EastByte> but http makes it even funnier :D
23:05 <+eeeee> yeah
23:05 <+eeeee> unfortunately if you open too many streams it might be considered an attack
23:05 <@EastByte> ep
23:05 <@EastByte> yep
23:28 <@deen_> TestTee96: your server is from nfoservers?
23:28 <+o_be_one> TestTee96, your french too :p
23:29 < TestTee96> I am 
23:29 < TestTee96> Yes they are Deen
23:38 <@deen_> but if you have something private to say you can whisper me
23:38 <@deen_> and don't mind the other deen joining all the time, that's just a ddosed server
23:38 <@deen_> OVH one actually
23:39 < TestTee96> Okay.. :P
23:39 <@deen_> you said you could convert one to linux?
23:39 <@deen_> what specs would it have?
23:39 < TestTee96> But those are not ddos protected
23:39 <@deen_> ah, too bad
23:39 < TestTee96> 1-4gb ram
23:39 <@deen_> nfoservers is not protected or what?
23:40 < TestTee96> cpu strong enough
23:40 < TestTee96> nfo is safe enough up to know
23:40 <@EastByte> safe enough against 28gbit/s traiffc?
23:40 < TestTee96> But they can be downed probably, Found a problem in the firewall of nfo.. 
23:40 < TestTee96> Do you get 28gbit? 
23:41 < Maple> woo
23:41 <@deen_> i think 20 gbit/s was the max so far
23:41 <+o_be_one> hey Maple :D
23:41 <@deen_> hi Maple
23:41 < Maple> yo
23:41 < Maple> the hall of fame is laggy
23:41 < TestTee96> I got good connections with owners of multiple online booters/botnets. I can ask stresstesting on my server? 
23:41 < Maple> so many videos take long to load
23:41 < TestTee96> Maple:  We are trying to find a solution to ddosing
23:42 <@deen_> Maple: https://www.youtube.com/user/DDraceNetwork/videos
23:42 < Maple> ddos the ddoser
23:42 <@deen_> Maple: i know, i have to redesign it somehow
23:42 <@deen_> TestTee96: don't attack your own server^^
23:42 < Maple> i suggest just making a list of titles
23:42 <@EastByte> TestTee96: the attacks are pretty well targeted on teeworlds servers
23:42 < TestTee96> deen_:  I do it all the time
23:43 < TestTee96> My big websites get pen-tests all the time
23:43 <@deen_> TestTee96: can you give me a ddos protected linux server in Frankfurt?
23:43 < TestTee96> for db security, etc
23:43 < TestTee96> linux, 
23:43 < TestTee96> Then I should convert mine into linux?
23:43 <@deen_> I'm just asking what you're offering
23:43 <@deen_> DDNet can't run on Windows
23:43 < TestTee96> I could, but I was thinking of something else
23:43 < TestTee96> (Got windows
23:43 < TestTee96> of? 
23:43 <@deen_> ok, tell me
23:44 < TestTee96> Why not? 
23:44 <@deen_> because i have a bunch of scripts and i don't want to port them to Windows
23:44 <@deen_> i have 0 experience with windows servers
23:44 < TestTee96> Okay
23:44 < TestTee96> Well, I can convert it
23:44 < TestTee96> But I still have a better Idea
23:44 <@deen_> tell me!
23:45 < TestTee96> I should rent a Dedicated (linux.. :( ) server
23:45 < TestTee96> And make multiple profiles on it
23:45 <@deen_> Maple: if you're bored, remake the hall of fame website and send it to me
23:45 <@deen_> sounds expensive, TestTee96 
23:45 < TestTee96> You your account, I will have mine, and we give hosters the possibility to join
23:45 < TestTee96> like r0x etc
23:45 <+o_be_one> its me :d
23:46 < TestTee96> 32gb, more then enough for half teeworlds
23:46 < TestTee96> génial ;)
23:46 < TestTee96> Not half teeworlds, but you get what I mean
23:46 <@deen_> 32 GB is enough for entire teeworlds
23:46 <+o_be_one> What is your goal TestTee96 i dont really understand from where you come and why you want to help all tw servers ?
23:46 < TestTee96> Well
23:47 < TestTee96> I used to own one of the best and most played teeworlds servers a couple years ago. When some people were jaleous. They started to ddos me. I had to stop hosting and started with learning about ddos, finding some friends. Testing all things arround it.
23:48 < TestTee96> Now, a couple years later, I think I have enough experience, money and time to be helpful for TeeWorlds
23:48 < TestTee96> It is a great community. Some old players got me in to it again.
23:49 < TestTee96> I can have some people donating a small amount (5-15€) /month just to have some servers of me online again
23:49 <+laxa> Took me the day to make it work, but I finally have this fucking rtorrent compiled with last sources \o/
23:49 < TestTee96> I think with the help of a couple people with the same goal as me,
23:49 < TestTee96> We could make a safe & good Teeworlds
23:49 < TestTee96> Built on Trust, Time and Friendship
23:50 < TestTee96> Not all hosters will be able to join our hosting. Only the ones realy motivated, not abusing, and mature enough to not fuck arrount with servers
23:50 < TestTee96> Some requirements need to be met. And the players that will get to know us, and like us. Might donate just to keep on the stability and fun
