09:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> chiller doing the lord's work :'0
09:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> giving zCatch some love
10:02 < bridge_> <teero777> chiller are you a 0.7 maintainer already?
10:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Chiller is the 0.7
10:02 < bridge_> <teero777> Does he merge his own prs tho
10:07 < bridge_> <jxsl13> he's giving zCatch 0.6/0.7 some love
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 send good zCatch colors
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 nah i got no powers nowhere :c
10:08 < bridge_> <jxsl13> look in my mod I think in player.cpp or so
10:08 < bridge_> <teero777> ;(
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez steal
10:08 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ez
10:08 < bridge_> <jxsl13> take everything
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u got good colors from professional designer?
10:10 < bridge_> <jxsl13> no
10:10 < bridge_> <jxsl13> it's Teetime's original color
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah what is this black magix algorithm ``color = max(0, 160 - GetNumTotalCaughtPlayers() * 10) * 0x010000 + 0xff00;``
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how many kills does it support? does it get stuck at some point?
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke ima try
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yeah hm gets stuck at red
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/zcatch_colors.gif
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmmmm
10:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> iirc at like 20 kills it was at grey, at least on zCatch 0.7
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need lerato the color wizard to get correct colors mapped from 0.6 to 0.7 xd

12:27 < bridge_> <learath2> I also made a big mistake. I forgot to note down the command I was using to generate my initramfs and it ended up getting pushed out of my bash history. If I make a mistake I might not be able to boot back in to try again üòÑ
12:28 < bridge_> <.laxa> No backups? üòÑ
12:29 < bridge_> <learath2> I'll keep one, but idk if I can get my bootloader to use it, never had to use the fallback with this bootloader üòÑ
12:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> increase bash history size
12:30 < bridge_> <jxsl13> hehe
12:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or you are simply not as relevant as lea, no front
12:37 < bridge_> <egyt> :D
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when will we add Denglish as language

14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im motivated
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to do a ricv emulator

14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what?
14:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to do a riscv emulator
14:49 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> –±–ª—è
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what?
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant read your msg
14:50 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> why does everyone write in English?
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in what language should they write?
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most ppl here know english
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we are from all kind of countries
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> germany, spain, italy, turkey
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so we speak english
14:51 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> I don't know Russian or English well
14:52 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> and then I realized why there are so many people who speak English here
14:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in #off-topic you can also write russian
14:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes there are russians
14:52 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> I'll be using a translator then.
14:53 < bridge_> <qiworzzz> but I understood well, it's just that a lot of people write in English
15:00 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> You know what would be better, if everyone was writing in their mother tongue, hell yeeeeeah
15:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> This chat would be all in german üò¨
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> das stimmt
15:05 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> tja
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isso weilso is
15:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/fvz2CxyGcyQ @avolicious you could learn a thing or two from that guy hehe. tl;dw he is running million dollar startups with this gigachad techstack: 1vps (16core 500‚Ç¨), no staging, no kubernetes, php, jquery, sqlite3
15:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Actually ddnet setup is quite close lol
15:17 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> deen also likes bare metal and beefy vps and ddnet.org uses jquery afaik
15:25 < bridge_> <jxsl13> urgh
15:25 < bridge_> <jxsl13> jquery
15:29 < bridge_> <avolicious> But my client is running K8s and makes multi billion dollars, not million üôÇ
15:30 < bridge_> <avolicious> So nearly all my clients are investing into cloud-native, all multi billion dollar companies
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> So for me it makes the most sense to invest knowledge into kubernetes, multi-tenant environments and all various kinds of technologies üòÑ
15:32 < bridge_> <avolicious> But sure, it doesnt always make sense to built it upon a hyperscaling infra. But for me its more a learning process & get some expertise based on a non financial ruin side project üòÑ
15:32 < bridge_> <learath2> Scuse me, no foreign languages outside #off-topic ü§ì
15:37 < bridge_> <avolicious> So chiller, I've looked into some of his websites & he uses other services mostly. He isnt a service provider per se, he just uses other services and is the middleman inbetween. Thats basically not my goal to do in life üòÑ
15:39 < bridge_> <avolicious> But if you like something like this, to work as a middleware. You can also check some documentaries about dropshipping - same technique ( no legal advise to do from me tho ).
15:43 < bridge_> <learath2> It is my professional opinion that cloud is a scam
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> does anyone know if llvm has a riscv assembler?
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for riscv assembly
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not llvmir
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw my emulator name will be rysk
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ryokan
15:52 < bridge_> <melo∆û> https://llvm.org/docs/RISCVUsage.html
15:52 < bridge_> <melo∆û> 
15:52 < bridge_> <melo∆û> looks like it
15:53 < bridge_> <melo∆û> ah wait no you still have to convert it to llvmir ig
16:03 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 how to differentiate pointer variable declaration and multiplication expression statement, they are both `ident` `*` `ident` :\
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but thats to assemble llvmir to risc
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i want to assemble assembly to machine
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like riscv64-elf-gcc
16:31 < bridge_> <zhn> if there's nothing in https://github.com/orgs/riscvarchive/ ig there's just nothing
16:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Precedence
16:34 < bridge_> <learath2> Well actually, not even precedence. How is dereference `ident * ident`?
16:35 < bridge_> <avolicious> But companies are paying a lot for cloud resources üòÑ
16:35 < bridge_> <avolicious> Without naming any company, but I can tell that all my clients are paying more than a million / month for cloud resources üòÑ
16:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Making more and more money for the corporations
16:36 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yeah, but running on-prem isnt sufficient for serving billions of requests / month
16:37 < bridge_> <learath2> Most people aren't serving billions of requests per month
16:37 < bridge_> <avolicious> But my clients arent most people
16:37 < bridge_> <avolicious> They have the need to serve it, so cloud is sufficient for their use-case
16:37 < bridge_> <learath2> And people were serving billions of requests per month way before aws existed
16:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Wot
16:38 < bridge_> <avolicious> But yeah, you dont have to run everything on a hyperscaler... but the linked yt video from chiller mentions "how to run it on a 400 USD vps"
16:39 < bridge_> <avolicious> Even if he has a small team of a few people, its more than enough. But the larger the company gets, the more fine-grained permissions it needs
16:41 < bridge_> <avolicious> If your company now runs several stores across a country, its also bad to have it on-prem. If there is any problem within this infra, all stores are kinda offline. Cloud eliminates it by providing a flexible way to lift & shift
16:41 < bridge_> <learath2> E.g. the startup I'm currently at would run at one one hundredth the cost if they weren't running on GCP
16:41 < bridge_> <avolicious> Then your startup has a bad deal tho
16:41 < bridge_> <learath2> They are preparing for a scale that will never come
16:41 < bridge_> <avolicious> We are google partners and we can give credits to our clients easily
16:42 < bridge_> <avolicious> Your google key account manager can add funds to your account without worrying about any consequences
16:42 < bridge_> <learath2> There are some operations that will never need this level of hyperscaling. People need to understand their companies will never be the next tik tok
16:42 < bridge_> <learath2> And you exist to serve the few who truly need it
16:43 < bridge_> <avolicious> But traffic is expensive on hyperscalers. Ingress mostly is pretty cheap, but egress is expensive as hell
16:43 < bridge_> <avolicious> So having on-prem and doing a hybrid solution can be more expensive
16:43 < bridge_> <learath2> The compute isn't exactly cheap either
16:43 < bridge_> <avolicious> What are you using for your compute?
16:44 < bridge_> <0xdeen> What choice do I have? If I used cloud for DDNet I'd have to pay 500k‚Ç¨/year üòÑ
16:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Also the only other alternative isn't on-prem. On-prem is a lot of work and will indeed end up more expensive in all the costs associated. But a lot of companies can run on a handful of off premises bare metal or even vps instances.
16:45 < bridge_> <paralix19> Why on server GER2 and FIN i have 200/400 ping √≤.√≤
16:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Everything is running on GCP. I didn't see what sort of instances they are running. But I do see the final cost and how many requests we do
16:46 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Be the change you want to see. I moved our tests from AWS to Hetzner at work.
16:46 < bridge_> <learath2> I set up our staging instance on a hetzner vm. It has been a much appreciated cost reduction
16:47 < bridge_> <avolicious> It depends on how you utilize GCP. You can do similar tasks with different tools, they are priced different
16:47 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Problems with peering to Hetzner I guess üòÑ
16:47 < bridge_> <avolicious> Tbh, thats a problem at hyperscalers. Cost transparency & FinOps in an easy way
16:48 < bridge_> <avolicious> You need basically a team of special trained GCP engineers/architects to get a good result which is likely to be cost efficient
16:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Figuring out the cost is also so hard to do in advance. With a tinfoil hat on I'd go so far as to claim it's on purpose
16:49 < bridge_> <avolicious> I guess your startup doesnt pay this much, but if so, you get a key account manager at google. They can help you in this
16:49 < bridge_> <learath2> With double tinfoil hats on I will make the claim that this entire industry just exists to make it as complicated as possible for non-specialists so there are jobs for specialists who pitch the solutions and so and so on creating an infinite money stream
16:50 < bridge_> <avolicious> Well, there is a lot of money in this industry üòÑ
16:50 < bridge_> <learath2> We exist at just expensive enough that google won't care about us yet
16:50 < bridge_> <avolicious> I would say its multi-billion dollars a month
16:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> Oh, well maybe we can cover you üòÑ I'll ask in the gcp chatroom, maybe someone knows who to ask
16:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> They love this tactic to keep you as a consumer
16:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> They basically set your account balance to a small amount, you are happy, google is happy
16:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Eh I don't care. It's not my money they are spending üôÉ
16:54 < bridge_> <learath2> We phased out an old elixir backend which helped a bit. But if this was my startup I'd definitely run it on just a single bare metal server
16:54 < bridge_> <avolicious> üòÑ
16:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe if I believed it'd scale into multiple countries I'd have a script to set up the server quicker
16:54 < bridge_> <avolicious> Terraform
16:54 < bridge_> <avolicious> No scripts
16:55 < bridge_> <avolicious> You can even manage bare-metal with terraform on hetzner
16:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah that's cool. Last I used terrafrom it was basically aws, do, gcp, azure
16:56 < bridge_> <avolicious> You can use any provider, its vendor agnostic
16:56 < bridge_> <avolicious> but aws, do, gcp, azure and a few others are supported by hashicorp itself
16:56 < bridge_> <avolicious> Others are mostly community modules, but they work the same way
16:56 < bridge_> <avolicious> you can also write your own module to support your own provider if needed
16:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh that's nice. I didn't know community modules were a thing
16:57 < bridge_> <avolicious> https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules
16:57 < bridge_> <avolicious> Its actually pretty awesome
16:58 < bridge_> <avolicious> We are using it for any scale. SME and big companies
16:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Back when I was last interested in this sort of automation ansible was still relevant üôÉ
16:58 < bridge_> <avolicious> It is still
16:58 < bridge_> <learath2> To be fair not exactly the same thing
16:58 < bridge_> <avolicious> There is a diff in Terraform vs Ansible tho
16:58 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ansible sucks but still widely used
16:59 < bridge_> <avolicious> Why?
16:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah very
16:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> automating a lot of customer configuration is not feasible
16:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> with ansible
16:59 < bridge_> <learath2> What would be your goto in 2024?
16:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and staying up to date
16:59 < bridge_> <avolicious> ?
16:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> there is no open source alternative, tho
17:00 < bridge_> <learath2> What would be your corposource alternative?
17:00 < bridge_> <jxsl13> we do our own internal tool for that üôÇ
17:00 < bridge_> <avolicious> And thats feasable ü§£
17:00 < bridge_> <jxsl13> we had a lot of problems with ansible
17:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, rolling your own. My favourite. I approve
17:01 < bridge_> <avolicious> Somehow I believe that all DDNet devs have this mindset
17:01 < bridge_> <learath2> So andsible is still the goto for deploying servers?
17:01 < bridge_> <avolicious> Just building everything their own, everytime
17:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Ofc. This is one of the last havens for free-minded developers
17:02 < bridge_> <avolicious> How complex are your setups?
17:02 < bridge_> <avolicious> I guess not that complex, no?
17:02 < bridge_> <learath2> So ansible is still the goto for deploying servers?
17:02 < bridge_> <jxsl13> My team is doing the tooling for our datacenters, so rolling our own is an option üôÇ
17:02 < bridge_> <avolicious> I would say that ansible is not working for 2 servers, but having 50 servers its highly recommended
17:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah if you are deploying 2 honestly you'd probably be wasting time writing the playbooks
17:03 < bridge_> <avolicious> Exactly
17:04 < bridge_> <avolicious> But writing own tooling is time consuming, you have to pay people to do it & to fix possible bugs
17:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> yep
17:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> who fixes your ansible bugs?
17:05 < bridge_> <avolicious> Which bugs? Bugs in modules?
17:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in external modules
17:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> for example
17:06 < bridge_> <avolicious> Either external maintainers or you & you PR it to help others
17:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> also costs money and time
17:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> might be way less than spinning your own
17:06 < bridge_> <avolicious> But less than building your own, maintaining it your own & its not helping others
17:07 < bridge_> <jxsl13> it's not open source, yep
17:07 < bridge_> <avolicious> If it would, you need to afford it as company as well
17:07 < bridge_> <jxsl13> helps our customere
17:07 < bridge_> <jxsl13> s
17:07 < bridge_> <avolicious> You need active maintainers and contributors, otherwise its a dead project as soo many others
17:08 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you need to afford that for sure to make such tools open source. Sadly our company does nearly nothing in the open source regard
17:08 < bridge_> <avolicious> But thats not sad. Its because they wont take this effort
17:09 < bridge_> <avolicious> Open Source isnt free as people often describe it
17:09 < bridge_> <jxsl13> yep. companies sink billions into open source
17:09 < bridge_> <avolicious> You need to actively maintain the project. Either by answering issues/prs or contribute yourself -> company pays salary for employee
17:10 < bridge_> <avolicious> And mostly the open source community likes to say: Hey, just open source it, so you dont have to take care. Well you basically HAVE to take care üòÑ Otherwise it will get forked and your initial open source idea is a dead project *blinks his eyes at ddnet* üòÑ

20:27 < bridge_> <learath2> What is the ident on the left in a deref expression?
20:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I wasn't talking about deref expression
20:29 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> But about variable declaration

21:10 < bridge_> <.tajm> hi, ive recently installed ddnet on linux mint through zipped file (tar), cuz ddnet on package manager is outdated. When i unpacked it, it has no icons, how can i make icons appear?
21:26 < bridge_> <jxsl13> linux magic is required
21:26 < bridge_> <jxsl13> gotta google that
21:26 < bridge_> <jxsl13> some config file in some folder is required for that
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> unpack all files
21:48 < bridge_> <.tajm> i did unpack all files, how can i unpack part of files? xD
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> unpack the .tar too

22:41 < bridge_> <learath2> You have finally arrived at a point that I actually don't know. I have only a clue. I think C doesn't allow expressions on their own. So this can't be an expression
22:42 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> :thonk:

22:44 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, I'm wrong. Then idk how this is handled for once
22:44 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm also extremely drunk
22:44 < bridge_> <learath2> Like about to pass out. So maybe tomorrow I'll know
22:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> do you want to read fun fun assembly
22:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Show me. Idk if my in-brain assembler is still operational though
22:45 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> my neanderthal brain can't do anything even with gdb xddd
22:46 < bridge_> <learath2> I remember C being context free, but perhaps it's not? If it's not context free then left side wouldn't be `ident`
22:47 < bridge_> <learath2> It would be `type * ident` vs `ident * ident` then there is no conflict
22:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1279180741305045003/image.png?ex=66d38166&is=66d22fe6&hm=a2f7767c30f1e5a44ab1a340084920b1c612685eaa1a41b4b20a28bc152b0c21&
22:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it returns sometimes true, sometimes false üò¨
22:48 < bridge_> <teero777> First non-deterministic machine let's goo :D
22:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Too long for the drunk version of the assembler sorry
22:49 < bridge_> <vladislav_durex> bye
22:49 < bridge_> <zaerin__> found it.
22:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Tis not an airport, you don't need to announce your departure
22:49 < bridge_> <vladislav_durex> bye bye
22:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> It's so joe over
22:58 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Omfg, it moves 0 into `r14b` but later in `cmp` uses `r14d`
