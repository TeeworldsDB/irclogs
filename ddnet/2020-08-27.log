06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Why DDNet crash my pc
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> woah
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> If I play for a few minutes, it just crashes my entire pc
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> I use Linux
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> pretty weird lol
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> That didn't happen, now I can't complete a map because it crash in the middle
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> It's not just the game, it's my entire computer, I have to turn it off and on again
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> @Jupstar âœª Thanks you so much
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spyry sounds like a problem with your hardware or os. other games work?
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spyry you can set `logfile "foo.log"` and after you restart client everything should be logged there
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> > @Spyry sounds like a problem with your hardware or os. other games work?
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen others game dont crash my pc
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen ?

08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gfx_show_warnings 0 to disable
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> divisible instead of devidable
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how long does it appear?
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 10 seconds
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did you implement it in the graphics pipeline? ðŸ˜„
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its in the main thread
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because it looks different from our usual popup windows
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but still bit hacky
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, we have some? the problem, is the graphic class has to access it
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, I guess only in editor
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if we have one i can reimplement it
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the Welcome message and things like that
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hmm, wasn't there some other popup?
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i really dunno
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it needs to be huge for sure
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, grep for POPUP_CONNECTING for example
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the thing that shows up while connecting to a server
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah buts its not a general popup implementation
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah but there is popupmessage
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll try that
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt work ingame
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast not always
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> demoplayback for example
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[E]-TEEE> any one know the mouse problem answer ?
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @[E]-TEEE don't write the same thing in every channel please
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[E]-TEEE> oki srry
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if someone will provide smth where i can just insert the warning string tag me
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª hm, then the red thing is fine I guess
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen ok, i know it looks bad, but i'm really not too good with the whole gui stuff, and the warning also has to be on top of everything
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I'll add a generic messagebox
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 ok nice
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can the auto updater create backups if we tell it?
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when we release a new entities.png we'll probs override the custom entities and probs most ppl don't do backups
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when we release a new entities.png we'll probs override the custom entities and probs most ppl don't do backups(and also doubt many ppl use the config directory to add them)
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only done for dll/exe/ttf files
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª hm, can't you just use a menu popup now that I think about it?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 he said it doesn't work in demo viewer
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's rather easy to fix
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will it be on top of everything too?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> above modt
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> motd*
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah should be
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then it will be that, can you color it? or just add a new popup type? ðŸ˜„
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like popup_warning
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can draw whatever we want in a popup
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also, there cant be 2 popups at the same time, can there?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the map images are probs loaded before "connecting to" is gone, and if it wants to write a popup then it will probs be broken
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Store a vector of all the broken assests we loaded in the graphics
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As soon as the connect popup goes away, we push a warning one if there are broken assets loaded
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, looks trivial, we can do it on state change
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm it needs to be more opaque though, to obscure the motd
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/577f7192caee1a535a41e0c7a44a1e428f221d0c
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need to go check whether an error occured at menus.cpp:L1972
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also play around with the color, it's rather annoying for me to test that when I have to mess with install name tool every time I compile
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 ok sounds good
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 maybe I can help you with the install name tool. what exactly is wrong with it?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen if there is a framework anywhere in sight, e.g. bundled or the system library, it will link to that, no matter what cmake settings i use or what parameters i pass to find_package
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, maybe @heinrich5991 knows about cmake internals ðŸ˜„
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For me cmake is a magic black box, don't really understand its internals
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like where to read find_package source code
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So whenever I update ddnet-libs. I  either replace the SDL2 binary inside the framework with a dylib, which breaks linkage but gets me a binary thats linked to a dylib, or delete the framework entirely but also delete my own framework so that it links to the one given by pkg-config
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH in https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah cmake is a blackbox
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you have some env variables set?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing that should affect this
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also some mac specific documentation here: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#search-procedure
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have brew no emoji and yarn no emoji set
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very odd that we now need to set env variables to not have emojis on our terminals
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just 2020 things
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll read a bit on find_package
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> The ping fix is a bad fix imo, should be a checkmark thing, i always click so many times to sort by players
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its good
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also its not a fix its a feature
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's just a changed default, sort by players once and you have the old default back
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we had many newcomers join servers with ping 300, so this was clearly necessary
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Quick question -- did DDNet client have higher FPS than vanilla 0.6 client?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I'm just asking because the 0.7 client has significantly lower FPS for everyone, I believe
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with gl3 it had better fps in game usually
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Pathos in 0.7 you need to disable gfx_finish
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else u have very low fps
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as learath said with 3.3 much more fps in ddnet probably
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and with the next renderer maybe a bit more, bcs tile layers are buffered for almost all gl versions
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @Jupstar âœª thanks, seems like that improved the FPS a bit, but it's still not as smooth as the DDNet client
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Does that imply that in the DDNet client, gfx_finish 0 was default even though it didn't exist there?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> strange actually.. bcs i doubt 0.7 has more CPU side features than ddnet ðŸ˜„
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in ddnet its default 0 yes
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but it still exists
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet generally has better default values
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (imo)
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Pathos in 0.7 vsync appearntly is still default
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i get more fps with the 0.7 client vs old renderer ddnet
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast if the FPS counter in 0.7 is accurate ðŸ˜„
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> V sync was already off
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> But holy fuck v sync on as default is so stupid
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> But holy fuck v sync on as default is unbelievable
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? I played with vsync for years, I did disable it at the end but it's not that bad usually
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows it does the full refresh rate sleep
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so withh 60hz its over 16ms
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so with 60hz its over 16ms
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am honestly baffled how some drivers can be so buggy we are having trouble rendering a 2d game on them
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like how does it even make it out of QA?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its actually just bcs opengl wasnt a thing before 2010
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs a opengl to directx wrapper would do magic
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (for windows ofc)
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this on hardware pre-2010?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt any hardware that is new should have problems with the opengl 2.1 renderer
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and with new i mean 2010+
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª and if we fallback to gl1 for those, do you think it'll render?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs yes
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean opengl 1 basically doesnt allow alot xD
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u just define some vertices and render them
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3.3 for example uses instanced rendering
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it can create vertices fast on the gpu
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's acceptable that the few people with dark age computers pretending to support gl2 need to manually set their gl version
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well idc too much, the only question i have is what opengl version their console shows
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these dark age computer users are usually the ones who know less about computers..
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i only need to apply the dirty hacks for these conteces
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> contexts
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want the 3.0 context to stay as clean as possible, thats only newer hardware anyway probably
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually its already sad if the 2.1 context needs these dirty hacks
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would be the SDL default atleast ðŸ˜„
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The border issue already just confuses me to high heaven
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine not just being able to render 2d tiles
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly hate graphics stacks
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> I know this is not my place as its the dev channel but I always always have issues with v-sync. No game works on my monitors without v-sync (not just Teeworlds)... Tearing galore! Need to get me some new monitors
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but to be fair thats not a bug, its bcs sampling textures is a question of math, and if you have one images thats 512px and one thats 1024px, then the floating point difference in a normalized coordinate is different
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in shaders u can fix it by telling the LOD(mipmap level) and the texture size
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i did that before 2d texture arrays actually for gl 3.3
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @alien1344 thats sad, and strange that its the monitors fault
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I revise my previous statement. God I hate floating point numbers
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who decided we needed a varying amount of precision as we travel across the real number line
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets just multiply all existing real numbers by 10000 and drop real numbers
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teeworlds would probably work much better with fixed point coordinates anyway
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sadly, gpus don't like anything except floats, barring doubles and quads
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in newer gl you can request texels directly no floating points requires
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in newer gl you can request texels directly no floating points required
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but still needs to know texture size
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine the most primitive feature that you could want from a gpu, only being available in gl4, what is that? 2018?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gl 3.3 is gl 4.0 without tesselation
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I talk about gfx with someone, they always expect we work with pixels
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748524028301541537/unknown.png
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> note the dates
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even if they german xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, so 2010
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have expected something like 1990, but 2010 works too
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just miss the simplicity sometimes
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You want to draw a circle, you have a grid of pixels, you intersect the imaginary circle with the real grid of pixels we have, voila circle
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> neural network teeoworlds
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lets do blockchain teeworlds
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you put your inputs in a bitcoin transaction
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 15-20 minute ping depending on network congestion
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> good we have antiping for that
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> ik blockchain tw is a big meme but i wonder if there are any games running on blockchain. Could be cool for strategy or farming games
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> @Jupstar âœª well I assume its the monitor because I've got a decent graphics card and I had problems with my previous computer too :(
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @alien1344 ok, you can ofc try a different display input, like DVI instead of HDMI
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> @Jupstar âœª Yeah I could try that. I think I did have it in the Dvi port in my previous computer at one point
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh alright, thats really a strange bug then ðŸ˜„
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> @Jupstar âœª My current GFX card is the RTX 2070 ROG and before i had the GTX 1060 with the same issue. I suspect its the monitors though, should probably just get a new monitor haha
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You could test it in your television of you have one @alien1344 
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Then you know for sure
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can one of you gimme a hand in testing votes in 0.7?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/debian/status/1298996070479851522
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look this language looks even harder to read than arabic :justatest:
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh god
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't look like it'd need a feedback loop like arabic though and doesn't switch writing direction
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> why dont we ignore whole build folder using .gitignore?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because u may name it build/ and i may name it shit/
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats ignored is what cmake produces
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its fine as it is
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> isnt "build" a default name. I dont remember me chosing a name for it
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have `build/`Â in my `.git/info/exclude`
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (which is where your local ignores should be going anyway)
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is not a "build" a default name? I dont remember me chosing a name for it
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not anything enforced by cmake. For the official servers e.g. the build folder isn't even in the source foulder, nor is it called build
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have build there
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> What if we add empty folder with the name "build" to source control and ignore everything inside of this folder?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I see, there is workarounds but we could solve this problem for everyone this way though
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why though?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are not solving it for everyone like that either. As said I don't build in a folder called build
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, you either add your local gitignore or build into this folder
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, I don't like it
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like it either
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am not big fun of this idea too
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just you being lazy
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At least I won't commit it. Someone else might
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its just me trying to solve problems people might face like me
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no problem here
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we could improve documentation?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u add ur prefered build folder name to ur local exclude
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is basic git usage
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A line in the readme telling people where to add the local ignore? (I find `.git/info/exclude` isn't known by many people)
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> exactly
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they can google that
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this doesnt belong to the readme
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I didnt know about it untill today, when build generated file so I got to revert it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No matter how I like to be discriminatory to ignorant people that don't google. I don't think it's a good stance for ddnet itself ðŸ™‚
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets also document how to git add, git commit git rebase git bisect
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in our readme
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will be  fun
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git checkout git fetch
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay Try `git commit`ing only what you want. `git add -i` or `git commit -i`Â will help you with it
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets just make the readme git documentation
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki slippery slope is a very boring argument
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lemme google slippery slope
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean, I been working with c# without CMAKE and stuff, and you know what - you never care about artifacts. Cuse they are always in predefined folders which are ignored by default
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so there was no reason to learn local ignores in my case
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well thats ur c#
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ is another story
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is more freedom
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the build system
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for good and bad
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its not about freedom
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I absolutely hate VS for putting my artifacts in some obscure path I need to track down every time
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine using VS
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are projects that are very heavily integrated with VS that are hard to work with otherwise
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like UE4
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it sucks
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hope godot takes over ue4
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> waiting for the 3.0
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3.3
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'll be waiting a loooooooooooooong looooooooooooong looooooooong loooooooong loooooong loooong looooooooong time
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Godot can maybe in a fever dream think itself in the same league as ue
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ue boo
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway i dont think ill even touch game dev much
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> outside this game
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was researching the performance of `std::stack`Â and I've seen the absolute most retarded argument I've seen not to use it
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "You can't peek the second to top element"
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are you using a stack if you need to peek at random elements or iterate it?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like they train the new generation to be as dimwitted as possible
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 xddd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 "std::stack doesnt allow what a list allows so its bad"

21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> got weird issue: dummy can't connect to the server
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> reconnect
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe if server is full u cant
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dummy is like another player
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> -, server players: me
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddos maybe
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> -
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> client's problem
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or my pc's
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This dnsbl is causing so many problems. Now some servers had dns problems and thus didn't register in master servers. After fixing it the servers still don't register, only after a restart
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> > @Spyry you can set `logfile "foo.log"` and after you restart client everything should be logged there
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen Where do I find this file?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> i need create it?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, the client will create it, for me it's next to the DDNet.exe
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen

23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you're on Linux. did you set it correctly? If you open f1 and type `logfile` is the name returned?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748658053330632754/unknown.png
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen the file has been created in my home
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen the file was created in my home
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, ok
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen so i need to play until it crashes, restart my pc and look what is in the file?
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spyry hm, if the pc crashes the file might be truncated
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it might be more interesting to check system logs if they are reachable after reboot
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you could use magic sysrq to try to sync disk when the crash happened
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but generally if an application crashes the operating system, it's an OS bug, not an application bug
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> it only happens with teeworlds after a while playingit only happens with teeworlds after a while playing
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Any other program, game or anything doesn't do that
