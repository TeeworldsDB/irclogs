00:31 <+bridge> <Chairn> too bad
04:55 <+bridge> <DefaultO> No one can if you don't allow yourself to get fixed. What issues do you even have.
06:10 <+bridge> <Kicker> Why chat where 5 same people talking about computers is above tw related chat in tw discord server :thonk:
06:12 <+bridge> <DefaultO> #developer is general for nerds
06:12 <+bridge> <DefaultO> that's what was told me
06:13 <+bridge> <Alexander> To not mix randoms with highly intellectual people
06:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> im actually really stupid but still dev here anyways lol
08:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah nice thanks for contributing to ddnet++ what made you do it? And should I know you?

10:01 <+bridge> <Faulty> answered in wire
10:12 <+bridge> <DefaultO> deen, are you actively fighting that one bot client?
10:12 <+bridge> <DefaultO> I've reversed it for personal use and have to say that the bot detection seems to not pick it up
10:14 <+bridge> <DefaultO> I've reversed it for personal use and have to say that the bot detection seems to not pick it up. Or maybe you have received reports for "DefaultO" getting flagged. But there were no bans that one day I fucked around.

10:15 <+bridge> <DefaultO> One way I think you can detect it, are the crashes on connecting to a server.

10:32 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Then there is this weird behavior of joining a server that you have joined previously with another name (that client does not disconnect properly when you close it): It will disconnect your later new connection and switch to the first/older one. But this probably just looks like one IP having two non-dummy clients, and closing one right after connecting it.

12:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> I have no real issues which is why I can't be fixed easily
12:22 <+bridge> <DefaultO> oh, could have made a pull request then if that was static all along. sorry to bother you with such a little thing.
13:39 <+bridge> <Izanagi> the first issue is that you tell yourself that your issues aren't real
14:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hm, does `int64_t` have an alignment of 8 even on 32 bit platforms?
14:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems so, I checked windows x86, linux arm 32 bit
14:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> Well there is no guarantee for it iirc
14:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> alignas
14:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm mostly interested in the real world for this, trying to reverse file formats
14:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think in that case alignment = size is a safe bet, iirc
14:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see, thanks ðŸ™‚
14:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But wouldn't a file format pack at 1 byte alignment anyway. Or is it not made for efficiently
14:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Efficiency
14:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not if you dump C structs into a file
14:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Even then
14:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Force it over pragma push pack
14:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you could do that I guess
14:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (but I'm not creating a file format rn ^^)
14:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah. But I seen games do that
14:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see ðŸ™‚
16:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is this a competition
16:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wait for my paycheck kek
17:15 <+bridge> <DefaultO> The thing is. When you get yours. We get ours. So we still can donate more than you.
17:15 <+bridge> <DefaultO> :Ray:
17:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> can u thoo
17:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> can u tho
17:22 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Can is the wrong question. Would I? Probably in a few months again. Or next one.
20:31 <+bridge> <WarHammer> Omg pls help!
20:31 <+bridge> <WarHammer> i get "client: delta unpack failed, error=-3" error
20:31 <+bridge> <WarHammer> and i get fps drop
20:33 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> This is the last thing I remember seeing about it. https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1063752047947690054
20:33 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> `Robyt3: Should be fixed in currently nightly (beta)`
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @deen is it not in release client?
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs it indeed drops fps hard, lags over 1 second for me xd
