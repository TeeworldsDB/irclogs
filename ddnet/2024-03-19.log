00:33 < bridge> <hyrlaxv2> hi
02:57 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, he already left. I wonder what annoyed him so much to come back and create that issue
02:58 < bridge> <yekrm> :thonk:
02:59 < bridge> <learath2> I‚Äôm guessing he doesn‚Äôt really have the right to rescind his contributions either due to the license. Sooo I guess nothing to be done about it
03:12 < bridge> <learath2> He left 3 months ago exactly, because melon and ryozuki talked about rust. Didn‚Äôt hear anything from him through anyone at all either for 3 months. Then he shows up with that issue. Truly an enigma

05:16 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 lawyer lerato could you explain how the license disallows withrading contributions?
05:17 < ChillerDragon> voxel seems upstet something else has to had happend other than people talking about rust. is he okay? :( 
05:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Im üëå so Close to Just commenting "i Use Rust btw"
05:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> But Hes Not in His right state of Mind so i rather not
05:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> (yet)
05:24 < bridge> <sedonya> Is everything he did really going to be deleted?
05:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> Im still wondering what happened that He ended Up Like that, i remember looking at His Twitter and seeing enough Salt to replicate the ocean
06:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> We all had that feeling, that the game was not moving forward, regardless of how much development went to the game itself.
06:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I think the main problem lies in providing community made contents, especially hq ones. We have great potential mods like Infection and Teeware, which in itself could be a unique game, separated from ddnet.
06:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Sadly making maps are also dependant on the community / creators and we somehow push these problems to ddnet devs, who themselves try to improve their own servers and adding gameplay ideas which are also provided by the community (latest being Konsti's weapon shields idea, with my design being contributed to).
06:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> From that moment I realized, that you guys don't make more gameplay stuff in ddnet, cuz it would create more and more distance within what was originally supposed to be "ddnet". I get that now.
06:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But to either blame the devs for not making the game different... I would never do that if I were Voxel.
06:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But to either blame the devs for not making the game different... I would never do that if I were Voxel. We appreciate his work.
06:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But to either blame the devs for not making the game different... I would never do that if I were Voxel. We appreciate his work. (and sorry for the long messages.)
07:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Aint it more of a Github ToS thing?
07:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Anybody could verify my statement? Don't wanna make false statements, it would be gaslighting lmao

07:57 < bridge> <murpi> Multeasymap
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> good
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is making drama out of nowhere
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> also completly dishonest comment of the effort of all other devs they put
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hate people like this
08:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.zdnet.com/article/no-you-cant-take-open-source-code-back/
08:24 < bridge> <viny_mio> I mean Voxel is right, the community sucks ass and the developers waste their time doing useless things when it is obvious what this game needs. I dont want to complain about developers as they basically work for free but Voxel has a point
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> the game has never seen so much new features as today, and as u said, nobody is getting paid, **you** are not **entitled** to anything here
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think people heavily understimate the effort for someone to work on free projects besides their work and daily life
08:26 < bridge> <viny_mio> yea, mostly useless featuresü§èüèº
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> if you qant something, do it yourself first and foremost
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> if you want something, do it yourself first and foremost
08:27 < bridge> <viny_mio> This is the worst argument around. I didnt want to hurt your feelings little man, sorry for criticising the developers
08:27 < bridge> <viny_mio> but you know... account system ;)
08:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Also battle pass would be nice
08:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And eeeh paid skins
08:29 < bridge> <viny_mio> account system would solve 90% of the problems within the community
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not the worst, its actually the beat
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> best
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> because you actually think are entitled to others work
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> and that actitude should gain u a timeout at least
08:29 < bridge> <viny_mio> I never said I was entitled to anything
08:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> you dont have to say something to mean it
08:30 < bridge> <viny_mio> receiving a timeout for stating an opinion? you should maybe touch some grass homie
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok im not arguing with this troll further
08:31 < bridge> <viny_mio> random
08:35 < bridge> <learath2> Well all code is under zlib and zlib is perpetual. So while he can relicense his parts, he can't revoke our use of it under the original zlib conditions he first licensed it as. Atleast that's how I interpret it. I am not a lawyer
08:36 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder so aswell but as far as I know no one really interacted with him after he left, so idk what might have went wrong there
08:42 < bridge> <learath2> Community has always been the same, it is what it is. It's a niche old game with a community that puts heavy emphasis on nostalgia.
08:42 < bridge> <learath2> 
08:42 < bridge> <learath2> On the developer side, the "useless things" are mostly maintainance, which is indeed not very visible to the users. But that's all any of us seems to have time for. Nothing much can be done about that, you can't tell someone what they should do with the free time they have, you can only gently nudge them.
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> Heavy emphasis on backlash for new features xd
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> even when i added telegun everyone was against it
08:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2015-6
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its also true u can't add new things willy nilly without thought
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> because most devs are paaserbys and guess who end up maintaining those new features
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> the same devs always are here
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> the same devs that always are here
08:47 < bridge> <learath2> There is also a lot of politics in adding new features, which I'm sure voxel realised on the very first pr they made. You need to please the right groups within the community to minimize outrage.
08:47 < bridge> <learath2> 
08:47 < bridge> <learath2> Then there is internal developer politics. Every person with push access has different views on a lot of things. Which makes it hard to get (especially large features with many components like an account system) things through. No one is interested in writing thousands of lines of code just for it to be rejected or mostly having to be rewritten
08:49 < bridge> <learath2> It's just a consequence of the way we went about structuring this project without any real hierarchy. Most other open source endeavors have a dictator that just pushes such things through
08:54 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw I wouldn't be completely opposed to just removing their contributions just to let them have a nice clean break as it seems the contributions are what brought them back. I was just stating the license technically allows us to keep it (as far as my interpretation of how licensing of source code works)
09:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its more a tantrum, something must be happening to him
09:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> as far as i know no one is rly in contact with him here
09:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> and im against removing the contributions if legally allowed to keep them
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> which im sure we are
09:10 < bridge> <learath2> Legal is one thing but the post really seemed like they were in some sort of distress. That's why I would consider it just to not add to their burden
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> to me it seemed more like a kid throwing a tantrum but well i rly dont care much, do what you want xD
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> also should think this might set a preceent for new contributions
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should think about adding something to prevent this drama in the future
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> also should think this might set a precedent for new contributions
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> >  I'm tired of having to be tied within development with this game
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> its weird because
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt ppl reach to him at all
09:11 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think it's actually ambiguous but a CONTRIBUTING file that explicitly states that all contributed code is under perpetual zlib might be nice to just so future issues like this are very clear
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> he seems to be coming back here on his own
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can definitly also delete ur account
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> he also has several ddnet-related forks and one source ddnet repo
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> so he doesnt seem to be wanting to cut at all
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> just being "annoying"
09:13 < bridge> <learath2> I at the very least don't know of anyone that reached out to them about anything. Especially doubt anyone reached out about contributions since the rage cycle for those features ended a while ago
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe he has an alt
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> here
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> and read something from someone
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess xd
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh this is just sad and the only thing i can think of is his life might be on some sort of bad phase
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> stress at work or something
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> depression
09:16 < bridge> <learath2> If only you werent a rust and linux snob we wouldn't be in this situation
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i highly doubt its cuz me
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know i can be annoying about it sometimes
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if that affects you this much, idk.. maybe im not the problem
09:17 < bridge> <learath2> Btw when voxel left you and melon were teasing me about rust, not them. We were all just joking around
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why it was weird
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw rust is adding C-string literals
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Reveal opaque types within the defining body for exhaustiveness checking.
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Stabilize C-string literals.

09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Add lint static_mut_refs to warn on references to mutable statics.
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Support async recursive calls (as long as they have indirection).
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Undeprecate lint unstable_features and make use of it in the compiler.

09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> next update
09:19 < bridge> <learath2> Aanyway, there isn't any use to speculating. They were clearly annoyed at something and it occupied their mind for 3 months after they left no-contact
09:19 < bridge> <learath2> Finally some good features

09:20 < bridge> <learath2> Allah willing one day they will stabilize it
09:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant find it in std
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> weird
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> it should be there right? even as experimental
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Drain.html
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> vec drain method returns this iterator
09:22 < bridge> <learath2> It may have gotten removed and/or renamed
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> which has a filter method
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> it all seems stable
09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u would do
09:23 < bridge> <learath2> It's called `drain_keep_rest` now it seems
09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> x.drain().filter(|a| a.x)
09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
09:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> nightly
09:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 no
09:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> its this

09:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> there was some progress

09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is 18.1 out?
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet web is not updated
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it was cache

09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> weird
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i have a modern system
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i updated gcc

09:34 < bridge> <learath2> I guess we can move to `execute_process` if our minimum cmake version is a 3.xx nowadays
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt seem to happen
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> on my normal build
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait

09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its cuz cc cache?
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ima clean
09:36 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah good idea
09:36 < bridge> <learath2> Also maybe dont use ccache at all?
09:36 < bridge> <learath2> Oh but ebuild was using it too
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> <.<
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if my normal build used ccache
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> it uses /usr/lib/ccache/bin/c++

09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe gentoo sets
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> this warning!
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> which should tell us its a bug (?)
09:39 < bridge> <learath2> Could be, gentoo does add stuff
09:40 < bridge> <learath2> It's inside an external library though. It'd be very annoying to fix
09:41 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing it's not a union based variant, type punning like that I think is fine for the compiler
09:41 < bridge> <learath2> No it does look like a union. Well idk I'll have to look at it later. I'm starving

10:35 < bridge> <learath2> I have no idea what the original is
10:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> :angy: get your mei mei's right!
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 om
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know why!
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to enable lto
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> on gentoo
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it recommended adding strict-aliasing warning
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> to find possible lto incompatibilities
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> -flto=8 -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> Btw strict aliasing is an issue for lto
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> We should get a fixed version of the lib or patch it ourselves properly
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean thats why the flag is added right
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> lto is broken on ddnet probs
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> There is no guarantee it breaks
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but there is no guarantee its ok
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly
11:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ryo what is the best way to communicate with a FIFO named pipe in rust? do i use ` tokio::net::windows::named_pipe`
11:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> or do i use the winapi `interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe`
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> ryo what is the best way to communicate with a FIFO named pipe in rust? do i use ` tokio::net::windows::named_pipe`
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> or do i use the winapi `interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe`
11:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> there is also `interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe::tokio`
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> uhh idk i dont rly know much about windows
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i would bet the tokio one is well maintained
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u dont use tokio use the other
11:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this kinda reminds me the godot is a scam bandwagon
11:47 < bridge> <dragere> idk if something can be done about this: i just downloaded 18.1 and when i run it windows defender goes crazy and quarantines DDNet.exe as Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml but when i check it before running no detection and virustotal has 0 detections on that file as well.
11:47 < bridge> <dragere> Only weird thing is that steam 18.1 has a different hash and can be run without windows defender freaking out, is the steam release build differently?
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> Steam has no autoupdater. Which is what usually triggers defender
11:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is possible for some virus to modify executables to turn them into trojans tho but i guess the virus would've been caught first in that case
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> I guess you can check hash to make sure. Do we even put hashes on the website?
11:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive been thinking about making a PICO-8 type of game "console"/"engine" thing but its just wasm reading / writing a specified memory layout.
11:53 < bridge> <dragere> yes
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i couldnt find any hash info on the download page
11:55 < bridge> <dragere> there is link to this file: https://ddnet.org/downloads/sha256sums.txt
11:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh cool
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh found it. im just bind
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh found it. im just blind
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not even a false positive is it? auto updaters are viruses. Especially automatic updates are basically remote code execution coming from a server that could be compromised.
13:16 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> omg thanks
13:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> :owo:
13:32 < bridge> <peter0x44> Windows defender triggers on practically anything
13:32 < bridge> <peter0x44> It feels random
13:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> You don't need to be making an auto updater to trigger defender, I assume valve signs/handles your code in some way beyond that so windows defender doesn't mess with it
13:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> I think it's a protection racket scheme to sell signing certificates
13:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> People call me a conspiracy theorist for saying but I seriously don't see another reason
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I like that conspiracy theory
13:54 < bridge> <learath2> They might have a back channel that they submit binaries to get them whitelisted (doubtful). But I think we verified that they don't touch our binaries
13:56 < ChillerDragon> @0xdeen could i get you on irc once again this time itll be quick i promise
13:56 < bridge> <0xdeen> antivirus software for unknown malware is snake oil anyway
13:57 < bridge> <0xdeen> Absolutely
13:57 < ChillerDragon> marry me
13:58 < bridge> <0xdeen> If you can figure out that a software is malware, you can probably solve the halting problem too
13:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> If windows defender was for "defending" it wouldn't be giving me fearmongering messages like this
13:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219631376005988452/unknown-20.png?ex=660c013b&is=65f98c3b&hm=cfd914c4c67fb0409ad55acac888f79edd1c51fc570c20617105e6f197d469fe&
14:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's great as a developer when your users get told you're a "remote attacker" making a "ulthar.a!ml trojan"  to "execute commands"
14:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> Whatever a ulthar.a!ml is
14:02 < bridge> <peter0x44> The whole way it operates is completely opaque, sometimes it deletes the executables as soon as you download them
14:02 < bridge> <peter0x44> Everything with it is a "dark pattern"
14:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I would
14:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> Not to mention the resources it consumes, or more accurately **steals**
14:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> This was my recent experience building GCC
14:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> And yes, this is *after* I added those directories to the "exclusion" list
14:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219632730871038044/IMG20240317192842.jpg?ex=660c027e&is=65f98d7e&hm=717671df21f9f5bcb76747f9fc30d087c294ffb402951a962bb3c022316564bc&
14:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hot
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> You might be able to heuristically through behavioral analysis. I can't think of any other way
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the word heuristics got replaced by the buzz word LLM cool kids ask chatgpt these days if software is a virus or not
14:15 < bridge> <learath2> Let's make LLMs illegal
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> There is an LLM for that
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is the new there is an app for that
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no but seriously such pattern recognition sounds like an AI task or do you think it could be fooled to easy? It should at least reduce false positives in my head.
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too*
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> We have colleagues asking chatgpt about what tech stack competing product uses
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and posted it on company group chat
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and no one questioned about any of the hallucinations.
14:18 < bridge> <learath2> It is well suited for machine learning indeed. But classical handwritten heuristics aren't bad either
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if hallucinations are worse than the current windows defender randomness
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> old school lerato
14:19 < bridge> <learath2> Like if the program is scanning the entire filetree that's sus
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you know you can install windows defender on mac and linux?
14:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I still enjoy github copilot tho
14:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what about
14:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219636371438829598/image.png?ex=660c05e2&is=65f990e2&hm=93ab6083c9ad6bf279d240c69239a76db257f34249a1d0482ff29f4f4345b1ef&
14:19 < bridge> <learath2> Ew
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato when build simple heuristics based light weight libre self hosted alternative to copilot?
14:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this stupid thing auto installs on targeted machine that has Microsoft Edge installed (which is basically all windows)
14:20 < bridge> <learath2> I genuinely believe it'll make every programmer worse overtime, until no one remembers how to code anything without it
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I feel like I already don't anyway?
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Heuristics isn't a word that applies to this problem. The more classical solution to copilot has been snippets and code generators
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Lies, you are great
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I mean I probably would need to look up something that I would need copilot for anyway
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> otherwise it is just a sentence finishing machine
14:23 < bridge> <learath2> Look it up, write it yourself
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> stackoverflow disagrees
14:24 < bridge> <learath2> The more you write it by hand the better you get
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably
14:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> i use copilot literally just for autocompleting boilerplate
14:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> but its not worth its 10$ a month lmao
14:24 < bridge> <learath2> What do they say? They are all careerists. I'd guess they say use copilot make money make greybeards mad
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they didn't say anything. they are just copying codes.
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 check this copilot usage out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7v6SNIgJpE&t=1456s
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you use it for the stuff that you would google/copy anyways it does not make you a worse dev just faster
14:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well google takes practices to
14:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too*
14:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I still get mad at our intern for not being able to search things
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> Effective research is an extremely important skill
14:28 < bridge> <learath2> And I genuinely don't think LLMs are a good tool for this except for the moooost basic things
14:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and we are using them for the moooost basic things i'm pretty sure
14:28 < bridge> <learath2> It tried to gaslight me into thinking MOSFETs have an extra leakage current that doesn't exist
14:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that seems like a you problem
14:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oof, that seems rude, I retract that. sorry.
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:30 < bridge> <learath2> It's also wrong, no? You don't know what you don't know
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye. but I don't think it is gaslighting you because you already know it's gonna be wrong?
14:31 < bridge> <learath2> If your tool for research is chatgpt and it lies to you, there is no recourse unless you have proper research skills
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good thing that when i look up something in the internet i can not be gaslighted because everything is accurate in the internet
14:31 < bridge> <learath2> I was lucky enough to know that it's explanation for this extra leakage current sounded extremely off
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't think I've ever fully trusted a auto completion until I read everything.
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao i never got trolled by autocompletion so far
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you have?
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait i have
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> I'm extremely critical of everything an AI produces. So I'm fairly safe in that regard. But as soon as you start trusting it implicitly there is no way to recover
14:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still. seems like a personal problem
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gotten ``.insertAdjacentElement()`` completed when i wanted ``.insertAdjacentHTML()`` and went with it because tldr
14:33 < bridge> <learath2> It's a problem that will become more and more common as more and more people rely on chatgpt and copilot for things
14:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> dumb people make dumb choice. and I choose to let them be dumb lmao
14:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> i have been trolled by auto completion many times
14:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> but its still more consistent than some LSP's
14:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> (imo) (imo) (imo) (imo) (imo)
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i have the same mindset but i am trying not to be conservative here. So my biggest concern is it being corporate controlled right now. I do not want to depend on a membership to write code.
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I was thinking about buying a graphics card just for personal LLMs
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> My long term tinfoil theory about this is that they will raise a generation of people incapable of doing anything without these LLMs, then they will start charging for their use heavily
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but my wallet strongly disagrees
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tinfoil tuesday huh?
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Create a disease, sell a cure. It's a story as old as commerce itself
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is it tuesday
14:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - i agree with Lea to the point where its bad espacially for new people
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh it is
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Create problem, sell solution
14:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - i agree with Lea to the point where its bad espacially for new people getting into coding, it does everything for you (to an extend)
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie i totally didnt have to open calendar for that
14:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> me neither
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lea
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - i agree with Lea to the point where its bad espacially for new people getting into coding, it does everything for you (to an extend), it auto formats, it gives you horrible but working code - its everything people starting to code need
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imagine calling lerato lea
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh wait i fucked up ping
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah gg
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> :D - i agree with @learath2  to the point where its bad espacially for new people getting into coding, it does everything for you (to an extend), it auto formats, it gives you horrible but working code - its everything people starting to code need
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> there we go
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> irc never forgets
14:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what did he do
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> neither does my custom chat log script for discord
14:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> hehehe
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 what do you mean by long term? isnt that already happening?
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û ban
14:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
14:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> discord is listening
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if discords listens that you listen on discord it gets mad
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> This is just the start. The current generation only use it as a crutch still. It'll get worse. The upcoming generation will not know anything about programming, they will just be prompting an LLM. Nvidia is especially invested into making that a reality
14:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think university would stop existing
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are saying the devs of tomorrow will be prompting like the product managers of today?
14:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> they will just learn how to use LLM's effectivly :D
14:40 < bridge> <learath2> University is already awful at teaching programming, it'll just shift into even more theory to keep existing
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dear chatgpt please build be a web scale database and a microservices front end and make the code as good as if it was written by someone with 10 years of jquery expirience
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly. They will be product managers with a bit more knowledge of theoretical computer science so they can tweak prompts
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 but isnt that a core skill of the human race? Abstraction and trust? We can build something more complex if we blindly trust and use existing solutions
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> our PM is actually pretty cool to explain things to
14:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> nah you'd just say "hey chatgpt use "refrence 1-20 from my senior dev" to write a functional program that does X and Y"
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh wait we don't have a PM
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nvm then
14:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> with gemini allowing (10?) million tokens, i can see it spitting out fully working programs at one point
14:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ok I have no idea how to fix this fucking shadowmask
14:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219642325056225320/image.png?ex=660c0b6e&is=65f9966e&hm=50264dc6c1f5d4a120d618f444a10dafb1ad9da2a8f28e4df590730d66bd1f40&
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Now is that bad? Idk, at the very least current LLMs produce inelegant and often wrong code leading to many bugs. IMHO it is bad but who cares what I think as long as shareholder profits go up and users get the same product at a similar price
14:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219642484020477982/image.png?ex=660c0b94&is=65f99694&hm=bafb323d726d24a48d565c36be84c6eb7539756c3a0dc2d7479692575fb3e73e&
14:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I hate unity
14:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although we are not using unity to bake lightings. but still
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I think as long as LLMs are bad there wont be the roles you are describing of 100% prompt engineering devs.
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> As soon as LLMs are good we don't need devs anymore indeed and those roles do make sense then.
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> 1.: Adjust Shadow Mask Settings: If the shadow mask is not correctly applying to the shadow, you might need to adjust its settings. This could involve changing the mask's opacity, feathering, or the mask's shape to better fit the shadow's area.
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> 2.: Use a Different Masking Technique: If the shadow mask is not working as expected, consider using a different masking technique. For example, if you're using a layer mask, try using a clipping mask instead, or vice versa.
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> 3.: Reapply the Shadow Effect: Sometimes, simply reapplying the shadow effect to the object can resolve issues with the shadow mask. Make sure to apply the shadow effect after the shadow mask has been correctly set up.
14:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
14:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> trust chatgpt!
14:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh
14:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> :DDD
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> tldr?
14:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> For real tho. I tried everything I know
14:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it only happens on this model too
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki windows defender flags ddnet auto update. llms are the solution to windows defender.
14:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm starting to think the artist fucked it up somehow
14:45 < bridge> <learath2> It depends on how you define bad. I think it's bad because it generates buggy inelegant code. Do you think the shareholders think inelegant code is bad? Do you think they care buggy code that needs a restart every other day is an issue?
14:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I waited an hour to bake this fucking mess
14:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh
14:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm going home
14:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what is this my dude
14:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1219643244996984912/image.png?ex=660c0c49&is=65f99749&hm=ca2be098bd32fcb83c29ca14433953a45db2990ac1573a654ca132bb0dd561e4&
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> I'm unsure what the issue is, where am I supposed to be looking?
14:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> shadow
14:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the baked shadow is missing chunks on some quads
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> Is it supposed to be sharper or something?
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont be rude lerato
14:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is also misaligned
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> I genuinely did not really understand what was wrong üòõ
14:48 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe not enough rays being cast?
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> shadowmask only does one ray for occlusion
14:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I thought it was a resolution issue but turning that up didn't help
14:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I don't think I'm actually asking for any help. I'm just frastrated to waste literal hours to this
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> I had a thought but it escaped. Sorry, too sleep deprived
14:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> is performance key? you could just pump up the entire shadowmask
14:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> and see if that helps
14:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is but I might try
14:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it works I can downsample it anyway
14:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it is 10pm
14:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm probably not gonna wait another hour to bake this
14:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still, only this model have the problem
14:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> every else seems to be fine
14:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually I could try soft shadows. so it actually uses more samples
14:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'll let it bake and go home. i'm not the one paying electricity bill anyway.
14:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
15:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wish they had more budget for more GPUs tho
15:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we are literally developing VR titles on GTX 1650s
15:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> rip :D
15:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did Learath went to sleep
15:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> fell asleep on the chair
15:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i feel like ive never chatted with him when he was completely sober
15:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe its a timezone thing
15:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> aahhh, i hate when i dont have time to do anything at home
15:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> got home

17:22 < bridge> <justniceasalways> Discord game activity.
17:22 < bridge> <justniceasalways> When you leave a server it still shows the map you were playing in the discord game activity. I suggest two ways:
17:22 < bridge> <justniceasalways> 1)  Stop showing game activity
17:22 < bridge> <justniceasalways> 2) Add game activity for just playing ddnet(when you run the game it also doesnt show anything in discord).

17:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Good luck finding anything nim-lang related in the future now that Nvidia calls their new software Nim too: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/generative-ai-microservices-for-developers üòÑ
17:52 < bridge> <louis> context?
17:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> NIM Inference Microservices Speed Deployments From Weeks to Minutes
17:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> Thats basically the context for deens Message
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> ```c++
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> //Thread 1
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> x.store(1, seq_cst);
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> y.store(1, release);
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> //Thread 2
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> r1 = y.fetch_add(1, seq_cst);
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> r2 = y.load(relaxed);
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> //Thread 3
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> y.store(3, seq_cst);
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> r3 = x.load(seq_cst);
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> Have any of you seen this absurd interaction before? This is allowed to produce `r1 == 1 && r2 == 3 && r3 == 0`
17:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> These Services will be available through kubernetes
17:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> Cool
17:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> What Kind of memory mess is this :justatest:  - and this is actually valid ?
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> Completely legal
17:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> What da hell
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> Even the absurd result that I highlighted is allowed to be produced
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> Mixing memory orders creates some very weird results
17:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> The post tells the story, except I'm the victim, not the attacker
17:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/
17:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
18:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> For anyone who wants to Tinker with it
18:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> I wonder how there are any hosts left who are configured badly enough to allow packet spoofing
18:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> Intentionally, they sell it as a feature
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> You mean origin spoofing? You'd be surprised
18:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> I meant origin, yes
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> This will never be fixed until there is some repercussions for it
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> s\/is/are/
18:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page should be enforced
18:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> Apparently we accidentally used hosters which allow IP spoofing before, ouch üòÑ https://archive.ph/jjqgT
18:24 < bridge> <reitw> That issue has been there for decades and sadly some providers doesn't care
18:26 < bridge> <reitw> + I don't think bcp38 would solve that
18:26 < bridge> <reitw> As bcp38 is mostly applied at the very edge of the provider's network
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> It'd be a huge step since it'd only be possible to spoof within an AS
18:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice post
18:29 < bridge> <reitw> Yeah for in-general spoofing
18:29 < bridge> <reitw> But for what deen is describing it's harder
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> Well it makes the attack more annoying to set up. Now you need to find an abuse mail happy target within the AS of your dubious server or find a dubious server in an AS with the target
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> But ofc it's not enough to completely solve it
18:33 < bridge> <learath2> For that you need to have filtering at every ingress point to the network by every ISP
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> That's a lot of investment you can't really convince a private entity to make without some threat
18:37 < bridge> <learath2> For every megabit of spoofed traffic you let into your network, the state nationalizes 0.1% of your company through eminent domain ü§î
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> Can be converted to a cash penalty at 10 times the market value of the company
18:49 < bridge> <_noby> hopefully people won't read this as a tutorial
18:52 < bridge> <0xdeen> They are already doing that, I'm just making it public so actors like hosters and the university can be aware of it. I don't like explaining the same thing to them every time, so can just link the blog post instead in the future
18:52 < bridge> <_noby> fair enough. maybe this is making it too easy for people though?
18:53 < bridge> <0xdeen> Well, that was one of the first results when I googled for "dedicated server with ip spoofing"
18:54 < bridge> <_noby> dang
19:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> @_noby when show me how to get Non-DDR moderator?
19:02 < bridge> <_noby> 1. be moderator 2. dont play (or moderate) DDR
19:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> i do both!
19:02 < bridge> <_noby> wait for role to appear
19:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> the last time i begged for dev role i got it within like 2 seconds
19:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> hmmm
19:02 < bridge> <swarfey> :pepeW:
19:02 < bridge> <swarfey> thats what happened to my server

19:05 < bridge> <0xdeen> It happened to everyone hosting servers in Teeworlds
19:05 < bridge> <0xdeen> Some hosters just ignored the abuse emails
19:06 < bridge> <swarfey> Yeah, seems to have been happening since roughly a week
19:06 < bridge> <swarfey> I was in contact with my hoster & had it blocked and unblocked 3x during that time
19:06 < bridge> <swarfey> I was in contact with my hoster & had it blocked and unblocked 2x during that time
19:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> @_noby hehehe i got the role lmao
19:09 < bridge> <_noby> :feelsamazingman:
