01:52 < bridge> <teero777> Chillderdragon: hahaha I love it when you just stream to yourself for 2 hours xdddd
02:00 < bridge> <sedonya> gm
02:00 < bridge> <teero777> gn
02:00 < bridge> <teero777> 2am

02:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> jopsti said it was funny that I was muted half the stream last time. So this time I decided to be even funnier by having the stream hidden from the public eye until 1 minute before the end xd
02:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
02:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Was totally on purpose because I‚Äôm comidical genius^^
02:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I always thought this is just client prediction and will only be a fast movement and not some other stats change such as a hook spawning mid air.
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> did u do a stream?
04:07 < bridge> <totar> whats the escape character for str_format? I can't seem to get it to put a "%" into the text
04:09 < bridge> <peter0x44> for printf it's usually %%
04:10 < bridge> <peter0x44> did you try that?
04:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> looks like str_format is calling this:
04:12 < bridge> <peter0x44>     int length = str_format_v(buffer, buffer_size, format, args);
04:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> which is calling vsnprintf
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan yep i did a 2 day challenge of trying to finish run_orange on official ddnet servers using lua
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> took me 12 hours :D 
07:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ur gonna get in trouble man...
07:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot why
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs u did a 2 day challenge of trying to finish run_orange on official ddnet servers using lua
07:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nothing troublesome about it? xd
07:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or what do you mean
07:25 < bridge> <Ewan> lua on official ddnet servers
07:25 < bridge> <Ewan> is not problematic?
07:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no its not ddnet is not discord xd
07:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> custom clients are not tos
07:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only automated inputs and unfair advantages
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> what else is the Lua doing
07:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wdym what else
07:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The lua is doing the connecting to the server and handling user input. Same as the C++ in the ddnet client? Xd
07:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just more bugged and less features
07:42 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF
07:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wot
07:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @mpft: what did you think the lua was doing
07:44 < bridge> <Ewan> automating inputs
07:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean like ath style
07:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ig
07:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes that would be sus

07:49 < bridge> <Ewan> u could have at least turned up `cl_refresh_rate_inactive`. ._.
07:49 < bridge> <Ewan> u could have at least turned up `cl_refresh_rate_inactive` ._.
07:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I turned it down on purpose :D it‚Äôs ma laptop I don‚Äôt want it to ever fan spin or hit 90% cpu usage

15:12 < bridge> <learath2> Peer pressured into getting one
15:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> in big cities you rarely need your car
15:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So happy I have a car, my life would be fucked otherwise
15:29 < bridge> <zhn> so happy i have my driving license, i don't need to bring my passport just to buy some beer

18:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> a few middle school kids
18:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyone on discord?
18:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
18:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they only get on discord when they need to ask for favors
18:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol, okay i see
18:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks for your honesty
18:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :owo:
18:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
18:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hahaha
18:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean if im in middle school i would do the same
18:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> probably
19:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just don't like them as an adult
19:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
19:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :gigachad:
19:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you want to reach them
19:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I thought about doing so, since they've not yet once updated F-DDrac and their server has 0 players :D
19:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But it's nothing of importance, just wanted to have a little chat if it was easy, so don't worry :)
19:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, they probably doesn't really care either
19:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Probably xd
19:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hi
19:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Bet they don't even know what features there is, just seeing other people's success makes them copy the work :D
19:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> kids wants attention and be "famous" and you probably shouldn't try to make them feel important.
19:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye, probably ur right
19:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there was one guy asked if he can post something of chiller, chiller said yes and the guy made announcements everywhere lol
19:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao

22:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe it would requires more than the basic controller support we have right now, like detecting the gamepad layout and automatically configuring the controls

22:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> How does DDNet add the empty voting placeholder lines?
22:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I understand how it works, but the code should disallow adding a vote with an empty (or spaces) description:

22:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It even adds 2 spaces here, because there is one added with 1 space already, so the description is taken already
22:53 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not a normal space üòâ
22:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No? Thought so
22:53 < bridge> <robyt3> https://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/utf-8.cgi?input=%E2%80%8A&mode=char
22:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> was the only logical solution, but googling didnt work
22:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nice#!
22:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> notnice, it is well known that the less braces you use the more cool you are
23:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust must be pretty uncool
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> if it was so uncool why did i spend all of yesterday porting one of my stupid little tools to it üò≥
23:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what did you write? üôÇ
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> that ddnet skin fixer tool
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> haven't tested it too much at all
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> github.com/ewancg/fix-skin
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> main branch
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> old impl is on the cpp branch
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/ewancg/fix-skin
23:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> can str_format and str_copy handle these `‚òê` ? it's the one from votes, to select the category
23:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> for me it's displaying a qeustionmark rn trying to use it from code
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> next I may do the web server behind the unique proxy. the one with the terrible skins
23:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool üôÇ
23:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. `str_copy`/`str_format` do not mess with your strings
23:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check whether you're saving the relevant files as UTF-8 (if these strings come from config files)
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/nicholassm/disruptor-rs @heinrich5991 @learath2
23:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `tokio` seems to be an essentially unused dependency
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> faster than crossbeam
23:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems to have a different API from crossbeam

23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Everything in the library is about low-latency and this heavily influences all choices made in this library. As an example, you cannot allocate an event and move that into the ringbuffer. Instead, events are allocated on startup to ensure they are co-located in memory to increase cache coherency. However, you can still allocate a struct on the heap and move ownership to a field in the event on the Ringbuffer. As long as you realize that this can

23:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's in the code file
23:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that code file saved as UTF-8?
23:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> probably not, i'll check quickly
23:34 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki how long does it take to compile firefox for you?
23:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> 8 mins
23:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> why?
23:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> on release obviously
23:34 < bridge> <learath2> Lto?
23:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think i have turbo build on
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes with lto
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have lto on by default with some flags to detect packages
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe not
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> if firefox had problems or not
23:36 < bridge> <learath2> It takes exactly 18 minutes for me so my guess was like bang on üòÑ
23:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i think it's saved correctly, yes
23:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> utf8
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> my old 5800x took 15 min
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw do u use a tmpfs?
23:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> it probs helps with firefox since big
23:37 < bridge> <learath2> Now this is verycool
23:37 < bridge> <learath2> I do use a tmpfs. I use a tmpfs for a lot of things on this laptop because I have 64 gigs of ram
23:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye same
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> how fast is ur ram
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine is 6000mt/s
23:38 < bridge> <learath2> 5600mt ddr5. The max this laptop supports since no xmp
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u use AMD right?
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> why no xmp
23:38 < bridge> <learath2> Yep
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a amd specific ram
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has a feature
23:39 < bridge> <learath2> It's a laptop mobo. Who knows why not perhaps their memory controller isn't good enough?
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> AMD EXPO
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah mobo limit ok
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/technologies/expo.html
23:39 < bridge> <learath2> Though actually nowadays idk if the memory controller is still on the mobo
