12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did consider making this a thing again, but I couldn't find a good way to implement this as an option without breaking vanilla
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> necropotame could do it i guess
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but he gone D:
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, he is way more familiar with the relevant part of the code, maybe he could come up with a trick
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well he managed to do the infclass class chooser
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats quite a big thing
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He definitely knows everything about quads and envelopes
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the source code for that is public

13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neb> NSA has discovered a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-0601) affecting Microsoft WindowsÂ®1 cryptographic functionality.
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neb> The certificate validation vulnerability allows an attacker to undermine how Windows verifies cryptographic trust and can
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neb> enable remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 as well as
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neb> applications that rely on Windows for trust functionality. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to defeat trusted
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neb> network connections and deliver executable code while appearing as legitimately trusted entities.

13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who knows how many years they abused it for before letting microsoft know ðŸ˜›
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This is just them tryna look like the good guys
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ama being tied to race time is ugly at start
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think there's a solution to this (on a logic level, not a coding level)
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i just want an option to be enabled to use that
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's the problem
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> sv_settings_racetime 1 XD
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does your (hypothetical?) map look nice when passing the starting line?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or does the animation "jump"?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> there is no animation so why should it jump XD
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> the animation is there after 255 minutes
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> so there is no flickering
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to whoever implements this, don't make this a server side setting but a per-envelope setting, please
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> why after i cut demos and save the file i open the file in ddnet i get the  error that the demo is invalid
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/667129567307366470/screenshot_2020-01-15_23-14-35.png
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Deathman you got the newest client?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ofc
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I remember there were a few demo bugs lately and some of them are already solved and this was one of them.
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> xd
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well you did good by reminding devs
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> no problem
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure how to help you cut your demo's know thi
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> well i guess i cant
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Btw you know this other way to record demo's? I forgot how it is called in f1 but for small gameplay it is much easier
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> i use autodemorecord
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Like if something funny happend you can say like okay save the last 60 secondes
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> lol
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> how?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> And then it only saves this instead of the whole demo etc
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Wait i need to check it
