00:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this sounds bad üò¶
01:14 < bridge> <catseyenebulous> That is so sad to read and at the same time unfortunately relatable..
01:33 < bridge> <learath2> but but but capitalism is the best way to allocate the resources of humankind
06:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Any successful ones?
07:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1. Very boring over long blog
07:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. Use rust over Python :brownbear:
08:58 < bridge> <deen> That‚Äòs just a bad company. Not sure how they are still alive, no competition?
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or the whole blog is just a straight lie üòõ

10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh weren't the maps fixed @robyt3
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or not all?
10:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe wasn't deployed to all servers somehow
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I c
10:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> might be a driver issue
10:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> just so you know
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I checked on a DDNet server though, what's the map hash?
10:41 < bridge> <ar1gin> Map is `Purple Panic 3`
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Ah, so also there
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> The bug was fixed on pp2
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah
10:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Now its pp3 time
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Guess we should check all^^
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
10:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, should probably run a script on all maps in the archive
10:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38081633
10:48 < bridge> <ar1gin> what is the issue though? and why did it appear out of nowhere?
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's simply missing textures
12:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @patiga https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/merge_requests/10
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to make a script-like language to make maps but i ended up updating twmap
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> *clippy updated xdd
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i updated the deps xd
13:32 < bridge> <teero777> this has been happening to me on multiple occasions when loading maps from downloaded maps and then saving to maps
13:49 < ChillerDragon> @blazulite got some docker for u UwU
13:49 < ChillerDragon> ``docker run -ti docker.io/chillerdragon/ddnetpp:v0.1.0``
13:50 < bridge> <chairn> just use -j then

14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
14:22 < bridge> <teero777> is there a way to turn of the halloween things? like angry eyes? i dont like angry eyes :feelsbadman:
14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> no :NekoEvil:
14:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> today all tees are angry
14:37 < bridge> <deen> You can select the non-angry eyes in shift
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> yea xd
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> yea im gonna compile ddnet to android today. im angry
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> but i still dont know how. ;(
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki give tutorial. how to compile ddnet client to android
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk jupstar is the guy for that
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> the readme has something
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> didnt find anything in the readme on ddnet git.
14:46 < bridge> <teero777> is it anywhere else?
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/scripts/android
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> readmethere
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> thx
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @teero777 u need to change the git pull in the script tho. It's simply set to master
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And eg sdl master is called sdl3
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I haven't really used it in a long time
15:19 < bridge> <blazulite> you're god
15:19 < bridge> <blazulite> tysm
15:20 < bridge> <blazulite> gonna try it in ~8 hs
15:20 < bridge> <blazulite> also, I had to reinstall Docker
15:20 < bridge> <blazulite> my installation was corrupted, that was the main error
15:20 < bridge> <blazulite> the CLI was installed partially for some reason??
15:21 < bridge> <blazulite> and about the errors with Amazon AWS... the Amazon Linux 2 profile is corrupted too, the permissions are bugged so I can't run / pull a docker
15:21 < bridge> <blazulite> that's a thing I certainly don't know how to fix
15:21 < bridge> <blazulite> but eh, I'll improvise
15:22 < bridge> <blazulite> anyways, thanks chillerdragon üôè ur a rly cool dude
17:26 < bridge> <furo321> I run a script on all DDNet maps, and got a total of 62 maps that have broken image file names. Maps: <https://p.fr33tux.org/923395@raw>. Should we really proceed with this? It's going to break tons of maps.
17:26 < bridge> <robyt3> :justatest:
17:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks for checking. I think it's still better to fix the maps themselves instead of trying to read strings best effort
17:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks for checking. I think it's still better to fix the maps themselves instead of trying to read strings best effort (i.e. fix broken UTF-8 etc.)
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sooner or later it should probably fail to load these maps anyway.
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess we should at least also check kog and the block maps or smth
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before we apply it to the client
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean the clietn doesn't need this info, but the editor must recover from this somehow
17:31 < bridge> <robyt3> It would reduce the influence a lot if the client could load embedded images even if the image name failed to load
17:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Since the image name is only used for logging in this case
22:28 < bridge> <patiga> `grass_main_jÔøΩgermeister` great image name
