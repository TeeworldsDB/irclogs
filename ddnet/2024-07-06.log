01:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> huh not sure what i would ever need it for but its a cool flex when someone is watching you xd @learath2 but something i noticed while trying that is that i get some weird selections of text by spamming ctrl+x xd
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> Make a symbols-only font and set that as the highest priority?
01:40 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted to delete all files in a folder but one
02:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 when i start a ddnet client i get the following log in the local console `2024-07-06 08:06:10 D stun/4: got address: ` followed by my public ipv4
02:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we remove that?
06:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Anyone having hard feelings about removing some 16 year old hotkey from the editor? <:justatest:572499997178986510>
06:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8358#issuecomment-2211618914
07:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah true thats a good use case @learath2 
07:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i usually do something like `ls > rm.sh;vi rm.sh;bash rm.sh`
07:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but next time i have a small amount of files i will probably do the cool trick too! i assume its a safe habit to develop anyways to expand the glob before running a command. I can see how this can safe your ass.
07:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh lol i forgot sometimes i do `echo ./*` to manually expand the glob. That stops now! xd
07:06 < bridge> <Ewan> More accurate
07:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Hello chillerdragon

10:21 < bridge> <robyt3> You could use Ctrl+Shift+P for the Prompt, that's also the hotkey for it in Sublime Text
10:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> ctrl+shift+p to open settings masterrace
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> is it new to u
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I know one of the ladybird devs irl

11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> I can barely use bath anymore
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> Bash
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
11:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you could set the log level to not log debug-level messages
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need the debug log level for debugging
11:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then what's the problem?
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont wanna dox my self
11:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you stream your development?
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:59 < bridge> <egyt> I made a PR to Arabic script so it is LTR and not RTL. Still not accepted :^(
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont want to turn debug of anyways since i dont want to turn it on every time i want to debug something i want to see all the debug infos all the time. But i dont want my client log to be something sensitive.
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think thats a sensible thing to ask for
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> off*
12:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cursor gore
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 so many key strokes the prompt is speed. I would argue a fast prompt is more important than a fast proof.
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it will be used way more
12:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's kinda expected that debug logs contain somewhat sensitive data
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bring one user who depends on ctrl+p and cant shift to `ctrl+p pro<enter>` and u convinced me
12:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could remove that log line from your fork when you're developing
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i do not expect to see my public ip in my client log. No not even when debug is on.
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 too much git maintenance and won't fix ddnet contributions
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like that communication style. instead of trying to reach people who may help you, you go complain *into a public channel* that something is wrong
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not following
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (answer to EGYT, unrelated to you)
12:06 < bridge> <zhn> chiller your own net protocol when
12:07 < bridge> <zhn> i swear you need to hold some tw server as chat room
12:07 < bridge> <zhn> and talk from there via your own protocol wrapper
12:07 < bridge> <egyt> That was a joke.
12:07 < bridge> <zhn> tw-discord proxy
12:07 < bridge> <zhn> tw-irc-discord proxy
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> woosh. that went over my head. sorry
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that wouldnt be a own protocol right? that would just be tw protocol xd
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and every tw server is already a chat room
12:08 < bridge> <zhn> nah these two are different statements xd
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah
12:08 < bridge> <egyt> I bet making Arabic LTR already sounds ridiculous enough to interpret it as a joke
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well im stalling to build my own multiplayer game since 16 years
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it would have a custom protocol
12:10 < bridge> <egyt> I bet making Arabic LTR already sounds ridiculous enough to interpret it as a joke, let alone making a PR to a LANGUAGE
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn so you want (my protocol) -> (tw server) -> (discord) ? xd
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea that sounds good
12:10 < bridge> <zhn> nah nah
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no?
12:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I interpreted it as making a PR to some project localization that made arabic text rendering LTR ^^
12:10 < bridge> <egyt> Still sounds ridiculous imo
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:11 < bridge> <egyt> Still sounds hilarious imo
12:11 < bridge> <zhn> i mean you should have some web service (so cross platform out of the box with ease to use) that can connect to passworded chat room tw server (with sv_register 0)
12:11 < bridge> <zhn> that proxied to irc
12:11 < bridge> <zhn> and irc is proxied to discord
12:11 < bridge> <zhn> so basically its the same thing you have now but with teeworlds as one step
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i love it
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im on it
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn u got a 0.7 client? xd
12:41 < ws-client> ChillerDragon: UwU from 0.7
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `teeworlds "connect 88.198.96.203:42069"`
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and the web service is here https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez done
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> ye wait lemme test :troll:
12:51 < ws-client> Zohan606: wow looks funny
12:51 < ws-client> Zohan606: can't see the messages though
12:51 < ws-client> Zohan606: one-directed chat
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye read only xd
12:52 < bridge> <zhn> write-only*
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eee
12:52 < bridge> <zhn> xd
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt implement much yet 
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a basic server in ruby xd
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme try to hack something where you at least can see your own msgs xd
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagwd is there any ddnet server that doesnt ban vpns? -.-
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn you ready for something a bit more cursed?
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no dont be afk one final trol server
13:17 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't see a difference between the speed for Ctrl+P and Ctrl+Shift+P. If you change the existing hotkey you'll anger mappers being used to it.
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea but are there mappers used to it?
13:44 < bridge> <robyt3> You'll find out if you anger them :justatest:
13:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> teeworlds bridge when?
13:44 < bridge> <zhn> ye sorry was playing with my brothers child

13:53 < ws-client> 1: i mean there is no one here
13:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be econ
13:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> I also did that using econ
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chiller unique admin confirmed
13:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> for my moderation tools discord bot
13:54 < bridge> <teero777> ah yea econ exists almost forgot
13:54 < bridge> <zhn> he just proxies all the things lol
13:54 < ws-client> 1: <ChillerDragon> i like feet
13:54 < bridge> <zhn> i don't think its an actual econ
13:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> then why is our message not going through :/
13:55 < bridge> <zhn> because chiller didn't implement it xd
13:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> lazy bun!
13:55 < ws-client> 0: yo teero
13:55 < ws-client> 0: why do you say capitalism
13:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
13:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> indeed
13:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> a proxy
13:56 < ws-client> 0: uh oh
13:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> "why do you say capitalism"
13:56 < ws-client> 1: lol it catches whisper messages
13:56 < bridge> <teero777> that was a whisper lmaooo
13:56 < bridge> <zhn> !
13:57 < bridge> <teero777> okay but no / commands atleast
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 too lazy to release xd
13:57 < ws-client> 0: real whisper: ||twinbopp x louis||
13:57 < bridge> <teero777> xDD
13:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> lol
13:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> try @ everyone ._.
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye so the first thing was a server implemented in ruby it had support for names 
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the second thing which is running now is a go proxy
13:58 < bridge> <zhn> irc proxy will not let you do it
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are connected to unique server through my vps and it intercepts chat messages
13:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> I mean from ingame
13:58 < bridge> <teero777> u turned it off...
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> everything is super bugged xd
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> bree
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok enuff trolling and spamming #developer ill shut it down
14:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> or is that coming from tw server -> irc proxy - > discord ?
14:00 < bridge> <egyt> twinbop x noius 👀
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 its (your client) -> (proxy go client) -> (unique race server) -> (chat.zillyhuhn.com webhook) -> (irc) -> (discord)
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bassic messaging app
14:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> the f
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the arrows look wrong xd unqiue race server does not send to webhook
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a branch
14:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's parallel, ik
14:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> proxy -> chat -> irc -> dc
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im websocket -> irc -> dc
14:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> pretty cool, that already does stuff 😮
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1720267450.png
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> epic webhook ui
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> wyd
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I really want to have the prompt on ctrl+p @robyt3 -.- i will use it for EVERYTHING
14:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> cooking
14:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> buying groceries
14:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> flushing the toilet
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes and the additional shift key makes that interaction way more complex
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its still better than mouse but its 33% more key presses
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or 50%?
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 150%?
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 1
14:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you go from 100% to 150%
14:14 < bridge> <Ewan> 50% more, 150% as much
14:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's 50% more
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its 3 instead of 2 keys
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i can press ctrl+p while keeping both hands fully in the center of my keyboard
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ctrl+shift is unergonmic for something that initiates EVERY transaction
14:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta think about the hand health of your players
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you know why the prompt in sublime is ctrl+shift+p? @robyt3 because the important shortcut is already ctrl+p
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the file finder
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least in vscode i thought in sublime it was the same not sure
14:17 < bridge> <sans._.> Hello, I wanna know if it's fine if I use data from ddnet to build some sort of web ui for server select, basically I wanna try my hand at an interactive web app as a side project and idk if it's allowed to use these stuff
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean the assets?
14:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> vs code stole from siblime text
14:17 < bridge> <sans._.> that too, but I meant live data from the master server mostly
14:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> sublime
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are allowed to access master server data @sans._. 
14:18 < bridge> <sans._.> nice <a:RikoYattaYatta:570162128590471168>
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are a bunch of projects out there working with it already you might find a helpful base for your work if you look first
14:19 < bridge> <sans._.> I already have my own package, although very crude still, but I feel like I can improve it if I use it in a real project
14:25 < bridge> <sans._.> I do have a question about the client tho, how does it get the ping for server? Does it literally just ping every single one? And also why do some of them show "EUR" for example instead of a number
14:25 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1259123172893261884/image.png?ex=668a8955&is=668937d5&hm=e0c7b7c7841634eb935ea4f941e77c5680683dc596fa90004ca366f6e7f9d02b&

14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it used to ping them directly back in the days the master would only hand out a list of ips and the client would get the details from the servers
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now since the ddnet http master your client only talks to the master and does no longer ping all servers. Thats also some ip leak protection.
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Since with the old master a user could spin up a public teeworlds server and collect the ips of all users browsing servers
14:27 < bridge> <zhn> ye you could just ip grab all the tw players by registering your server in masterlist back in the days
14:27 < bridge> <sans._.> I dont recall seeing anything about ping values when I looked at a master server request
14:28 < bridge> <sans._.> that sounds bad xd
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> because master will not give you any
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so if you connect to a server it will know its ping
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> you can ping server only directly
14:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> ^ - the server will expose it when you connect to it
14:28 < bridge> <sans._.> So the client connects to every single server?
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> eur/asia/na/sa and so on are identificators based on geoip db or something
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why you see the EUR
14:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think it remembers pings from servers you connected to or something idk actually
14:29 < bridge> <zhn> ye it does
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> There's no way I connected to more than 50 servers in my entire ddnet career XD
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> especially asian based ones
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> or US
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
14:29 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1259124178104094780/image.png?ex=668a8a45&is=668938c5&hm=5dbb23e848ad305bdc49274212a1d7bec60646ba82d346974647681fd38fcad9&
14:30 < bridge> <zhn> how long do you play ddnet
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> how old is ur client
14:30 < bridge> <Ewan> there's an option in the browser called leak ip
14:30 < bridge> <zhn> nah its off by default
14:31 < bridge> <zhn> ig he just had old client that cached all the pings it had (did it cache in the past?)
14:31 < bridge> <sans._.> good question, probably less than a year since I installed ddnet on _this_ pc
14:32 < bridge> <zhn> ye also if you join 1 game server and other game servers have the same ip (so they are located on the same machine) you'll see others game servers pings too
14:32 < bridge> <sans._.> that makes a lot of sense
14:32 < bridge> <sans._.> but still, i dont get how my client knows pings for US servers
14:33 < bridge> <sans._.> How would I go about pinging a server though
14:33 < bridge> <sans._.> just send an http request and time it?
14:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Joining it
14:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Sure
14:34 < bridge> <Ewan> head request
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1720269238.png
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah 97
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> ye but it will be ping from your server to game server
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> not client's latency
14:34 < bridge> <Ewan> can do it on client xd
14:34 < bridge> <sans._.> In the browser it's gonna be client-side, meaning the pings will come from the user that uses said web app
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> ah
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> i thought you are about to make web servic
14:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Web app :justatest:
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> i thought you are about to make web service
14:35 < bridge> <sans._.> nah, just some random project cuz im bored
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it stores the timestamp in the cache you can check when it stored those ips
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> all random project that tw had are being hosted xddd
14:35 < bridge> <sans._.> the goal is to recreate the ddnet client server browser... but on a web browser xd
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> projects*
14:36 < bridge> <sans._.> such as?
14:36 < bridge> <sans._.> :Thonk:
14:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ddstats
14:36 < bridge> <sans._.> neat
14:36 < bridge> <Ewan> good for ppl's bookmarks ig
14:37 < bridge> <Ewan> I hate using the web :feelsbadman:
14:37 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/k2d222/twwe
14:37 < bridge> <zhn> also jupstar's map preview
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://ddstats.org/
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki the url linked here is down btw https://github.com/edg-l/teeobserver
14:38 < bridge> <sans._.> this makes me wanna build something useful for ddnet and talk my way into having it hosted for free 😩
14:38 < bridge> <Ewan> by whom
14:38 < bridge> <sans._.> good question
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> by ewan
14:39 < bridge> <sans._.> no idea xd
14:39 < bridge> <rodrig9> Hey
14:39 < bridge> <sans._.> surely there's some free host i can use
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you develop an account system that works the way heinrich wants it and is functional i'll carry all costs
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> :gigachad:
14:39 < bridge> <sans._.> bet
14:39 < bridge> <rodrig9> What is the best DDNet client
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you sabotage ddnet accounts ill carry all costs
14:39 < bridge> <Ewan> DDNet
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> DDNet client ofc!
14:39 < bridge> <sans._.> did he describe it anywhere
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> free pink rat
14:39 < bridge> <sans._.> heh, I will now steal your ddnet name :Evil:
14:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> #3411
14:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> someone do it the opposite way of what Heinrich wants and I'll carry all costs
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pin rat is first comment in #3411 xd
14:40 < bridge> <Ewan> just kidding..
14:40 < bridge> <zhn> Konsti: Colo-Colo
14:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> pink rat best rat
14:43 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm pretty sure the way ddnet works there's no way a login system will ever be added while also pleasing everyone
14:49 < bridge> <furo> Servers aren't HTTP, so no. You would need to send a Teeworlds server browser info request, which you won't be able to make a HTTP client send as it is UDP.
15:26 < bridge> <louis> wait whats bad abt it
15:27 < bridge> <Ewan> im just trolling
15:27 < bridge> <louis> hmm i know nothing abt cryptography what makes a decentralized system different
15:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont remember much aboug either of their prefs but  i think jopsti wanted something a bit more abstract
15:28 < bridge> <louis> it seems like any of the approaches can be abstracted for the average user anywayas
15:28 < bridge> <louis> it seems like any of the approaches can be abstracted for the average user anyways
15:29 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as u dont rely on the user to store api key
15:29 < bridge> <Ewan> itll be fine
18:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> any recommendation for a small dashboard service which can be hosted in a docker container pointing to some local ips.
18:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> ?
18:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> for like a home page in my internal network
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> the js option is using nestjs with some css like bulma
