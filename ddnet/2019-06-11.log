02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> we just can find analog of letters
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> in "𝐎𝐗𝐘𝐆𝐄𝐍" 𝐎 = O
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> 𝐗 = X
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> etc
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> and so we can create database of these analogs
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have a database of those already, see confusables.c / confusables_data.h
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Created from the official Unicode document: https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/12.0.0/confusables.txt
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Someone just needs to implement a str_utf8_find_confusable and then you can use that to search
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we had a utf8 function that reduces strings to basic characters
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen the comment was adressed 5 days ago https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1777
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo the additional crc check doesnt belong in this hotfix. It is heavily tested and fixes almost all bugs demos have currenlty. The longer we wait to fix this crucial bug the more demos we loose.
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> alright
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hey, anyone up for some DM? I started a project where I collect gameplay data, my goal is to use machine learning to teach an AI to play teeworlds deathmatch. My first approach will be a deep network. Broadly speaking I render a highly simplified scene of what the player sees at a resolution of 90x50 and record the player input at 25fps.

13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Join `timakro.de:8500`!
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I will release the source and collected data in the future.

13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice!
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i still cant join the srv :c
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wow, thats awesome
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro Nice. Is it learning from the players?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you make it learn from teehistorian files?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen The plan is for it to learn from players, I've did nothing on that end yet. I'm not anywhere close having enough data. I think ddrace would be too difficult to start with. Does teehistorian include the environment data (could an image like the above be reproduced with teehistorian files) or just player input?

14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I figured that you need more data. We have hundreds of GBs of data, but only DDrace
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just player input, but the map file is linked of course
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so with map file + teehistorian you could get something like above
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah, I don't think I could possibly do ddrace, it's incredibly complex
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just give it more neurons and rent some cloud gpus? 😄
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But yeah, solo maps would be easier to start with
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's a lot of work even thinking about input and output and preparing it for the network
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> are you using a modified tw client?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> All I've done yet is write some server code to save compressed gameplay sessions
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> In this format which is relatively straight forward to feed to a CNN
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "compressed gameplay session" is exactly what teehistorian is
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Why whould he put "Oxygen" to the second nickname?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @Arseniy Zarche 
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> >for example, player with unicoded-nickname OXYGEN (just example) will put to this line (second nickname) "Oxygen" and other players can find him with nickname Oxygen, but on the server he will be an OXYGEN (unicoded)
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @timakro maybe @noby  is interested in your project. He has the most visited fng server.

18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @deen what do you mean by that?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/588036578115321888/unknown.png
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that we should merge your change
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Learath2 is proposing to do it totally differently
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah, and there was a small discussion here that was about which way was better and the most agreed with my way
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but it can be interesting (in the future?) to do multiple demo markers, but that will require to change how they work since only 2 exists and are used to slice a demo ^^
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should merge as is for now
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wot
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/588094187275157504/unknown.png
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wow it took so many time to zoom me correctly and put the correct scores
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> probably because the ddos is affecting the servers ability to reply to ur inforequests and tell ur client its a ddrace server
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah probably
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> someone is attacking ddnet again 🙄
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/588094520370003970/Screen_Shot_2019-06-11_at_2.57.26_PM.png
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> whats the link to that already?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet.tw/status
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> thx
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jean-Claude Van BAN> I thought that there's no more stupid thing than making cheats for 2d platformer game with no more 600 players online. Nowadays the next level exists - ddosing such games' servers because you was insulted of being banned after using the cheats for such games
