00:18 < fstd> deen: happy you know what!
00:43 <@deen> oh right, you too, fstd 
00:44 < fstd> :)

12:32 < luca> HI, I got some err message while compiling Teeworlds, it sais bam has a syntax error:./bam.lua: Zeile 2: Syntaxfehler beim unerwarteten Wort `('
12:32 < luca> ./bam.lua: Zeile 2: `target_family = os.getenv("TARGET_FAMILY")'
12:32 < luca> I tried with the latest version, but how can I fix this?
12:33 < Ryozuki> what os?
12:33 < luca> Linux Mint 18
12:33 < luca> KDE 5
12:36 < Fin> someone can help me?
12:37 < Ryozuki> maybe
12:37 < Ryozuki> what's the problem?
12:37 < Ryozuki> ahh
12:37 < Ryozuki> u are luca
12:38 < Ryozuki> well i don't know, sry
12:40 < Fin> OH sorry, forgot to say, and I am on 64-b
12:58 < Ryozuki> Someone knows how to get the nearest [not solid] tile being inside a solid tile?
13:02 <@EastByte> just go around your current solid tile and use the first free tile you find
13:04 <@EastByte> I guess that would require some circular function
13:04 <@heinrich5991> nah
13:04 <@heinrich5991> oh well, Ryozuki hasn't offered all information :)
13:05 <@heinrich5991> somehow a projectile made it to that point
13:05 <@heinrich5991> so one of the adjacent squares must be non-solid
13:05 < Ryozuki> yeah, i'm making a teleportatio ngun
13:05 <@heinrich5991> just check each direction (up left down right) and check the next tile in that direction
13:05 < Ryozuki> but the projectile colision point puts the tee inside a solid tile
13:05 <@heinrich5991> then take the closest empty one, I'd say
13:05 < Ryozuki> what class i need to check tile type?
13:06 < Ryozuki> and how much measures a tile?
13:06 < Ryozuki> 16?
13:07 <@heinrich5991> one tile is 32
13:08 <@heinrich5991> the IsSolid function on CCollision sounds interesting
13:09 < Ryozuki> another thing
13:10 < Ryozuki> usually the proj would be near a side
13:10 < Ryozuki> so it should be easy i guess
13:10 < Ryozuki> imagine o|o
13:10 < Ryozuki> where o is empty space
13:18 < Ryozuki> i nearly got it
13:18 < Ryozuki> but when shooting down it's still bug
13:18 < Ryozuki> mmm
13:23 < Ryozuki> ah i see why
13:23 < Ryozuki> if u are on ground and shoot down, projectile doesnt spawns from inside the tee right?
13:23 < Ryozuki> it does from the gun
13:23 < Ryozuki> and gun is inside a wall :/
13:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #665: CMakeLists.txt: Create the generated source directory (master...pr_ddnet_cmakelists_mkdir_generated) https://git.io/vyor2
13:36 < Fin> :D
13:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: why don't you just push directly?
13:38 <@heinrich5991> dunno, I like code review as a principle
13:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/vyorM
13:39 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 253857e heinrich5991: CMakeLists.txt: Create the generated source directory...
13:39 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 1b6071c Learath2: Merge pull request #665 from heinrich5991/pr_ddnet_cmakelists_mkdir_generated...
13:39 < Learath2> maybe we should ff such small merges not to create merge commits
13:39 <@EastByte> deen, fstd_: happy something! :)
13:45 < Ryozuki> damn corners -.-
13:46 < Learath2> just put a // Cornercase and call it a day
13:47 <@heinrich5991> // this is a real corner case
13:47 <@heinrich5991> (grep for it!)
13:47 <@heinrich5991> src/game/collision.cpp:369:                // this is a real _corner case_!
14:34 < fstd_> EastByte: thanks!
16:22 <@deen> thanks EastByte
