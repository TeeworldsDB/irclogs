02:27 < bridge> <totar> What do foes actually do?
02:28 < bridge> <totar> I couldn't figure it out, I thought it was related to muting but that doesn't seem to be the case
02:55 < bridge> <bencie.> use add_foe "playername" "clan" to add a player name to mute permanently (unless removed with remove_foe)
02:55 < bridge> <bencie.> then foes will list all the players in that list
02:55 < bridge> <bencie.> then foes will list all the players that you muted
02:55 < bridge> <bencie.> then foes will list all the players that you muted with add_foe
02:55 < bridge> <totar> So it does mute them
02:56 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya
02:56 < bridge> <bencie.> yeah
02:56 < bridge> <syrinok> add_foe is a permanent mute for that specific name, or name / clan combo
02:56 < bridge> <bencie.> unlike the tick in the Players tab ingame, foes get saved so the name you added is permanently muted
02:56 < bridge> <totar> But muting in the player menu is completely separate
02:57 < bridge> <totar> Foes don't show anywhere except ``foes`` command
02:57 < bridge> <bencie.> unlike the tick in the Players tab ingame, foes get saved so the name you added is permanently muted (settings_ddnet.cfg)
02:58 < bridge> <syrinok> They used to show up in a list in the browser, similar to the friends list
02:58 < bridge> <syrinok> iirc
03:00 < bridge> <totar> Why is the player list mute separated from foes? I assumed it would add a foe because the friend button is right next to it
03:01 < bridge> <syrinok> No clue, but I remember deen being worried about permanent mutes
03:02 < bridge> <syrinok> Probably something along the lines of accidentally permanently muting someone and not realizing, which I could see happening I guess
03:04 < bridge> <bencie.> i could also imagine it being abused with fakenames, imagine someone spamming every server with the name of moderators names (or literally anyone), and a bunch of people mute them forever
03:05 < bridge> <syrinok> I liked the context menu thing someone posted earlier for the scoreboard, I think a combination of that and some better interface windows would be an overall improvement to everything, maybe in combination of accounts
03:05 < bridge> <bencie.> i could also imagine it being abused with fakenames, imagine someone spamming every server with the name of moderators names (or literally anyone), and a bunch of people mute them forever
03:05 < bridge> <bencie.> whereas if the majority of people only use the tick to mute permanently, its not an issue since they only mute the spammer
03:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Though idk how well that'd work for a full server, would need to rework the scoreboard in general. especially 128 player
03:07 < bridge> <syrinok> Every menu could use a overhaul tbh, but I'm just yappin :greenthing:
03:10 < bridge> <syrinok> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1321200563433504849
03:11 < bridge> <syrinok> Seems like a good start to modernizing things imo
03:17 < bridge> <syrinok> (Players tab is awful)
03:38 < bridge> <louis> needs something to enable cursor in menu cause i like to have my ingame cursor in menu sometimes
03:38 < bridge> <louis> maybe same button for spectator menu or smth
03:39 < bridge> <louis> actually, maybe just ditch that idea and force cursor in tab menu
03:39 < bridge> <louis> there's not many cases where you really need it during gameplay so it might be better to force cursor and just have people get used to it
03:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @animepdf @syrinok i made a quick concept for how i'd do the menu
03:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1321310680363827251/image.png?ex=676cc5f6&is=676b7476&hm=0af95b4cb0a8b695daa6a3b600173527a5acc7cf01fbd000eab04008f79d561e&
03:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> the 3 icon buttons mean:
03:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Add friend, Add foe, and Report
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> dope
04:01 < bridge> <animepdf> This looks goated, thanks a lot. I was thinking about adding all team stuff there join/leave, invite/kick, lock and copying nickname/id, do you think it will look ok to make some kind of tabs, to not put all actions in 1 menu?
04:02 < bridge> <syrinok> Seems good, dunno what I'd change but maybe have less options so it's not as big, I feel like mute emotes isn't used very often by most players
04:11 < bridge> <animepdf> In video cursor is being toggled by mb3, I showed it in the end, ig no one noticed this feature
04:12 < bridge> <animepdf> ðŸ¤“
04:14 < bridge> <animepdf> In the video, cursor is being toggled by mb3, I showed it in the end, ig no one noticed this feature
04:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i guess so, but i did kinda make this to replace the players tab
04:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, fair enough
04:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Scoreboard should be changed to make it more obvious you can click on people
04:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> really as simple as highlighting the current player your mouse is over
04:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> which is already done
04:21 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, I guess. I guess then it needs to be made more obvious you can turn mouse mode on
04:23 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't like the idea of having it on by default when hitting tab, as louis suggested
04:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea but that involves a... *gulp* ...option!
04:29 < bridge> <animepdf> @_voxeldoesart why do you have me blocked, I didn't mention twinbop for a year already, and I still can't add silly reactions to your messages ðŸ˜­

06:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> GOOD MORNING
06:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> merry christmas y'all
06:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yo, is there anyone who may have a little super secret, redacted article about culling textures that are completely covered by other textures which don't have any transparency at all? :kek:
06:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm planning on implementing occlusion on textures which shouldn't be visible whatsoever and is wasting precious draw calls
06:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yo, is there anyone who may have a little super secret, ~~retarded~~ redacted article about culling textures that are completely covered by other textures which don't have any transparency at all? :kek:
06:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> how much fps do you think it will save
06:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> depends on how draw calls are handled
06:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> since I develop my own stuff in Godot, only Objects that are flagged visible will be checked for it's draw calls
06:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so, the less draw calls, the more data can flow into the GPU, the more FPS :owo:
06:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> not exactly like that, but this will make sure the CPU can concentrate on more things, than sending data
06:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> For example, if 10 textures are overlapping each other and all 10 objects are flagged as visible, all 10 of them will be checked, waste of CPU usage.
06:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If I can manage to hide all 9 of them which are completely not visible to the camera's view, then 9 Objects are skipped from gathering data, which means CPU go wroom wroom
06:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And for the love of god, I cannot find a single article about how they handle what to render and what not to render in a 2D space.
06:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I saw 3D videos about frustrum culling, but it's mainly used in 3D. Do we have an article similar to it, but in 2D space?
06:24 < bridge> <louis> 2d is a subset of 3d aint it
06:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW:
07:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice!!
07:14 < ChillerDragon> @0xdeen i tried moving ``Input()->MouseModeRelative();Ui()->SetEnabled(true);`` to OnRender but that did not help
07:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/teeworlds.cn/commit/264155a3f0d3bdff6cb46e440c4945677c497d46
07:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i hate tencent
07:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> wiki was still accesable within qq yesterday morning
07:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Is it possible to ask them for an explanation?
07:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it just says malicious content
07:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but it says that for about every website
07:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can appeal it if i submit my ID and claim it is mine but idk if i want to
07:51 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think they just auto block every website that is not registered if more than a few people access it. cuz i send the link in the chat and it is just gone after that
07:52 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
07:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> What??
07:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Does Tencent give any info on what is so malicious about it? It doesn't let the end user download content, drop ads or ever redirect them elsewhere no?
07:57 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no
07:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Then wtf?
07:57 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but again, it just says that for basically every website
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> There is no malice in giving documentary on a game lmao
07:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> unless you are registered
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that is bs
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that is not an intention for malice, that is a misuse of that word
07:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> jeez tencent
07:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i mean i assumed ddnet.org got banned bcs it contains twn in ddnet.org/status
07:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> maybe it auto detected the traditional chinese language settings in wiki too
07:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I thought so, cuz ddnet.org is in a way, allowing the end user to download content outside of chinese regulations no?
07:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> again, no idea
07:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so maybe they immediately target the main website, instead of the wiki directly
08:00 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and i don't care. i just need to work around it
08:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> again, this is so bullshit ðŸ˜„
08:00 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm pretty sure is automatically banned
08:00 < bridge> <eidderFsT> cuz no way they can manually ban 90% of all websites
08:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So, does Tencent force someone in the Easten region to register as an upholder that is .... gonna be responsible?
08:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> there is not many websites you can just log onto unless it is gov or appealed by a register holder
08:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that is a super dangerious bet
08:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so f.e Deen wouldn't be able to uphold it, but it would be your job to do so, if you register for it?
08:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> luckly browsers don't do that in china yet. maybe they do, i just don't use chinese browsers
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and you get punished for it if anything they intent as malicious?
08:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> idk dude, no idea how it works there
08:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i don't need to register it for ddnet, and also i can't i have to be the one buying the domain in a chinese provider for me to register it to the gov
08:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i can just submit my id to tencent and say it is mine
08:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not sure if that will work tho
08:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eh... not worth it
08:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and i don't really want to attach my id to a website that is not mine tho
08:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, we shouldn't force a person to register it in behalf of ddnet
08:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you really shouldn't be able to claim it is yours too
08:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think they do check the registeries
08:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> until Tencent properly reviews it and sees it as a conventional documentary site, it shouldn't be done
08:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> cuz anyone can just submit an ID and appeal
08:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> they probably won't do it anyway
08:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> for now i'm just trying my best to make sure twcn is up to code and fully tracable to me, so if anything went wrong at least they can find me
08:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> just to show that i am (at least trying) to be lawful lol
08:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maaan, hopefully you won't get yourself to court because of it
08:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> unless it is so serious that involves either heavy politics or violence, they will just call me to let me close the site i think
08:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :nouis: mabye
08:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not that we have that many users anyway
08:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ~~and i did remove the taiwan flag on the chinese version of the site just to be safe lmao. you can't do that on ddnet that would be discrimination.~~
08:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> fantastic
08:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hope it goes well
08:48 < bridge> <learath2> I love the font. What is it?
08:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Inter
08:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it's the closest default font to Deja Vu Sans I can get on Figma
08:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> (and i really dont want to have to go through the trouble of using the figma font thingy again)

16:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> does someone here know um... some windows
16:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i have an issue where my keyboard fucks up & randomly freezes the inputs, this is fixed if i plug in a second keyboard, probably something about drivers, does someone know how to force that driver to stay or smth? lmao
16:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> throw away pc
17:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> too expensive to throw away sorry
17:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Try this first: https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1299058332212133899
17:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> still happening
17:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> well rn its happening outside of ddnet
17:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe the keyboard, cable, connection or USB port are faulty. Try using a different USB port and for testing unplug all other devices that don't need. If it works with one keyboard and not with the other it seems like the keyboard or its cable are faulty. Uninstall the drivers for the broken keyboard in the Device Manager and then install the latest drivers from the manufacturers website. If that doesn't work, contact the manufacturer.
17:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> happens for all usb ports on that one keyboard
17:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> the "broken" keyboard works completely fine if i put in a second keyboard plugged in like i said, there also doesnt seem to be any drivers online
17:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> guess im just gonna use a different keyboard
19:43 < bridge> <animepdf> can it be that when I write `x = x || foo();` foo() won't be executed since x is true?
19:48 < bridge> <animepdf> ig compiler is smart enough, ever for switching foo() and x places
19:50 < bridge> <teero777> yes
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> that is also why something like
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> `if(some_pointer && some_pointer->att1 > 2)`
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> works even if some_pointer is NULL
20:06 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim
20:06 < bridge> <teero777> anyone tried this? :D
20:06 < bridge> <teero777> looks cool
20:19 < bridge> <animepdf> smth like this, also team buttons are 'contextual', they appear only if they can be applied

20:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oooooh nice
20:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the button prob need to be opaque if you can find a cool color for it imho. the background is too text heavy it blends with the button text a little bit
20:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whatd you change the report button to
20:41 < bridge> <animepdf> yeah, I just made it less transparent, looks better
