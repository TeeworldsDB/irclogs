03:21 < bridge> <totar> tbf dummy is basically an allowed cheat
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im having a hard time finding the code that stucks input when you switch team. I assume thats some kind of ddnet server feature to hold hook when you join spectators or something like that.
06:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> checkout this new gamemode i found
06:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727496922.png
06:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so many ddnet client download links are 404 ._. can we get them back
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm i found the input stuff now
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only took 1 hour xd

08:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft is .green a legit tld?
08:07 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
08:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://icannwiki.org/.green
08:07 < bridge> <Ewan> I bought it with no issue
08:07 < bridge> <Ewan> awaiting lawsuit or revocation
08:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> nono im just asking
08:08 < bridge> <Ewan> I think it really was just a publicity launch thing
08:08 < bridge> <Ewan> no requirements
08:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it have a theme or what
08:08 < bridge> <Ewan> earth related
08:08 < bridge> <Ewan> greenwashing
08:09 < bridge> <Ewan> I did ewan.green because that is my full name
08:09 < bridge> <Ewan> with a dot instead of a space
08:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> green is ur surname?
08:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn these american names
08:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> legit question, but is someone named Orange?
08:09 < bridge> <Ewan> unsure
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> discord used to be much simpler
08:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> now there are 3 kinds of usernames
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> my server nickname is Ewan bcs that’s my ign and the bot likes that
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> usually my display name is Ewan Green
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> if u go into DMs for example
08:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but on my server profile it doesn’t show that at all
08:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should write blog posts
08:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> no wonder u had it hard to find job
08:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur web is blank
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> there is stuff but there’s no stuff
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> I have frontend code on there to grab gists from github and display them w formatting and colors and shit
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but it seemed out of place
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> where do u live in us btw?
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> Colorado
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> will u vote trump
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> absolutely not
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289469784689217617/300px-Colorado_in_United_States.png?ex=66f8efd1&is=66f79e51&hm=2c3273f4485d67f4de5b4561207561b517b0e8fc1c400c89d18493438bf48294&
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur state red or b lue
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur state red or blue
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> blue
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> purple often
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> are you pro gun owner?
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats purple
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> trolling
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> would u vote sanders?
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> swing state
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> in a heartbeat
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> me too
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also find his accent rly funny
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> his english has a rly strong accent
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Boston accent sounds like
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk where he is actually from
08:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> so ur vote counts "more"
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I am woefully underinformed on the voting process
08:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :Lash:
08:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft why do u think many ppl dont vote? because ur required to register?
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I don’t wanna give u a yes or a no cuz it’s been a long time since I learned about it
08:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> in spain ur registered by default
08:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can go or not
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> because there’s zero point for most people
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> we will never see the democracy take true control as long as these issues exist so far above our head
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> corporate lobbying bypasses legislation all the time
08:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho u cant have true democracy when u just have 2 relevant parties
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft on twitter i see lot of shills for SF and their million salaries
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it true or there is a catch
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> or its just the top blabering
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> SF

08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> san francisco
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a highly populated area
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl get paid good
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but cost of living is very high
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> life is about as shitty in most places around here
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> high dollar value really just means you can buy nicer goods lol
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but only sometimes
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> right
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> like a product u buy online will cost the same
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289471413211631636/GYOI20OXsAAPJIW.png?ex=66f8f156&is=66f79fd6&hm=e7dcd1529d2b816c68090c5d5b4aa84b53ad602853c30fef6761430ba314d1ea&
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s life
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but a tomato in San Francisco will cost 3x what it does in West Virginia or some shit
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i pay 1.3€ for coffee
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice coffee
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc in us coffee is lot of milk or water
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and giant
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> it seems like u live in a nice place
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yes basically
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289472098942713918/pxl_20240927_065213009.png?ex=66f8f1f9&is=66f7a079&hm=c7b4fd0ed0bbc43e5e93f0515375c85ea8aeb91cbfa9f2401b849a13edfb6755&
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft what do u think
08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> about my coffee
08:21 < bridge> <Ewan> looks very tasty
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> I would probably expect it to taste sweeter than it is
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also dont add sugar
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> W
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> lactose free milk is good in coffee
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> brain trick
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
08:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is lactose free milk
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> (cuz gf, but i cant bother to buy 2 types of milk)
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> personally too sweet for me on its own
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> we buy it skimmed too
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if thats the word
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> "desnatada"
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> skim milk
08:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> less fat
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> we buy whole milk
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> the fat is necessary for me
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> w medicine milk is usually all I can handle in the morning
08:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg nice. But also with milk and ice?
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> with milk
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never ask ice with coffee
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need ice and it’s so expensive everywhere
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> where do u live
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it gets quite hot in Spain no?
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but it feels like a sin
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> not hot hot but need ice hot
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> crazy
08:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Right now in Bali iced coffee is my biggest spending after rent xd
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But in Munich it’s the same
08:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> These starbucks fuvkers somehow made it socially acceptable to sell iced coffee for 10 bucks. While it costs them 10ct.
08:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> starbucks sucks
08:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Buying that kind of coffee is getting scammed. But as an addict there isn’t always other options.
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> there is not really a place to get good coffee fast
08:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do \#9055
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> I gotta get productive
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> on my ownsome
08:34 < bridge> <Ewan> I don’t wanna depend on this medicine
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> but there is so much at stake if I give it up
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant do 0.7 features
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> I am starting to understand why ppl go out and become monks
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta find peace

11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> crates should have like teams
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah xd
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they do AFAIK

13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just for the meme
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc it has like some fpga stuff
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> and 1gb l3 cache
13:03 < bridge> <kebscs> a bit
13:04 < bridge> <kebscs> these are mostly extra features/debugging tools for the client

13:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't seem like a problem?
13:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's only for account creation, I'd guess
13:17 < bridge> <loh81758> привет
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's only for operations related to changing or logging into accounts yes
13:18 < bridge> <loh81758> я новенкий
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> signing for example currently has no rate limit
13:18 < bridge> <loh81758> я русский

13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @loh81758 english only lease
13:18 < bridge> <loh81758> я не знаю англиский
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @loh81758 english only please
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you log in once currently
13:18 < bridge> <loh81758> ??????
13:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then use #off-topic please. all other changes are english only
13:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah okay then it seems like a non issue actually
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, it's configurable anyway
13:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Unless you have a room full of people and try to convert them to ddnet
13:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like my public monthly irl ddnet meetups
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you reminded me of an open question.. to either invaidate a session or not xd
13:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks you could add `github:ddnet:core` as owner on crates.io to grant everyone who has push access to https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet to the crates
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did it work?
13:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I just added that group to the ddnet crate, it worked for me there
13:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> https://tsdo.in/blog/test-steam-networking/ wrote my first article oof
13:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I had to re-authenticate with github first though, because it had some permission problem — for that I had to revoke access of crates.io to my account (under "authorized oauth apps) and re-login to crates.io…
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i send an invite for all crates
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://crates.io/crates/ddnet-account-client looks like it worked directly
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe it just takes some time
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok nice
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that defs makes it easier

13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you ever need to wait for github actions, write a long issue in the meantime
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
13:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why is my github not pinged. i got no notification in my github inbox hmm
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i first had that repo on private
13:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: valid
13:51 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> ghostping
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> github ghost ping
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be funny if it would create a real ping
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and u cant see it
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is anyone else in this super bugged github beta?
13:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would imagine that it probably did that when they first implemented it
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me everything is breaking down since weeks
13:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what beta
13:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> gladly not - i didnt hear a single good thing about it
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727524361.png
13:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> non beta github is already pretty broken isn't it
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me it only works on some repos for whatever reason
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727524386.png
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant see ddnet forks
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need to use incognito browser for github half of the day xd
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the "repository type: none" seems to be the issue
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "try changing your filters"
13:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> "mysql"
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fair
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo this ur should work right out of the box https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/forks
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because it links there
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> incognito can handle that url
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it probably does, unless you manually selected "none" before
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (as evidenced by it working in incognito mode)
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might be a cookie thing
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, it probably saved your filters
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i have the feeling my account is in some sort of beta that only works with this url https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/forks?include=active&page=1&period=&sort_by=stargazer_counts
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also have an entirly different contributors section
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727524621.png
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this one even says beta xd

14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i hate that xdd
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with fancy headers
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> readme is rly good already
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i would usually spam in more sections xd but i like the readme
14:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> "to build - use https://github.com/matricks/bam"
14:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bam
14:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> done
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ omg you used "main" branch
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we stop mixing main and master in ddnet please
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> main is main
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> decide on one and go with that
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> master is a person
14:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> does it hurt in any way? ._.
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we can also switch to main but then also switch ddnet/ddnet
14:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> i told you multiple times now... dont call me master in public kitten
14:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ocd chiller probably
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried that xD
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its so annoying to have to work with two names for the same thing
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont try again
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use tab completion
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can make a deal to not add another branch that starts with m
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or even ma
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow
14:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289558215784271984/image.png?ex=66f9422d&is=66f7f0ad&hm=4d916efea050901d5f5b36ab1c2e872204ed2c833580801ba6dcac5967df1b2c&
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller:
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/discord-skin-upload-bot
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uses main too
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you feel offended?
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> :pepeW:
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet data too
14:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289558480830599231/image.png?ex=66f9426c&is=66f7f0ec&hm=f08e5ac9aad4f034c593016c4ed016058a9680adfff51ba7673c8a0a037658ca&
14:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what about chowmain
14:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> omg i forgot to eat again

14:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> time to order food i guess
14:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> didnt know it's that easy tbh :o
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes its super straightforward
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have all my organisations setup to use master as default branch
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to be consistent with ddnet and teeworlds
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and josspit is messing it all up
14:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> idk i kinda got used to having both, i just type `ma` and autocomplete anyway
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1727525239.png
14:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we should keep it as-is just to annoy chiller
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe you can have a local git extension that deals with this
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd also like to have that
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds like source of horrible bugs and debugging session
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then i also need it on my vps to port git scripts and it becomes a maintenance nightmare
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just be consistent when creating repos its not hard
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe you can upstream it
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we can still fix it
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that'd solve this problem for everyone
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we can solve it for everyone
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> decide on which to use and make sure all repos use it
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you only want to "solve" it for ddnet
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you upstream it to git, it's solved for literally everyone 🙂
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what else is there?
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not upstreaming stuff to git
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> upstreaming to ddnet is my pain toleration limit
14:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> does git have default branch or is it mostly a web service thing
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there  is ``git init``
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which used to do master
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think modern woke lgbtq++ git throws a warning that you should configure a default branch
14:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> afaik it just prompts and defaults do main if you dont input anything?
14:11 < bridge> <learath2> Is it finally time? Has modernthink caught up to us? Will we have a main branch now finally ending slavery?
14:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> am i woke?
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 josspit solved racism
14:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> i saw your legs and chin hairs - yes you are
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he fixed it
14:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't identify as queer. :pepeW:
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am okay with solving racism idc but then do it consistently and also get oy to rename it xd
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> #off-topic
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> welcome to 2099
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the year i was born
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> Did git finally make the default main btw?
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> It was still master last I checked
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not AFAIK
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think it did
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well idk not sure if it did first thing i did was change it to master xd
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> $ git init
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint:
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint:     git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint:
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint:
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hint:     git branch -m <name>
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, it did not
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah still master
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> git version 2.46.1
14:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> doing it from the website it prompts you to call your branch Main ^^
14:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289560817565569165/image.png?ex=66f94499&is=66f7f319&hm=1a0e144ef74c411a413a755cd3c339296b59cd9305445b701ad5e419ece3a3d1&
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you only need to configure master to get rid of the hint
14:14 < bridge> <learath2> Let's use `development` to annoy everyone
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not annoyed by development
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am just annoyed by a mix
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ahead of time
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least across one organisation on github it should be consistent
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> labber kein
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nobody cares
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you seem to care
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just accept and live a nice life
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> create a github issue, ChillerDragon, if you want to talk about it. I don't see it being resolved here
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls
14:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye weird. i thought i had a repo that defaulted to main
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont open an issue for that xD
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have enough ignored gh issues already
14:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't usually copy github's setup
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fix 20 issues as trade
14:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe i did that time
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ agree
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> man how did we end up in this discussion again
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think this is a productive topic for discord, it usually devolves into flamewars
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nobody would have noticed
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nobody would have cared+
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i noticed
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i care
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so with my moderator hat on, I'll ask you to stop the discussion on discord
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i get annoyed by it every time in the ddnet data repo
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf it's hard to miss that your git commands aren't working 😄
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: stop the discussion
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller then pls go ahead and create a new account system to call your main branch master
14:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> i respect it - but where is fokkonaut with the gif? he should've been here by now...jk
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ you are saying nobody should care right? Why do you care enough to use main over master? What value does it bring thats worth breaking consistency?
14:19 < bridge> <learath2> Ping him, it's not the same without
14:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
14:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now would be a good moment for a fokko gif
14:21 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> does timing out chiller involve revoking webhooks
14:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes 😄
14:21 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> sounds like extra work
14:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i go to marriage now, cya tomorrow bros & sises
14:23 <+bridge> <avolicious> All the best
14:23 <+bridge> <patiga> enjoy yourself :)
14:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thx, I'll tell the Bride and groom
14:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the groom even plays teeworlds 😛
14:24 <+bridge> <avolicious> Damn, do we know him?
14:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably yes
14:24 <+bridge> <avolicious> deen 😄
14:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hehe, i wont leak anyway
14:24 <+bridge> <avolicious> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
14:25 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> https://wccftech.com/huawei-is-completely-ditching-android-app-support-with-harmonyos-next/
14:27 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> huawei just had a developer event announcing their new OS hinting at the removal of android in their devices...
14:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> doubt they'd do that tbh
14:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (not having read the article)
14:27 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> it was an old article. they did talk about app compatibilities during the event
14:27 <+bridge> <reitw> HarmonyOS is already used
14:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> which is just AOSP + some other huawei stuff. but it seems they are removing AOSP.
14:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why would they remove AOSP?
14:28 <+bridge> <reitw> Ah
14:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds just like extra work
14:28 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> they kinda bragged about the apps that they currently supports. but wechat is not on the list
14:29 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i feel like they would just backtrack all of this if tencent just decide to ignore them
14:29 <+bridge> <meloƞ> isn't wechat whatsapp for china? - sounds like a horrible way to advertise something
14:30 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly. it is fully possible that they pulled a AOSP removal by just renaming all android runtime. the main thing is definitely blocking sideloading.
14:31 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> wechat is the app for china
14:32 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> if your phone now only opens wechat. you can still live. like you pay with it, you earn with it, you file tax with it. most people are reachable with wechat.
14:32 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> isn't monopoly wonderful :kekw:
14:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they want to block anything but their store, or they think that AOSP is too locked down?
14:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> definitely the first one
14:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> if i had to guess
14:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> huawei has a track record of ambiguious communication in china. the first time harmony os is revealed a lot of people thought it doesn't have android in it.
14:37 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so maybe they are trying to do it again, and just make everyone thinks they ditched android just to block sideloading
14:37 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> so maybe they are trying to do it again, and just make everyone think they ditched android just to block sideloading
14:37 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ctrl+f5 is clearing the website's cache right?
14:37 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> supposedly yes
14:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> udemy.com working on edge, chrome and brave, but god forbid it loading on firefox :reeeee:
14:38 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i keep run into weird errors on firefox too.
14:39 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> the only way out is endure (lol)
14:39 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess you can try using the inspector and force disabling cache
14:39 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1289567159168667789/image.png?ex=66f94a81&is=66f7f901&hm=bbb87b28f0df743d42b96f7c9502108ce95e74b944e56e524b5b965b88ae20e2&
14:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i get an 401 error on firefox ?XD
14:41 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i keep getting NS_ERROR_FAILURE randomly on firefox. still don't know why it does that
14:42 <+bridge> <meloƞ> glad i'm using bitwarden (thanks to heinrich for the recommendation btw) - so it doesnt hurt switching browsers for this, but still annoying
14:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `NS_ERROR_FAILURE` is that a name resolve failure?
14:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe but it resolves fine on chrome always
14:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> might be it's a GFW thing and chrome just know how to hardcore retry
14:43 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe it's a GFW thing and chrome just know how to hardcore retry
14:45 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> although DNS pollution here usually gives me connection reset instead of just failure to resolve
14:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Even before looking at your screenshot I knew it would be either google or a google service
14:48 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> why
14:49 <+bridge> <learath2> It's suspiciously always google services breaking firefox. Definitely not a conspiracy to push people to chrome
14:49 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> google isn't broken for me tho
14:49 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean google.com can randomly disappear and i have to use google.com.uk from time to time but that happens on chrome too.
14:50 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> just usual chinese thing lol
14:50 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> the screenshot is to show melon how to disable cache in the inspector
14:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the log looks unrelated, and if it's not, it's not google's but the addon privacy badger's fault
14:50 <+bridge> <learath2> I wish google was a chinese company
14:51 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> baidu is like.. hell
14:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think google didn't enter the chinese market back when they had ethics
14:51 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh definitely. I just want the google executives sent on reform vacations for their crimes against firefox. Can't do that in the west
14:52 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> baidu usually has a full page of ads for fake drugs before you can find the real results
14:54 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> btw firefox managed to fix the bad AV1 stream youtube is sending.
14:56 <+bridge> <learath2> Nice, finally
14:56 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> I switched to zen tho
14:58 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> oh nice. "native" harmoney os apps are typescript
14:59 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> and their default IDE is still jetbrains <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
15:01 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> oh bruh unitycn already supports harmony. only unitycn tho. https://docs.unity.cn/cn/tuanjiemanual/Manual/openharmony.html
15:11 <+bridge> <learath2> Is it nice?
15:11 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> it is nice
15:12 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> nice enough that i sticked with it
15:12 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> it feels more like firefox just with the tab yanked to the side than anything really
15:13 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> it feels more like firefox just with the tab yanked to the side than anything else really
16:11 <+bridge> <teero777> @patiga im waiting for ai upscaling of the graphics when doing twmap-edit --scale
16:12 <+bridge> <patiga> it'll not only upscale the graphics, but also the game layers

17:36 <+bridge> <kebscs> why someone thought this is good idea
17:36 <+bridge> <kebscs> `FlagPos -= vec2(21 - TileSize / 2.f, (42 - TileSize / 2.f) + (42.f * 0.75f));`
17:36 <+bridge> <kebscs> why someone thought this is good idea and not  just in the middle
17:36 <+bridge> <kebscs> `FlagPos -= vec2(21 - TileSize / 2.f, (42 - TileSize / 2.f) + (42.f * 0.75f));`
17:41 <+bridge> <kebscs> why someone thought this is good idea and not  just in the middle
17:41 <+bridge> <kebscs> `FlagPos -= vec2((ScaleX - TileSize) / 2.f, ((ScaleY - TileSize) / 2.f) + (ScaleY / 2) * 0.75f);`
17:41 <+bridge> <kebscs> why someone thought this is good idea thats its floating
17:41 <+bridge> <kebscs> `FlagPos -= vec2((ScaleX - TileSize) / 2.f, ((ScaleY - TileSize) / 2.f) + (ScaleY / 2) * 0.75f);`
17:45 <+bridge> <chairn> maybe it's supposed to be planted in a flag holder hence slightly floating
17:45 <+bridge> <chairn> weapons are also not grounded
17:45 <+bridge> <chairn> neither are shields or hearts
17:47 <+bridge> <kebscs> yea but flag has randomly (ScaleY / 2) * 0.75f added
17:47 <+bridge> <robyt3> I guess this would also allow you to see if the flag is in the stand or dropped at that position
17:48 <+bridge> <kebscs> makes sense but never seen a flag stand tho
17:50 <+bridge> <robyt3> There was a discussion about adding a visual flag stand to 0.7: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1732

19:21 <+bridge> <bobik8912> Hi
19:52 <+bridge> <kebscs> hello
19:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> teeworlds devs be like:
19:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest: but it's good no?
19:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> teeworlds devs be like:
19:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> ":justatest: but it's good no?"
20:03 <+bridge> <devinci24> Imo it makes sense.
20:03 <+bridge> <devinci24> Would you also give the players a shovel to get that flag out of the dirt O.o
20:04 <+bridge> <chairn> lel, i started learning some rust and i tried to use ferris-says, and the crate doesn't compile on debian with rust apt package
20:05 <+bridge> <chairn> why would people create a mess that relies on having an internet connection all the time...
20:15 <+bridge> <kebscs> Ninja sword aswell
20:16 <+bridge> <kebscs> Asset drawn wrong and theyre like whatever just hardcorde -10 px to position
20:19 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I actually thought it was a sin function
20:19 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> well, the more we know xd
20:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont use rust apt package
20:29 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Yeah don't use rust apt package :harold:
21:19 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: took only 1 week to fix code generation for int packer function 😏 (assember doesn't spit out errors but it can either segfault or behave weird)
21:22 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> now it's in endless loop, cool
21:46 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> seems to work :DDDD

21:48 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> i just noticed that i have array `foo` of size 3 but array expression has 5 elements :lol:

22:37 <+bridge> <teero777> hii @imilchshake
22:37 <+bridge> <imilchshake> xd
22:37 <+bridge> <imilchshake> Can someone explain me how sv_rescue_delay works? Tooltip says "Number of seconds between two rescues". 
22:37 <+bridge> <imilchshake> But it only works with respect to spawn time, so e.g. value of 5 blocks me from using /r for the first 5 seconds of the run, but after that i notice no effect. Am i missing something?

22:39 <+bridge> <furo> Looking at the code, it seems like `m_LastRescue` is never set ;D
22:40 <+bridge> <imilchshake> holy shit is it my time to do a ddnet PR?
22:40 <+bridge> <robyt3> yea it's neither initialized nor set anywhere
22:40 <+bridge> <imilchshake> @blaiszephyr HEY
22:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> hi milchshake :)
22:41 <+bridge> <teero777> hi melon :)

22:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what discord is that
22:44 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ähm... ähm..........
22:55 <+bridge> <egyt> You can also do translations, they are important, too
22:57 <+bridge> <meloƞ> EYY EGYT YOU ALIVE
22:59 <+bridge> <egyt> I don't think I died?
23:00 <+bridge> <vob1ch> Здравствуйте ошибочный бан
23:01 <+bridge> <egyt> Greetings, ошибочный бан, I am EGYT
23:04 <+bridge> <vob1ch> Можно как то решить проблему?
23:09 <+bridge> <egyt> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-accounts Oh wow, this is real
23:09 <+bridge> <vob1ch> И что мне с этим делать?
23:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> please try using english here or use #off-topic 
23:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> if you absolutely can't understand english use a translator - otherwise we'd have to which gets annoying :P
23:11 <+bridge> <murpi> $deepl
23:11 <+bridge> <murpi> sadness
23:12 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> > And what do I have to do with it?
