00:04 < bridge> <Learath2> and it's equally if not more difficult for us to explain tbf
00:05 < bridge> <newlesstee> but no documentation? Or anything like that?
00:05 < bridge> <newlesstee> An example?
00:06 < bridge> <Learath2> You can look at how we link to sdl maybe, there are no docs on the specific way we use cmake
00:09 < bridge> <newlesstee> There is in the D++ documentation how to use it in CMake but it is different
00:09 < bridge> <newlesstee> https://dpp.dev/10.0.1/buildcmake.html#autotoc_md24
00:35 < bridge> <nha> It's just use a different language
01:02 < bridge> <Marcel> There is nothing wrong with outing as a femboy
01:04 < bridge> <newlesstee> Is there no way to join a teeworlds server with ddnet?
01:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Iâ€™m sadly as vanilla as humans come
01:04 < bridge> <newlesstee> Modding DDNet to vanilla is being hard
01:07 < bridge> <newlesstee> Am I doing something wrong?
01:10 < bridge> <Voxel> they're cute ngk
01:10 < bridge> <Voxel> they're cute ngl
01:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> do you wear programming socks
03:53 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> You can read how you can call CMakeLists.txt from dpp directory and it will compile with ddnet and add to your project
03:53 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> You can read how you can call CMakeLists.txt from dpp directory and dpp will compile with ddnet and add to your project
03:56 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> In old versions(15.8) it was not too hard
04:12 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> You can read how you can call CMakeLists.txt from dpp directory and dpp will compile with ddnet and appear in your project
04:13 < bridge> <newlesstee> how?
04:14 < bridge> <newlesstee> i dont know how put dpp in CMakeLists
04:14 < bridge> <newlesstee> i have tried
04:14 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Download dpp sources from github
04:15 < bridge> <newlesstee> i already downloaded and put in ddnet sources
04:18 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Then put in ddnet CMakeLists.txt add_subdirectory(DPP)
04:18 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> DPP - is name of dpp folder
04:19 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Its one of simplest variants
04:20 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> But compile will take more time
04:21 < bridge> <newlesstee> It will work?
04:21 < bridge> <newlesstee> I will try tomorrow
04:21 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> It working in my project
04:21 < bridge> <newlesstee> Can you help me with one more thing?
04:21 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> And in uhcity
04:21 < bridge> <newlesstee> Oh, nice
04:21 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Yap
04:22 < bridge> <newlesstee> How can I make DDNet vanilla? Despite having several things, I'm creating a city and they get in the way
04:23 < bridge> <newlesstee> I don't know if there's a way to create a server with teeworlds and enter with DDNet
04:24 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Remove freeze shield indicator(search in character.cpp for "m_Armor ="), take damage logic from vanilla(i dont remember which function is it) and return old hud
04:25 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> I think it will work
04:25 < bridge> <newlesstee> There are more things, like the shotgun
04:26 < bridge> <newlesstee> It's been really hard to go back to vanilla
04:26 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Oh, yea
04:26 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Take logic of it from vanilla xd
04:26 < bridge> <newlesstee> I've already tried it, it's quite difficult to keep fixing everything, you have to change all the code
04:27 < bridge> <newlesstee> For example, changing the projectile logic I need to change all the things that use it
04:30 < bridge> <newlesstee> I don't know how the other mod devs manage to do all this.
04:31 < bridge> <newlesstee> But thanks a lot for the help
04:52 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Just create own projectile
04:53 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Just create new projectile
05:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well, you get to know the code base more and more over time.
05:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> feel free to dm me and I can help you with specific things :)
05:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (or here but ping me)
05:56 < bridge> <Voxel> i wish, but my legs arent ready yet
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Working on it \:)

09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 any hint if master server used vanilla registering to fetch server info instead of http way?
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Still many skins missing
10:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check whether map sha is in there
10:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it's there, it's http
10:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if it's not, it's backward compatibility
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> K ty
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Does the server or master server log why or where it failed to register?
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the server does
10:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @deen next time u open ddnet and see missing skins can u look into the logs?
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Jupeyy_Keks I spot a bug already ^^
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A nice
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it immediately returns for some stuff
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but the buffer isn't null-terminated
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps that could be added at the start of the function
11:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Is it normal I prefer C++ over Java
11:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Very normal
11:37 < bridge> <Learath2> AbstractCakeFactoryFactoryInterfaceFactoryEx
11:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :justatest:
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Java kinda feels dead
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Are there still new projects using it?
11:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Probably, Java is well loved by the enterprises
11:44 < bridge> <Learath2> It also runs on almost every smartcard, so itâ€™ll be around almost forever
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Lmao. True. I also forgot Android for a split second
13:18 < bridge> <Marcel> ðŸ¤¦
13:28 < bridge> <ReiTW> Java sux
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is normal
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also do
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but one thing java does better is it has maven or gradle
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c++ dep management is the worst
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But Gradle is also annoying xd
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And ultra slow xddd
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is there a c++ property testing library
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe ddnet could use some
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What property
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like this in rust https://github.com/proptest-rs/proptest
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like half fuzzer, it shrinks to find the minimal input to produce a invalid test
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> quickcheck in haskell
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Cool if that works well
16:22 < bridge> <marmare_314> Hey, does someone have an idea why I get this error when compiling ddnet? `ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: curl_slist_free_all`
16:22 < bridge> <marmare_314> It should just be the latest master branch.
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is Ur os and version
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is your distro
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is your curl version
16:34 < bridge> <marmare_314> Im using Debian 11, and cmake says it only found the boundled version of curl
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Have u installed the requirements that u find in the main github page of ddnet?
16:38 < bridge> <marmare_314> Yes, i copied the apt install command
16:43 < bridge> <marmare_314> One important detail of the message might be that I'm using the clang linker lld.
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That shouldn't matter
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe try a clean build directory. It shouldn't fail to find curl
17:01 < bridge> <marmare_314> Thanks, that fixed it
17:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> Use carbon :giga_chad:

18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u said it before i had this job i would have applied
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh well
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its all senior
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also dont know much about db engineering

18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think this is warp
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah no
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its axum
18:58 < bridge> <deen> Well, you're using Erlang now, so that counts as distributed systems, should be about as relevant as DB experience ðŸ˜„
18:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did u rq ur current one?
18:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its related to his current job
18:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> parent company or smth
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh
19:01 < bridge> <deen> I didn't ragequit, I enjoyed the job. But this sounds even nicer. It's not related, but you could use them together. YugabyteDB is a distributed database you can use as your source of truth, while Materialize is a streaming database that can ingest data from other data sources (like a Postgres-compatible YugabyteDB)
19:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen i sent the materialize thing on my company chat, when u shared it some time ago, they mentioned this to me also https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria
19:06 < bridge> <deen> I'm not familiar with Noria, but the competitors of Materialize I have seen had one of these limitations:
19:06 < bridge> <deen> 1. Doesn't support SQL so you have to write actual code to get complex calculations with incremental upgrades
19:06 < bridge> <deen> 2. Only supports a subset of SQL, so you can't do complex multi-table joins and CTEs

19:37 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> this is my error
19:42 < bridge> <deen> Do you have the git repo cloned or just the source code?
19:45 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> no, i have source code
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u asked that like 5 times already
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try a clean build dir
19:52 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> My work is clean, but my only problem is that you are not going to guide me??
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice comment
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u are the first with that problem
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is no guide
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can try -DDEV=ON
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just use git clone
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> instead of the source code directly
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i remember, that was the problem
20:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> Using the source code directly isn't the problem. I tried when someone had this issue the last time and building from the source archive works as expected (except the bundled libs aren't included)
