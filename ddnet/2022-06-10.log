06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Looks ok to me. Less distracting than the stars or nameplates
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> tele in... evil?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://ddnet.tw/tiles/TELEINEVIL
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ARE RED TELE TILES EVIL?????
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or is this some obscure joke
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> does red indicate evil, like the flags too?
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> tf2 coincidence?
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not sure, there's probably no filter for that
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Sorry for the delay, im gonna try it tonight, if u need some testers, feel free to ask
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> its evil because it removes all hooks and speed. But In reality the blue teles are evil, because you can fail a lot easier because it keeps hooks and speed
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD it is already merged now... So the nightly tester will report if it breaks something
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> true
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> üëç
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They are called "evil teles" in the source code, don't ask me why üòÑ

20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> Could we reduce the delay for loading gamesaves? It's really annoying having to wait 100 seconds after saving on a ddosed server
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is it there at all?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just add the punishment and its fine
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it was there to prevent swapping too much and that one guy does all the map
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it's fine to wait
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if they want to swap they do it anyway
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> punishment prevents that its abused for speedrunning
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so who cares
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it prevents them from doing it for every part
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not if they have to, especially not with swap
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> player tries 30 seconds -> swa√ºp
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> player tries 30 seconds -> swap
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also why does it matter to you?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean why does it matter if somebody abuses this, do you think the one that doesnt do the part likes doing nothing? Xd
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> if someone wants to keep swapping then they will
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> 100 sec delay wont prevent anyone
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> it just makes it more annoying
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> but it also makes it annoying for other cases
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> Yes, remove the delay :^)
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a small delay is ok
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its not abused to cheat time
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not 100 seconds
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> punishment 30 seconds, wait time 15 seconds
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> smth like that
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done, punishment 60 seconds, wait time 15
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thanks
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @bencie @Not Keks I think it was chosen to be a bit annoying, to discourage players from using it more often
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> kinda feel like it was changed just because of /swap in team 0
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> it was fine at 30seconds before
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> but 100 is too much
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> same reason that swap has a cooldown, its so that you are encouraged to not switch so much
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why is it too much though? I would think that your use-case with ddos is one of the rarer features that save is used for
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that many maps are alternating 1-player maps is a different topic I think ^^
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> you're right, there was just no reason to increase the delay in the first place
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> not sure, have you looked up whether there was a discussion around that time?
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> well i read pretty much all messages in here so it would've been hard to miss that discussion, not saying its impossible. only reason i complained is cuz ive had to wait out the 100 seconds due to ddos 3 times just in a week, can get very annoying quick, waiting for a useless timer instead of playing
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lio messi> is swap still 100 seconds in TEAM? makes no sense then, if u want to swap in team u have to wait 100 seconds, thats annoying, but now i can just save and change name and just wait 15 seconds, this change makes no sense if u still keep the 100 seconds for swap in TEAM
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> why is the new hud actually not in fng?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i would love to have an indicator which weapon i have equipped when i'm frozen
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is it a server feature?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ask noby about that feature
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well which weapon you have selected is that not kept track of in the client?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Yes the client keeps track about it (kind of). I will work on allowing mods to also display the new hud in combination  with the old (or exlusivly). But since DDnet comes first, this is still in the backlog. I asked  fokkonaut  to implement it... but he did not want it.
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ah ok nice, anticipating that
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ah ok nice, anticipating that with great joy üç¥
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ah ok nice, anticipating that with great joy
