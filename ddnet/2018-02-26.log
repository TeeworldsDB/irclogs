00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> If I read the source correctly the pickup you add last will hide other entities spawned previously. But as you already realized Snap is not the correct place to create pickups 😃
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @HMH snap is important to create something
16:44 <+Learath2> do we have a way of disabling our auto updater for packaging for distros?
17:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> feel free to add
18:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1053: Don't log out on `sv_rcon{,_mod,_helper}_password` if not changed (master...pr_ddnet_dont_logout) https://git.io/vAKUt
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao ^
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ja> nice, thanks 😃
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what it means exactly?
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ja> changing map on test srv doesn't log you out of rcon
19:10 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vAKOc
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DanilBest> bors spam :D :D
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll tackle docker, bors and investigate our deployment process this thursday
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what about our deployment process?
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen beta.teewebs.com doesn't just use websockets, it also (ab)uses some webrtc dark magic, it was broken for me for quite some time, eeeee
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well we all do it however we want, it'd be nice to have it all standardized
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you mean deployment to the servers?
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> i like to ssh to ddnet.tw then deploy using for loops, deen likes clusterssh, you do something else
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah exactly
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also setting up servers, it'd be nice if we could have one script that does everything from ddnet.tw, or maybe ansible or sth
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you figure out ansible, tell me
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> want to use sth like that for my computers
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao try the map change now 🙂
19:40 <+Learath2> I'll prolly take a look at ansible, puppet and chef but ansible looks to be more suitable
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ja> @heinrich5991 works 👍
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> great 🙂
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what u think about providing better support on where the compiled binaries will appear? `cmake -DEXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH='bin' ..` places the binaries in the `build/bin` folder without all the cmake files, greate, but it doesn't copies the data folder
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what u think about providing better support on where the compiled binaries will appear? `cmake -DEXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH='bin' ..` places the binaries in the `build/bin` folder without all the cmake files, great, but it doesn't copy the data folder
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe use EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH to put the data folder
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in cmake
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something?
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure, might break MSVS
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then make it linux only
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the problem you're trying to solve? 😛
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just wanted a clean way to put the binaries and data files
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in another folder
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```bash
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cd 'dirname $0'
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mkdir build 2> /dev/null
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cd build
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cmake -DEXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH='bin' ..
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make DDNet-Server -j4
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `make package_default` can give you an archive if you're after that
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 there's another thing you wanted to do 😛
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> parsing of teehistorian for a log of rcon actions
