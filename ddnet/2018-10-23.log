18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I think not
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @Learath2 do u still are working on an account system ?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @Learath2 are u still working on an account system ?
18:58 <+Learath2> I don't even have time to look myself in the mirror, let alone working on an account system
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> xd sad :c
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> I rly think this is what ddnet need
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> @Learath2 just saw your comment on GH about having worked on a serverside lua version, and TBH, I have worked on one too, once ðŸ˜„
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> matricks wanted to create a vm to run gamecore on so the server could send over the gamecore aswell
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that was also a cool idea
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> HMod is a good example @Learath2
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> I think doing something like minetest and turning teeworlds into an engine for mods would be a way forward
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> instead of closing it for modification or hoping that people will port their mods easily
19:38 <+Learath2> It'd take an immense amount of work, while we barely have enough people to keep this mod running and mostly bug-free
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> yeah, true...
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Is there anyone doing something against the master server problem?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just a flood, the only thing we can do is a better master server protocol
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are flooding cou2. Can't filter that out
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Well like I said it's time to move to http
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 was working on a http version of the masters, maybe talk to him if you are willing to help out with it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Sure, but he doesn't seem to be active recently
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Oh he was on saturday, didn't saw that
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He does come around atleast once a day
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Oh? I'll wait then for him
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 "matricks wanted to create a vm to run gamecore on so the server could send over the gamecore aswell"
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does that mean?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently the only way to change gamecore e.g. physics are tunes
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as they need to be the same on the server and the client
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> currently= 07?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently = since forever
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.5 0.6 0.7
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well why would u want to change the gamecore?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the fng hammer is bad enough
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye but what does this vm part mean?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> matricks wanted to create a virtual machine to run gamecore in that wouldn't be turing complete so you shouldnt(tm) be able to run malicious code
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which would allow us to send the compiled gamecore in bytecode from the server
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> without allowing us to hack people with it
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> big words
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like work and a shitty vm like java xd
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dislike vms ._.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when did he mention it? back then when he was active?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> waaay back
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think this was also related to it https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/tree/bluesky
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> allowed seperate loading of resources iirc
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well dont get me wrong i am a fan of modding but that went way too far
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was pretty cool stuff. The map loaded first then the map resources and stuff
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and you could chat while the map is loading
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo it would be better to serve a boilerplate with the teeworlds networking stuff and basics and everybody can build an actual own game out of it
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to start a teeworlds client and play something that changed the core physics
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't you dont. Someone else might
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nodes was pretty cool imho
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or things like destroying terrain with rocket
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or proper moving tiles
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> agree
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lua is a pretty cool guy
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guy? xd
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Marcel hi? ðŸ™‚
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Hi
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcel> Are you still working on improving the master servers?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Marcel ppl are on it u can watch the discussion in the teeworlds irc
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ojh
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u are there already^^ useless comment by me then soww
