01:08 <+eeeee> isnt it easier to include the said database in client updates?
06:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Yeas
08:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/vFf14
08:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master ab2738c heinrich5991: Allow cross-compilation from Linux to macOS
08:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 77ca355 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #930 from heinrich5991/pr_ddnet_crosscompile_mac...
08:50 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> The important part is that the skins would have to be loaded dynamically in the background instead of loading all of them like right now
08:50 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> right now having hundreds or thousands of skins fills up your RAM
09:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> and size/amount limit, like with demos and some way of stopping people making 9000 gigantic skins and spamming them
09:09 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> the skins should be from skin db, and we have mods for that
09:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Ok good
09:09 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so I'd accept a PR to download them from within the client
09:10 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> just show the default skin until it's downloaded, don't hang the main threads waiting for download
09:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> hmm if the client downloaded the skins from DB couldn't it also download Creator and skinpack data so instead of searching by skinname you could search by Creator and skinpack too
09:16 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> sure
09:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Neat!
09:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Guys
09:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> All the haxx client is way better than ddnet client
09:37 <+ddnet-discord> <chalequex> ?
09:37 <+ddnet-discord> <chalequex> lel xD
09:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> hell no
09:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Too many useless thing
09:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And too little useful stuff
10:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> wait a minute, isn't it hack client? Ban  @Ezy and remove all his points :banhammer:
10:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> wait a minute, isn't it hack client? Ban @Ezy and remove all his points :banhammer:
10:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And by minute I mean 14 of them
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <chalequex> lol
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Mokuz it's not a hack client, so no need to banhammer Ezy :) And yea, you are totally right, it has got loads and loads of useless stuff, like the exact same skindownloader that deen described earlier :D
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Skinstealer*
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> if you consider downloading from ddnet's database "stealing"..
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I meant ath's skinstealer ðŸ˜„
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Was mostly joke, tho it has some hacks
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @jao what's that?
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Mokuz oh does it? didn't know about that... like what for example? o.O
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> A tool that downloads skins from other players that are on your sever
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that sounds like a skin downloader
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @jao that's not possible, how would you do that?
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> One hack is balance boy
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> the players would have to send it over the gameserver or p2p
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Not*
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Bot*
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Idk how it works, but some client has it, maybe it wasn't ath ðŸ˜®
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Baumalein?
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Oh and ath has this thing where you hammer someone to get his skin on your tee xd
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> lol no xd now THAT was baumalein
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @jao can we get that for ddnet?
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> But no download just changes it
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Probably;
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> its rly hard to copy colors on your own
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Ye why not, pretty useful feature
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Nah
13:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Guys
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ath is just better
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> If u dont like useless things then dont fuck around with em
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> But so many things that ddnet doesnt have that are cool
14:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Even small things like when u spec someone it moves to the player smoothly makes it so much better
14:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> dude what are you discussing about? just let people use whatever they prefer and do so yourself
14:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Im saying that ath is better than ddnet
14:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ofc they have to decide themselves
14:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> It's just your opinion, and it's wrong
14:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> how can an opinion be wrong or right tho? ðŸ˜„
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
14:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> let's keep ddnet as purely only practical features, no autohammerskinchanger
14:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's so funny to read you
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And here's opinion: hitler was a good man
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Use whatever you want, just don't cry if you will be banned while using hacks
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Am I wrong?
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, the whole discussion
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> about clients
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's funny
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> ....
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Mokuz well that's not an opinion, it was a claim
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Savander totally agree with you
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> it's rediculous
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> @Henningstone I'm quite sure I said hitler is a good man beofore that
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What are you trying to say
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> someone deleted his one message
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Mokuz stop that
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> yes pls
14:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> That someone removes hit let posts
14:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Ok
14:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Sorry
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> @Savander yes about bans yes, would be better if just no-one used them
14:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @Mokuz so ath doesnt have the hammer feature and we talked about this already. and why would u dislike a client that has autohammerskinchanger. Obviously if ddnet had this function any normal person would just keep their fingers from it. Also It isnt even a bot or some other script which u can cheat stuff with
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> I ment please don't add 900000 useless features to dd
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Stuff like the opengl update isn't really useful for players either
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ofc
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why? ðŸ˜®
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it makes rendering faster
14:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> -> less resources used, runs on worse computers
14:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> if they've got opengl 3.3 support, that is :D
14:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
14:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't know the stats on that
14:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> quick googling suggests that nvidia supports it with its drivers since 2010
14:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> from the first impression it sounds likely that everyone has OGL 3.3
14:49 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Oh I thought it's for better fps while zooming out far
14:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's a side effect of doing things faster ^^
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> hum, I might have found something where a lot of performance is being wasted... all the stuff that `mem_alloc` and `mem_free` does in addition to what their main purpose is makes them be more then two to three times slower than a simple `malloc` and `free`. I'm not sure if it would make change fps-wise, but considering that they are called about 30 times per second when ingame, it's definitely mor <message clipped>
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> think `mem_alloc` and `mem_free` were used to keep control over the way memory is allocated, possibru to keep it less fragmented
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> as far as I can see it's just collecting stats about how much memory is being allocated from where in the code for debugging purposes. It's also performing integrity checks and asserts if something is wrong, so that you can find possible memory errors
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> oh and of course you can use it to find memory leaks, at least if every allocation in the code is done using mem_alloc
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't think we have code there to track leaks do we?
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> the code from vanilla remembers what has been allocated and from where, so if you read all these information after client shutdown, there should be no allocations left (except for a few that are hard to get rid of)
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> the function `mem_debug_dump` writes everything that is currently allocated to a file 'memory.txt'
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> do i have to open ports so that ddnetserver shows on internet
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> usually yes, if it tell you to
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> I guess I don't have to tell you about setting `sv_register 1`, do I?
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i set it to 1
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> hmm i try to open port
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> it doesnt show
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> did it say "server registered" in the console tho?
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You have to forward port, and also be sure that your ISP allows you to use that port
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> ah
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> [2017-10-26 20:01:49][register]: chose 'master2.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> [2017-10-26 20:01:52][register]: ERROR: the master server reports that clients can not connect to this server.
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> [2017-10-26 20:01:52][register]: ERROR: configure your firewall/nat to let through udp on port 8303.
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> yep, as the message says :D
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> do i have to fear hackers if i open that port?
20:04 <+Henningstone> well if you are going to host a teeworlds server you have to fear everything nowadays :D
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i think, if teeworlds server has
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> some weakness
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which can destroy your life
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then yes
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no one can be sure
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> generate ports are used to communiate
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> communicate
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE>

20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> wtf?
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> wtf
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's german
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :OO
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> it wants me to choose a port from 1 to 65k
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i chose 8303
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> hmm
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> just guessing, but have you got a port forwarding rule for that already (inactive)?
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> nope
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> ah got it
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> im stupid
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i didnt choose the machine
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i thought it works for all
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> kind of a stupid error message then
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> yup
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i bet, they sent random message
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if they don't know what went wrong
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
