00:01 < Savander> omh
00:01 < Savander> i'm timeouted.
00:01 <@deen> ouch
00:01 < xrothx> deen: 
00:01 < xrothx> any problems with the server? 
00:02 <@deen> xrothx: yes
00:02 < xrothx> what?
00:02 < xrothx> I just lagged like hell
00:02 <@deen> =/
00:02 <@deen> some people have bad routing
00:02 <@deen> especially during evening
00:03 <@deen> aaa from France, me from Germany
00:05 < Savander> deen: i'll upload everything to github
00:14 < Savander> it can be hard for you, because i used screen and i have scripts for it :<
00:25 < Savander> good night ;)
00:30 <@deen> savander_androi: where's the database?
00:31 < savander_androi> In zcatch_config
00:31 < savander_androi> Called zcatch.sql
00:31 <@deen> ah, i see
00:31 < xrothx> deen:  So you wont use it anymore? 
00:32 <@deen> xrothx: i don't have a better server
00:32 <@deen> all servers have problems
00:32 <@deen> the only perfect servers i found were 400 € / month
00:39 <@deen> savander_androi: you probably shouldn't post your rcon password on github^^
00:40 < savander_androi> Its doesnt matter
00:40 < savander_androi> It was temporary rcon
00:40 <@deen> i set another one and can i fix the configs?
00:40 < savander_androi> Sure
00:41 < savander_androi> You can change 3 configs
00:41 <@deen> so you need 8 zcatch servers?^^
00:41 < savander_androi> People played
00:41 <@deen> ok
00:41 < savander_androi> On 5 xD
00:41 <@deen> that's great =)
00:41 < savander_androi> In one moment
00:41 < savander_androi> But server wasnt full
00:42 <@deen> yeah, that's ok
00:42 < savander_androi> 30-40 players
00:42 < savander_androi> Sometimes more
00:42 < savander_androi> Somtimes less xD
00:42 < xrothx> deen:  400€/month
00:42 < xrothx> what capacities? 
00:43 <@deen> xrothx: low ping, good ddos protection, 4 cores
00:44 < xrothx> I will have a good one
00:45 <@deen> where from?
00:45 < xrothx> http://www.soyoustart.com/ie/betas/game-servers/
00:45 < xrothx> :)
00:45 < xrothx> ovh powered
00:45 <@deen> you know they run for 14 days and then they get shutdown?
00:45 < xrothx> yup
00:45 < xrothx> -Beta
00:46 < xrothx> will be released one of those days/weeks
00:46 <@deen> yes, they keep pushing the end of the betaphase for the last year
00:46 <@deen> always pushing by 1 month
00:46 < xrothx> :p
00:46 <@deen> also, it's in france, so ping is bad
00:46 < xrothx> ok..
00:46 < xrothx> notting is good for you :P ^^
00:46 <@deen> :P
00:46 <@deen> i just get a loooot of complaints from people
00:47 <@deen> and try to make it perfect
00:47 < xrothx> my webinterface should become a cloud of a lot ddos protected servers
00:47 < xrothx> So when 1 server isn't good anymore for a moment, will jump to another one
00:47 <@deen> and the gamestate?
00:48 <@deen> how does a client just jump to another server?
00:48 < savander_androi> Like save
00:48 < savander_androi> Maybe
00:48 <@deen> players won't understand that
00:48 < savander_androi> But , automatically?
00:49 < savander_androi> Bht
00:49 <@deen> players don't use the modified client that's necessary for that
00:49 < savander_androi> Its imposdible to connect
00:49 < savander_androi> To anotger server
00:50 < savander_androi> Server cant do that?
00:50 < xrothx> deen:  I know, I mean the server will restart ofcourse
00:50 < savander_androi> (teeworlds server, force disconnect and connect to another one)
00:50 < xrothx> But the thing is, the downtime will be a couple seconds 
00:51 <@deen> xrothx: for ddrace that's terrible, since players lose their hour of hard work
00:51 <@deen> savander_androi: no, can't
00:51 < savander_androi> Meh
00:52 < savander_androi> It would be awesome
00:52 < savander_androi> Heh.. :p
00:53 <@deen> you all with your crazy ideas!
00:53 < savander_androi> XD
00:54 < savander_androi> Proxy server
00:54 < savander_androi> Balance usage
00:54 <@deen> why not just the easy way?!
00:54 < savander_androi> Yol
00:54 <@deen> get 1 good ddos protected server, run everything there
00:55 < savander_androi> Easy way is harder to devising
00:55 < savander_androi> Nvm
00:55 < savander_androi> Ye but good protected server is expensive
00:55 < savander_androi> We should ask google !
00:56 < savander_androi> Maybe they want to host
00:56 < savander_androi> Teeworlds servers
00:56 < savander_androi> For free xD
00:56 <@deen> sure, they would love that
00:56 < xrothx> lmao
00:56 <@deen> "Server sponsored by Google"
00:56 < xrothx> deen:  admit it, its the best option
00:56 < savander_androi> Yea xD
00:56 < savander_androi> Lol
00:56 < savander_androi> Lets send
00:56 < savander_androi> Email
00:56 < savander_androi> Or come into
00:57 < savander_androi> Mountain view
00:57 < savander_androi> Place
00:57 <@deen> i tried useless mails like that already, you guys do it
00:57 < savander_androi> Ye
00:57 < savander_androi> Brb
00:57 < savander_androi> :pp
00:58 < xrothx> deen:  Its a good idea, when user can select for example a prefer list of 3 servers
00:58 < xrothx> depending on their location and the one of their players
00:58 < savander_androi> You cab
00:58 < savander_androi> Can
00:58 < savander_androi> XD
00:58 < savander_androi> More than 3
00:59 < savander_androi> But its not automatically
00:59 < savander_androi> Just connect to one of ddnet servers
01:00 < savanderlol> You can select the best one
01:00 < savanderlol> Wtf
01:00 < savanderlol> Tineout
01:00 < savanderlol> Stupid app ._.
01:00 < xrothx> it would get just 3 servers in prefer list
01:01 < savanderlol> Meg
01:01 < savanderlol> Ill host ddnet in.my home
01:01 < savanderlol> The best ddos protection
01:01 < savanderlol> ._.
01:02 <@deen> some more realistic locations to expand: brasil + australia
01:02 < savanderlol> In my cigy
01:02 <@deen> brasil has a few players, maybe it could grow
01:02 < savanderlol> We have datacenter
01:02 < savanderlol> With 30gb
01:02 < savanderlol> Port ._.
01:03 <@deen> nice =)
01:03 < savanderlol> Up\down
01:03 < savanderlol> Its small city
01:03 < savanderlol> Xd
01:03 < savanderlol> My school
01:03 < savanderlol> Got permission
01:03 < savanderlol> To use those servers
01:04 < savanderlol> Lol
01:04 < savanderlol> Datacenter is near to my school
01:04 <@deen> savanderlol: zcatch servers should be running =)
01:04 < savanderlol> Yay !:3
01:04 < savanderlol> Go on server
01:04 < savanderlol> And try
01:04 <@deen> i am
01:05 <@deen>  /rank and /top5 work
01:05 < savanderlol> Yea
01:05 < savanderlol> :D
01:05 < savanderlol> How many records?
01:05 <@deen> 1181
01:05 < savanderlol> ;pp
01:05 <@deen> Marceel is first
01:05 < savanderlol> Woah :o
01:05 < savanderlol> Ye
01:05 <@deen> you need to fix some grammar
01:05 < savanderlol> Witg 70+
01:05 <@deen> "Marceel's have 72 wins"
01:05 <@deen> should be "Marceel has 72 wins"
01:05 < savanderlol> Ye, im shity
01:05 < savanderlol> In english
01:05 < savanderlol> :///
01:06 <@deen> not that important
01:06 <@deen> now we need to get players back on the server
01:06 < savanderlol> Youp
01:06 < savanderlol> Ill rerun servers
01:06 < savanderlol> With name
01:07 <@deen> I'm making some advertisement on ddnet servers and in client
01:07 < savanderlol> "we changed ip address"
01:07 < savanderlol> Or smth
01:11 < savanderlol> If you want, you can change gamemode on another zcatch servers too ^^
01:11 < savanderlol> In chila, etc
01:11 <@deen> hmmm
01:11 <@deen> let's see how the german one works, then maybe
01:11 < savanderlol> Yee
01:11 < savanderlol> :)
01:11 <@deen> you can ask the players in chile what they think about it
01:12 <@deen> if you speak spanish :P
01:12 < savanderlol> Ofc.i can
01:12 < savanderlol> You didnt know?:[
01:12 <@deen> nope
01:12 < savanderlol> :[
01:13 <@deen> i like the setup you have with the configs and directories, very tidy
01:16 < savanderlol> :)
01:16 < savanderlol> Easy to edit
01:16 < savanderlol> News.cfg the besy
01:16 < savanderlol> Best*

01:52 <@deen> so much evil on blocker servers. they have a lot of new bots
01:53 <@deen> for example: aimbot, flybot, balancebot, recording other players' movement and replaying it, automatically lasering yourself, ...
01:55 <@deen> the guy who wrote this wants money to add a bot detection to ddnet server now^^
02:14 <@deen> if anyone wants to test ddos protection, i have 3 guys on the blocker server threatening to ddos us now...

03:06 < Teetime> nice :)
03:07 < Teetime> btw deen, do you know if this is legit c code?
03:07 < Teetime> http://ideone.com/j1inOQ
03:07 < Teetime> it compiles at least
03:08 <@deen> looks ok. why?
03:08 < Teetime> i'm trying to build mysql with bam and thus i need to check if some functions exist
03:19 <@heinrich5991> Teetime: apart from a missing \n in the printf, everything is ok
03:20 < Teetime> heinrich5991: thanks
08:40 < hannibal> morrrr
08:40 < hannibal> ning
08:40 < hannibal> :D
08:48 <@EastByte> hello hannibal 
08:49 < hannibal> friday <3 weekend :) i need it so bad.
08:53 <@EastByte> I still have holidays :)
08:55 < hannibal> oh. feel my jealousy :D
08:56 <@EastByte> I do.. it feels soo good :)
08:56 < hannibal> ;D 
09:00 < hannibal> just listening to "lissie - in sleep (live version)" wow is it good!
09:13 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
09:14 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
10:32 < savanderlol> :)
11:04 < xrothx> deen: 
11:10 <@deen> xrothx: yes?
11:13 < xrothx> do you have a moment? could you create a test server? 
11:15 <@deen> yes, what for?
11:15 < xrothx> I made a new version of royal
11:15 < xrothx> Would like to test it 
11:15 < xrothx> (secured with pw)
11:21 <@deen> i hope you're adding music
11:36 < xrothx> How? :D
11:36 <@deen> with the new sound feature!
11:36 < xrothx> Problem with music is there will always be  players that do not like it
11:37 <@EastByte> then add other cool stuff
11:37 <@EastByte> like a bathroom with a toilet flush sound
11:37 <@deen> haha
11:37 < xrothx> EastByte:  I try :)
11:37 < xrothx> Should find somebody that can work with envelopes :D
11:37 < hannibal> yes and for example "daft punk - around the world" in a club-setting. who doesn't like this song?
11:38 < hannibal> you just get in the club mood when you hear it _D
11:38 < xrothx> :p
11:38 < xrothx> Can it be limited to a certain part of the map? 
11:38 < xrothx> like tiles for start song 1
11:38 < hannibal> yes
11:38 < xrothx> and stop song 1
11:38 < xrothx> nice!
11:38 < hannibal> you just hear the sound when you are near the sound tile
11:39 < hannibal> it gets louder as you move closer
11:40 < laxadedi> Boah, tomorrow, germany here I come !
11:40 <@EastByte> it's not a tile, just a "sound source object" :)
11:41 <@EastByte> laxadedi: nice
11:41 < laxadedi> EastByte: I have a good plan for you !
11:41 < laxadedi> if you have a smartphone only
11:41 <@EastByte> yea I have
11:41 < laxadedi> Nice
11:41 < laxadedi> then
11:41 < xrothx> deen:  logged out by pw change? 
11:41 <@EastByte> but I can't come to Koeln
11:41 < laxadedi> If you wanna find a girl
11:41 < laxadedi> you might consider using the app called "Tinder"
11:41 <@EastByte> I usually don't use apps like that
11:42 < hannibal> tinder is kinda boring :D
11:42 < laxadedi> Well, if you wanna meet (or fuck) girls, it's an easy way :D
11:42 <@deen> xrothx: huh?
11:42 < laxadedi> I might even consider buying a smartphone just to use that app
11:43 <@EastByte> oh lol
11:43 < xrothx> deen:  I got logged out due to change pw
11:43 <@deen> yeah, but what did you do?
11:43 <@deen> did you change the pw or what?
11:43 < laxadedi> EastByte: try that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCmuhmGDC48

13:06 < Meow_> it sounds like im coding, huehuehue
13:07 < hannibal> that can also be a bad thing
13:07 < Meow_> in which case
13:07 < hannibal> you're tempted to be lazy. and being lazy is cool while you're at it. but when you go come and you did nothing the whole day
13:07 < hannibal> you'll feel bad
13:07 < hannibal> home*
13:08 < hannibal> well it is like that for me
13:08 < Meow_> that might be true, but im not going to do nothing the whole day, ill just sit around maybe for 1 hour,
13:08 < hannibal> i feel like shit when i spent the whole day chatting and surfing :D
13:08 < hannibal> ok if you can do this
13:08 < hannibal> then good
13:08 < Meow_> especially because i already did work
13:08 < Meow_> earlier today
13:08 < Meow_> :p
13:08 < hannibal> oh, then, 10min surfing as a reward
13:08 < hannibal> feels great :D
13:09 < hannibal> or 20
13:09 < Meow_> yeah
13:10 < Meow_> i'd really appreciate it if our firewall would not block the port teeworlds is using
13:10 < Meow_> :(
13:10 < Meow_> but i have to be glad, i think if it were not blocked, i never would work
13:10 < hannibal> !
13:10 < Meow_> xD
13:10 < hannibal> thank god for this :D

13:49 <@deen> xrothx: usually a tester
13:51 < Savander> but, yey
13:51 < Savander> zcatch on ddnet work :>>
13:53 <@EastByte> yea, not bad
14:00 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/zcatchddnet.webm
14:00 <@EastByte> so pro
14:01 <@EastByte> east is like BAAAAM
14:01 <@EastByte> and the others like "uurrgghhh"
14:01 <@EastByte> :>
14:02 < Savander> wowo EastByte  :3
14:04 <@deen> cool server, Savander 
14:04 <@deen> lots of activity already
14:04 < Savander> ^^
14:04 < Savander> i think, it's because news? :)
14:04 < Savander> btw, i should add ./cmdlist
14:05 < Savander> because 
14:05 < Savander> people don't know what commands are on server
14:05 < Savander> btw, you should check
14:05 < Savander> ctf5_e
14:06 < Savander> map by ELITE
14:06 < Savander> :D, look gooood
14:06 < Meow_> zcatch with rifle or nade?
14:07 < Savander> grenade
14:07 < Meow_> i'll join after work :3
14:07 < Savander> ^^
14:08 <@deen> Savander: how to set gametype rifle?
14:08 <@EastByte> *pst* we don't need rifle
14:08 <@deen> =(
14:08 <@EastByte> =)
14:08 <@deen> i need!

14:17 < hannibal> laser zcatch is awesome, too!
14:18 <@deen> just made 2 laser servers
14:19 <@deen> Savander: if i want to run the zcatch servers in other countries, i should do separate databases, right?
14:20 < Savander> don't know, it can be like on ddnet, but i think, more work?
14:20 <@deen> i think it's not fair
14:20 < Savander> why?
14:21 <@deen> imagine that players in chile are much worse (i don't know if they are)
14:21 <@deen> then you could go on chile, kill all and get many points
14:21 <@deen> wins*
14:21 <@deen> and it's easier than the same wins on GER
14:21 < Savander> on ger more players? Don't know, win only adds score when you have more than 5 players on servers.
14:22 <@deen> hmmmmm
14:22 < Savander> but with bigger Ping, you're worse too.
14:22 <@deen> you know, with ddrace, it's the same no matter where you play
14:22 <@deen> the maps are always the same
14:22 <@deen> but for zcatch the enemies count, so i think global rankings are unfair
14:23 < Savander> hmm
14:23 < Savander> so maybe ye, spereate databases
14:23 < Savander> seperate*
14:23 <@deen> but same database for grenade and laser?^^
14:24 <@deen> or should we maybe just add votes for each gametype?
14:24 < Savander> hm xDD
14:24 < Savander> or maybe i can add 
14:24 < Savander> new row 
14:24 < Savander> "gametype"?
14:25 <@deen> i don't think that's a good idea =/
14:26 < Savander> hmm
14:27 < Savander> so not :D, just thinking :)
14:27 < Savander> btw, maybe we should
14:27 < Savander> restart database?
14:27 < Savander> because it's from ddforce? or it doesn't matter?:D
14:27 <@deen> i don't know. your decision
14:27 < Savander> but first, maybe we should add vote
14:28 < Savander> to change gametype
14:28 < Savander> laser/zcatch
14:28 < Savander>  grenade/zcatch
14:29 <@deen> and even more?^^
14:30 < Savander> don't know :D
14:31 <@deen> Let's just add a vote for each option and see what players play?
14:31 < Savander> ye
14:31 <@deen> good
14:31 <@deen> i'll do that now
14:31 < Savander> okay
14:31 < Savander> and now, fifo console would be awesome xD
14:31 < Savander> haha
14:32 <@deen> i have fifo console only for ddnet mod
14:32 <@deen> don't need it for others
14:32 < BeaR> 'console' :>
14:32 <@deen> ^^
14:32 <@deen> fifo input
14:33 < Savander> tsiiiii
14:33 <@deen> i use tail -f logfile for output :P
14:33 <@deen> How to call the server names for each mode?
14:34 <@deen> DDNet GER - zCatch Laser Pro?
14:34 < Savander> DDNet GER - zCatch Hammer Pro
14:34 < Savander> haha Ok, hmm
14:36 <@deen> to switch mode can i just set sv_mode or do i need to reload map?
14:36 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zcatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/gamemodes/zcatch.cpp#L20-L29
14:36 < Savander> dont know how to
14:36 <@deen> ok, good
14:37 < Savander> but i think yes
14:39 < Savander> btw, votes looks bad
14:39 <@deen> yes, i'm fixing
14:43 < Meow_> did you guys learn c++ while experimenting on tw src or before that
14:43 <@deen> before
14:44 < BeaR> you dont learn c++, you try to understand a small subset :>
14:44 <@EastByte> hm learning the language itself is not the problem I think
14:45 <@EastByte> actually I learned C before and did some C++ experimenting with tw
14:47 <@deen> Savander: any more complaints with the config or is it fine now?
14:47 <@deen> I'd like to copy it over to other countries now
14:47 <@heinrich5991> Meow_: I knew some C++ before teeworlds, but learned a lot till the present day
14:47 < Savander> in news.cfg
14:47 < Savander> i forgot to add one 
14:47 < Savander> |
14:47 < Savander> before "by {E}{L}{I}{T}{E}
14:47 < Savander> and it looks bad :P
14:50 < BeaR> why no fancy animations in the server name :D
14:50 <@deen> because we disabled them in ddnet client :P
14:50 < Savander> btw deen 
14:50 <@deen> i hope i didn't scare nuborn off when i disabled his weapons prediction feature again =/
14:50 < Savander> look ino autorecord folder
14:50 <@deen> some people say they really need it, hope he can fix it
14:50 < Savander> because on my server i had a lot of demos from zctach :/
14:51 <@deen> i see no autorecord folder :P
14:51 < Savander> and i disabled this function!
14:51 < Savander> ok
14:51 < Savander> D:
14:51 < Savander> in .teeworlds?
14:51 < Savander> xD
14:51 <@deen> empty as well
14:51 <@deen> all is good =)

14:52 <@deen> now your mod comes to usa, chile and south africa =)
14:52 < Savander> yay
14:52 < Savander> ^^
14:52 < Savander> we can add someday
14:53 < Savander> show ranking of website, <hehe>
15:03 < Learath2> Meow_: "learned" C++ while reading the tw code
15:04 < Learath2> late answer is b/c I came home and your color standed out in all the other messages :D
15:09 <@deen> Savander: they should be running now
15:09 < Savander> nice :))
15:11 < Meow_> i had to consult customers, im back now
15:12 < Meow_> i want to learn c++, i never did something with before but im familiar with programming in general
15:13 < Savander> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/34e568f41bbe7a487535d368142e5607d70bf07b
15:13 < Savander> you did something more?
15:13 < Savander> ah ye, whisper
15:13 <@deen> Savander: i probably fixed it a few times^^
15:13 < Learath2> Meow_: well in that case I would go thru the basics of syntax first as you are already familiar with programming
15:13 <@deen> it might be better to get it out of the source than look at the commits
15:14 <@deen> Savander: I'll try to fix some english spelling and grammar in the source now
15:14 < Savander> okay
15:14 < Savander> thanks ! :))
15:15 <@deen> Chile players would probably not notice, but USA^^
15:15 <@deen> In Chile they play zcatch every day, curious how they will like the ranks
15:15 <@deen> and other features, like release
15:16 < Savander> :)
15:16 < Savander> respawn protection
15:16 < Savander> too
15:16 < Savander> :PP
15:16 < Savander> i added you to "Collaborators"
15:16 < Savander> so maybe, you can make commits?
15:16 <@deen> i see
15:18 < Meow_> Learning just the syntax will'nt be enough for being able to modify tw src imo, there are a few concepts in cpp i never saw in other languages like java before
15:19 < Meow_> multiple inheritance, the way you prototype your methods, vars etc
15:19 <@deen> i don't think you need that for teeworlds
15:20 < Learath2> syntax is a good starting point and most the complex stuff isnt in tw
15:20 < Meow_> oh, good to know
15:20 <@deen> Teeworlds looks mostly like C with C++ classes to me
15:20 < Meow_> never peek'd into the source
15:20 < Learath2> Tw was converted from C so is quite simple
15:21 < Meow_> alright, in this case im realy motivated to spend all my ideas to the tw community
15:21 < Meow_> :)
15:21 < Savander> wtf
15:21 < Avarone> hi
15:21 < Meow_> hi
15:22 < Learath2> Meow_: I am generally around if at anypoint you feel lost in the code could give you a hand
15:22 < Savander> hi
15:22 < Savander> don't understand
15:23 < Meow_> thanks learath2
15:23 < Avarone> savi ddmax down?
15:23 < Savander> Avaron, ye
15:23 < Savander> https://github.com/Teelevision/zcatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L530-L536
15:23 < Learath2> ddmax was down for quite some time now
15:24 < Savander> GetNextInfoText() its virtual function
15:24 < Meow_> @lea any recommendations for c++ references? 
15:26 < Meow_> i heard so far just positive feedback to this one -> http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
15:26 <@deen> Savander: i pushed it, hope it's fine for you: https://github.com/savander/zcatch/commit/06e12799b82d9eda6cc6f998821d71eccb64087b
15:27 < Savander> ye, thanks deen :)
15:27 <@deen> afk a bit now
15:27 < Savander> i found info messager
15:27 < Savander> but don't know how to use it :DD
15:27 < Learath2> Meow_: when i need to lookup things about the STL I use http://en.cppreference.com/ as a referance
15:28 < Learath2> but its by no means a tutorial
15:28 < Savander> oh
15:28 < Savander> i see
15:29 < Meow_> i know the difference between reference and tutorial, but thanks for the link. i think its good for me to start with the basics
15:30 < Learath2> Meow_: the link you sent is a nice place to start with the basics
15:31 < laxadedi> Meow_: meowwwwwwwwww
15:31 < Meow_> laxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
15:32 < laxadedi> you have skype at work meow ?
15:32 < Meow_> neither skype nor a headset
15:32 < Meow_> hahah
15:33 < laxadedi> Too bad ;9
15:33 < Meow_> :<
15:33 < Meow_> just 2,5 hours remaining
15:33 < laxadedi> 1.5 for me :p
15:33 < laxadedi> I am at school today
15:33 < Meow_> @Lea which IDE is recommendable for developing cpp?
15:34 < laxadedi> On which OS ?
15:34 < Meow_> win
15:34 < laxadedi> VS
15:34 < laxadedi> there is another one
15:34 < Meow_> which version?
15:34 < laxadedi> I forgot his name
15:34 < laxadedi> VS 2013 I guess
15:34 < laxadedi> codeblocks ?
15:34 < laxadedi> not sure if it's a compiler
15:34 < Meow_> i know codeblocks and dev++
15:34 < Meow_> you could download mingw compiler suit 
15:35 < laxadedi> Well, VS 2013 is good for it I think
15:35 < Learath2> Meow_: I do it with MinGW plus Sublime Text
15:35 < laxadedi> I never did C++ outside of linux, and I forgot everything :p
15:35 < Learath2> I don't like to go thru the pain of downloading 10GB Visual Studio with its fancy includes that ruin everything
15:36 < Meow_> i think vs is an overhead
15:36 < Meow_> does the vs13 compiler supports managed c++ ? i thought this ide was created by M$ only for C++/CLI purposes
15:36 < laxadedi> I have no clue
15:36 < Meow_> thanks bro, your the best consultant
15:36 < laxadedi> Going to smoke, afk 10 minuts
15:36 < laxadedi> Yeah, I do C# man, not C++
15:37 < laxadedi> And I am still a noob at it
15:37 < Meow_> everyone started being a noob so no problem
15:37 < Meow_> i would'nt call myself programmer pro
15:37 < Learath2> eeeeeh VS is of no use it just slowed me down so i nuked it 
15:37 < Meow_> k i think about codeblocks
15:38 < Meow_> but the intelliSense feature in VS is very lovely
15:38 < Learath2> doesn't work as seamlessly as advertised :D
15:38 <@heinrich5991> to me VS > codeblocks
15:38 < Learath2> I think I tried eclipse before too
15:38 <@heinrich5991> it has that autocompletion and most importantly: a very good debugging interface
15:39 <@EastByte> vs has autocompletion?
15:39 < Learath2> good luck making a project file for tw in VS
15:39 < o_be_one> hello
15:39 < BeaR> clang also works on windows (:
15:40 < Meow_> East -> its name IntelliSense
15:41 < Learath2> I'd say either get VS or use a text editor you love + a compiler
15:41 < Meow_> in this case notepad++
15:41 < Meow_> :<
15:41 < Meow_> :>*
15:41 < Meow_> but im thinking about getting Vs, not sure tho
15:41 < Meow_> there are 2 hours i could think about
15:41 < Learath2> Notepad++ had some primitive completion afaik 
15:41 < Meow_> :B
15:42 < Meow_> yes, completion in notepad as worse as its possible
15:43 < Meow_> i have already installed codeblocks, so maybe i save the time for downloading vs and start with cb
15:44 < Savander> VIN
15:44 < Savander> Meow_:  are you on windows?
15:44 < Meow_> yes
15:44 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8937
15:45 < Savander> ^^
15:47 < Meow_> thanks men, i'll do this after work :d
15:48 < laxadedi> No
15:48 < laxadedi> We play cs Meow_ :p
15:48 < Savander> btw
15:49 < Savander> eclipse is for linux too
15:49 < laxadedi> Well, I don't know if I'll have much time tonight. Gotta prepare bagage, watch TBBT and two and half men and go to bed early for once :)
15:50 < Learath2> this cs game is a very addictive game 
15:50 < Learath2> friends got me hooked
15:50 <@deen> Learath2: "I don't like to go thru the pain of downloading 10GB Visual Studio with its fancy includes that ruin everything" Exactly!!!
15:51 < Meow_> laxadedi: of course we can play, there are no problems :) 
15:51 < Meow_> but first of all..
15:51 < laxadedi> deen: oh come on man, you have fiber optic :D
15:52 < Meow_> :((((
15:52 < Meow_> im jealous as hell
15:54 < Learath2> they told me I can get fiber optic lines as soon as fucking 2020 
15:54 < Learath2> how is that even soon
15:55 < Learath2> and rest of Turkey already has fiber optic lines everywhere
15:56 < Meow_> im going to move my house just to get better internet :j
15:57 <@deen> laxadedi: i don't have fiber optic, i have a cheap 30 year old copper cable
15:58 <@deen> laxadedi: i tried to install VS but stopped after half a day because it was annoying and took way too long
15:58 < laxadedi> Oh, I thought you had it
16:13 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

16:13 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
16:19 <@deen> Have to get the skins issue resolved in ddnet client: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=634
16:24 < Savander> woah..
16:25 <@deen> Aoe and others are spamming the forum right now...
16:26 <@EastByte> hm
16:29 <@EastByte> I kind of want specific players to have their own skin
16:29 <@EastByte> like top rank players
16:30 <@deen> but it's so annoying to keep that up to date
16:30 <@deen> and some people always feel like it's unfai
16:30 <@deen> r
16:30 <@deen> in my opinion we have way too many skins
16:31 <@EastByte> well it should be more dynamic then
16:31 <@EastByte> why is it unfair when pro players who invest a lot of time into ddnet have a reward?
16:32 <@deen> how to judge who's pro enough?
16:33 <@deen> they always show me a skin that's in, for a player that's worse than them
16:33 <@deen> so i have to remove that skin then, or what?
16:33 <@EastByte> the ones who are top ranked in tournaments
16:33 <@deen> try suggesting that and see what happens^^
16:33 <@deen> some pros are not playing in tournaments to give worse players a chance
16:33 <@deen> they wouldn't like that
16:34 < Savander> deen: m_ClientVersion is set somewhere?
16:34 <@deen> yes
16:34 <@deen> gamecontext.cpp:1416
16:37 < Savander> ahm
16:37 < Savander> so now i need to add MSG
16:37 < Savander> ese if (MsgID == NETMSGTYPE_CL_ISDDNET) xD
16:37 < Savander> ..
16:37 <@deen> yes
16:38 < Savander> it's in network.py?
16:39 <@deen> yes
16:39 <@deen> Cl_IsDDNet
16:39 <@deen> line 344
16:40 < Savander> ye i see :))
16:40 <@deen> EastByte: and Aoe is totally pissed now because he made money by making skins and promising people they would get into ddnet client
16:40 <@EastByte> meh
16:41 <@EastByte> not the best idea
16:41 <@deen> so it's no wonder that people start copying his skins for free
16:42 <@deen> I still haven't decided on the server for ddnet.tw
16:45 < Savander> deen: , for what is "ConWhisper() and ConConverse()" ?
16:45 < Savander> if it'll be never called
16:45 <@deen> Maybe just so it compiles^^
16:45 <@deen> i don't remember
16:51 < Savander> oh, maybe i added /w and /c
16:52 < laxadedi> deen: just remove all skins, let player do their own business
16:52 < laxadedi> think it's the best solution for everyone
16:53 < laxadedi> if you wanna please them
16:53 < laxadedi> make a skin database
16:53 < Savander> lol, hehe
16:53 < laxadedi> but don't include it on ddnet
16:53 < laxadedi> and if you don't like that suggestion, you can remove the "laxa" skin, I don't use it.
16:53 < Savander> i forgot to add #if defined(CONF_SQL)
16:54 < Savander> before ./top5 and ./rank
16:54 < Savander> :PP
16:54 < laxadedi> it's terrible idea to put personnal skins on a game release now that I really think of it
16:54 <@deen> laxadedi: yes, thanks
16:55 <@deen> we just need a few good skins
16:55 <@deen> and people take care with their skin packs
16:55 < laxadedi> standart ddrace skin pack is good
16:56 < Savander> okaaaY?
16:56 < laxadedi> I'll go back home now, I have to buy a Baguette for the little maggi for tomorrow :p
16:57 < Savander> deen: can you try join to DDForce.net test?
16:58 <@deen> Savander: Wrong version
16:58 < Savander> ye, but ehm
16:58 < Savander> :<
16:58 <@deen> Savander: you need to cheat the netversion
16:58 <@deen> ugly hack to keep compatibility =/
16:58 <@deen> maybe adding /w and /c is a bit complicated after all, haha
16:58 <@EastByte> ^^
16:59 <@deen> in ddnet source it's defined in version.h GAME_NETVERSION
17:05 < Savander> WOW
17:05 < Savander> works
17:05 < Savander> but i need to change smth lol
17:13 < Savander> Wow
17:13 < Savander> little problem
17:13 < Savander> xD
17:21 < Savander> deen:  added !<3 :D
17:22 <@deen> o_be_one: you there?
17:25 < Savander> shit ;-;
17:26 < Savander> don't know why, ( fetch github), but i replace your commit deen  :<
17:26 <@deen> oh no!
17:26 <@deen> you evil
17:26 < Savander> with grammar fixes
17:26 < Savander> :<<
17:31 < Meow_> a half hour and i can leave work <3
17:31 <@deen> i decided to go with Harmony Hosting I think
17:32 <@deen> they haven't been down since they had their problems back then
17:33 < Savander> deen:  you can later change mod, to newer :)) 
17:36 <@deen> only one problem with HH, somehow their anti-ddos is weird... Takes me 10 seconds to connect by ssh
17:37 < Savander> france hosting?
17:37 <@deen> yes
17:37 <@deen> but i want to use it for ddnet.tw website
17:38 < Savander> ahm
17:38 <@deen> i want a server that just keeps working for the next years and has some ddos protection
17:39 < Savander> only for websites?
17:39 <@deen> website, versionsrv, that kind of stuff
17:39 <@deen> but no game servers
17:41 < Savander> ah, okay. Cost of server???
17:41 < Savander> because i don't see xD
17:41 <@deen> 5 € per month
17:41 <@deen> https://www.harmony-hosting.com/panel/vps/order
17:42 < Savander> ah
17:42 <@deen> really cheap and cheap upgrades
17:42 <@deen> ping is too bad for game server
17:42 <@deen> doesn't matter for website i think
17:42 < Savander> can i test ping to you server?
17:42 <@deen> fra.ddnet.tw
17:43 < Savander> it's stay now?
17:43 < Savander> it*
17:43 <@deen> hm?
17:43 < Savander> website is on this new server?
17:43 <@deen> not yet
17:43 < Savander> but fra.ddnet.tw?
17:43 <@deen> now it is on ddnet.tw
17:44 <@deen> but i want to move to fra.ddnet.tw
17:44 < Savander> ah
17:44 < Savander> 35 ping ~~
17:44 <@deen> nice
17:44 < Savander> very stable ;o
17:45 <@deen> yeah, it's a good and cheap server
17:45 <@deen> but i'm not sure if the company will keep existing for long =/
17:45 < Savander> 40 packet send: min- 34 ping, max - 36
17:45 < Savander> ah
17:46 < Savander> Overselling
17:46 < Savander> it's new hosting?
17:46 <@deen> nope, not oversold
17:46 <@deen> i guess they're new, dunno
17:46 < Savander> now not overselling, but maybe later
17:46 < Savander> who knows..
17:46 <@deen> ^^
17:47 < Savander> in poland
17:47 < Savander> all hosting 
17:47 < Savander> has oversell
17:47 < Savander> polish shit :<.
17:47 <@deen> same in most countries
17:47 < Savander> BUT! We have too
17:47 < Savander> one  nice hosting
17:47 < Savander> hosteam.pl
17:47 < Savander> very good anit-ddos
17:48 < Savander> with really good servers
17:48 < Savander> but not cheap
17:48 < Savander> and servers are from poland :PP
18:06 <@deen> good that i test before deciding!
18:06 < Savander> Hoh?
18:06 <@deen> the ddos protection does crazy things on HH/fra.ddnet.tw
18:06 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/releases takes 1 second to load for me, http://fra.ddnet.tw/releases takes 17 seconds!
18:06 < Savander> for me
18:07 < Savander> 1 second on both
18:07 < Savander> :D
18:07 <@EastByte> same here
18:07 <@deen> yeah, i mde the ddos protection hate me by forcing reload a few times^^
18:07 < Savander> sorry
18:07 < Savander> worse on ddnet.tw
18:07 < Savander> xd
18:56 <@deen> EastByte, Savander does http://fra.ddnet.tw/releases load quickly for you when you use ctrl-f5?
18:56 < Savander> ye
18:56 <@EastByte> hm first load took over 10 second for me
18:56 <@deen> EastByte: see!!!
18:56 <@deen> that's the problem
18:57 <@deen> when multiple connections are opened from one ip, the ddos protection stops some of them
18:57 <@EastByte> that's silly
18:57 <@EastByte> do they not know http?
18:57 <@deen> when i download with wget -m -p -np http://fra.ddnet.tw/releases
18:57 <@deen> it works at full speed with no problems
18:57 <@deen> because wget just uses 1 connection
18:58 <@EastByte> I wonder whether it's ovh's fault or HH
18:58 <@deen> i think ovh
18:58 <@EastByte> maybe because of permanent mitigation
18:58 <@deen> i have problems like this with kimsufi as well when ddos protection is on
18:58 <@deen> yes, HH has permanent mitigation on
18:58 <@EastByte> hm
18:59 <@deen> My next choise are these servers then: https://www.kms-hosting.com/vserver/
18:59 <@deen> Only 1 TB traffic though
18:59 <@EastByte> try one of those cute classic vps :3
18:59 <@deen> EastByte: they only have 100 mbit/s, hmmm
18:59 <@EastByte> don't think that's a problem
18:59 <@deen> you're probably right
18:59 <@EastByte> images are mostly cached
19:00 <@deen> i'm thinking about download of new ddnet client
19:00 <@deen> could get saturated
19:00 <@EastByte> well could slow down a little bit
19:01 <@deen> KMS or OVH, hm
19:01 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/07_Nov-14-18_59.png
19:01 <@EastByte> this looks funny
19:01 <@deen> ehm yeah^^
19:01 <@deen> no php support, oops
19:02 <@EastByte> haha
19:03 <@deen> 2.40 € vps from OVH then?
19:04 <@deen> so oversold, i guess
19:04 <@EastByte> maybe
19:39 <@deen> I'masking HH whether they know anything about these issues caused by the ddos mitigation
19:39 <@deen> maybe something can be changed
19:40 < eeeee> can also cdn the website, cheapest one is $0.04 per GB of traffic
19:40 <@deen> i think that's overkill, but thanks
19:41 < o_be_one> deen ?
19:41 <@deen> o_be_one: yes!
19:41 < o_be_one> you asked for me ?
19:41 <@deen> o_be_one: you seem to know a bit about HH. will they keep existing for a few years?
19:42 < o_be_one> not sure about your question, you want to know if there will be here in some years ?
19:42 <@deen> yes
19:43 <@deen> most hosting companies only exist for a short time and then go bankrupt^^
19:45 < o_be_one> well the company is 4 years old
19:45 < o_be_one> so you can expect it will stays for a while
19:45 <@deen> ok, good enough. now i just need to get the ddos mitigation issues resolved
19:46 < o_be_one> with ovh its easyer to dont get bankrupt but you are agree to dont earn many money :/
19:46 < o_be_one> hope it will be ok for you
19:46 < o_be_one> i really want to work with you, but i think about that every days, every time
19:46 <@deen> o_be_one: i don't understand what you mean about ovh
19:46 < o_be_one> and the real thing is that i dont want to loose my r0x.fr identity on TeeWorlds
19:47 < o_be_one> HH use OVH DC and other services, you know no ?
19:47 <@deen> yes, i know
19:47 < o_be_one> so i just telling that working with ovh is an easyer way to earn a little money without problem
19:47 <@deen> ah, ok
19:47 <@deen> i don't know how we could work together, o_be_one. you have any suggestions?
19:49 < o_be_one> i dont know what is possible, i just want that players keep in mind that its r0x.fr network too, cause we are a true community to, but mainly in France
20:40 <@deen> huh, weird
20:41 <@deen> i restarted fra.ddnet.tw, now the ddos mitigation issues are gone, but instead ping is constantly 300^^
20:48 <@EastByte> haha, not for me
20:48 <@EastByte> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 76.561/81.892/87.082/4.755 ms
20:59 <@deen> love the ovh ddos protection...
21:12 < Savander> for me
21:12 < Savander> 40+ ping
21:13 <@deen> only icmp ping 300
21:13 <@deen> over udp normal 3
21:13 <@deen> 0
21:13 <@deen> 30*
22:18 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
