11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wanted to report a SteamDB bug but to get to their Discord I need a paid Steam account...
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If someone wants to join https://discord.com/invite/steamdb and report that the Players Trend on graph is broken since they switched to hourly player statistics (compared to the old 10 min interval)
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Example is the top chart in https://steamdb.info/app/412220/graphs/
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Android-Linux-Upstream-First
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> They use github: https://github.com/SteamDatabase
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> maybe you can get in touch with people there
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> or this email: defectiveturret@steamdb.info ^^
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Fair enough, opened a bug
15:05 <+randombit> yay!
15:05 <+randombit> heyho
15:05 <+randombit> can someone enlighten me how could i make a moving platform? (hookable - collision on that is a moving ground)
15:05 <+randombit> or not hookable
15:06 <+randombit> so, a moving collision-on platform. which moves. and u can stand on it. and moves u with it.
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> by coding or by mapping?
15:06 <+randombit> is it possible? i remember a map where there were moving freeze
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah its gores mod
15:07 <+randombit> well, i want to make a map in which there are moving platforms.
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ask qshar then :p
15:07 <+randombit> so, no possibility on standard DDNet map?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yep
15:08 <+randombit> so no
15:08 <+randombit> :D
15:08 <+randombit> too bad. it would be so awesome
15:09 <+randombit> wanted to make a moving boat which moves accross the ocean :D
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if you will not do any gameplay related things with this platform you can animate it kekw
15:13 <+randombit> oyea, i know.
15:13 <+randombit> but the tees then wouldnt be able to sit in it :D
15:13 <+randombit> they will drown :(
15:14 <+randombit> into the dephts of the ocean :D
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> why not?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> teeworlds supports parallax scrolling
15:19 <+randombit> but... i dont understand what you mean. i am literally talking about a moving platform in water, from which u can jum out or in. and water outside.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u could animate the water moving around a still boat
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you can create the illusion of driving a boat by making the boat static and adding a animated background and if you want to involve gameplay then you'd need to force the player to move into one direction using speeders
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> Q: what the point of `CCharacterCore m_ReckoningCore` in `CCharacter` if it just keeps updated
15:36 <+randombit> yea. but then there is no ocean. i was talking about an actual moving platform, while what u say is a fake one. it could be nice for an "Intro" though.
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Moving real platforms are only possible on kog servers
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Anyone used https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx so far?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Avolicious i know ppl in rust community like it a lot
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and dtolnay is the rust magician
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anything he does is bound to be good
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see this? 4 of these are from him xd
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/890649193704747008/unknown.png
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Ah I see ðŸ™‚
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar âœª do you happen to know a profiler with which I can figure out where my occasional 1 sec game freezes come from?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> watch gpu/cpu/ram/motherboard temperatures, cpu/gpu frequences and internet ping jitter
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and make sure your PSU is good enough
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1 sec delay is pretty long, could possibly be HDD or smth, maybe disable all demo features
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> unplug usb stuff
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in the realm of profiling you can try perf on linux, it can collect data to a ring buffer which you can send a signal to save right after the freeze happens
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can perf regonize lags outside of the program? e.g. if the instance is suspended for whatever reason?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd start it with strace, would tell if it's some syscall blocking, like reading from disk or usb access
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> strace has quite some performance overhead
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But a 1 second delay should be recognizable
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Heh, the strace man page even lists under BUGS: `A traced process runs slowly (but check out the --seccomp-bpf option).`
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh good to know i tested it, from perf looks similar to the sanitizers, so ok
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `getpid()                                = 108924`
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only suspicious for me
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is that suspicious?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> too high? I think most distros enable high PIDs
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah its the value?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thought its the number of calls
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it's the returned PID
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, in strace at least
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i used -n now, i hope thats  the real count
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or maybe -T is useful
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess i need to search the internet xd
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> -n is to print the number instead of the name of the syscall?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the help isnt really exact
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the typical feature of -n
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> print syscall number
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also exists for iptables etc.
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, well thats not intuitive to me, but yeah
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> -c soudns like what you want
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but with -T?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> without time spent it sounds rather useless
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> -T is for individual calls, I think
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah that looks nice xd
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```

23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Patiga maybe try that
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this only gives a summary of the whole process, no?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think Patiga is looking for something like "the last 3 seconds"
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how often it happens but usecs/call must shoot up eventually
