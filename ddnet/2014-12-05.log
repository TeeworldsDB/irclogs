00:03 < Maple> i dont get it
00:03 < Maple> no one tries to beat any of my hall of fame records
00:05 < laxa> it's because you are too good :(
00:19 < Maple> xD 
02:50 <@deen> damn, some people are faster than me. found a segfault,but was reported a few hours ago
07:25 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
07:26 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
09:49 <@EastByte> deen: hehe
12:13 <@deen> hm, i'm trying to tcpreplay my tcpdumps, but the ddnet server doesn't like them
12:29 <@deen> ah, i just forgot to record the first 3 packets^^
12:29 < laxadedi> deen: 100 subscribers on youtube channel !
12:29 <@deen> now it works!
12:29 <@deen> hi laxadedi, nice!
12:30 <@deen> youtube offered me a custom channel name, not sure what that's supposed to mean
12:30 <@deen> for my s3c0nd channel, not the hall of fame
12:31 <@deen> "Good news: You're now eligible for a unique [1]Google custom name that let you easily point people to your YouTube channel and Google+ profile. Here's what we've reserved for you: youtube.com/c/DdnetTw"
12:32 <@deen> would make more sense for the hall of fame though, since I don't use that channel at all
12:40 < laxadedi> I had that too
12:40 < laxadedi> but I don't care
12:40 < laxadedi> you could already do it I think
13:43 <@deen> hi BeaR 
13:44 < BeaR> hey
13:44 <@deen> BeaR: nice that loading and saving works, i should test
13:44 <@deen> and maybe soon release new client
13:46 <@deen> BeaR: hm, are you sure it works?
13:46 <@deen> i don't see the layers anymore
13:46 <@deen> aaah
13:46 <@deen> it's not supported yet, got you
13:56 < BeaR> yeah, you have to add support for the old maplayers
13:58 < BeaR> sth like this, which I added for bezier splines: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/editor/io.cpp#L463
14:04 <@deen> Could you add it for map sounds as well? I would probably do something wrong if I tried to fix the maps by hand
14:04 < BeaR> hm sure
14:14 <@deen> now primitively fuzzing ddnet server with network packets
14:15 <@deen> about 100 connections per second
14:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: if you find a bug with that, I'd be impressed!
14:16 <@heinrich5991> (in the server code, via network)
14:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: the whole thing is inspired by the bug that caused 0.6.3 release
14:18 <@deen> it would've been found with this primitive fuzzing
14:18 <@heinrich5991> have you tried whether it's found?
14:19 <@deen> nope, looking for new bugs first, sounds more exciting
14:23 <@deen> would be much more efficient if I could get the instrumentation output from DDNet-Server to AFL
14:24 <@heinrich5991> then that statement is unwarranted though ("would've been found by primitive fuzzing")
14:24 <@deen> heinrich5991: I mean it's just a flipped bit
14:24 <@deen> and the fuzzer is flipping every single bit right now
14:24 <@heinrich5991> ah ok
14:25 <@deen> would still be a good idea to actually check that it works
14:26 <@deen> if i find nothing else I'll do that
14:39 < BeaR> hm Ama created one huge sound source in Spooky?
14:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #114: Add editor compatibility with sound layers from older maps (DDRace64...pr_compatibility) http://git.io/FGIKWg
14:48  * BeaR tries to implement a variant datatype in C++...
14:50 <@heinrich5991> BeaR: usually done with a tagged union
14:51 < BeaR> well yeah but still need some meta template magic :D
14:51 <@heinrich5991> struct { int type; union { TypeA type_a; TypeB type_b; ... }
14:51 <@heinrich5991> oh, you want it to be not ad-hoc
14:51 < BeaR> no via variadic templates
14:51 < BeaR> template<typename Ts...> class variant { ... };
14:52 < Savander> hi
14:52 < BeaR> hi
15:18 < o_be_one> hi all :)

16:12 < Nimda> Lawrence by Themix just released on Solo at 2014-12-05 16:07
16:21 < Learath2> deen: you areound ?
16:21 <@deen> Learath2: hi
16:22 < Learath2> as you used json parser before can you check https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/tree/autoupdateinc
16:22 < Learath2> engine/client/autoupdate.cpp ParseUpdate()
16:22 <@deen> No, I haven't used json parser before^^
16:22 < Learath2> eww 
16:22 <@deen> that was EastByte 
16:22 < Learath2> just need to get the json part compiling and it should all work
16:23 <@deen> ah, ok
16:23 < Learath2> mine looks like a bit of a mess too :P will get rid of std stuff later
16:26 <@deen> so you want help getting it to compile?
16:28 < BeaR> "This branch is 2834 commits ahead, 481 commits behind teeworlds:master" lul
16:30 < Learath2> deen: would be really appreciated
16:30 < Learath2> thats not the latest state tho
16:30 < Learath2> let me push it up again
16:31 <@deen> ok
16:32 < Learath2> really hope noone pulled that had to force push it 
16:34 < BeaR> OHMIGODITWERKZ
16:34 < BeaR> best debug messages
16:36 < Learath2> :D
16:37 < Learath2> BeaR: should have seen the way i debugged kerning
16:37 < BeaR> :D
16:37 < BeaR> does this already work?
16:37 < BeaR> the autoupdater
16:37 < Learath2> doesnt even compile yet 
16:37 < BeaR> ah
16:37 < Learath2> couldnt really figure out  how json works
16:38 < Learath2> from what i read from json.h this should work but :/
16:38 <@deen> Learath2: fixed =)
16:38 <@deen> autoupdate.cpp:106
16:38 <@deen>                         for(int j = 0; j < json_array_length(&pVersions[i]["download"]); j++)
16:38 < Learath2> i think i need to link the ui with it call IAutoUpdate::Update() from somewhere within client
16:38 < BeaR> you mixed the different ways to handle :D
16:39 <@deen> and autoupdate.cpp:108
16:39 <@deen>                         for(int j = 0; j < json_array_length(&pVersions[i]["remove"]); j++)
16:39 <@deen> now it compiles
16:40 < Learath2> well obv SIGSEGVs so dont even try :D
16:40 <@deen> hm?
16:41 < Learath2> well there is no way its in working condition Init() is empty and Update() isnt called from anywhere
16:41 <@deen> ok
16:41 < BeaR> l25: str_copy(pUpdate->m_Status, pDest, sizeof(pUpdate->m_Status));
16:41 <@deen> sounded different before^^ "16:22 < Learath2> just need to get the json part compiling and it should all work"
16:42 < Learath2> oh yeah it should all work just isnt tied to the client yet :D
16:42 <@deen> ok^^
16:42 < BeaR> poor windows user cant compile ofc ):
16:43 < Learath2> BeaR: does compile under windows 
16:43 < BeaR> hm missing lib
16:43 <@deen> what lib? json?
16:43 < BeaR> curl.lib
16:44 < Learath2> did you try bam config first ?
16:44 < BeaR> Compiled from clean repo (:
16:44 < BeaR> well there is no curl.lib. You added it?
16:45 < Learath2> oh msvc needs curl.lib ?
16:45 < BeaR> sure :D
16:45 < BeaR> cuz visual studio is too lazy to generate it from the dll
16:45 < Learath2> :D been compiling from mingw didnt notice
16:46 < Learath2> will add a curl.lib
16:46 < BeaR> (:
16:46 < Learath2> any idea where i can call my Update() function from ?
16:47 < BeaR> what does it do?
16:47 < Learath2> checks if the manifest file is done downloading before continuing
16:48 < BeaR> hm would put it in the main client loop
16:48 < Learath2> really dont like that solution but couldnt figure out something better without blocking the client
16:54 <@deen> threads everywhere?
16:55 < Learath2> can do that too but meh
17:02 <@EastByte> use the tw job handler?
17:02 <@deen> I think I'll release the new client
17:02 <@deen> any complaints?

20:01 < o_be_one> hey Maple :D
20:01 < o_be_one> nice shot with skeith ^^
20:01 < Maple> heylo
20:02 < Maple> meh i hate him
20:04 < o_be_one> why u played with him so Maple ?
20:05 < Maple> cause no one else could
20:05 < Maple> veri sad stori
21:06 < Nicos> For all testers of ddnet: there is a new map in map testing
23:19 <@deen> we could make teleporters predicted
23:20 <@deen> when there is only 1 destination tele
23:20 <@deen> any opinions?
23:31 <@EastByte> is it easy to implement?
23:32 <@deen> i don't know^^
23:32 <@deen> I've not implemented any of the prediction stuff
23:33 <@EastByte> hm I don't think it's neccessary
23:34 <@EastByte> afaik mostly checkpoint are being used
23:34 <@deen> ah yeah, also wouldn't work with checkpoints
23:35 <@EastByte> but we could disable the tees prediction when it enters a teleporter
23:35 <@EastByte> so it doesnt float through the air
23:35 <@EastByte> well that was my solution for the freeze prediction aswell...
23:43 <@deen> no one liked freeze prediction =/
23:44 <@EastByte> doesn't look buggy enough :P
