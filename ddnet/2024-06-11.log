00:05 <+bridge> <teero777> Nah you are superhuman anywas
00:05 <+bridge> <teero777> I will :D
00:06 <+bridge> <teero777> Just so if you crash you know you're not alonr
00:06 <+bridge> <teero777> Just so if you crash you know you're not alone
00:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
00:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> sweet
01:14 <+bridge> <learath2> Someone should rewrite the zcatch mod, it's ancient and it needs like an entire restart to change weapons
01:36 <+bridge> <zhn> based on which one you joined to
01:37 <+bridge> <zhn> jxsls version is nice
01:55 <+bridge> <learath2> The one we host is very dated, it also needs an antibot implant
02:09 <+bridge> <louis> add in a team grenade vs team laser mode
02:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
03:05 <+bridge> <totar> Wouldn't laser be way better?
03:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> laser players don't have movement
03:19 <+bridge> <louis> ig they could just camp easily
03:19 <+bridge> <louis> maybe laser bounce only xd
03:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Im on it in ddnet-insta but sadly with not much support from Heinrich :p I would love to stay 0 commits behind ddnet but \#7777 is stale
09:04 <+bridge> <melo∆û> #7777
09:04 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
11:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Honestly we should just rewrite a lot there, make a ddnet-skeleton that is easier to mod, on which we can implement ddnet
11:23 <+bridge> <learath2> If I win the lottery I'll just work full time on ddnet
11:25 <+bridge> <avolicious> So no rewrite üò¶ I still pray for the lottery win, but its currently unlikely if you dont play in lottery
11:25 <+bridge> <louis> start playing roulette instead
11:27 <+bridge> <louis> tbh in most games there are separate launchers for big mods
11:28 <+bridge> <louis> im surprised someone hasn't made a mod launcher for tw like there is for minecraft,etc.
11:28 <+bridge> <louis> i guess there just isn't enough demand
11:28 <+bridge> <learath2> Feel free to donate so I can get lottery tickets üëç
11:29 <+bridge> <learath2> There aren't many client side "mod"s to launch
11:38 <+bridge> <zhn> lua scripting was a thing before people put all affort tino making bots instead of client side modifications
11:38 <+bridge> <zhn> into*
11:41 <+bridge> <louis> yeah
11:41 <+bridge> <louis> but i guess you don't see any mods adding new weapons or blocks sadly
11:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> That's what I was planning to do aswell, but the other way around. A skeleton based on/around ddnet so new mods can be created very easily
11:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> F-DDrace has a set of custom weapons and any idea can be implemented quickly

13:49 <+bridge> <louis> any networking pros here? I've another question. is it possible to predict a deterministic event sent from server to the exact millisecond on client side, or is the best way to just to predict it <x> ms ahead where x is a weighted average of the last few pings?
13:52 <+bridge> <louis> I assume it should be possible by synchronizing clock off first ping and then just sending the server clock during each event-to-be-predicted, but is it necessarily worth it over just using the average ping?
13:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> what are you trying to do
13:55 <+bridge> <louis> i'm implementing client side predictions for a PvE game, for example there is an enemy that shoots a bullet at the nearest player and I want the client to predict enemies events <ping> ms in advance so what the client-side state sees will line up with the server-side state

14:12 <+bridge> <krystalx_play> can I ask this question? why was my nickname ponobloxxx, I have 21 hours in the game, but I was banned for no reason
14:12 <+bridge> <krystalx_play> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1250060045752729660/IMG_20240611_151049.jpg?ex=666990a3&is=66683f23&hm=fd3750d23e6ccb6cd31f8f651c3353d2cc410723721da8e5eb17a3bbe212b2f9&

14:12 <+bridge> <krystalx_play> thanks
14:13 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I recently let my brother play this amazing game. But when I got home my account had been banned until February 21st. My brother said he didn't know why this happened. Until I found out he started  blocking people on multeasymap. I'm sorry for what happened, but please release my account again. I really like this game, and I didn't want to be without playing it for so long. I promise this will never happen again
14:17 <+bridge> <teero777> Thanks for your message. It sounds like your brother's creative use of the block function on multeasymap led to some unintended consequences. While a good sibling chat might be in order (no whips needed!), the account ban until February 21st will stand. Consider it a lesson in account security and responsible gaming. We look forward to welcoming you back in February, hopefully with fewer family-induced surprises!

14:28 <+bridge> <jxsl13> The server is suggesting you to learn the Go programming language: https://go.dev/play/
14:29 <+bridge> <jxsl13> good luck
15:19 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> https://tenor.com/view/fnb-get-this-man-a-true-gif-25257480
15:19 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> agreed tho
16:32 <+bridge> <learath2> When I first got my domain I used to pay 14$ for it, now it's 24$...
16:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Actually 10$
18:56 <+bridge> <learath2> I transferred my domain to porkbun, namecheap is far too expensive now, for literally no reason
19:19 <+bridge> <headshotnoby> name**cheap** expensive
19:24 <+bridge> <learath2> name"cheap"
20:02 <+bridge> <learath2> My server needs lots of updates but I'm terrified of updating it because it has very janky full disk encryption
20:02 <+bridge> <learath2> Every time I reboot it I'm terrified it won't come back up properly then I need to mess around with things
20:03 <+bridge> <bober_v_nebe> how can i play with my friend
20:08 <+bridge> <bober_v_nebe> hey
20:08 <+bridge> <bober_v_nebe> p;ease
20:10 <+bridge> <jxsl13> paying less than 5‚Ç¨ for german .de domain
20:10 <+bridge> <jxsl13> paying 40‚Ç¨ for zcat.ch
20:18 <+bridge> <jxsl13> does porkbun have a dyndns api?
23:16 <+bridge> <learath2> They have an api, idk if there is a client for it or if any common clients support it
23:17 <+bridge> <learath2> I've been hosting my own nameserver since forever so it's not something I look at
