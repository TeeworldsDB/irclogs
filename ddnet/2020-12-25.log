08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Well, you just literally guessed the exact problem. Wanna become programmer?
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh fun 😄
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I made it onto the global leaderboard \o/
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 congrats!
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome :D
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wow perseverance! Congrats
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich pro
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder why there is not a single add in the leaderboard
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> wouldnt it be fun for a company to pay a team to get in the leader board under the name company.com/jobs xd
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ad?
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> ye ad not add
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a ad on the right side
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its not intrusive
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> no i dont mean like from aoc it self
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/792002352504373268/unknown.png
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> but from users climbing the board to self ad
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> or companys representing them self there
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u would get banned
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> oh rude
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s cheaper for companies to buy ads than waste working hours on it
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> How i turn off the xmas skins?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Trafalgar Law only possible server-side
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or choose a skin that has no christmas version
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, you could locally copy your skin myskin.png into santa_myskin.png
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then you don't see it, but others still will
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Since everyone is complaining, I'll disable events on DDNet servers :/
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh wait, it's actually client-side. So just `events 0` in console should work
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen not everyone, ofc u will only hear ppl who come here and complain
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think russia doesnt celebrate xmas btw
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they celebrate later in january
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> toggle event based on timezone lul
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> can we get ddnet to write logfiles relative to ~/.teeworlds/dumps to avoid confusion when switching from vanilla to ddnet or vice versa?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can we get vanilla to not randomly interpret paths relative to /dumps instead?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And there were people from the companies playing AoC. A guy from spotify and github were up there for the first week but I guess none ended up in the final leaderboard
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> did they use spotify and github as their username tho? Or just their private name
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> yea its probably a weird idea to use one dood to represent a big company xd
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> we should try next year to get ddnet.tw in the leaderboard ;D
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They had a tag next to their names
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> ah
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They had a couple ppl playing but dont forget these ppl have full time jobs at their respective companies
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Full time competitive coders are a different breed
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Twilio also had one of theirs up there
16:04 <+ChillerDragon> so me expecting to see a company there wasnt too absurd i guess
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich is a different kind of breed than twilio github and spotify o.O hehe
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqHjc7hlqd0 I can rly recommend this video if you want to get into bash scripting :) it is by far the most informative i found in the last years and keep returning to it to look things up
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> pattern match listing variables is so strong and i have never seen similar in other languages
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon can u show an example
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> see i have this list of vars prefixed with acc_ https://github.com/DDNetPP/server/blob/23ef67af0cb5b727bcd2545618a912408f906204/lib/fddr-parse-accounts.sh#L37-L79 and ``${!acc_@}`` expands to all of them. Then i iterate over them to print them all https://github.com/DDNetPP/server/blob/23ef67af0cb5b727bcd2545618a912408f906204/lib/fddr-parse-accounts.sh#L306-L312
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> you can also iterate over them and get the value
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> or you can also get the value of the variable with the name held in in a variable xd
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> @rqza als ob du daily uploads bis 2021 machst o.O dezember yt money iz da :D
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> @onbgy unmute me in #fng readonly soks
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rqza> 😄 Hab meine Videos nicht monetarisiert, aber ja 🎄😇
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Todays AOC is breaking diffie hellman, huh
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> @jao it's cheaper use texnonik instead 2 workers ...
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I googled an algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem. Anybody did the maths themselves?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> How can newbies see all srvs?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> A friend can just see novice srv
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> clear the search bar at the bottom
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That default exclude filter is very counterintuitive
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro no need for math today. brute force worked in reasonable time
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 How? Both "loop numbers" aka exponents are in the millions. I only saw the 10-thousands ticking up every second or so. The babystep-giantstep algorithm solved it in no time
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess ~15 minutes bruteforce would be ok
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my bruteforce is 10s
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in unoptimized python
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Send code :D
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```py
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for i in count(1):
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     dexp += 1
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     dnum = (dnum * 7) % mod
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     if dnum == door:
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         break
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I bet this would have overflowed for me
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> overflowed?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait I read that wrong
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Theres another loop around that trying different `i` i suppose
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just one loop
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ignore the i there, it seems like I changed my idea of how this is supposed midway through
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> imagine it's a `while True:` instead
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It was so easy
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```py
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dexp = 0
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dnum = 1
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> while True:
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     dexp += 1
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     dnum = (dnum * 7) % mod
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     if dnum == door:
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         break
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe like this
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what did you do? ^^
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm genuinely am confused what problem the "babystep-giantstep" algorithm solves then
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If not this
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my algorithm runs in O(n)
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Right, that one in O(sqrt(n))
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> babystep giantstep runs in O(√n)
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> where n is 20 million smth
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I wrote a function to calc the modular exponent first which had your loop inside and then called that function in a loop haha
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Didn't realize you could do it simply like that ^^
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that's O(n²) ^^
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> python has modular exponentiation and inverses built-in btw
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Well, that was a brainfart. But now I've got a super overkill solution https://github.com/timakro/rust-unsorted/blob/main/aoc25/src/main.rs
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wdym built-in?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `pow(base, exponent, mod)`
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> uh
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `pow(base, -1, mod)` for modular inverses
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `pow(number, -1, mod)` for modular inverses
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What python module is that?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without imports
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just the standard pow function
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Omg!
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if you use `from math import *` you get a different pow function!)
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Good that there is `math.pow` without that functionality to distract from the fact that there is a better pow function built-in 😄
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
23:31 <+ChillerDragon> anyone good with bash completion here? Or do you know a tool that has bash completion for files in a directory?
23:33 <+ChillerDragon> nvm got it
