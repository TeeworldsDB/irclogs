00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or can I just rename it?
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be fine right
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I removed the Build folders, but it still doesnt work
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it regenerates the build folder and it's still only 'x86-release'?
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, but its x64-release
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not x86
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i click on "Konfigurationen verwalten" it opens CMakeSettings.json
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try to delete that file
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is not from our repo
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is in `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_7de87f2d\OpenFolder\CMakeSettings_schema.json`
00:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but when I try to change to another configuration in ChillerDragons mod there comes a pop up
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, let me show you
00:43 <+bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> wait
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >12:38 AM] fokkonaut: if i click on "Konfigurationen verwalten" it opens CMakeSettings.json
00:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> delete that file, not CMakeSetting_schema.json
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt exist
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh wait
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is in my repo folder
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay, now it says x64-Debug (standard)
00:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and there is still no other option
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you post the file's contents?
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> BUT, if I click "Konfiguration verwalten" it opens that popup, and I can choose
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try it?
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh wtf, I have selected x64-release now, and when I click "Konfigurationen verwalten" now again, it opens CMakeSettings.json
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So i have to remove that file in order to get another configuration?!
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afaict, this file specifies which configurations are available
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could you post its contents somehow?
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```{
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   "configurations": [
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     {
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "name": "x64-Release",
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "generator": "Ninja",

00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "buildRoot": "${env.USERPROFILE}\\CMakeBuilds\\${workspaceHash}\\build\\${name}",
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "installRoot": "${env.USERPROFILE}\\CMakeBuilds\\${workspaceHash}\\install\\${name}",
00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "cmakeCommandArgs": "",

00:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     }
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   ]
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> }```
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> were you perhaps able to select multiple configurations in the "Konfiguration verwalten" dialog?
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nope, I just tried
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can only select one
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can copy-paste these configurations I guess
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will try
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> into the `"configurations"` array in that json file
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```{
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   "configurations": [
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     {
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "name": "x64-Debug",
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "generator": "Ninja",
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "configurationType": "Debug",
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "inheritEnvironments": [
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         "msvc_x64_x64"
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       ],
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "buildRoot": "${env.USERPROFILE}\\CMakeBuilds\\${workspaceHash}\\build\\${name}",
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "installRoot": "${env.USERPROFILE}\\CMakeBuilds\\${workspaceHash}\\install\\${name}",

00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>       "ctestCommandArgs": ""
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     }
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>   ]
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> }```
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so this one under x64-release?
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can select two now
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, x64-release and debug
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://pastebin.com/raw/cuzWSgsf
00:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> have ut like this now
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, sounds good
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay good
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have no idea what might have possibly broken it
00:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me neither
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Never update microsoft programs if they are working :D
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can you fix it tho? or is it unfixable? xd
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fix what
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That it can create this file automatically with all the information
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd need a windows computer to properly debug this
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have one right now
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> BTW: @Learath2, I think your commit fails a bit, if there are more than 64 players on my server, it used to send 63/256, and if it reaches 256 it will turn to 64.
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut well it's your job to fix the intricacies of the implementation of 256 players
09:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Up to 64 we dont need to fake any behaviour afaik
09:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 oki^^ :D
09:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (It should be a simple enough fix to make sure you never send more then 63/64 for older clients)
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 let's try reenabling aio then and giving it to someone with windows?
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 now that I think about it, I think you need the ucs2 conversion added to aio, I didn't bother because it wasn't used for windows
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also needs a check to only enable that if stdout is a console :/
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does anyone know why the over-head emotes on DDNet fng2 servers are smoother and slower than on any other server? I would like to implement that as a feature
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> After I compiled DDNet via cmake my regular client changed HUD colors and bg to this shit
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602460489104097280/unknown.png
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Something was overwritten?
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Did you really change HUD colors in update?
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur client was rly old
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> They are the defauls one ?
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u compiled anyway
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u modifying something
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> that looks like messed up defaults
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @Ryozuki Yes, ofc
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Im writing my own bot
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> to take some top times
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @jao I can't see any setting for HUD colors in-game
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> settings > graphics > ui color
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and whats setting for default one...
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont complain about colors or Learath2 gets a breakdown :c
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what is the point of dummy_map tool?
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> nvm got it
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I take full responsibility for breaking those
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @Learath2 Any simple task I could try to make with DDNet source code?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> To dive into it somehow
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> client or server?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is ur end goal?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> client
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> no goal
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then start there
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> just want to know how it works
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u wont succed in life if u have no goal
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nothign that dives u
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xdddddddddddd
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and then, maybe, could make some mods for HUD, or useful features
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then ur goal is knowledge i guess
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> HUD is the main goal I guess
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> programming xp?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> yes
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> thats also
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i highly recommend of thinking something you would really want to do and then just try it
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you want to do with the hud?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> First of all I want to understand at least somehow what each method here does
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> to comfortably navigate here
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u d that by doing something else
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its an side effect
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> so I could help with fixing bugs
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and etc
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> yes
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> that's why Im asking about any simple tasks I could try to do
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and also help with that
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> for first time
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk if u desire any improvements in the hud or if we have any open issues
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but if its just for the learning make an pr in chillerbot-ux with a simpler scoreboard
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its so messy imo
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just remove parts
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> remove ping country flag
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> make it smaller
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Ok, maybe I could try to make new entities that looks cool and randomize unhookable/hookable blocks
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but its not so easy
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that sounds like a harder start to me
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> to start with
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> look at ddnet issues
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> most of ddnet issues are server sided
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont think we have some nice hud issues tho
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> no
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> there are also client issues
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1820
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ?
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> not so simple as learath say, ok
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> skip it
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but I guess its about making a new setting in settings-hud menu
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and access it from demo player
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ok, I'll imagine my own task to start with
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sorri for only bringing my stuff up but tthats the thing i can think of @Evgesha 
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it would be nice if u have a demo paused and select a different player in the view to update it without playing the demo again
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1843
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602529377690976286/unknown.png
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> what these buttons do btw
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cut demos
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> left start right end
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then right camera on the right
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and it create a new demo
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> you mean without unpausing?
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> because changing view is working
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it doesnt update for me if i dont play the demo
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imagine u want to pause a moment and then skip rtrhoigh all the tees and see where they are
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> k
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> where is the demo player?
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk maybe demo.cpp
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i usually search for strings i see in the ui
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and let a tool search the whole src code for it
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602532188449275924/unknown.png
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> n1
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wrong
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> if really would be also cool if we had time untill unfreeze instead of shields on hud
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> some day I will do it.
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> May be few years later
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> maybe dozens
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the ninja bar unfreeze timer in 0.7 is pretty cool 😃
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Open suggestion:
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Remove "long pain sound" from the game (shooting in freeze) and replace it with choosing randomly from some sounds with fat guy saying something like "Hey" "Hey, save me" "Save me sucker" etc
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pls no
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just keep the sounds how they are and let the server send the health sound instead
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> what do you mean "helath sound"
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> health pickup sound
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Oh yeah
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> best sound in da world
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602544369546952840/unknown.png
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Modified client to show milliseconds
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> useless
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> oh ok, not milliseconds
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> thats ticks
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but anyway its victory
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> gg
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> is there 60 ticks in seconds
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> is there 60 ticks in second
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> or what
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 30 i think
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602545777809686677/unknown.png
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> why not
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont we have a race timer already?
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> what do you mean
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> lol the timer works incorrect
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ??
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> it changes seconds on XX.6
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> this works fine
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602546851488464896/unknown.png
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> no
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> And now its not, wtf...
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xdd
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can at most have 1 more digits worth of precision with the tickcounter the way it is
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i think race servers use interpolation or something to get even more precision
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602549977343983627/unknown.png
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Why its getting width of text with size 12
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> to calculate offset
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do they? I thought they just added the extra digit
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> and then render it with size 10
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro do you?
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ?
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> fontsize is the fontsize no?
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That code has been touched by a dozen people, who knows
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> as I see it does what I said
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So its offset calculation with 10 fontSize and render with 12
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> funny
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So its offset calculation with 12 fontSize and render with 10
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 Yes, game servers run at 50 tps so 0.02 seconds is the most precise you get without interpolation
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> there is no sense adding one more digit
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> because it runs to fast
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> because it runs too fast

19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Setting the color of text
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> after its being rendered
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wats the problem
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just resetting the color
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use some logic please
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lol
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> no lol
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> its not setting it anywhere before
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> so there is no need to reset
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> u never know so better to reset
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> daily complain #6
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xDD
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @Evgesha when u create a new variable the computer just allocates space in memory for it, its not guaranteed to be zero even if it usually is
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> so for reasons like this its better to reset before using
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 👌
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> what new variable you're talking about
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> 
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602554376694923275/unknown.png
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> "its not setting it anywhere before"
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ```cpp
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> if(m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_TimeLimit && Time <= 60 && (m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj->m_WarmupTimer <= 0))
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha>         {
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha>             float Alpha = Time <= 10 && (2*time_get()/time_freq()) % 2 ? 0.5f : 1.0f;
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha>             TextRender()->TextColor(1.0f, 0.25f, 0.25f, Alpha);
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha>         }
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ```
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> *any* new variable
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but ok, let's say default color is always zero and resetting is just fix for non-ddrace gamemodes
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but ok, let's say default color is always 1111 and resetting is just fix for non-ddrace gamemodes
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lol
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIS-100 is quite fun
20:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im a zachtronics fan
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 exapunks is the best game they have
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:

20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> EXAPUNKS
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> epic music
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> epic theme
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love the neojapanese them
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have it on exapunks and shenzen
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>

20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my program is fokin long
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> late game is very hard, on any zachtronics game
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://streamable.com/pl7cv
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> got a real nice solution to the differential one in tis100
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> looks dope
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zeta is just too good at these
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> really cant beat his signal multiplexer 😛
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Where can I find server's best time
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the client or on the server?
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> client
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When the client receives `NETMSGTYPE_SV_RECORD` if `CGameClient::CGameInfo::m_RaceRecordTime` is set it'll be the first integer in that message
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can see how we get `m_ServerRecord` in `src/game/client/components/hud.cpp`
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> thx
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @Learath2 Still can't get it
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where exactly are you in the client code
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602604685773373500/unknown.png
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So the server record stored in `m_ServerRecord`
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> but on DDnet servers its one of these:
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 1. `CGameClient::CGameInfo::m_RaceRecordTime` not set
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 2. `m_ServerRecord` is 0
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 3. `m_ServerRecord` is -2147483648
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> its `hud.cpp`
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Evgesha we set m_RaceRecordTime in the latest master, it was a bug
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news, zeta is a beast, can't even come close on most challanges :/
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> im on latest master rn
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> problem exists
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> or what did you mean
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> almost pushed to master lol
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pro
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> thx I have no permissions
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I have fucking localized VS
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I don't understand meaning of the buttons
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 zeta?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> @Learath2 For now only on 95.172.92.151:8333 i got right `m_DDRaceTime`
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> which resets to 0 when I kill
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> on other servers (or maps?) I resieve no message
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> on other servers (or maps?) I receive no message
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how many zeta's do you know? I'm ofc talking about the great Zeta Hoernchen
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was wondering ^^
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you really should try TIS-100, amazing game
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Evgesha only the lastest master servers will send you the correct RecordTime flag
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you'll need to build your own server
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> lol
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> How does scoreboard on tab correctly show top-time
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it sorts the times?
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ?
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> 
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602618068992131093/unknown.png
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I mean this time
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> btw I got it right
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602618139599175720/unknown.png
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know, have you considered checking the code? 😄
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do know where all these are. but I don't have the entire code in my brain
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I'll look for scoreboard code
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Evgesha iirc the scoreboard code wrongly assumes `m_RaceRecordTime`
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just google chrome things
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/602619411978911857/Screenshot_2019-07-22_at_00.53.48.png
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's a very weird computer architecture that you have to write assembly for, to do "simple" tasks
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> wtf 100.6%
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
