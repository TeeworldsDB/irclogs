13:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> Hey can someone help me?
13:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> My Dynamic Cam can't be toggled off :C
13:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> I just reinstalled ddnet
13:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> click it again I think
13:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure, there was a bug recently
13:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> you don't think i tried that? 😛
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so what are you trying and what is the result
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so what are you trying and what is the result?
13:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried `cl_dyncam 0` in f1?
13:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> yeah tried that too
13:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> well no mather if the setting is set or not, dynamic cam is always on
13:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> restart didn't help either
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_mouse_deadzone 0
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_mouse_followfactor 0
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl_mouse_max_distance 400
13:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <CodeX | Alex> that worked, thx :3
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> pls add cinematic mouse moves from ATH to DDnet
19:04 <@deen> sure, sounds good
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can you just steal it with copypaste without permission. or do you have to recreate it
19:10 <@deen> well, personally I'm not doing anything
19:11 <@deen> it depends on their license and whether source code is public
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> stealing in tw is more a matter of honor right?  like when ddnet hesitated to host ddmax maps
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it couldnt actually lead to any legal issues
19:12 <@deen> of course it could
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh.  didnt knew that o.O
19:13 <@deen> but additionally asking the ath authors if it's fine with them would be ideal
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i am almost positive that i saw the feature in another client before. maybe they stole it too.
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> henningstone is okay with it but he recommends to recreate the code
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> ^ That is affirmative, and if you do take the code anyways, stating that in the patch notes is fair enough (to answer your license question)
