00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You wouldn't care if you weren't a mapper anyways
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Voxel now to get rly serious. What ur doing does look nice. I think you should prepare few sets of colors of tiles and show them to ddnet mappers and they will tell you what they feel
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> in what sense? too thin?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> I always cared about mappers thats why I though it will be good to involve myself into this disscussion ðŸ™‚
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean, alternare colors would sound nice. i'm just going by the given colors from the entities overlay
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i don't want to change **too** much, since that would be a big throw off for mappers
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a bit
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wouldnt waste time remaking default mapping entities tho
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im sure almost all mappers dont think theyre that good
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thats reasonable
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> btw I once tried to map in ddnet but that feature with picking layer on shift or ctrl and right click of mouse is a big mistake. I bet it was added by a person who never mapped.
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> picking layer/tile on a button to release tile (genius.............)
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same, it also normalizes the gameplay across maps
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I actually did map a lot. And always missed the feature. I was asking around in this channel if someone has suggestions for a key combination. If you know a better one feel free to propose it
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Tsin)
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet persian doesnt have ping
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> location
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 ^
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that means unknown
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which location do we want to assign them?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> EUAS ?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> eurasia
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> either EUR or ASI, there's nothing in between
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ASI
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Learath2 do you feel more close to Europe or to Asia ?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he's in italy ðŸ˜‰
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh ðŸ˜¦
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> i would pick middle mouse button to pick up layer without any other shift or ctrl + button combination.
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> 
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> btw correct me if im wrong but it looks like middle mouse is now doing the same as ctrl+left mouse button
06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what will this do exactly :o
06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> its just code quality stuff
08:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye middle mouse is used 
08:51 <+ChillerDragon> you do not need ctrl to release a tile so in theory ctrl+leftclick should not conflict
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on point
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 8h since ur last msg
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> truly a perfect bot
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn do u ever sleep? xd
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im gonna soon ðŸ˜„
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this last pr took me last 2 nights ðŸ˜„
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im procrastinating too hard maybe
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rip
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we need tools for that anyway
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i use regex ðŸ˜„
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else contributing gets hard ^^
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> to find them, and then i use `replace all reference`
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i even put the regex i used in the commit message this time
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> clang-tidy freaking slow on my computer
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can run in with multi core, but dont do auto fixes then
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it doesnt "lock" headers
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so it will write to the same header simultanously ðŸ˜„
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im using the same run as CI, so it doesn't fix anything
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah looks like it also runs single threaded
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but ninja parallelize it
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Load average: 8
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> on 4 cores ðŸ˜„
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok maybe not
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its just slow xd
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean its defs slower than a normal build, but thats obvious
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe you can run it only on files u changed? but no idea how xD
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how the hell did ubuntu-latest compile??
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> No, for it to go into ddnet I need to refactor some things and redo the base PR. My Prototype is closed to be finished, while sounds and some animations are still missing
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's a fucking typo in a variable name
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesn't ubuntu-latest uses sqlite?
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> uhm maybe not, maybe it uses mysql directly?
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn can u explain again why the assignment from vec2 to vec3 was required?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or what exactly required the logic to be reordered?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i see both code paths as completly independent
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the function QuadsDrawTLImpl is a template class
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it is called from 2 places
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> one where template was an old struct of yours with an operator= overload from vec2
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i removed that struct as it was just a vec3 copy
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but the assignment from vec2 to vec3 didn't touch last 3rd coordinate
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so to mimic the final behavior, i switched for loop and QuadsDrawTLImpl
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah i see
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want a case how to trigger the bad new behavior
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> load some huge map into the editor with GL 3.0+ (or vk) and zoom out far
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it will probs render incorrectly then
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, thx for the feedback, i'll try later
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, have a nice day, i'll go sleep ^^
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @fokkonaut btw can u also see the FPS drops in demos? if so maybe you can record a ~1min demo and send it to me?
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gn8
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> gn8? its 10
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> AM
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night ðŸ˜‰
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ChillerDragon, do you have some nice ~1min demos?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> random team sizes, many particles, many entities whatever. I guess your server also abuses the physics to the limit, perfectly for what i want ðŸ˜„
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> just join a server and record some? xd
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> and omagawd the internet is offline
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> gitlab and github are down like watafak
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> when git.ddnet.tw for better uptime
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> .org *
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> everytime i read about unicode and text rendering stuff i wonder again and again, why was it made so insanly hard ^^
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/orling/grapheme-splitter
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> multiple unicode points for one visual
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ChillerDragon pls send, i dont want to join ur server
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont think his server does
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> ok i can try to get something
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> but only because i love u jopstar
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ZÍ‘Í«ÍƒAÍ«Í—Ì´LÍ¨Í§Í©GÌ‘Í—ÌŽOÍ‚ÌŒÌŒ!Ì¿Ì‹Í¥" 
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao. this string is 145 bytes as c++ char array
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u pls send demos xd
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and only browser technology can render it
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of what
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all other software will fail ðŸ˜›
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah bcs nobody understands this xDD
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like wtf
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Not Keks just join my server
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea what u need
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just gimme any demo with bad performance as u mentioned
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, its just that the general performance seems to be going down
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing specific i can do
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said that performance went down. have you checked whether it also went down in demos? if so, just send a demo you used to test this to Jupstar
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then give me general demo xd
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> like this? @Jupstar https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656755720.png
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice xd
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what the fuck? i cant use open gl 3.0.0 it seems. i get massive laggs when zooming out and when i checked it was set to 1.4.0
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are you on an intel GPU on windows rn?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well use vulkan, intel drivers shipped with windows are still broken
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i always used gl 3.0 without problems
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but on nvidia 1060
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah wait
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i didnt select 3.3
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs i had set it before, idk why it resetted to 1.4.0
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah weird
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/GrillBlockShive_2022-07-02_11-54-24.demo enjoy virus maatfaka
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we blacklist some intel drivers on windows?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but fokko has an nvidia 1060
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that seemed to be it
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he is just confused
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 3.3.0 works again, lol. why did it got reset to 1.4.0?! i did not change any setting
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and yesterday when i checked and reported, i verified it was on 3.3
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so i thoiught there was no change on my side
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, 1.4 is hard to trigger, u need to have a bug during your first start with the client and it must fail to render a tilemap with the new rendering method
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else it never falls back, so you probs did it manually
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or u uninstalled your driver or smth xd
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> neither
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think it rechecks everytime you do driver updates
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess it will stay a mystery
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so that was the problem with ur performance i guess?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gl 1.x does not batch any particles or whatever
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> u need more jopstar?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i take everything yes
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> ok 
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not the same if possible, other particles or different entities
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> yes
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am collecting some weird edge cases ðŸ˜„
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> i can give you some shields
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/shields.demo
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656756248.png
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> i might have a finding for u jopstar
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656756744.png
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1656756755.png
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> this is smooth af in game but the demo gets very gltichy :/
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/bullets.demo
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol ðŸ˜„
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks funny
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> made by timakro the legend
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> imagine the possibilitys if servers could send a laser color to the client o.O
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would already be nice to get the owner of the laser, does entityex have a field for that?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now that we have extras.png, can we also move the new shields to extras.png? i many ppl use customized game.pngs so would be worth it
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i abuse everything in this game to all extends
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :monkaS:
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thatâ€˜s not bad. my main job is abusing databases to find bugs :happy:
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> interesting
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds fun indeed
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some time i ago i saw this https://www.edgedb.com/
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looked interesting
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> built on top of psql
