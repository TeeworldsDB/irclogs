01:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what do u use for collision?
01:03 < bridge> <louis> not shore if its better or worse with particles
01:03 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416559861008826510/switch_2025-09-13_18-59-38.mp4?ex=68c749ad&is=68c5f82d&hm=3fd384cb682735fde9b175bf838b8c5dba0000a49bbb16e0bb3845e38683d530&
01:03 < bridge> <blazulite> OH MY GOD WHAT
01:03 < bridge> <blazulite> THAT'S SO COOL????
01:03 < bridge> <blazulite> looks perfect to me
01:03 < bridge> <louis> they almost feel too modern xd but im too lazy to change it
01:04 < bridge> <louis> i tink have to move it out of general group though cause they don't fully move during the hammers
01:04 < bridge> <blazulite> are the particfles server or client side
01:04 < bridge> <blazulite> are the particles server or client side
01:04 < bridge> <louis> client side
01:04 < bridge> <blazulite> maybe randomize them a bit
01:05 < bridge> <blazulite> cause they look way too linear
01:05 < bridge> <blazulite> which is awesome in my opinion
01:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think it looksf ine, but im not sure how the behaviour of turning on and off works
01:05 < bridge> <louis> the right one is an alternating switch other two do what their color does
01:08 < bridge> <louis> wtf are particles tick dependent xd
01:09 < bridge> <blazulite> Yo
01:09 < bridge> <blazulite> How can I see a server's statistics
01:09 < bridge> <blazulite> I remember there being a website for that
01:23 < bridge> <kebscs> Looks so nice
01:23 < bridge> <kebscs> I was sceptical about the particles but this is nice
01:25 < bridge> <louis> for some reason they dont have the same distance each time
01:25 < bridge> <louis> idk why i set flowaffected and collision to false
01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> flow haha nice joke
01:27 < bridge> <louis> hm
01:55 < bridge> <totar> Try with high bandwidth
01:55 < bridge> <totar> It might be a 25tps thing
02:01 < bridge> <louis> oh true i'll check
02:14 < bridge> <blazulite> it would be so cool if u were able to make whole platforms that toggle along these
02:14 < bridge> <blazulite> so they can also turn on and off visual layers as well
02:18 < bridge> <louis> thats a lot harder ü´°  but would be cool yea
02:18 < bridge> <blazulite> well true lol
02:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> random positions for the particles would make it better
02:56 < bridge> <blazulite> hey that's waht I said :C
03:15 < bridge> <z2basti> Uh so guys
03:18 < bridge> <z2basti> All fngs servers are down if you join one you get banned for 3000 minutes + theres like a new cheat that makes you a moderator or sum like that cause ive been playing earlier today and there were cheaters that had like auto laser and shi like that on. When you tried to kick them it would say something like you cant kick a moderator
03:18 < bridge> <z2basti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416593993415917651/ScreenRecording_09-14-2025_03-16-34_1.mov?ex=68c76977&is=68c617f7&hm=64cc0295739382f59017226327c5442cb9384b6037118e66801e426aedb3f5cb&
05:25 < bridge> <blazulite> D:
05:28 < bridge> <blazulite> @noketchup do u know anything
05:28 < bridge> <blazulite>  about this?
05:28 < bridge> <blazulite> @noketchup do u know anything about this?
05:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not really fast, patiga has a fast one
11:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @z2basti I can not reproduce. I can still join "all" fng servers and there are no cheaters. Which client do you use? And which servers exactly did you connect to?
11:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the last one is actually really important, cuz if it's like Noby's fng, then Noby should really pay attention to it
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> today i had to fix a bug to fix a bug
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had a bug in the page fault and panic handler
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> which occurred when bug 2 happened
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> page fault was recursively faulting xd
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416726385145282673/image.png?ex=68c7e4c3&is=68c69343&hm=72a25acd2c38996a003fd1bf883f0a5342f9f65310ae500f552f83ac7c05d27a&
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> can spawn programs loaded from fs now
12:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when dev in own os?
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have a editor
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> nor compiler nor lot of things
12:33 < bridge> <Assa> time to debug üôÅ I played with this for months now, never had it crash
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> Nah I must be fucking stupid
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:35 < bridge> <Assa>     if(Env == -1)
12:35 < bridge> <Assa>         return m_EnvelopeExtremaItemNone; // No envelope just means no movement
12:35 < bridge> <Assa>     else if(Env < -1 || Env > (int)m_vEnvelopeExtrema.size())
12:35 < bridge> <Assa>         return m_EnvelopeExtremaItemInvalid;
12:35 < bridge> <Assa>     return m_vEnvelopeExtrema[Env];
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> ```
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> Spot the error
12:35 < bridge> <totar> >=
12:36 < bridge> <totar> >= ?
12:36 < bridge> <totar> >=
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> the other thing is, the map contains quads with an env, but no envs
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa heinrich once told me to capitalize the first letter of the commit. Everyone still seems to stick to it. Except you <:justatest:572499997178986510>
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh and dobry xd
12:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but he is robyte so it doesnt count
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> I do, but this was a quick hotfix
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> i normally do <Keyword>:
12:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but we dont do that here xd
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> but I do that here
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i guess robi does too
12:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pure chaos
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> put it in the contrib.md
12:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon where do i put it
12:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its out of order whereever i do
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) idc where too much. Just pick something that feels right. But try to at least put it somewhere sameish in header and source as far as the current mess allows
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa did you introduce the bug fixed in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10915 ?
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon can you review the 1 line PR? I am very confident you can do that
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> yes üôÅ
12:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok nice
12:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay is done
12:58 < bridge> <Assa> not nice, it's was a wrong invalid behavior check, I am afraid of other maps
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> forgot to push
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is done now
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
12:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** No if its your code and your bug you are the code owner and you can do whatever you want with it. Makes the review easy because you break nobody elses hidden agenda burried in the code.
12:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats why its "nice" @Assa xd
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> I am only mad about myself there, such a stupid bug, now I have 3 bugs on my neck üôÅ
13:36 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> Does anyone have a ready-made Anti TAS system code?
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @rehoboamrulit doubt. Which servers are yours?
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 i am sad my prs are not being merged. Can you send some reviews or hire more reviewers please.
13:42 < bridge> <learath2> Anything urgent?
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i would like to get the rcon refactor in
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i tried to split it into atomic easy and fast to merge prs
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but all of them stay untouched for weeks and are now full of conflicts so now when i have time to work on the rcon stuff i can not continue
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> Are you set on the design part of the rcon stuff now?
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nobody commented on it
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i guess i am fine with our latest proposal
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> why does the current build pipeline take almost an hour?
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but there are some prs that just make working on it easier 
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa oh that ._. also on my todo
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can also do it :p 
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** build a Dockerfile and push it to gh as a build base
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> no I mean, previously it was like 20-30 minutes
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we should be able to get a huuuge performance increase w that
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** at least it still finishes @Assa xd my ddnet++ does not pass anymore because the runners do not have enough ram
13:48 < bridge> <learath2> If you gimme some pr numbers I can take a look

13:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u need all of them for something? -.-
13:54 < bridge> <Assa> some of them are exlcuding each other, either A or B, like with mapitems or envelope sync
13:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yeye
13:55 < bridge> <Assa> and the ivec thing is just future proofing
15:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ByFox u here?

15:03 < bridge> <byfox> a?
15:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nice
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am working on credits
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did you look at kaizo insta for foot?
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or even take parts of the code?
15:04 < bridge> <byfox> I watched but didn't use his version
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** okay so no credit i guess
15:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i credit you as "ByFox" ok?
15:05 < bridge> <byfox> I liked how football is made in kaizo-insta, it is convenient, but there are a lot of bugs that take longer to fix
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** okay yes i just want to make sure that if we took anything from kz that we credit him and his project
15:06 < bridge> <byfox> Specify as ByFox, I am already specified somewhere
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you are
15:06 < bridge> <byfox> Specify as ByFox, I am already listed as such somewhere
15:07 < bridge> <pluskz> xd
15:32 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> K Gores
15:32 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> I have already tried to implement it, and even implemented it , but it interfered with legitimate players.
15:32 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> The anti-shuffle system should sort of push the player back
15:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @rehoboamrulit do you have a lot of cheaters there? oO
16:02 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> yes
16:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh interesting. How do you know? @rehoboamrulit

18:10 < bridge> <Teero> are there any sources to proper skin rendering or do i have to look at the code? xd
18:25 < bridge> <Teero> the animation system is so confusing

18:28 < bridge> <Teero> ```
18:28 < bridge> <Teero> oh here it is
18:35 < bridge> <robyt3> That's generated code, `content.py` is very readable
18:37 < bridge> <Teero> ```python
18:37 < bridge> <Teero> anim = Animation("base")
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim.body.frames.Add(AnimKeyframe(0, 0, -4, 0))
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim.back_foot.frames.Add(AnimKeyframe(0, 0, 10, 0))
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim.front_foot.frames.Add(AnimKeyframe(0, 0, 10, 0))
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> container.animations.Add(anim)
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> 
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim = Animation("idle")
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim.back_foot.frames.Add(AnimKeyframe(0, -7, 0, 0))
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> anim.front_foot.frames.Add(AnimKeyframe(0, 7, 0, 0))
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> container.animations.Add(anim)
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> ```
18:38 < bridge> <Teero> based on this shouldn't the feet be at an offset of 4 units to the feet? but the feet are moved 7 feet to the right/left based on the foot? how do i know the y offset of the feet to the body? because it is definitely not 4
18:41 < bridge> <Teero> most i get is a sus tee

19:34 < bridge> <kebscs> @ryozuki is ddstats.org also deleted?
19:41 < bridge> <blazulite> seems like it is
19:41 < bridge> <blazulite> it stopped being available a long time ago
19:41 < bridge> <blazulite> at least i cant access it myself since ~3 months ago
19:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :nouis:
20:03 < bridge> <iamminka> hi @forgottenabscat 
20:03 < bridge> <iamminka> i heard you are the go to guy about mobile code so im asking you.
20:03 < bridge> <iamminka> can the action of clicking the screen on mobile be reprogrammed? i know there is the change config ingame setting which you can set it to fire but its pretty limited, i wondered if i could make it do custom commands, like the kog bind bind mouse1 "+prev_weapon;+fire" and bind the circle to custom command like bind mouse2 "+weapon2;+hook"
20:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Inside https://maps.ddnet.org/compilations/ - ddnet-maps.zip, there are 3 map duplicates listed on the top-right and bottom-right
20:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416849572063481946/image.png?ex=68c8577d&is=68c705fd&hm=678a393eb6d011886d231508b511b92ea8c915eff140af94c67de21edc015cbc&
20:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (ignore the windows activation)
20:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'll try to open all the other maps in DDNet nightly to see if the Quad clipping optimization works everywhere
20:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's only 2500 maps, I had worse :owo:
20:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (25k image moderation on Teedata)
20:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ... Why is F1 (which is the console) inside the Map Editor opens the URL https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Mapping on my browser?
20:22 < bridge> <melon> because F1 is the default key for `help` on a lot of applications
20:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Like, please next time add a window to announce to all users that you plan on opening up this link
20:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And the link itself isn't secure even
20:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, not exactly secure
20:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, but no warnings for opening a website on your browser via a third party app?
20:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You cannot justify it xd
20:23 < bridge> <melon> i mean - its a dead link atm, but wdym `not secure` ?
20:24 < bridge> <melon> its just a wikimedia instance
20:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> security risk
20:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Uou already got hacked by Jupstar who knows what urls ddnet will open on your machine üò¨
20:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> You already got hacked by Jupstar who knows what urls ddnet will open on your machine üò¨
20:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm not kidding, if there's any chance for that link (which you said dead link) to be used for some idiotic remote code execution, then eeeh
20:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Let's say it's not legal to do something like this without warning the user
20:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Common example would be Steam, Youtube, Facebook, Discord and all the other social media sites warning you that you (the user) go to another website, uncontrolled by this specific party
20:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's due to regulations
20:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> DDNet is not an exception
20:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Escecially when it leads to an unsafe dead link
20:27 < bridge> <melon> dead link as in: it redirects to the current backup
20:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Robyt is also adding backdoors, crazy
20:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416853008519528601/image.png?ex=68c85ab1&is=68c70931&hm=b42976aef59d96722a66dd0a2691280d95c990a0667945d5d51002963718c993&
20:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I rephrase what I said. It's not that legal to do something like this, without warning the user
20:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If the user doesn't know what the application opens (which I assume under a fucking loophole, you can say "just look up on Github", nobody will do that), then there's a chance that this backfires under EU user safety regulations
20:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And since Github is a place for developers, not casual users who just want to play the game, most of the playerbase will overlook the fact that this ever existed
20:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Meaning, they don't know about F1 in the Map Editor, ever leading you to a website.
20:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's much worse to think about it when other clients have this feature as well, especially hacked ones
20:30 < bridge> <s1ph3r_official> Hi guys
20:30 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
20:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I send the screenshot so you know who to sue, now to show the url
20:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I sent the screenshot so you know who to sue, now to show the url
20:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> i mean it's obviously legal if you control the linked website
20:30 < bridge> <louis> the link should be fixed indeed with the new wiki instance, but having F1 open a browser link is very standard behavior
20:31 < bridge> <melon> i may need a source or two from you stating it as `illegal` and `breaching EU user safety regulations`
20:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Without warning the user where it takes you first?
20:31 < bridge> <melon> because all i can find are ethical reasons not to do it
20:31 < bridge> <louis> i mean click f1 in the discord client, it opens a website too
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> F1 has now two functionalities which users know only one of:
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Opening up the console for commands inside the game
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Opening up a browser and redirecting you to a website
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> There is no clarification, nor explanation inside the client to know that these two exist together
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This is my only issue -
20:32 < bridge> <melon> and without a prompt too! :OHNOOOO:
20:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This is my only issue -^
20:32 < bridge> <avolicious> But only for discord links üòÑ
20:33 < bridge> <pilonpl> warnings only make sense for user generated content
20:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Discord is a web application, DDNet is a game
20:34 < bridge> <Teero> the f1 keybind works on both the application and the browser version
20:34 < bridge> <louis> that makes sense then, its just that what u were saying earlier about privacy risks and warnings just isn't true
20:34 < bridge> <louis> 
20:34 < bridge> <louis> some clarifiation on the difference betwen f1 ingame and in the editor is a good discussion, i don't really mind much but it might be clearer to have a [?] button in the editor for help and revert the f1 to just open the console normally
20:34 < bridge> <melon> its default behaviour and i dislike the fact that you're throwing words like `EU user safety regulations` and `legal` <-> `illegal` without proper sources around. kebs could probably puke out a prompt for it within 20 minutes, but only if there's an actual need for it.
20:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You don't understand the point or what you are on?
20:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> DDNet is a game, which means it shouldn't have the functionality of a web browser, since the game isn't about social interaction... right?
20:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You debug the game, using F1, the consoler
20:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You debug the game, using F1, the console
20:35 < bridge> <Teero> its a wiki page, for the game...
20:35 < bridge> <Teero> that is managed by the admins
20:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Inside the game, The console is the debugger
20:35 < bridge> <melon> :pepe_godwhy:
20:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why is it that you guys are against informing the playerbase about multiple functionality on the most major keyboard button?
20:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @teero777 you clearly don't play the game if you don't know the basics of console debugging in ddnet
20:37 < bridge> <Teero> every time i fail on kog extreme i check console to see what went wrong
20:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'll spam it to hell until you guys understand the problem
20:37 < bridge> <melon> > I rephrase what I said. It's not that legal to do something like this, without warning the user
20:37 < bridge> <melon> 
20:37 < bridge> <melon> proof that sentence to me and i'll make a PR
20:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't mind the redirection
20:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't mind the wiki part, I don't even mind that it's on the same key as on the Console
20:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can you redirect it to /dev/null?
20:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> JUST WARN THE FUCKING USER
20:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> was I clear now?
20:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Wait, you can launch ddnet? Not having any install problems for 3 days in a row? üòÆ
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> XDDDDDDDDDDD
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> avo stfu xDDDD
20:38 < bridge> <melon> ey Cellegen, press F1 in Visual Studio - its an application and opens up a microsoft webpage.. without a prompt!
20:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> warn the user about the wiki page??
20:38 < bridge> <avolicious> How well did the new game perform tho?
20:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> "There is no clarification, nor explanation inside the client to know that these two exist together"
20:39 < bridge> <Teero> warning that the client is gonna open a webpage. its not a bad thing to do.

20:39 < bridge> <bencie> ü§î
20:39 < bridge> <melon> peopl also dont know that `unbind_all; cl_save_settings 1; quit` will give you a good time

20:41 < bridge> <Teero> best quote of you yet
20:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Do wait, this icon doesn't have a dropbox saying what is up with it, and it's next to the exit button. These buttons are small brother, what if you misslick it?
20:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Or better example:
20:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> What if I wanna bring up the console inside the Map Editor?
20:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Like, I wanna test out maps on Nightly.
20:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I have to press either the exit button, or have my left hand suffer with CTRL SHIFT E
20:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And there's a chance I missclick it
20:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why not just put it on the left side instead, or have it be separated more, while also just writing "Wiki" next to the icon?
20:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> From a design perspective, this is the bare minimum to provide something no one asked for xd
20:43 < bridge> <Teero> @robyt3 this would be a nice thing to be able to do btw. im using i3 and my mouse i locked in the window until i go into the console. its impossible to unlock your mouse in the editor afaik.
20:43 < bridge> <robyt3> That's be a few thousands lines of code, feel free to contribute
20:44 < bridge> <robyt3> That'll be a few thousands lines of code, feel free to contribute
20:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Pay me
20:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that's the only way I do anything for you all xd
20:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'll feel free to complain dw
20:45 < bridge> <Teero> you'd have to pay robyt to accept your pr if you even made it
20:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Only mention Github to me if I'm getting paid tonight üòÇ
20:46 < bridge> <melon> Cellegen getting the KoG reaction treatment on DDNet is next level sunday entertainment
20:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> That how you know I'm him
20:46 < bridge> <melon> straight to silly billy you go
20:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :feelsbadman:
20:47 < bridge> <louis> hmm didnt work unfortunately
20:47 < bridge> <louis> @robyt3 would u happen to know why my particles dont have the same behavior
20:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but fr tho, I wanna open up console on the map editor, otherwise I cannot test out the Quad Clipping optimization
20:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but fr tho, I wanna open up console on the map editor, otherwise I cannot test out the Quad Clipping optimization as efficiently as possible
20:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Hey hey, this is typical developer chat
20:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I have like 2.5k maps, this will be painful
20:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Hey hey, this is typical developer chat - not KoG specific
20:48 < bridge> <melon> eh
20:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Main character development, wdym
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I would have written a script if I needed to test more than 3 maps manually, but have fun if that's what you want to do
20:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why don't you do it for me then? If this saves a lot of time, tests out all of the maps for quad clipping and would benefit future maps with the same tool, why not do it yourself?
20:49 < bridge> <melon> w...wow
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's not even ü§£ moment
20:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you put them in the correct group?
20:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I would've put fire under Roby by saying "feel free to contribute" but I'm no contributer ü§£
20:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I would've put fire under Roby by saying "feel free to contribute" but I'm no contributor ü§£
20:50 < bridge> <louis> they're in group::general
20:51 < bridge> <melon> if it weren't for my own sanity i'd clown emoji react to that and your prior message.
20:51 < bridge> <melon> 
20:51 < bridge> <melon> good night Cellegen
20:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> laziness, gn for u:owo:
20:51 < bridge> <robyt3> You are using `SPRITE_PART_BALL`, not sure if this needs to be in `CParticles::GROUP_PROJECTILE_TRAIL` then
20:51 < bridge> <louis> oh ew
20:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Also because of this comment, I almost don't feel like contributing to anything related to DDNet at all now
20:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Kinda depressing fr
20:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Not entirely sure how these groups work though. I guess also add some debug messages to make sure the particles are created correctly to begin with.
20:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> righttt so i was actually also confused by this, configs and commands are kinda two separate things and in the editor some commands are explicitly loaded
20:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416860513056325692/image.png?ex=68c861ae&is=68c7102e&hm=48ef8e7158168a3618b0fffe9c80f4242134a1d6dc12e1ea488a0481c847cd56&

20:58 < bridge> <melon> lets say you generously need ~3 minutes for each map, thats almost 175 hours of manually checking maps.
20:58 < bridge> <melon> even if its just a minute, that is still ~58 hours of work, manually!.
20:58 < bridge> <melon> roby wasn't giving off a lazy comment to stop you from contributing, they were giving you a suggestion every sane person would've given you.
21:07 < bridge> <Teero> can someone explain the animation framework in ddnet to me? üò≠
21:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> didn't you go to sleep? xd
21:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Also, it counts as a lazy comment for me, since no developer in DDNet throughout my entirety of playing this game wouldn't have mentioned "do it yourself".
21:10 < bridge> <melon> in germany we call that a Strohmann
21:10 < bridge> <melon> we dont like Strohmann
21:10 < bridge> <blazulite> strong man
21:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In on the forum days I have received comments about programming your own stuff on Github by developers
21:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Strawman? do you call me thin?
21:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In the forum days I have received comments about programming your own stuff on Github by developers
21:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In the forum days I have received comments about programming your own stuff on Github by developers
21:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And that was half a decade ago
21:12 < bridge> <melon> i guess the english translation would be straw-man argument or straw-man fallacy
21:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Konsti made a farcry to deen about adding different shields to ddnet and they implement it, ONLY CUZ I MADE A PICTURE FOR IT
21:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> that is the only contribution you ever get from me
21:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Only cuz that pink rat bastard is a good friend of mine
21:15 < bridge> <melon> Cellegen wants to test maps
21:15 < bridge> <melon> Cellegen says he wants to manually check them
21:15 < bridge> <melon> Cellegen was told that Roby would've written a script personally
21:15 < bridge> <melon> Cellegen says "lazy comment because do it yourself" - even tho Roby never said that
21:15 < bridge> <melon> 
21:15 < bridge> <melon> today's a good day for silly-billy

21:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You forgot
21:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Cellegen says SLEEP
21:19 < bridge> <Teero> @aoetw physics change? why
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> also the thing in your video is not a magic edge
21:20 < bridge> <Teero> you just slipped
21:20 < bridge> <melon> you should run for office in germany
21:21 < bridge> <Aoe> Because it is annoying not to get your DJ back, and many people have died from it.
21:21 < bridge> <Assa> he touches the corner in a subtick and doesn't get his jump back
21:22 < bridge> <Teero> yea, you would need to put the jump refill logic into MoveBox
21:22 < bridge> <Teero> yea, you would need to put the jump refill logic into CCollision::MoveBox
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> it is already in the move box, but only for bouncyness > 0
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> because fix changes physics.
21:22 < bridge> <Teero> really?
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> yes
21:22 < bridge> <Aoe> Ah okay, I can get another demo showing it.
21:22 < bridge> <Teero> ah yea i see
21:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It is. The magic edge occurs on two separate occasions according to Aoe's findings:
21:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 
21:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Both the Tee (circle hitbox) and the Entity (...also circle hitbox) distance is on a perfect 45 degree angle
21:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - A continuous force towards the distance won't distrupt the distance's angle
21:23 < bridge> <Teero> stfu
21:23 < bridge> <Assa> it's not, wrong definition tbh.
21:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How rude from a developer
21:23 < bridge> <Assa> go discuss semantics
21:24 < bridge> <Teero> the first video features a magic edge, the second video doesn't
21:24 < bridge> <Assa> wait until Aoe finds out about magneto soups
21:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I was talking about the first video ofc
21:24 < bridge> <Assa> zoops?
21:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> which I think is more related to the issue Aoe did
21:24 < bridge> <Teero> literally the exact opposite
21:24 < bridge> <Teero> did you not fucking read the issue
21:24 < bridge> <Assa> the issue is about not getting his jump back, the first clip is unrelated
21:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I did. the issue was about double jumping on an "magic edge" (from upwards) resets your velocity
21:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I explained how the first video was indeed magic edge, as well as how it occurs. I can replicate it in Godot, since circle shapes behave exactly like how I explained.
21:26 < bridge> <Assa> yes, this is well known, as hitting the corner perfectly resets your velocity to 0/0
21:26 < bridge> <melon> :Bruh:
21:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> However, it might surprise you
21:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But I also don't agree with the second video
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You always surprise me
21:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I only said that assumably, you were wrong about how magic edges work
21:27 < bridge> <Assa> assumably, the TAS guy knows what he is talking about
21:27 < bridge> <Teero> bro i rewrote the entire fucking physics engine. i have to learn more from you
21:27 < bridge> <Teero> bro i rewrote the entire fucking physics engine. i gues i have to learn more from you
21:27 < bridge> <Teero> bro i rewrote the entire fucking physics engine. i guess i have to learn more from you
21:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Now based on the video, Aoe does it from upwards, which means that the angle it approaches the edge is not a perfect 45 degree turn, so it cannot satisfy the "magic edge" condition
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> yes because his issue is about jump refill
21:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The only way it could reset it's horizontal velocity, if the Tee has been flagged as "grounded"
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> which doesn't happen because he is in no tick grounded, exactly
21:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> which might mean that during a specific spot at standing on the edge, you both get double jump and the "grounded" status
21:29 < bridge> <Aoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416868404345835540/Stuck2_22222222.mp4?ex=68c86907&is=68c71787&hm=870906fc3df772761848001fdcab7fc6b5e3892367f48cac4e783efce513e633&
21:29 < bridge> <Teero> that is a magic edge yes.
21:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Idk the properties a Tee has, you may need to clarify me on this one üòÑ
21:30 < bridge> <Teero> exactly, so please keep out of this convo if you have nothing to contribute
21:30 < bridge> <Assa> he only touches the ground briefly in a subtick in his second clip. At no point he touches the ground at an existing tick
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> That one is simple to explain.
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You are going at an upwards direction, meaning to have you be aligned for a 45 degree angle force, your hook needs to redirect your velocity to be exactly identical for a 45 degree turn which results in the satisfaction of a magic edge:
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> - Your velocity has been redirected to a perfect 45 degree angle towards the bottom right, and the hook applies a specific force on you
21:31 < bridge> <melon> is this AI
21:31 < bridge> <Teero> okay what are you explaining
21:31 < bridge> <melon> it feels like AI
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Do I mistaken about this?
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416869069206061239/image.png?ex=68c869a6&is=68c71826&hm=0afe96e2df6a41df19a37191ecbcced84a8f7d110e19d0dd3ef428fd5a7522c0&
21:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> nothing's open on my side
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> I assume he took something
21:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> No
21:33 < bridge> <Aoe> Is that the same thing here? https://youtu.be/5EQENT5VHcI?si=4dfRGJ6A5HkidQgq&t=1251
21:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Hmmm, that is the opposite of what I expect from this issue, which is that on a specific spot, you don't get a "grounded" status on the Tee, even tho you should've had
21:34 < bridge> <Assa> yes
21:35 < bridge> <louis> after rebase im getting conflicting enum errors, would anyone happen to know why?

21:36 < bridge> <melon> √∂h, did you clean rebuild after rebasing?
21:36 < bridge> <Aoe> Ah okay, I always thought that it was the magic edge, in those cases.
21:36 < bridge> <louis> yeah i rm -rf build and redid cmake
21:36 < bridge> <Assa> magic edge is always the one resetting your speed or making you "clip"
21:36 < bridge> <Assa> I'd report the issue where you can get full stuck in a block @aoetw this one actually deserves a fix as you can't finish if you do this
21:37 < bridge> <kebscs> enums were moved around since its in generated maybe it didnt rebuild properly
21:37 < bridge> <kebscs> enums were moved around, and since its in generated maybe it didnt rebuild properly
21:37 < bridge> <melon> maybe try a `cmake --build . --clean-first`
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> The generated files are now in `generated`. Delete the folder `<BUILD>/src/game`. Then change your added includes to use `generated`.
21:41 < bridge> <melon> maybe a `#pragma once` for generated files?
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Also delete `louis-ddnet/src/game/generated`, it shouldn't have been generated there
21:42 < bridge> <robyt3> They have a header guard, but it was adjusted because the files were moved/renamed
21:42 < bridge> <melon> o
21:42 < bridge> <robyt3> If you still have the old generated files and include both you get duplicate definitions
21:43 < bridge> <louis> thx
21:43 < bridge> <Teero> @aoetw it is a very simple fix but it is a physics change so i don't think admins will approve.
21:44 < bridge> <Teero> @robyt3 are there any docs on the animation system for the tee?
21:44 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416872231195115651/image.png?ex=68c86c98&is=68c71b18&hm=b995e99ca54e5f5da53a5ebde96a7c59c4ec896a117582833be92fbcd19aad71&
21:44 < bridge> <melon> its a very nieche thing, so not sure about it
21:44 < bridge> <Teero> tbh i can imagine that there is some map that uses the fact that you don't get dj on an edge
21:45 < bridge> <melon> also its hard to determine if you want the behaviour changed or if its already considered a feature xd
21:45 < bridge> <Teero> ye
21:45 < bridge> <Teero> @blaiszephyr u in bed right? wanna see my tee?
21:45 < bridge> <melon> maybe a solo part on some random hammerhit map utilizes that, where you slip off an edge without getting dj
21:46 < bridge> <melon> i wonder if you could test that in some way
21:46 < bridge> <Teero> oh yea i can imagine
21:46 < bridge> <Assa> i can also imagine a freeze cannon probing this behavior
21:46 < bridge> <Teero> also it breaks a lot of ranks because slips happen often lol
21:46 < bridge> <robyt3> `animstate.cpp/h` are probably the entire documentation. There used to be some information on the wiki, but I don't know which page or whether it was lost
21:46 < bridge> <Assa> also you will not ground jump even if you get jump back, you can then get the dj back without beeing able to ground jump
21:47 < bridge> <Assa> so the autojump feature would actually fail i guess
21:47 < bridge> <Assa> or you would auto-double jump
21:47 < bridge> <Teero> yea
21:47 < bridge> <Teero> you'd need to put the entire logic into MoveBox
21:47 < bridge> <Aoe> I don't recall any maps using it.
21:49 < bridge> <Teero> have you ever finished a map where you slipped somewhere accidentally and tried to dj but couldn't? that means that rank will be broken xd
21:49 < bridge> <Teero> have you ever finished a map where you slipped somewhere accidentally and tried to dj but couldn't? that means that rank will be invalid with this patch xd
21:49 < bridge> <Assa> true this would even break the teehistorian
21:49 < bridge> <Aoe> Most of the time you die, because you didn't get DJ back. So I don't remember ever finishing with it xD
21:49 < bridge> <melon> meh, we bump teehistorian for those things
21:49 < bridge> <Assa> ye
21:50 < bridge> <Assa> and other times you don't die and finish the map
21:50 < bridge> <Aoe> Besides the video I sent ofc üòÑ
21:51 < bridge> <Teero> this does allow for more optimized tas'es tho...
21:51 < bridge> <melon> <a:ANGRYCAT:1117827853006938153>
21:51 < bridge> <Assa> this would allow for maps which rely on that trick
21:51 < bridge> <Assa> naaah pls don't
21:51 < bridge> <melon> killedgejump maps just got an upgrade peeps!
21:52 < bridge> <Aoe> Isn't bugs only considered a feature, if it can be used to in speedruns? This one just kills you most of the time.
21:52 < bridge> <Aoe> Isn't bugs only considered a feature, if it can be used in speedruns? This one just kills you most of the time.
21:52 < bridge> <melon> i think we're currently trying to evaulate if its worth the effort and if it'll be accepted or not if the effort is done
21:53 < bridge> <melon> from what i got out of this discussion is that fixing that may or may not be heavier than one might expect xd
21:53 < bridge> <Aoe> It should be up to the community, in my opinion. For any physics changes like these
21:53 < bridge> <Assa> fixing this would open another can of worms.
21:53 < bridge> <Assa> fixing this would open another can of worms, as we tried to explain
21:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> explain, but rather just yell at me 90%
21:54 < bridge> <Teero> yea this is annoying
21:54 < bridge> <melon> :baked:
21:54 < bridge> <louis> someone should probably check all the getspeeds and those hold a+jump parts on t0 maps xd
21:54 < bridge> <Assa> @teero777 lets fix it and make a map which you can only finish by chaining double jumps this way
21:54 < bridge> <Assa> make it a TAS detector
21:55 < bridge> <Teero> cor would finish
21:55 < bridge> <Teero> im working on my own physics. i dont want to have anything to do with the original anymore. its so fucking shit
21:55 < bridge> <melon> XD
21:56 < bridge> <Assa> xD just delete old speedtiles
21:56 < bridge> <Teero> 6th grader could have written a better collision system
21:56 < bridge> <melon> ey, the physics are ~20 years old
21:56 < bridge> <melon> :(
21:56 < bridge> <Assa> the guy solo writing teewars back then knew ofc he would create endless discussions
21:58 < bridge> <melon> someone call magnus and ask him whatdahell
21:58 < bridge> <Teero> magnus? wasn't it matricks?
21:58 < bridge> <Teero> > Teeworlds (formerly TeeWars) is a free, open-source sidescrolling multiplayer shooting game originally created by the Swedish developer Magnus Auvinen
21:58 < bridge> <Teero> nvm
21:59 < bridge> <Teero> yea im emailing him
21:59 < bridge> <Teero> to roast him
21:59 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
21:59 < bridge> <Teero> oh matricks is magnus's gh name xd
22:00 < bridge> <Teero> https://github.com/matricks/ryozuki_thinks_i_am_a_fake
22:00 < bridge> <Teero> what is this  @ryozuki XDD
22:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> lol i remember this
22:00 < bridge> <melon> lol i remember this as well
22:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ryozuki thought hes fake when he talked on dc
22:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and he made that to prove hes real xd
22:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:01 < bridge> <Teero> do you have his discord?
22:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> `@mtrcks`
22:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think its this one
22:04 < bridge> <Teero> thank
22:04 < bridge> <Teero> thanks

22:04 < bridge> <melon> 
22:04 < bridge> <melon> indeed
22:04 < bridge> <Aoe> Does that mean that this bug, will never be fixed either? :/ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10685
22:05 < bridge> <Assa> 48K lines PR :justatest:
22:05 < bridge> <melon> hmm, thats expected behaviour
22:05 < bridge> <melon> i dont think anyone will tackle that one :/
22:05 < bridge> <Aoe> Would break both tee historian, and ranks too I guess.
22:06 < bridge> <melon> you can break teehistorian as often as you want, we just increment the version if need be
22:06 < bridge> <melon> 
22:06 < bridge> <melon> ranks however will absolutely be annihalated
22:06 < bridge> <melon> espacially on older maps
22:06 < bridge> <Teero> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/commit/73aa9b71c1d8b5c5065d1e474f13601da3ca6b20#diff-7558badd8a9a936d9881aae37d2141d40d2f5ce4d97a29eab89b9d3cbd7052c9R28
22:06 < bridge> <Teero> yea hHAHA
22:07 < bridge> <melon> :owo:  thats so cute

22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> According to the contributing guide, this should be avoided:
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> 
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> > Breaking backwards compatibility in gameplay:
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> > - Existing ranks should not be made impossible.
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> > - Existing maps should not break.
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> > - New gameplay should not make runs easier on already completed maps.
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> 
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I think if the behavior has no advantage then fixing it could still satisfy "Existing ranks should not be made impossible." if better ranks are simply possible by not using the behavior (accidentally). For example, the "stuck in corner" bug only seems like an annoyance that should be fixed in my opinion.
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> 
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> If existing maps require the use the behavior, then we could add it as a map bug so it would only apply to relevant maps.
22:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would be best to not allow maps to rely on bugs in the first place
22:27 < bridge> <Assa> then we should delete that one map which relies on the speedtile bug

22:37 < bridge> <kebscs> i think this will be nice to fix, ill investigate

22:39 < bridge> <kebscs> for now i see that the smaller jump happens when grenade fire is on the same tick as unfreeze
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> small jump: unfreeze->fire->jump
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> high jump: unfreeze->jump->fire
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe rerunning tee core tick after getting unfrozen, but the fix might be bit jank

22:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data is invalid
22:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it could very well just be CMapItemLayerTilemap::* as a type
23:44 < bridge> <Teero> You can use both sides no?
23:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> *::Data???
23:45 < bridge> <Teero> I mean either the right side of -> or at the start
23:45 < bridge> <Teero> `GameClient()->Layers()->Map()->GetData(*pTMap->pTMapData);`
23:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (this doesnt make sense from a "how do i implement this in c" standpoint)
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if that works
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ill try
23:46 < bridge> <Teero> I wasn't talking about that part of the code xd
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that doesnt make sense
23:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pTMapData is not a member of pTMap
23:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> even if it did work i prefer the derefence at the point of use instead of left

23:49 < bridge> <Teero> `GameClient()->Layers()->Map()->GetData(*(pTMap->pTMapData));` this def works
23:49 < bridge> <Teero> Or what do you even want
23:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pTMapData is not a member of pTMap
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> It's your code not mine
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> You sent that xd
23:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the value of pTMapData is `&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data` or `&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Front`
23:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i sent this
23:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the value of pTMapData is `&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data` or `&CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Front` (and tele is being weird so idk abt that)
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> What type are these
23:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `unsigned char CMapItemLayerTilemap::*`
23:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `using TheseTypes = unsigned char CMapItemLayerTilemap::*`
23:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `using TheseTypes = unsigned char CMapItemLayerTilemap::*;`
23:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a offset into a class/struct
23:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a offset into a container
23:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but typesafe
23:55 < bridge> <Teero> I'm confused. This is valid? How is TheseTypes not ambiguous. What does the star do?
23:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the star means any member of
23:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and the unsigned char means it has to be a unsigned char
23:56 < bridge> <Teero> Okay what happens if I declare a variable with type `TheseTypes`
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in c this would be
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```c
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> void myfunc(struct mycontainer, int offset) {
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>   unsignedf char value = *(unsigned char *)(&mycontainer + offset)
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ````
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in c this would be
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```c
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> void myfunc(struct mycontainer, int offset) {
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>   unsignedf char value = *(unsigned char *)(&mycontainer + offset)
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
23:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
23:56 < bridge> <Teero> oh ok
23:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a ptr type, nullptr or a CMapItemLayerTilemap::*, it probably has the same semantics as any other ptr type
23:57 < bridge> <Teero> Ah okay
23:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a ptr type, nullptr or a CMapItemLayerTilemap::* (in the sense that the * refers to any member of the class), it probably has the same semantics as any other ptr type
23:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont understand why its a ptr and what value nullptr is (probably -1)
23:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its probably so you *can* derefence it otherwise its ambigious whether its meant to be derefcing the value or taking it from the class
23:58 < bridge> <Teero> why tf would you abstract this lol. use void* and put a comment above it
23:58 < bridge> <melon> Just woke up what I miss
23:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the other way to abstract this is to pass in a function which gets the tile from the index
23:58 < bridge> <.dartmonkey> pointer maze
23:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :red loud incorrect buzzer:
23:58 < bridge> <melon> What am I reading
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is perfectly valid
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just not typesfae
23:59 < bridge> <melon> Looks cool, what use case?
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DoLayer(GameClient()->Layers()->GameLayer(), &CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Data);
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DoLayer(GameClient()->Layers()->FrontLayer(), &CMapItemLayerTilemap::m_Front);
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> structs designed by stupid people
23:59 < bridge> <Teero> I actually do this in my physics some times lol to avoid code repetition
23:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (sorry previous ddnet/tw devs, it is stupid how this is done that i have to do this)
