00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> hi@deen, for https://ddnet.tw/mapstats/ personally I would sort in reverse order, top of the page being most recent. list would keep growing and users will keep scrolling.
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could u also show the number of finishes for each map in the month too if possible?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hover the image
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah nice
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> multeasymap üòÖ  25k finishes
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Even crazier, in september 2020 sunny side up had 30k+ in a month, which is 1027 each day
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both august and september üòÑ
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 98402 finishes on that with 11.716min average
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> that would take someone about 2 years and 2 months to get if they played ddrace 24/7
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for multeasymap its even more, you'd need 6 years and 220 days to get 99446 finishes unless my math is wrong
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :feelsamazingman: pretty cool
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> time well spent‚Ä¶ üòâ with friends and others having a fun time
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :PogU: ‚ù§Ô∏è didn't even know
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799075824460234802/unknown.png
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Also there is a lot of stronghold :LuL:
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we need something like this:sendhelp:
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799198625749794846/unknown.png
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> yo deen these grub args dont make my kernel custom right? Because my graphics driver does not work and i read something about nvidia-dmks for custom kernels but I assume i still need nvidia right?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 that is planned, yes
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, not custom
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :gg:  ok
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> btw
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> deepfly should be on and off by one key
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799219005810278410/unknown.png
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> yikes i think i rq debuggig my pc :/ any recommendations where I can buy good pcs and be sure that linux runs smooth on it?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 not so easy I think
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but i have in one key
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Hussainx3 you probably have the noob version of deepfly
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't want to ship the config files for these binds
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm ok
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kynilix> quakenet
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kynilix> wdym noob version @Ama ,
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kynilix> wdym noob version @Ama ?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kynilix> flux btw
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> hey, i was wondering if there are any alternatives ways to build on windows (without using cmake)
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, mingw works too
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Something like this, not sure if still up-to-date: https://github.com/tudelft3d/masbcpp/wiki/Building-on-Windows-with-CMake-and-MinGW
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> thanks, you will get something back for that ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh wait
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you said without cmake, I thought that was without visual studio
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, we only support cmake as the build system
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> aight, thanks anyways
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can we be able to watch demos while on a server?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not without significant changes to the client
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as a workaround, you could open a second client
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> mh ok
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wouldn't call that a workaround but the proper solution
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://man.archlinux.org/
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> heh, that's nice üôÇ
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there any public dns names that I can use to resolve to any IP address
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like e.g. 1.2.3.4.something.com resolving to 1.2.3.4, etc.
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my google-fu fails me
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> There are probably limits to the amount of subdomains you can have
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Might not be possible at all for all ipv4 domains
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 what for?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro the dns server could implement it dynamically
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, you can host your own dns server
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyway, I don't know such a dns server, no
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I see the number 16777216 for BIND floating around the internet
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen certificates for IP addresses
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro nothing would really prevent you from dynamically implementing it. I mean I can describe the algorithm to use in like 1 sentence
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh you're talking about a specific dns server
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro IP addresses can always be interpreted as 32bit uint numbers
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You might not be able to control the dns server
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the one you posted is 1.0.0.0
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh? if you have a domain name, like heinrich5991.de
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can host the dns server on my own hardware
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can completely control what it does
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh, really?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üßê
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is used for breaking the bootstrapping problem if I host the heinrich5991.de domain on heinrich5991.de: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domain_Name_System&oldid=999921407#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone knows if SSPL is a free software license according to fsf?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant find it here https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> elasticsearch moving to sspl
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Google found it @heinrich5991 http://xip.io/
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> google pro
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen thanks, I couldn't find it
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that of course means you trust the hoster of xip.io
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > xip.io runs a custom DNS server on the public Internet.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ofc
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they made a custom dns
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what do u need this for?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Like heinrich said, it's not exactly complicated, a few lines of bash: https://github.com/basecamp/xip-pdns/blob/master/bin/xip-pdns
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki for now mostly a thought experiment, whether it's possible to automatically get some publicly trusted tls certificate on an arbitrary server
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7522/sspl-and-the-open-source-definition
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh no
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Please not the same thing with elastic as with mongodb
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> They removed mongodb from debian
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 open source != free software tho
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> open source and free software generally mean the same thing, I think
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe they're defined by slightly different groups
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 now you will get assassinated by the free software foundation üòÑ
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes; gnu has a stance on that, they're the free software camp
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but check wikipedia:
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> The term "open source", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.[3]
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this explicitly says why its not the same
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> An open-source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified and/or shared under defined terms and conditions.[1][2] This allows end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code, blueprint or design for their own customization, curiosity or troubleshooting needs. Open-source licensed software is mostly available free of 
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also wikipedia
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt say anything about user freedoms
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is probably what those people refered to as political agenda and moral philosophy
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why its not the same
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you describe a difference?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like what can I do with x but not with y
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can *you* tell me a difference
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one concrete
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> <food>
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess there isnt much practical difference, but open source has a different philosophy more based on practical goals i guess
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> üòÇ
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799325882325008404/unknown.png
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there actually are
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol copyleft
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I'm trying to understand the vs code thing. does that mean that the MIT license is not a free software license?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> according to GNU
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> GNU doesn't like permissive licenses like MIT. They want copyleft licenses like GPLv3
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://www.datamation.com/open-source/open-source-debate-copyleft-vs.-permissive-licenses.html
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm aware of them preferring GPL over permissive licenses
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Should better says FSF
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Should better say FSF
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> howeverthat document tries to lay out practical differences between free software and open source software, and gives vscode as an example
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vscode is MIT licensed, does that mean that the FSF does not consider the MIT license to be a free software license?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Those are just words, idk who defines them. I like the terms "permissive" and "copyleft", it's clear what's meant
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fsf considers mit free software
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> license
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but that doesnt mean it makes it a free software
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799334567910572103/unknown.png
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the beginning of the discussion was what is the difference between "free software" and "open source software". I don't see how this discussion could not be about words
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess free software cares about the user freedoms and social aspects of the software and open source just cares about the practical uses
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine a open source implementation of drm software
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if it has a free license
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will never be free software
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/799335072792444978/unknown.png
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Personally I say open source because I'm sick of this FSF propaganda against he word "open source"
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> free software raise up
21:32 <+SnowFox> Welcome b3z from quakenet -> freenode -> Matrix.

21:41 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> we were just trying stuff with matrix and irc ^^ quite nice how everything is connected these days
21:44 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z[m]> but i figured we need a slack server to connect to. And a telegram group... xD
21:45 <+SnowFox> No thanks to either of those...
21:45 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> :D
21:46 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> Now SnowFox and me chatting via 4 querys + #ddnet and a couple minutes ago also ingame tw. There is no way this is enough
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you need to connect chat rooms, I suggest using https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
