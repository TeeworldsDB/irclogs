13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> where is the code that change player velocity to fall down with gravity after being freezed ?
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> where is the code that modifies player velocity to fall down with gravity after being freezed ?
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> after being freezed?
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> They simply don't do inputs anymore when frozen.
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> @fokkonaut Yes after character its freezed, velocity starts to get near to gravity so tee start to fall down to the ground. There must be a code which applies gravity to freezed character
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is no such thing xd
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Awww I thought I can change the physics to increase gravity after being freezed
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Of course you can
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But you have to write it yourself, it doesnt exist in the normal ddnet code
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Right thank you!
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mohsen7s you could just insert tune zone with gravity settings on all the freeze - but that would work just for ddrace
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'd need to check in the gamecore while applying gravity
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why is the laser invisible in ddnet when you shoot straight up while falling?
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its also in my 0.7 port, but not in vanilla/other gametypes
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> For me it works. Or do you mean falling with insane fast speed?
15:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, normal speed
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay weird
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its only in my mod and in ddnetpp
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon l
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u know why?
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet++ is a mess xd and ur mod inspired by this mess...
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> once i desided that selfrile is too easy when using a straight wallshot while  falling down so i made it invisible
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut might have something to do with projectile extrainfo
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 in 0.7?
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a laser shot
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> laser is no projectile
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and extrainfo is from ddnet
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk maybe they adopted it
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xddd
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut it's probably related to NetworkClipped()
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> o yea, right
