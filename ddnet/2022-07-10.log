00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> before there where 100 ninja sword particles falling down on the side of you ðŸ˜„ but they disappeared much faster
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess we have to experiment a little more with the effects to come up with a better one
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also agree that the freezebar could be thinner... because it is not really that impotent, to be so thick
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Max> well that might be true
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Max> sry if i sounded agressiv or anything ðŸ˜… Ty for the help ill just let you experiment for now youll figure something out
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> was good feedback, thank you ðŸ™‚
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Max> ok Ty for cooperation
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Skeith do you use really dark entities or something btw?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995451467903275018/unknown.png
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ya basically
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah I see how you could say the bar is bright
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> does the vanilla hud not look too bright? I think the white outline is the bright part but that's just the tw ui style
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> does the vanilla hud not look too bright? I think the white outline is the bright part but that's just the tw hud style
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> which elements? like the time etc? Not following
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hearts and shields
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> same style
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I had them disabled
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> also edited
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I guess my only real gripe is the lack of option to make it more transparent, which is already being resolved. The size of it should probably be reduced as well tho
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's already smaller than the stars were btw
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya, but the stars didn't follow you
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and default game.png stars are incredibly bright too xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And I ofc had those edited ðŸ˜…
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they don't follow you but they move around a lot and spin
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> So ya, realistically my only gripe is the lack of setting to make it transparent, having to manually edit the transparency myself
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> So ya, realistically my only gripe is the lack of setting to make it transparent, having to manually edit the transparency myself
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> 
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Again, already being added so :feelsamazingman:
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it's easy enough to edit and share
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you don't get a setting for transparency on any other hud element so I don't see why this should have one
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Btw... we had a talk lately about energy savings xD we could introduce a dark mode someday... with dark entities and dark game.png/hud.png ...
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Cause it's more important I guess, it's directly in your face
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's less in your face than the stars which also didn't have one
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Btw... we had a talk lately about energy savings xD we could introduce a dark mode someday... with dark entities and dark game.png/hud.png ... (not really for energy saving, but I guess darke mode gets more and more popular in the internet...)
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Btw... we had a talk lately about energy savings xD we could introduce a dark mode someday... with dark entities and dark game.png/hud.png ... (not really for energy saving, but I guess dark mode gets more and more popular in the internet...)
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oled is barely used for computer monitors
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> We're in talks of improving the overall feel of the game, these settings would've been nice for both sides
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I just never really thought about it until now, should be expected that changes make people think about it more
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen does it not save a negligible amount of power to have pixels emitting less light?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on LCD no
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and backlit LED with LCD same
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think because it is a HUD directly on the Tees it is ok to make it transperent, like in other games you also have HUDs on player that have not full opacity, so you do not fall out of the world
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only saves with OLED, MicroLED, or local dimming
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think because it is a HUD directly on the Tee it is ok to make it transperent, like in other games you also have HUDs on player that have not full opacity, so you do not fall out of the world
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nameplates
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they are big and white and follow
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> true
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but in other games I already saw them transparent
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> like we do for other teams
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's probably a good thing this all happened, it's like a fresh new look at how things affect your gameplay, ironing it out and making it feel as comfortable as possible for everyone, even if the feedback is a bit biased because sudden change is weird. The freezebar does have more information, so that's cool.
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you'll never please everyone
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But I guess text in general is easier to read with full opacity
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Sure, but pleasing a majority is ideal. Can get to that point by listening to some biased points
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think all things considered there's nothing to complain about on the bar that isn't already a "problem" on some other hud element
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Lol I searched for some example game screenshots and found this https://i.imgur.com/ETpnGTz.png?1 as one result xDD I did not even know 0.7 has a speed meter too
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That looks like a modification called Teecomp
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the website it was linked <https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12918>
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see xD
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see xD, interesting
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think transparency options for things you can alr edit transparency will get a bit confusing
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also more for people who try making a skin for it to worry about
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I don't see how allowing the user to adjust transparency would be worse for the artist?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> because they are perfectionists too ðŸ˜„ and want that it looks good in any settings xD
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then you have to design a bar that will also look good with transparency, or don't care that it will be ugly as heck for people with certain configs
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's like with skin coloring
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I guess
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I don't know enough about art to argue this point, and it's extremely subjective. ðŸ˜…
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think it's just an important setting for the user, and caring about the user is more important
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well i just think two ways to edit transparency is redundant, transparency for hud etc is fine but for gameskins it doesbt make sense
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> the freezebar feels like a HUD element
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but stars don't?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Read everything I said above
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok sec
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait theres too much text nvm
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> this basically
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> zhould remove weak too ðŸ‘€
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Oxygen Not Included is also a 2D platformed that uses "bars" under specific game elements, basically everything that can get damage I think
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> they do not use transparency on the bars, but on pickup notifications xD  That could actually also be a way how we could handle our powerups. by text that fades upwards and gets transparent, or symbols (issue for that: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5510>)
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995461229990654112/unknown.png
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995461230636568593/unknown.png
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a transparent text snd bit of particles on powerups would be very good
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only downside is the text spam when u go thru a badly mapped part wity many powerup spam but dont tbink it should matter
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> generally bars show important information and are never transparent, health, progress and such
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i agree, but by the time someone is in situations where transparency of a freezebar might matter, they should already know a bit about the game and how to edit textures
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or in other words it doesnt have a big of an effect on noobs
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's just a massive QoL for the user
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and only some decent ish players who are trying to "optimize" every setup of their game
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> so it's worth
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes but not good for devs nor artists, imo there are more important things to work on
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if the look of the default bar bothers you then you have an incentive to edit it or find another skin
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think the benefit to work is worth
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You're already having backlash against the change, I think it's very much worth the effort
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't think alpha would help much with backlash
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, the point is trying to find a middle ground to where people prefer it / can live with it
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The goal is to not completely revert back to the previous method
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I haven't really seen any other complains about the appearance of the bar itself, just the fact that it exists
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Making your loyal fanbase happy is important ðŸ˜…
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> maybe we can make the freeze bar flash brighter at the period when stars would normally shoot to imitate previous behavior
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> just an idea
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you want it happy then you need to just not change anything
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, that's also not a good thing
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's valuable to make changes to improve / keep things fresh
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Freezebars can improve, it just needs some polishing
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The improvement is that it gives you more accurate information
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I honestly don't see what could be improved on the bar itself, only the freeze animation
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> make small tick marks each sec
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> when do you ever need to know how many seconds are left xD
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> 255 second freezes be like
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you only care about when you unfreeze
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> lol black bar
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for skips
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or speedrun optimizing
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> how would you use it?
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ah yes this tee needs to be 2 seconds until unfreeze for us to pass through this part optimally
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> freeze resets every second basically so u can get someone outside of freeze right before it resets to get a 2 second freeze time (after exiting freeze)
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> is that true?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ofc
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea it is
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can just see how much of the bar is left
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u cant calc 2/3 tho
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean its functionally same as stars in that aspect rn since it jumps to full every second iirc
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but tick marks would make it better over stars
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> u can just see there's 2/3 of the bar left
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hard to
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> in the moment
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> how so
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do u see exactly 2/3 lol
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> easy enough to tell things like 1/2 or 2/3
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> by eye
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not a genetic benefit that humans can find exactly 2/3 of a bar
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it adds a new layer of skill to the game :justatest:
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im not saying it would be a huge improvement over eyeing it, just saying itd be an improvenent over the stars for speedrubnera probably
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you don't even need to know exactly 2/3 or so
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you'll just see if there is more or less left than you want
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well u dont even speedrun neither do i really so should ask someone who does
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> can't you just edit freezebar texture to add ticks?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> actually I think stars don't show you the freeze cycle at all
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the middle part is 1 long quad so no
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> oh
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> yeah I guess it's animated
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think they emanate every freeze reset
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but when you leave freeze it's always 2 I think?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u have ti leave freeze between 3 stars and 2 stars to not reset
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> after you leave freeze u never get 3 ticks
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u leave at "2.5" stars youll have 2.5 sec of freeze but if u leave at 2.98 or 2.02 youll essentially get  3 or 2 second
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but in both cases you get 2 more ticks
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's just about where exactly you are between 2 and 3
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean u still have to guesstimate the 1 second for stars
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but atm its the same with the bar
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i was saying the tickmarks would be a technical improvement
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can essentially imagine the tickmarks after a while tho
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and to less technical players this would be useless so just bloat
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so it's still more precise than stars how it is now
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> bar look cooler but skin when
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> easy to skin stars
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> forgor how big it was but 1 or 2 pixel from top and bottom of bar shoukdnt be too bad
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait yea how is the bar graphic generated
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be a lot nicer if it was just 2 overlays, one for border and one for the fluid rendered under
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are 2 end caps and the middle part is stretched
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> right now it seems hack for no reason
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hacky*
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0.7 does it like that as well but the end caps just disappear fully xD
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #5558 already got the transparency thing done, it should get in soon
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5558
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why copy 0.7 tho :<
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and great now add opacity for every weapon and hud element lmao
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now that ur at it
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm also looking for a nice way to add that for the people that want even more details
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> add opacity for louis
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> so i can remove louis
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I demand opacity setting for nameplates and strong/weak and direction arrows
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think uhh
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would make everything w lot easier
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for everyone
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fluid
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> blue stuff
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> just edit image
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> should be easier in code, easier for artists to make custom ones
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> :poggers:
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything except nameplates can be edited in the assets
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so can the freeze bar
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> i canr beleieve this guy is the skin leafer anf he dont know edit imagr
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry, you don't have an angry mob of people behind your demand
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The freeze bar should have different treatment I think, it's more important, and there are already customization options for the elements you mentioned.
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > would be a lot nicer if it was just 2 overlays, one for border and one for the fluid rendered under
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if we are changing features is this possible
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ðŸ˜ 
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i need someone to back me up on that
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think for sure it will be much better for asset creators
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Transparent nametags would be cool tho.
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and in code all u habe to do is like
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> renderTop()
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> renderBottom()
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> [ render less every tick or smth idk ]
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, how is it easier?
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for the current one dont you have to grab a small quad and stretch it out
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> then render 2 caps
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with an overlay and the fluid bottom, its a lot simpler
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and a lot easier for gfx designers
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with the current way it doesnt seem possivle to customize the middle of the freezebar
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, yep that is indeed not possible
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> additionally, with the overlap method, you can make tickmarks in your asset manually for anyone who wants it
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just add ticks to the top image with an image editor
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't make tickmarks like that, freeze time is not constant
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh true
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hm
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess 99% its 3 seconds but for some maps i guess not
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Aight, I have a plan... We remake ddrace...
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also if you have auto rendered ticks you might have a completely white bar on that awayza map lmao
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes ticks bad idea
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we must appease the old guard, old guard wants ticks
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if we get the pro players to defect to our faction we can get even more changes in
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Taking a page out of Neville Chamberlain's book
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ticks won't work with ridiculous freeze times and also they'll be a nightmare for customizing the bar
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think oldheads would only need 3sec ticks so you should adopt the louis method ðŸ¥º ðŸ¥º
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> (I imagine the ddnet way would be to hard-code the ticks as quads and not an asset that you can edit)
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll let @c0d3d3v think about that one, I don't think he'd want to mess with the rendering
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was imagining subtle red/white couple px thick lines
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if this is actually gonna be a thing then please use something from the image where the height of it can be matched to the bar
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah the height of the bar isn't constant
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ye also please no red xD
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, new plan, no ticks, so very annoying
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> :>
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah i wouldnt auto render ticks
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just make it easy to add in custom gameskins
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should talk to @c0d3d3v when he is here, I'm not messing around with the way they ended up rendering the bar
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The risk of lyme disease isn't worth it anyways :troll:
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think eventually some pro player will come out with a skin for it that everyone will use because it makes edgehooks easier and everyone stops crying at the default one
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'll see myself out
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> excuse the poor drawing cus im on a phone but like
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995474718691967077/Screenshot_20220709-174043.png
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> customizing it to stuff like that would be dope
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yisus> Ã‘
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I guess that's not possible the way it's done right now
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The advantage of this current way is that it takes very little space in the hud.png
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess the bars could be something like this if there is enough demand for editing it
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995475151758037012/unknown.png
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> then it can be asymmetric and stuff
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One issue is these things aren't stretchable
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait i forgor what's the current one look like
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ingame
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> for now we went with the way that was easier to code
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995475425297977445/unknown.png
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the current seems harder to code xd
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The current bars can be stretched forever, but if it's asymmetric in the x direction it just can't be stretched at all
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait how is it 2 colors?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> separate middle sections is more complex
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ninja timer
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the current way, the middle quad can just get squashed over time
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesnt require cutting and stretching tho
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i thought it had to do with masking
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not sure if it uses clipping or anything like that
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it may just be clever maths to make the quad narrower while the texture stays in place
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think clipping would be specific to each renderer
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how are the ends treated then?
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/freezebars.cpp It's not a horribly long piece of code if you want to take a look
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> permalink: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/444603faf63df2e3dec5ff20a469ab8565d02028/src/game/client/components/freezebars.cpp
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not a huge fan of how it looks like, but it is readable ðŸ˜›
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/game/client/components/hud.cpp#L641 0.7 one is much more concise, atleast imo
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it also doesn't work correctly
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the end pieces just disappear instead of getting clipped
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't they use tiny end pieces so that's not very obvious?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's quite obvious once you see it
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they just disappear xD
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also from what I can tell this is the case
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really need better documentation for the graphics functions
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really need better documentation for everything actually ðŸ˜„
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you draw a pattern on the bar it becomes way more obvious how it's rendered
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995484650774474803/bar.webm
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> OHHHH
05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> there could be a third sprite that gets drawn over top
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> please, prioritize the api
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> getting to this took me 5 hours
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995535652496080916/unknown.png

05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> (this, for who's curious, is me logging the last 10 map finishes for me aka Sans3108 cuz i was trying to test a function that takes time.time and returns time.timeString)
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> probably should change the names of those but eh
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf 500 moving parts
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> javascript :monkaS:
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> :GUN:
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> you were saying?
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> my whole idea was to make a better ddnet bot, and to do that i need some sorta way to interact with the api, so i decided to make a wrapper for it and publish it on npm :KEKW:
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> and it's hard
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i woulda used any other lang if it wasnt for the fact i only know to do stuff in js and also discord.py is outdated
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i woulda used any other lang if it wasnt for the fact i only know to do stuff in js and also discord.py is outdated/doesnt cover slash commands
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> my whole idea was to make a better ddnet bot, and to do that i need some sorta way to interact with the api, so i decided to make a wrapper for it and publish it on npm so i can use it in the bot :KEKW:
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddnet
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> nowhere near done
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> player part of things is almost done, possibly with bugs (i tried to check everything)
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> Hey, what are the oldest existing solo r1 ranks?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> Hey, what are the oldest current solo r1 ranks?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah u said that before, i remember, makes sense now
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> doesn't matter anyway.
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Thinking about it for a bit I'd assume its 3 things that bottleneck in ddnet when zooming out far enough:
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1. instacing is like a loop, so requires a powerful singlethread (as said grouping vertices together improves it slightly, so I assume drivers are already pretty optimized for instancing)
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2. more load on the vertex shader. Even tho 2 quads next to each other instead of one big quad including both doesn't make a difference in fragment shader, it will create at least a small overhead in the vertex shader. So if you do it few thousands(or LOT more, more about that in 3.) it adds up to each other.
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3. if you have a 1920x1080 screen, and watch BIT3 fully(without borders) one layer is already 1400x3900 tiles. For simplicity 3900x1400. I mean kinda obvious what i want to say for you. we often draw multiple quads for a single pixel.
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I assume 3. is indeed the main bottleneck in fact. The others might make the FPS fewer compared to taking your approach up to a certain zoom level, but its not like the vertex shader is totally slow, in the end you usually have less vertices than fragments. Except for 3. ðŸ˜„
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I looked in renderdoc and see the insanity of overlapping quads
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995595749234593792/unknown.png
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 26â€¯070â€¯911 JUST for the top left border
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my screen can only hold maximum of 3â€¯686â€¯400 pixels
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> impressive my GPU still renders it at 30fps xdd
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that probs shows how optimized the rasterizer is for discarding overlapping pixels anyway
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> going to move here since it's topical
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think at max we should accept a value like 110 or 120 for ui_scale. anything above that is unreasonable to get right for smaller resolutions
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what is the smallest resolution we actively support for UI?
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its resolution independent
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also if we want ui_scale, then to downscale
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet's ui is big af
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> even with different aspect ratios?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont see how that's possible
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> height is always the same
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so more width just gives more size left and right
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> on 1080 ui_scale 110 connect button overflows. it should adjust to the main browser column width
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995611178615185468/unknown.png
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but doesnt make the text bigger or smth
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it is also disjointed with the y-position of the Refresh button
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is this always the case?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh yes it is, because of the text
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no its not the case, also ui_scale is gone isnt it?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's additional space above here to fit it so it is inline
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995611469070729296/unknown.png
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is agnostic of ui_scale
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can you show me a picture of your windows explorer?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this has nothing to do with ui_scale btw xd
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> windows explorer?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> file explorer
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> deen asked me to try to fix it if i still want it and that a PR could be accepte
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> deen asked me to try to fix it if i still want it and that a PR could be accepted
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am currently on 16.1 to test
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but honestly, our UI will break regardless
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even 5:4 is often already a problem
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is this a pain point because of the lack of a flex system?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can we just create a separate issue for this?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why do we need it bigger?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet your file explorer is much smaller scale
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and return ui_scale when it can adopt itself to that
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am still not sure what you mean by file explorer
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> game browser?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I have some guess about how the UI works in this game
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> flex system will create many additional rows where you dont expect it or if you dont wrap rows, it will scale the ui elements and thus making the text smaller again
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> correct me if I'm wrong
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a loose loose situation xD
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I used to do UI dev with tkinter
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and there was a component system called place that used coordinates
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> our ui is basically split this rect in half and put stuff
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> are we doing math based on the resolution and aspect ratio to "place" the components where they should be, relative to some distance
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont talk about fancy gui frameworks xd
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am making a comparison to try to see what it is it
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am making a comparison to try to see what it is like
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah sounds all good and nice, but u forget one thing... nobody would start with an UI as big as DDNet's
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not advocating for this
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's what i am trying to say. downscale ok
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but upscale its already mobile friendly af, bcs everything is so huge
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it can still be upscaled as ive explained
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> components need to react to these adjustments
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for example, the one issue i cited
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the skins list
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it overflows into the button row below, with the search bar
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, but i talk more about navigations
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that will break
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it can ofc be adjusted so the skins list is less high
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what navigation? the browser?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the menu
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nav
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the main menu?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> open your client in 5:4 and u'll see there are lots of places where its already lacking space
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the nav in the server browser
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would like to consider areas in 5:4 with default ui_scale to be separate concerns than fixing ui_scale lol
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like this magic <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5600>
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995613559159529512/unknown.png
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u either wrap it by rows
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> okay so browser ui_scale lol
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ur downscale, and loose either text or also downscale text
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what magic?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> here is 1080 again but at 120
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995613824684146728/unknown.png
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> same issue, also friends is now clipping
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the tabs are not an issue
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the auto size thing xD
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will try a smaller resolution but ryo said it was not resolution dependant
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i dont get what the PR has to do with auto sizing, am i missing smth? xD
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with template it can pass the size of the dst array
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u dont need to put sizeof
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995614140871741460/unknown.png
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not really new to me ðŸ˜„
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it is to tw xd
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the size of the elements aren't as i said
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just the space u have left and right
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basically from your whole quad u split
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i recommended that we cap an accepted value for ui_scale
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> up to 110 it's pretty reasonable
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there are just some small fixes we would need to make
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> upscaling will break stuff xD
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our UI is build for 5:4 worst case
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we could go up to 120 with some more serious effort
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u upscale it will break stuff, that simple
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will test on 5:4 and tell you how we could fix it
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why do u need ui_scale over 100 tho?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u havent told me yet
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what application on your computer scales as big as teeworlds does
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my IDE is like 5 times smaller
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ui_scale in the first place (as im sure) was created for accessibility reasons
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just because someone doesn't care now doesn't mean it's not useful
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I am not great with a mouse, i like having large components if I can afford it
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but who has so bad eyes, what are glasses made for then xD
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my discord is set to 110 zoom
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is a zoom option that ships with all major browsers....
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but its still smaller than ddnet i bet
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not arguing about how small or large ddnet already is
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah and using it sometimes breaks websites
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im just saying there was a feature and it existed and now it does not
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u scale it as much that its as big as ddnet especially
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and it was removed because it was broken despite being fixable
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> having to restate this many times is exhausting
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its too costly to maintain, full of bugs, and a legacy of old times
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will again test on 5:4
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also 5:4 is already very broken on 100 ui_scale
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "fixable"... Well that depends on your defintion of fixable
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And probably holds back devs implementing ui changes
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why is this a concern about ui_scale then
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i already find the 5:4 limit a problem
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ui is already hard enough to do
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wastes so much space on 16:9 often
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Too many things to consider
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems like you guys just want me to shut up. deen was the only one who responded and he said if i could come up with a list of fixes and try to fix them, a PR could be considered
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this discourages me
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Remove support for 5:4 too xZ
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I told u ny reasons
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how about you just make a second unrelated UI?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mobile UI
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats what websites do too
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> simply bcs its not worth the effort
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you just gave a bunch of reasons after i said i would try to come up with fixes for
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is 5:4 on ui_scale 100
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995616041944223774/unknown.png
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cannot fix code maintainability by adding back ui_scale since it spreads across all places
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why is connect not aligned?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it is on latest client
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it does not have this issue in 16:9
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> am i to believe that removing ui_scale changes ui grid on 100?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> am i to believe that removing ui_scale changes ui grid even on 100?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure how that makes sense to me
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Otherwise the changelog is unclear
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "Remove ui_scale"
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's another item here
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995616754191573053/unknown.png
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno what u talk about, but anyway, just dont give me an even worse experience on 16:9 xD
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Prevent UI lockups
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is this somehow related to what you are saying xD
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our UI already looks shit and sucks code wise, dont make it even worse xD
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> with the connect button
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doesnt make sense still
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im responding to this
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's not aligned on 5:4
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it is
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wait
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i test
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in .1 it's not. on latest, it may be, but that doesnt make sense according to the changelog
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is no such "fix ui layout" item there
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995617103581294652/unknown.png
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i havent checked the diff
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am not great at this
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me it is
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will test on .2
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> verbinden!
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i was translating german, and now i use client in german
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs im gangsta
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Karte spielen" xddd
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Denglish is best
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mixing english where german sounds stupid
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's also aligned for
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's also aligned for me
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what change caused this?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> surely it was not something random
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone was already fixing ui
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah dunno dude xD sometimes ppl complain about 5:4 being broken and then smth fixes it
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> deen often plays 1:1 he'd probs notice breakages anyway
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> was existing UI changed in addition to the new UI?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is that what the first change is?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> new UI? XD
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> HUD
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> LOL, how did we end up talking bout HUD now xD
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sigh
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u were talking about a HUD_scale the whole time or what?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am trying to track down this discrepancy
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is nothing in the changelog that suggests this misalignment was targetted
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ui_scale was removed --> all randomness gone
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so again
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my question is
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dude i dunno why this single button is magically fixed
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ui_scale 100 =/= ui_scale removed
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but who cares
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its completly unrelated to ui_scale then
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how does removing ui_scale entirely related to how things looked on ui_scale 100?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> should i believe they are different?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its one button xD
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe someone simply fixed it
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's what im asking
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone was working the UI area or else ui_scale 100 does something specific from whatever was done to remove it
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my impression was that removing ui_scale would make it act the same as if it were set to 100
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if that cannot be easily clarified then i forfeit
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it does, have u restarted ur client?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> after changing ui_scale?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> one moment
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the connect button for example is cached
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> most browser text too
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want to have it automatically trigger a resize event
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs changing ui_scale is basically that
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well im just observing a version (.1) with 100 ui_scale with a version (.2) without any concept of ui_scale
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and checking 5:4 on each
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and they have different behavior
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno dude xD
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u talk about connect and refresh button
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest is 100% same isnt it?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then the answer is, someone fixed these buttons
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not more, not less
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i can take another look but im not sure, i dont even think that helps my case about proving the fix was not rly mentioned
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if someone took the time to fix UI and it wasn't mentioned, could have easily made a handful of fixes for ui_scale and kept the damn thing
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and since i cant figure that out im giving up
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why does it matter if the fix is not mentioned
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the changelog is mostly for important stuff
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> because the argument is that you would HAVE to fix it in order to keep it
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone WAS already fixing UI
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> omg
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf xDDD
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the argument is that ui_scale makes ui dev way harder
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its another thing to look out for
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> UI is changed pretty much once per week
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cap ui_scale to 110 or 120, do current fixes for it
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anything added should be flex anyway or we tackle issues on 5:4 and have a scrollable tab system idk
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> currently you gotta look for: "will a longer text break this", "how will it look on all other resolutions" "will ui_scale break this even more" + ui code being a mess
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just for adding a button
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am not giving direct fixes here im just pointing out my philosophy
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is this also why freeze stars were removed? it breaks something existing?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just give us HTML + CSS renderer
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then we dont need to talk about this anymore
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they were changes
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to make more sense to new players
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are now snowflakes and no sword
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they were changed
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is there honestly no such gdl ui framework for making it web-like
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i find that hard to believe
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we may be able
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it might not be called gdl
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to usee IMGUI
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am so tired im sorry
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if it can be made to look teeish
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is, but it has the worst license i've ever seen
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this uses mit
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ultralight-ux/ultralight
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would rather use imgui than a html renderer xd
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> It's unrelated. UI lockup is bug where you can't use any buttons or other UI elements anymore.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets face it html is ez, html is smth everyone used before
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> html renderers are highly optimized
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks probably if we limit ourselves to just html yeah
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without js
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's ultralight, but the license sucks hard
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD thanks, looks interesting
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats 5head
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :5Head:
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the connect and refresh buttons are the only cached rects in the UI so it's likely that those were also broken in combination with ui_scale
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the only ui_scale specific issues ive found were those buttons and the skins list
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> with 16:9*
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats exactly how I coded it ðŸ˜„ first it stretched , then it clips. But to allow more customisation we should maybe only clip, so the customised stuff is not stretched.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and the "friends" button in the browser is cut off but only on 5:4
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats exactly how I coded it ðŸ˜„ first it stretches , then it clips. But to allow more customisation we should maybe only clip, so the customised stuff is not stretched.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at either 110 or 120 scale cant remember
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could count the resolution list as another issue but i think that is intentional so they are guaranteed to be accessible
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone can correct me though
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could count the resolution list as another issue (in that they dont respond to ui_scale) but i think that is intentional so they are guaranteed to be accessible
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> If you want to fix ui_scale then start from the other "direction". Instead of trying to fix the mess that was the existing ui_scale everywhere, find *concrete* issues with the current UI and make well thought out changes to address those issues.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> then this conversation is pointless as i suggested originally and im redirecting this topic to the idea that we need a better ui system as a whole
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whew
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what a ride
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> well, I'm not against a Java swing frontend :troll:
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only problem with this is that with the current approach we can have an arbitrarily long bar, with the other approach that's no longer the case
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm against it :raise
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mobile discord strikes again. Thank god for electron
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wow your mobile phone must have 200GB of RAM
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good phone
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this was nearly an hour ago...
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For something like ui scale to be maintainable we'd need something like rem/em in css. A relative unit of size
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i imagine placements are attempted this way
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently we size a lot of things hust by pixels
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can we say the same about widths of components?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just*
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if components are organized based on aspect ratio + resolution im not sure why widths couldn't also be done this way
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i must be insane or something but it doesn't seem odd to me to resize the buttons / offset for smaller screens
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As far as I remember, no. We split larger panels proportionally, but the elements inside them usually have set pixel sizes
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah so that seems like a fix regardless of the existence of a ui_scale but ui_scale took the hit for it anyway
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it is a fix, but it's a fix that requires a huge amount of work
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it can be created as an issue
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean I would just repeat, the small middle peace
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will put with big fireworks emojis ðŸŽ‡ PLEASE BRING BACK UI_SCALE IF THIS IS COMPLETED THANK YOU ðŸŽ‡ just to make sure i am not further undone by this "convenience" afforded by its original removal
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/no-bugs-bunny-nope-gif-14359850
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sry i had
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to properly suport a whole range of ui scales you'll also need something akin to css breakpoints, to hide/move around stuff after a certain scale/resolution is hit
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am only thinking to cap ui_scale to 120 and fix all of the problems introduced with thaqt
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am only thinking to cap ui_scale to 120 and fix all of the problems introduced with that
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah lets do ddnet mobile first design
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Learath2  can you send me the hud.png for experiments...
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like here if the refresh button became an icon after a certain scale, it'd look far better
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The one I drew the pattern on? I already deleted it
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ðŸ˜¦
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it was just a 45degree zigzag. You can make your own
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also made all the transparency white so I can check sizes and stuff
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> done
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> bye
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes i know it's not written in the client as 1.16.2
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i changed it on web
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Since https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5032   automatic weapons can fire every tick instead of every 2. 
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> here some random tries on fireball map https://streamable.com/10a6qi   can also be seen on every fly map
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do we want to add a limit to automatic weapons so they can only fire every second tick? to get the old behaviour back?

11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Zwelf
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess in the end we do not really want very long bars. Ravie would also like that the texture matches the size ingame, so I think in the end it would be better to have the outline seperate from the fill. and just make them in the texture so wide as I render it
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> We could also increase the reload timer on that map?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should be easy enough to do if you choose to do it like that
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes. original I made it that way because we wanted to have a long ninja bar and used the same texture. ... but now there is no need to
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> This input was already possible before the patch by spamming +fire, e.g. by binding it to the mouse wheel. So making automatic weapons only shoot every second tick wouldn't disable speedrunners to shoot every.
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Which fly maps do you mean? Like Justrocketfly?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Disclaimer, I did not debug if it really fires every tick. It just feels faster, I'm not totaly sure
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> every fly is the name
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That sounds good to me
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @skills ^
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> teams should not be forced to do solos
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> or only once
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "just every fly" is the name
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> nothing related to the above discussion, just wanted to debate coz I think it's boring to redo solo everytime you fail a map
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> especially when you speedrun it
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how would this be implemented? i dont see any practical way that doesn't affect ranks
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I meant noob-filters
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> sry
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> much different than solos lol
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I thought you meant mid map solos too
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would require map spec and noob-filter flag could likely be spoofed without proper auth
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> non-fix?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> every map with a filter would need tagging in the map format
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd require a special tp target to just before the noobblocker
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and there may be edge cases where the filter moves cleanly into the map
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> either by speed or by force
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess the map is also not a lot harder xD I can not do the first part easy also with the old inputs.... It is just a little different as before. And ranks that are made with such a bind are now possible without such a bind.
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> where it is not possible to create a destination such that it does not affect ranks
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> idk Fireball map feels so weird and it feels like inputdelay when shooting rn
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wasn't there a report about input delay in latest?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> + why even change it anyways not needed imo
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it should not feel like delay... should feel more faster. since inputs get handled one tick earlier
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> idk this change also made all maps like this different u can do faster ranks
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> I tried it before it felt like input delay xd
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah there was a report but it was related to CPU/GPU
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> actually I think it is fine with the new input handling...  Gives the advantage of fast inputs to everyone. And I think the map is also doable, at least there are a lot of finishes in last days on that map
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> actually I think it is fine with the new input handling...  Gives the advantage of fast inputs to everyone. And I think the map is also doable, at least there are a lot of finishes in last days on that map (and I finished the first part after x tries wuhuu xD)
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> it's way more trashy to play imo
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will debug the automatic weapons, if they really fire faster then before... mabye it is only subjective feeling.
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will debug the automatic weapons later this evening, if they really fire faster then before... mabye it is only subjective feeling.
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> It does fire faster 100% sure we compared my Fireball demo vs other
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you think fast input handeling is generally more trashy ?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or only on teleport flys
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, from what I remember when I skimmed that PR. It shouldn't be any faster than back when you could bind the mousewheel
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> Hmm idk only tried on Fireball it feels shit
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ok
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> then we can just increase the fire delay on that map
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes but yopu can just hold left click... as I did in my video
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats what most do
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> did you use a mouse wheele bind back in you old demo?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> no
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its definitely a physics change, if you shoot faster now while holding. Never the less whether you could achieve the same behaviour before with tricks
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That makes sense. Not quite sure how we'd reintroduce the behaviour though
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then probably go a step back for now?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a teehistorian change not sure of the consequences of a revert
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 and @Zwelf would know I guess
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We saw you, Zwelf
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Ye, looking back at the PR rn
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Reverting that commit would make teehistorian files not reproducible again. They currently are AFAIK. While writing the PR I thought it would only make a change when the tee respawns. We now know it also changes the automatic weapon when holding fire (every second shot probably).
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> a special tile?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> well that would therefore need to be taken in consideration during the mapping
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and tbh I can't think of any maps like that?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> every single map would have to be tagged with where to teleport the tee if they have done the noob filter just for this change
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and this place may not be sensible for every map
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> no just a new spawn tile that mappers will put after solo
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i suppose on a per-map basis this could be done
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what maps in particular right now do you want it for?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> firestone
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> You could allow players to set a "checkpoint" at any point before they touch start which can be teleported to after restarting
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Might not work for all noob filters but probably many
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Although imo doing the noob filter consistently is also part of the challenge but I can see how its annoying for speedrunning
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> nah it'd be too complicated
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> a new tile fits better
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> what?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> A new tile and tagging every map is certainly more complicated?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> i don't get why we'd need to tag every map tho
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This might make it possible to get to unintended places if not done VERY carefully
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> it's literally just a condition on kill
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Alternative, save tee state the tick before touch start and use that as the checkpoint
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> oh
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> this would interesting
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> tho could be broken
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> There are some start setups better than others
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That doubles the state that is kept for any player
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and it's sometimes way too hard to react
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> well you are doubling the state for the first way too right?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is actually quadrupled since we keep a rescue state :D
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I say the only good way to do this would be letting mappers add a tp target tile
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and every respawn u get to check if the player passed the noobfilter checkpoint
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Yeah but what if you collect weapon in noob filter
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> which may need to be a tile too
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i see what u mean about firestone i guess
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With a tile mappers would add a small tunnel where you grab everything you need before starting
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Idk seems like a burden
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> true, but I guess this is something that needs to be checked during the mapping for the new maps ; and for the already released one it could be done if some ppl remake the map with the feature
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With state saving magic there are many scary issues that can happen.
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast I wouldn't be very confident in it
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> ^
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> how come we don't have a general robust save state for all features that use it?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Could rescue /save and swap all share?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's what CSaveTee is supposed to be, but see how many bugs we get on even that
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> hmm
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Idk I don't feel like the use case is strong enough to warrant adding a tile and modifying all maps
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> well it wouldn't be only one tile tho I think
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> prob 2 tiles
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> 1 for checkpoint
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and 1 for the afterfilter-spawn
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Can't you use start as the checkpoint?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> nah
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> u'd just spawn mid air
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I mean the start tile triggers the new spawn once you touch it
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Oh that
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> yeah right it's better
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> also it should only be available to non-0 teams
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> 1-63
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Though I already see some abuse problems with that
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Though I already see some problems with that
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> as going in team, kill, then /team 0
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Well if anyone wanna develop this, I'd be gratefl ðŸ¥²
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Well if anyone wanna develop this, I'd be grateful ðŸ¥²

17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cmake has a built-in FindRust package
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> color me surprised
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nvm
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had a package that installed it
17:19 <+ChillerDragon> wow i got used to the new freeze way too fast! i just joined kog and the ninja with sword looks super weird haha
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great, that was the hope
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i still find ninja skin unfitting, looks unfinished ^^
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @c0d3d3v https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> expand this
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and mention everything
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we already started it
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Der Allman Style ðŸ˜†
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> this space should be removed from the wiki
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/995736728616829070/unknown.png
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do it
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I don't have an account yet, though
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> do you guys use bool or int for 0|1 values?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Because it's not consistent in the code. I also see stuff like 
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> int var = bool:func()
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> why would anybody use int for 0|1 values
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> c programmers
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lots of ppl
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: is godot that advanced
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: is godot that advanced xd
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can register
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without an email
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah, I'll do
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> So, nobody cares if bool or int?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bool for new code
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just that c doesnt have bool
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so old days
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> sql enters the chat
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so is it possible to update all bool ints now?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u want
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> everything is possible
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> but i cant think of a RegEx that can check if its used as a bool or normal int
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's `-Wint-in-bool-context` but its already enabled by `-Wall` and doesn't report anything
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> what else doesn't have? match function?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> actually, nvm
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think only like c89 doesnt have bools :P
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stdbool has been around for a long long time
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0qmkQGqpM8
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> no cap
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> lmao look wat i just found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8VX3uJWTIU
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki fake reveal
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> face*
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is it planned that deep is going to be fixed soon?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who is that
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill just tell u something
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not bald
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats broken?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the livefreeze deep, i press /r and everything is weird
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but maybe its related to #5539
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5539
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also when u spec as live frozen deep, the eyes are normal
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also livefreeze needs better visuals, really sucks
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> livefreeze deep
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Well the texture is limited to the freezebar and people are gonna customize it. We dont need to make it longer or shorter since it would mess up the texture anyway.

21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> The texture is limited to the freezebar and people are gonna customize it. We dont need to make it longer or shorter since both approaches would mess up the texture.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> did you add a tick to.the freezebar? or am i just fantasising?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> What do you all mean with a tick in regards of the freezebar?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> You mean that it doesnt run smooth but jumps from 1 second to another?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i didnt catch the convo, is the rendering of the freezebar planning to be changed
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> like a clock not smooth ðŸ˜…
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> maybe
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> aight
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nah im just fantasizing, it looked like ir
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fluffysnaff> Terry Davis is just too wise
