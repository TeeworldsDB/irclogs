02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Why bans so ineffective? If anyone list reports we can see some ppl that break rules over and over again. May be need to more variants to identify players, for more effective bans? HWID, IP, logpass (so, it's also stop faking other ppl nicknames) with mail, ban indicator into game files for repeating ban if it same client, but new others.
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> 
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I think it all divide all "crime" by zero
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> 
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> If u really need to wait weeks after doing shit u think twice before doing this
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> 
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> For example, i talked a little with some idiots. With BlockMark and Rety. Those category of shit players think identically: "I'll not be punished, i can do what i want. If i got baned I just avoid this, lol"
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> HWID, IP, and some other type of bans are known to be very ineffective
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> could send drive serial or gpu uuid to server, not sure how much of a privacy concern that is though
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, we can't send those. DDNet is open source, anyone can change the client to send fake info
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Better use an account system
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but that only works if you make registering accounts hard, for example by having to pay
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if people cared about their ingame name, we could nameban them already
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Maintain a hidden branch with "anticheat"?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> This would totally destroy the purpose of backwards compatibility & open source though
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Or rate-limit account creation per ip
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that'd be equal to ip ban
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> not a solution
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Most of those guys are using known proxy/vpn ranges
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and would also destroy backwards compatibility.
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> How would it destroy backwards compatibility?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Do official servers not use getipintel.net or whatever it was called?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> account system.
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I don't see a way to implement an account system without a client update
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> KoG uses the account system for years now
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> yes, but you don't need one to join
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Yeah, but you cant kick logged in members for example
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have a way to detect vpn ranges, but we don't disclose which one we use so botters can't test to find a vpn provider that is not detected.
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Either way, getipintel is very decent.
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +1
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I think it possible to do register system using ddnet.tw, affecting only ddrace servers.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Login in game once per day using log pass. And for register need to link email, with restriction one mail - one account and nickname, + ban services that provide 1 minute mail, + ban for registration  multiple accounts from same ip, + ban for registration from VPN services. 
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> And change vote system a little. For example, only registered users can start vote for kick, + if target is unregistered user kick without vote.
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> "Once per day" I about don't need to relogin every time, just one login and u gaming all day, like in KoG
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what about tempmails then
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> As ridiculous variants may be link phone number with verification, and seriously restrict unregistered users, but it's too complicated
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> phone numbers nowadays is useless
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it can be easily bypassed
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> onoff app and done
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I write about tempmails, 1min mails, etc, need to ban registration using that services
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dunno if there's any existing online db to get domains used by 1min mails
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Yes, much of this can still be bypassed separately, but the point is that the "terrorists" spend much more nerves and efforts to bypass the blockages.
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Along with this, it will still not be so "cool" that it causes the slightest difficulty for ordinary players.
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Target is making ban really serious thing, not just "i change thing1 and thing2, and i go do shit again"
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> We just have "serial killers" and many of them are not very technical. It turns out that at the moment almost no effort needs to be made to bypass the blockage, which is why they continue to do all this.
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> (some Google translate, sorry)
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> (some Google translate, sorry)(some write self)
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> speaking of Mac, has anyone tried running DDNet on M1? How is the performance there?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> as an additional measure, you can force to verify in Discord even during registration, and same, one ds - one reg.
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> the 1min mail thing won't work. I can generate emails with a custom domain all day long
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> there really is no good solution until you introduce $$$. Bc if it's free then it's trivial to do
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> imo
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Whitelist emails? To only popular ones
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> its easy enough to make email with gmail
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Anyway ->
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> ```Yes, much of this can still be bypassed separately, but the point is that the "terrorists" spend much more nerves and efforts to bypass the blockages.```
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I considered this but the several clients that do have these kinds of features are extremely easy to reverse engineer. I really dont want to be in this game of cat and mouse
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fan tried, said it's fine iirc
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> that's good to know
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Depends on how you approach this
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You could use Code Virtualizer and things like that to make it harder to reverse engineer.
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> But anyway, grabbing disk serial & gpu uuid, and sending it, encrypted with AES-256 or smiliar, will do very well
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> The OpenGL backend on M1 can be a bit odd bc it's really only tested against professional apps and bigger games
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could do accounts and require like an hour of proof of work to create a new one. If people invest in fpgas to create ddnet proof of work then we are fucked :D
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> even without obfuscation
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Yep, it's good.
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> but I don't recommend using a touch pad for this game
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> lmao
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> or the magic mouse lol
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> what's the framerate like?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sacrificing tons of performance for a solution that will only stop people not commited to the task. Things like VTIL are getting better day after day
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 0% performance impact if done properly.
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds like fairy dust
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You wouldn't run this in a loop 24/7.
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You would only run the hwid routine when you connect to aserver
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You would only run the hwid routine when you connect to a server
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that's it.
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> what's stopping anyone from changing the source code
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> That's why it'd be a hidden brach.
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> That's why it'd be a hidden branch.
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> then now you can't compile DDnet anymore?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> You can, simply include the "hwid" module in your source code and you're all set
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well any part of the code that isn't virtualized makes it trivial to reverse. E.g. look at escape from tarkov
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Let's be real, barely anyone knows how to circumvent hwid checks in here.
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They keep attacking the point where the game interfaces with battleye
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and no one will bother to do so for something like ddnet.
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> BattlEye is totally different, and has a totally different player base.
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Trust me that it'd prevent a LOT of ban evasion if done properly
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and if this would become a thing, i'd be happy to assist
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the guy that developed one of the most popular bots right now also sells bots for AAA games. So atleast one guy here that has that sort of reverse engineering skills
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Let's say you can simply download the hwid module .dll, and place it in the same folder as your ddnet build
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> should be very easy to implement
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> yeah that works for windows fine but for linux maybe not as well
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> ship a linux module aswell
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 🙂
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't quite get what stops you from just hooking the dlls calls. The dll just asks winapi for the information at the end of the day. This is why most modern anticheats are moving into the kernel and even requiring they be loaded up at startup
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> having proper integrity checks.
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> you can directly query the disk driver instead of using winAPIs
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> same for gpu uuid
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Leave a few traces if the offending player has been banned, and it should prevent most offenders from joining back (temporarily)
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> you can always go even further in-depth
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, lets not talk more about this here. Bot people watch this channel all the time
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👋 hi bot people
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But in general we dont really love the idea of a closed source blob being required. All our proprietary integrations are also all optional if you notice, so you can run the game without any blobs right now
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes stallman is happy with us
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is he? We dont use gpl :P
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> With serious registration and serious limitation for registration it need to change a much more things. 
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> For account use mail and DS verification. And very serious restrict to: 1 ip = 1 account, 1 mail = 1 account, 1 DS = 1 account. If u already used any of this, u cannot register, in addition, ban registration using known VPN services and ban registration if used unknown mail service or if used known bad services, providing mail for 1 minute. 
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> 
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> And in game we just ban account, IP and HW. 
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Imagine that, for bypass u need literally change everything. IP, mail, Discord, HW, ip cannot be known VPN, need to register/use new normal mail, etc. Yes, moms hacker kids still can bypass, but it significantly down repeating of rule-breaking.
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> lol please don't force users to register with discord
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Still exist other measures
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are no other measures
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tw is open source
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can spoof any measure
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I about all listed, but not DS
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Site is open source too?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what is DS
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> btw if i was forced to register email, and my own email didn't work bc it wasn't popular enough, I'd not bother. Though I might be the odd one out there
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Ds - discord
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> what's stopping anyone from creating a new gmail account lol
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> It is already longer, than just change only ip
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i only have 888 hours in the game, but so far I've only seen one guy evade bans anyway and he never disrupted anything anyway
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> when people get kicked I don't see them return. do you?
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> maybe this is a regional issue idk
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> And, i listed it much upper, we can do some fingerprint in client shadowly, only about ban info. If ban info detected, we ban all new things
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Idk, in Russia we have mad guy's that everytime bypass restrictions and block all again and again
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can just recompile ddnet code with anything u want added
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well i dont think theres a perfect solution
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on my servers i have a better list of blocked providers + detection for bad inputs
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it works a littel  better
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Yes, but not all is super mega hackers
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive suggested some of these things to ddnet
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they added a couple of them
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but their tolerance towards false bans is very low
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Good
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so they arent gonna accept every strategy ive implemented for my servers
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and thats fine lol
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Anyway, cheaters is more rare in ru regions. Really common thing is idiots that bypass ban everytime, it's annoying.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what XD
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no they arent
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i did a statistical analysis on my main server
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it was a ger server
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i found that russian ips are roughly 3.7x more likely to be cheaters than german ips
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> In other news, our gear in germany is coming up by tuesday 🥳 
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> I'll likely release the old mitigation code for DDNet here (the reconnecting in 3 seconds one), as this will be deprecated by then
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I about ru ddrace servers, ddrace mode. May be fng more common cheat situation
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tbh im not sure
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was talking about fng
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I think cheating in fng do more profit for ego of cheaters
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its far easier to cheat at fng
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ~~theres a reason my banlist is 3.5k lines long~~
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> :D
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Anyone can ddos server with just a giant attemtps to connect?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i mostly just use  iprange bans instead of this fwiw
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> depends on ur defn of giant but in general yes
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most tw dos attacks involve connect or info requests
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most are spoofed with either random or player ips
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> I just thinked about "oh, u need to check about guy bot in ban list, and other things"
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh no
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my servers skip the info and the first handshake packet when checking banlist
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to show banned players the discord link + to protect a little bit against dos
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it only shows them the link on the second stage of the handshake
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> once they send back a correct packet with a token
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Hmm
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that's why we made a filter that will block both query floods, and other traffic
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> just dealing with capacity issues in frankfurt atm
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which will be solved by tuesdaay
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which will be solved by tuesday
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yes fan servers are better protected than mine, lol
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which means we'll also be able to utilize our newer ddnet filters
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> that are pretty much transparent.
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> against dos at lest
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> against dos at least
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Fun fact
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> they're also a lot more complex, probably the biggest filter I've made so far (except for FiveM)
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Most games use one single protocol, no4
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Most games use one single protocol, not 4
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Pretty much, only issue we're seeing in Frankfurt is limited capacity at the moment
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i host on a $5 vps so
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Eh, there's a difference between multi-k$ equipment and a $5 VPS I guess
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ofc
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> id hope so at least
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> So, in ru regions we have a problem, that in most cases we have just agressive and unstoppable (i about ban ignoring) ppl, that not cheaters.
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Still waiting for our Threadripper 3995X in Dallas with an additional 200Gbps in capacity to come up too, filtering is still running on a 3900x there, which does suffice due to the nature of XDP being very great performance-wise
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o__o
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Hah
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (Макс)> Strong
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on my servers i use rangebans to deal with such players, thers a system to correlate names to ips and it lets me easily find which ranges i can ban
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think ddnet is willing to do this
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but its one option
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i also have a system to ban providers
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Who knows, we're potentially gonna have 2.5Tbps in capacity by the end of year (globally), if things go as planned.
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> 🙏
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> "globally" being an anycasted network
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> nice
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or making the module optional for self compiling, just disallowing account registrations on the Server side
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw, could custom servers use these identifications like gpu nr or so too?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nice!
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you show me that? then i dont have to waste vpn requests when i have the network address of a bad ip cached
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If you compile your own ddnet client, and distribute it, sure
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean, my Server for example
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So I can identify banned people too
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u live in EU
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the whois system is probably illegal for u
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (u can add vpn caching without this btw)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I do have vpn caching already
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i think caching the network address of a vpn ip is more effective
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wdym network address
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like the network that ip is in
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like its in a /24 network for example
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then one vpn provider has a /24 and all of these ips are used
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my main vpn detection relies on a db of ASNs and a list of blocked ones
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the seocndary one uses an api
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i use an api too, which works very good
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> EU uses mostly dynamic IPs, so there's no reason to block VPNs
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> it's useless
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that logic doesnt make sense xd
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> It does
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> most EU users can simpy log into their router dashboard, and use the "acquire new ip" button
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> and done.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes thats true
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is an entirely different problem (that can sometimes be somewhat solved by rangebanning)
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> has nothing to do with vpn bans
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> which will lead to banning legitimate users aswell
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which can* lead to that
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> depends on the provider really
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> it ultimately will.
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> There is smaller "local" ISPs that have a single /24
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and if theres only one person using that isp and playing tw
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then its an easy solution xd
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tw isnt very popular afterall
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> Ok, chances are high that it'll affect legitimate players regardless
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> If you are ok with taking that risk, sure
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fän> i personally would not
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> banned players can see the server and get a discord link when they try to connect so they can appeal false bans; i also check recent player ips and only do a rangeban if it seems safe
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its still not totally safe but these two measures make it feel a little safer and it seems to be worth it for now on my relatively small servers
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nobody tested a native build, only the emulated x86
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> OpenGL seems to be wrapped by metalHe said the fps arent the real problem, but the input delay

14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generally spoken, i dont see why the M1 should be bad at it, it's more likely that the OS/drivers is the fault
