00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no idea, sory, very busy, have to figure out very urgent plane ticket
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe in a day or two ill give oyu a hand
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> learath chill and get 10 coffees
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i doubt coffee will help me at this point
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> herion then
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> heroin then
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what's the current forward compatibility problem?
00:20 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: if we move to a netobj for settings the old netmsg wont work anymroe so whe have to keep that aswell
00:20 <+Learath2> but then we have two things doing the same thing, so more code so more bad
00:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> the netmsg for time score? just drop that, it's a couple of client versions
00:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> (imo)
00:22 <@heinrich5991> woops wrong network
00:23 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: hm. we don't have a clear vision for the network protocol. it's all just hacked together
00:23 <+Learath2> yeah, i don't really like it :/
00:26 <@heinrich5991> I don't know what to do about it
00:27 <@heinrich5991> a proper design would require quite some developer hours and a proper idea on how to do it
00:27 <@heinrich5991> I don't know if you can steer the current development into a direction where it converges to a sane protocol
00:28 <+Learath2> yeah i don't htink so either, we just don't put enough time in it to get it to a decent point
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The NETMSG_TIME_SCORE is just a couple of versions, as heinrich said. Just replace it
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can we get the new time score system before the release aswell?
01:09 <@heinrich5991> the netobj version could be merged
01:10 <@heinrich5991> (if it works ^^)
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @noby help DDNet coding when
01:10 <@heinrich5991> good night
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do they need help lol
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> they don't have bot detection :troll:
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Also youre best coder in tw if you just wouldnt be so lazy :feelsbadman:
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> afaik they dont want automatic bot detection :feelsbadman:
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> qshar has an automatic bot report system
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It doesnt ban the botters but message him when someone is botting, what time and what map :O
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 partly works, wouldnt want it to be merged. (Learath2 wanted to make a working version maybe.) The point is that it needs to be dummy seperated, as both tees can have different score formats enabled
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it does ban
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if u keep botting
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
07:45 <@heinrich5991> @fokkonaut yes, doesn't sound impossible
07:45 <@heinrich5991> after all, tee position isn't shared between main tee and dummy either
07:45 <@heinrich5991> ^^
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://dark-the.me/is-the-only-theme/jyPzoWB3CY7W.png
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i cant believe i have fucking done it
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Gg wp
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im working on this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1649
10:41 <+Ryozuki> im wondering if its worth letting clients know if a player is frozen
10:41 <+Ryozuki> it may allow for custom freeze skins without changing the file
10:42 <+Ryozuki> and also custom deep freeze skin
10:43 <+Ryozuki> ill add it the more the best
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can I just remove the game/client and engine/client folder and from Cmakelists or is there something i need to care about, like does the rest of the src need these folders? (engine maybe i guess)
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (i have client compiling off already)
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I cant view many demos latley because map differes from server. How does that even work? Is the map not saved in the demo?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yes, and that name doesn't match with one in your downloaded maps folder
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I guess
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that makes no sense to me
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why does it need downlaoded maps if the map is in the demo already?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No idea, it was only a guess
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea i also thought once you need the map in downloaded maps and it only saves map name with crc
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but why was i able to watch all these demos ppls send me
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did i really had all these maps? o.O
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg ppl not ppls xd
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon show me how to reproduce it
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i never had that problem, i read the code and didn't see how that could happen
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> When i delete my downloaded maps Folder, can i replay any demos then?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, should work
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the map is stored inside of the demo file
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :O
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea so how i expected it
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/568850027125145600/mapdiffers.demo
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon recorded with current ddnet client?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> basically the demo contains a map with a different hash than the demo expects, that's weird
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure how to create that with ddnet client
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> except if the filesystem is corrupted
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is a cutted demo im not sure if it happend during cutting
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is an old demo so i dont know if i double checked if the cut surived it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i also have no idea what ddnet version it was
19:43 <@deen> ok, show me a way to reproduce it with current version
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bro
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no idea if i would knew i would report it
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just went through my cutted demos and noticed that a few were unwatchable
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any idea how to fix the demos? Is it possible to change the expected crc to match the actual one with some hex editor?
19:48 <@deen> probably yes
19:48 <@deen> or just download the map file as well and put it in downloadedmaps
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so it does look in downloaded maps as well?
19:48 <@deen> yes
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if this would fix it it would be cool if the client tried that on its own
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe asking the user if he really want to do it
19:49 <@deen> basically the map is extracted from demo, put in downloadedmaps, and then the client tries to load a map with the correct CRC
19:49 <@deen> would be better to fix the client
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure
19:50 <@deen> maybe if you cut it again from start to end the final result gets fixed
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont have the original demo anymore
19:50 <@deen> you posted it in discord
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats the cutted one
19:50 <@deen> just download the map to downloadmaps, open it, cut it from start to end, and save again
19:51 <@deen> then try the deleting the map in downloadedmaps again and see if the newly cut one works
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lez see if i can find the maps
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i need the crc that is not displayed on the demo priewviw correct?
19:53 <@deen> yes
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> both maps by me
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe that is the reason
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because i had them in editor alreay idk what ever
19:53 <@deen> maybe there is a way that the client ends up saving the wrong map in demo
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can only find the version i already have on heinrich5991.de
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff any haxxors here? I dont find the hash as plain string in the demo file -.-
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can i search for it
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any idea how the string "74f6a427" gets converted to binary "4A E6 A1 E1 5B F1" for me that makes no sense o.O
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/568876882326716426/unknown.png
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> as far as i understood it stores this CDemoHeader struct at the beginning and between mapname and type there is the crc?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/568877294479736883/unknown.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh it doesnt im stupid
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought this crc is the left one the expected one from server
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen ok that doesnt help either
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i bypassed the wrong crc diff
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> now i get network decrompession error
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen  i opened a demo which was send to me and i opened it with that new way to move it on client.exe. the demo didnt work and i got error. Now everytime i launch the client i get the same error and then after that i get to the serverlist.
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does the error say?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @deen hi, I've tried to reproduce the mouse bug on a few different pcs without success, and I started wondering if its related to settings (mouse, etc) or to pc/platform
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I also didnt notice anything
