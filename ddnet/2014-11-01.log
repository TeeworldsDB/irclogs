00:06 < Nimda_1716> DDNet Chile went back online!
00:10 <@deen> seems like Chile was down for everyone, not just Europe
00:43 < xRoThx_> deen: 
00:50 <@deen> hi
00:51 <@deen> xRoThx_: 
00:51 < xRoThx_> I found the source of a attempt to remake my mod (only the upgrades part)
00:51 < xRoThx_> Can you use it? 
00:55 < xRoThx_> First I was thinking privately. 
00:55 < xRoThx_> But then I thought that it should be open-source
00:55 < xRoThx_> To make it evoluate faster and better
00:55 < xRoThx_> That way everybody can use and make more fun
01:11 <@deen> i don't know what your mod is
01:11 <@deen> also, i'm mostly interested in ddnet, not other mods
01:42 < xRoThx_> ddrace
01:42 < xRoThx_> but with upgrade tiles
01:42 < xRoThx_> So you can put them at the end for example
01:43 < xRoThx_> and everytime somebody finishes he gets 1jump more, X% faster rocket, X% faster laser etc
01:43 < xRoThx_> Should I send you the mods? 
01:52 <@deen> hm, i don't really like that
01:53 <@deen> people shouldn't get advantages
02:01 < xRoThx_> people liked it 3-2 years back
02:01 <@deen> people also like xxlddrace's fun features but we don't have them
02:08 < xRoThx_> aight :)
02:09 < xRoThx_> Gnight though
06:10 < Nimda_1716> DDNet GER went down!
10:44 < Nimda_1716> DDNet GER went back online!
10:52 < xRoThx_> deen:  Would it be better if I order SSD space? 
10:53 < xRoThx_> I think that doesn't make a lot of difference for Teeworlds, but just to know :) Might help
10:53 <@deen> xRoThx_: no difference for ddnet, might make one for other mods depending on how you write the logfiles
10:55 <@EastByte> ger down for 4 hours?
10:55 <@deen> my bad^^
10:55 <@EastByte> looks like a full restart
10:55 <@deen> They restarted the server at 6 am, don't know how long it was down
10:55 <@deen> but i forgot to setup automatic restarting
10:56 <@EastByte> haha
10:56 <@deen> because of all the temporary servers we have
10:56 < xRoThx_> deen:  change the map don't forget
10:57 <@deen> xRoThx_: what?
10:57 <@deen> well, now we don't have blocker players anymore^^
10:58 < xRoThx_> Great
10:58 < xRoThx_> Perfect moment to change the map
10:58 < xRoThx_> I got another map you can maybe setup
10:58 <@deen> i don't understand what you want
10:58 < xRoThx_> Its my remake of ROYAL a couple weeks ago
10:58 <@deen> and maybe i'd rather shut down the blocker servers
10:58 <@deen> people want so many changes to them and i don't really care about them
10:59 < xRoThx_> Then I will restart them on a new server
10:59 < xRoThx_> Keep it on for a moment
10:59 < xRoThx_> Later today/tomorrow I will restart ^^
10:59 < xRoThx_> You only care about the Dummy Drag maps? 
10:59 <@deen> have you taken a look at http://ddnet.tw/ ?
11:00 <@deen> it's 100% about ddrace
11:02 < xRoThx_> I see
11:03 < xRoThx_> Is there any chance you help me set them up / explain me how to work with linux? :P 
11:03 < xRoThx_> Because Windows itself takes a lot cpu/ram 
11:03 <@deen> if you want to run your own blocker servers you can just administrate the ddnet ger blocker ones
11:04 <@deen> then i don't have to do anything with them and you don't need to buy a new server for them
11:04 < xRoThx_> Sure
11:04 < xRoThx_> But can you set a pw for only those servers? 
11:04 <@deen> yeah, i can do that
11:04 < xRoThx_> That would be nice
11:14 <@deen> ok, done
13:31 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/piranha.webm
13:32 <@EastByte> drunk players in the morning
13:38 <@EastByte> deen: http://teeworlds-friends.de/Forum/index.php?page=Thread&postID=183484#post183484
13:39 <@EastByte> as I said "ger goes down" was a bad idea :)
14:50 <@deen> EastByte: haha
14:51 <@deen> EastByte: i had the hope that someone could tell us a new, better server if i write it clearly, like that
14:51 <@EastByte> :)
14:58 <@deen> laxa: can you try out 60fps videos for the Hall of Fame?
15:03 < laxa> Yes I can try
15:03 < laxa> I forgot to upload the last video this night :(
15:37 < xRoThx_> Yo
15:38 <@EastByte> hello
15:41 <@EastByte> deen: EUR seems to be unstable right now
15:42 <@deen> hi
15:42 <@deen> EastByte: what's up?
15:42 <@EastByte> laggy
15:47 < xRoThx_> where is EUR hosted? 
15:48 <@EastByte> ovh strasbourg
17:31 < xRoThx_> EastByte: 
17:31 <@EastByte> hm
17:31 < xRoThx_> Are you expercienced with linux servers? Can you explain me how to host tw on it? :D
17:36 <@EastByte> well first learn how to work with linux^^
17:47 < xRoThx_> so I better stay with windows? 
17:48 <@EastByte> your choice
17:48 <@EastByte> but please don't use windows for hosting^^
17:52 < xRoThx_> I know.. It eats my resources.. But I never worked with linux before. Need kind of a teacher
17:54 <@EastByte> well if you are interested in hosting or even development linux would be the first thing you have to learn to work with
17:54 <@EastByte> and you don't need a teacher for that
18:51 < Edible> xRoThx_, use a bsd, fuck linu
18:51 < Edible> x
18:52 < xRoThx_> I have no experience with it
18:52 < Edible> even better
18:53 < xRoThx_> I am contacting some hosters to ask for a partnership/ 
18:53 < xRoThx_> I am contacting some hosters to ask for a partnership or so
18:53 < xRoThx_> I would like to have a webinterface where people can create/manage their own teeworlds server
18:53 < Edible> alrighty then
18:55 <@EastByte> xRoThx_: but this way you are going to be in conflict with G@mer :P
18:57 < xRoThx_> EastByte:  Honestly, I don't even care. I would like to offer him a partnership aswell.. but he doesn't leave contact info on his countdown website...
18:58 < xRoThx_> I just want to provide a safe server hosting option for players/clans without having to do everything manually
18:58 <@EastByte> I guess that's the same G@mer wants to provide
19:00 <@EastByte> and as you said he has his own company and I'm not sure whether he wants to partnership with you
19:00 <@EastByte> but honestly, there are enough teeworlds servers
19:01 <@EastByte> the kids just want to have their own servers to take over the role of an admin
19:01 <@EastByte> but then it'll just be another idling server filling up the list
19:08 < xRoThx_> I get demands for a server pretty often. I think there are a lot of players that would love their own server. That in combination with the fact that a server do cost pretty much 
19:08 < xRoThx_> I think there could be a balance between what I host for public and the servers players order
19:14 <@EastByte> the tw server engine is really low cost, you can hardly see its consumption on a dedicated server unless you have above 200 players
19:14 <@EastByte> and there are only a thousand players online
19:15 <@EastByte> the only problem is the network stability
19:22 <@EastByte> and all the attackers of course :)
19:29 < xRoThx_> Is there any existing easy-to-install webinterface? 
19:30 <@EastByte> the only I know is uptee
19:30 <@EastByte> seems not to be easy to install though
19:30 <@EastByte> http://uptee.sushitee.de/
19:31 < DoNe> i am searching in the code for the part that prevents players to hit their selves with projectiles.
19:32 < DoNe> i really cant find it,
19:32 < DoNe> i think it should be in projectiles.cpp but i have no idea where!
19:32 < DoNe> is here any1 who did something with projectiles and can help me?
19:36 < DoNe> does some1 know how to contact HMH? hes sometimes on a server and then he disappears for about 2 month ...
19:36 <@EastByte> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/projectile.cpp#L67
19:37 < DoNe> it will give false or the character?
19:38 <@EastByte> CCharacter *TargetChr = GameServer()->m_World.IntersectCharacter(PrevPos, CurPos, 6.0f, CurPos, OwnerChar);
19:38 <@EastByte> it'll ignore OwnerChar
19:38 < DoNe> aah
19:38 < DoNe> thank you!!!
19:39 <@EastByte> no problem sir
19:39 < DoNe> i searched every where behind this line xD
19:46 < xRoThx_> EastByte:  saw that one tho
19:46 < xRoThx_> but I m not experienced enough for it :P 
20:24 <@EastByte> deen: is there a way in nimrod to make all attributes of an object public/accessable?
20:24 <@EastByte> instead a marking each attribute seperately
21:46 < Savander> :<
21:46 < Savander> this dynamic bind
21:46 < Savander> works bad :<
21:46 < Savander> don't save my previous cl_max_mouse_distance
21:46 < Savander> :<<
21:46 < Savander> cl_mouse_max_distance *
23:24 < eeeee> sup guys
23:24 < eeeee> consider this http://tw.qwe123.info/DDNet_x86_d.html
