07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I still believe there is something else going on. The state machine is not save. Try adding this line maybe? It improved things on my server. I believe it takes multiple tries to connect because it enters incorrect state. https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/blob/master/src/engine/server/register.cpp#L308

07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> > The state-machine-like code in the server that handles the registration at the masterservers in engine/server/register.cpp didn't reallly change between 0.6 and 0.7 but it's still broken. It can get into the `REGISTERSTATE_HEARTBEAT` and `REGISTERSTATE_REGISTERED` states with the `m_RegisterRegisteredServer` (which holds the id of the master server we are connected to: 0-3) set to `-1`.
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @timakro
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's incredibly annoying to debug because this whole connection sequence depends on latency and you must try multiple times to get the bug I also believe it occurs more frequently on high latency to the masterserver. And every test you must wait multiple minutes. But whatever: the unconditional state transitions on receiving packets are dangerous
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro not that I've checked but you know the invalid state, is it not obvious where the state is entered?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> Hello guys !
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> Thanks for the game üëç
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> I played last night and I had a lot of fun with the "Just2Easy" map :)
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> I want to share to you my feedback about https://ddnet.tw/:
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> - It seems you are intentionnaly hiding the documentation / help. Setup the server with a maps accessible for newbies was a true challenge. May be you're doing it intentionally because you love difficulty ^^ Otherwise It would be nice to have at least a README.md in the archive we download AND a page "Getting started" in the left menu (a doc for dummies).
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> - I was so happy to find this repo https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps ! I think it should be highlighted from https://ddnet.tw/. I think also that this repo deserve a better documentation.
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> That's it for my feedback, thanks for reading and thanks a lot once again for this game !
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> Good luck üí™
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its intentional
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you just need common sense
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks for the feedback, I think I agree with all of those
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well except for the website one. Don't we have a settings and commands link?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think its even on the sidebar
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or were you asking for something more akin to a getting started. Like download zip, unpack zip, edit autoexec_server.cfg?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he wanted probs to setup a sv with the map votes
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could have went to https://github.com/ddnet
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can find anything
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The map votes are quite tough to set up
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think so
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ddnet-maps repo
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> already has everything i think
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> Ok I will clarify what I would have expected from a "Getting started" page.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> **1 - How to get and start the game.** This part contain actions to do, step by step, to get into the game. It should says at the end "Run DDNet to start the game.". It could also explain what is inside the archive content, or refer to the archive readme if there is one.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> **2- How to run a the server with a map for beginners.** When I started the server for the first time, the map was way too hard for us... I didn't know how to get an easy map from the archive I've just downloaded. I was happy to find this repo https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps and looking forward in "maps" see the "novices" directory! Do we need this repo to get easy maps ? I don't know. May be what is in the archive is enough, can't s
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> **3- That's it !** Here you refer additional ressources, link to server settings / custom commandes, and additionnal advanced documentation.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> I hope I have been more clear in this message. Have a good day üòé
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Constantin ddnet is open source! Go to the web repo and make all this you said! Dont wait for others to do it! :poggers:
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "How to get and start the game." well maybe this is a bit too much for dummies lol
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I guess join official ddnet servers and vote a random easy map
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or ask around on how to create a server if you get stuck
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Constantin The problem is that DDNet is the name for two different things. The network of servers we host and the teeworlds mod. The maps are part of the network of servers.
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We only ship a single ddnet map in the package and that's Kobra 4
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we could streamline the process of downloading a map, e.g. a map browser on the website with links to download
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> If you want I can make a draft on the github wiki of one of these projects : https://github.com/ddnet
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Constantin> Let me know if you want me to do it and on which repo I should do it.
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do we link curl statically on macOS?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if so the version we are linking lacks https support
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm just horrible with cmake, could you please fix the macOS issues? You can ssh into my computer, or vnc if you prefer to see what you are doing
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lez hax learath
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Constantin do it on https://github.com/teeworlds
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Constantin do it on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont...
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :d
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 See the link with the highlighted line, the line below is where it enters the invalid state. This if statement I added should fix that, but I'm not sure if it fixes the connection issues entirely, this all seems very dependent on timing.
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I only tested that with the unique race source and it seems like I changed something else while adding 0.7 support which made it worse. But before hiding error messages I'd start with investigating if this problem also occurs on vanilla. It might be the cause of those ""WARNING: Master server is not responding, switching master" log messages which occasionally appeared in the server logs of teeworlds servers for years.
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Add debug here which prints `m_RegisterRegisteredServer` https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/blob/master/src/engine/server/register.cpp#L242
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sometimes it showed -1 for me
