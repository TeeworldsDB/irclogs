00:00 <@deen> he worked 1 street from my university
00:00 <@deen> but not anymore
00:01 < savander> ahm
00:02 <@deen> Now he's paid to develop stuff in Nim
00:03 < savander> http://www.infoq.com/presentations/nimrod 
00:03 <@deen> I guess that means you didn't find my Nimrod presentation :P
00:03 < savander> so nimrod changed name lately
00:04 < savander> hookrace.net 
00:04 < savander> you mean?
00:04 <@deen> nope, video
00:04 < savander> im not
00:07 < savander> if i understand, you did a presentation. Can you show me?:D
00:07 <@deen> I assumed everyone had seen it, they send it around on DDNet currently
00:07 <@deen> see PM
00:08 < savander> i wasn't here a long time
00:08 < savander> maybe that's why
00:11 < savander> ;)
00:11 < savander> Goodnight
00:11 <@deen> bye
05:51 < o_be_one> hey deen you changed the pw on v3royal im not able to admin ^^
10:11 <@deen> yes, just as I said yesterday
10:48 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/public/videos/silence.webm
10:48 <@EastByte> dat moment when you realize your team is gone
10:51 <@deen> they left you or what?^^
10:54 <@EastByte> they failed and I didn't notice
10:55 <@EastByte> actually they should have come after me
10:55 <@EastByte> I wish I had the demo were they fell down
10:58 <@deen> ok
11:00 <@deen> damn android toolkit, why is it so huge?
11:02 <@EastByte> I just ran "du -ch /home/android"
11:02 <@EastByte> still working
11:02 <@deen> 24 GB for me...
11:02 <@deen> that's as much as everything else I have combined
11:03 <@EastByte> I also have multiple ndks in it
11:03 <@EastByte> 26G total
11:03 <@EastByte> ah okay
11:05 <@deen> Everything is getting so huge
11:05 <@EastByte> yep
11:05 <@deen> Last time I tried compiling Rust I stopped after an hour of compiling or so...
11:07 <@deen> and from what I've heard you need a day to compile Android on a modern system
11:08 <@EastByte> I did it once, yes
11:08 <@EastByte> but it's linux so...
11:08 <@deen> hm?
11:09 <@EastByte> since you are using gentoo, how long does it take to compile the linux kernel?
11:09 <@deen> if i just change the config or from scratch?
11:09 <@EastByte> everything
11:09 < laxadedi> guys, I need an idea for a school project, we will be a group of 7 people, all doing dev, we need an innovative idea to program and maybe later sell :)
11:09 <@deen> a few minutes, 5-10 i think
11:10 <@EastByte> laxadedi: you wanna sell <.<
11:10 <@EastByte> deen: hmk
11:10 < laxadedi> well
11:10 < laxadedi> the idea
11:10 < laxadedi> first year : we develop the idea
11:10 < laxadedi> second year : we make a business plan about it
11:10 < laxadedi> doesn't mean we have to really do it
11:10 < laxadedi> it's a project on 2 years
11:10 <@EastByte> selling an idea is even harder
11:11 < laxadedi> we won't sell an idea
11:11 <@deen> EastByte: I could bring it down if I cared about disabling all the stuff in the kernel  I don't need, but that's a lot of work, keeping up with all the additions to the Kernel over the years, so I don't do that anymore
11:11 < laxadedi> we will 'sell' a project that is working already
11:12 <@deen> laxadedi: make a clean mobile operating system which doesn't take 24 hours to compile!
11:13 < laxadedi> deen: we don't have time for that
11:13 <@deen> you want quick money? make an app that doesn't do anything and is just expensive, so that you can brag to your friends about having bought it
11:14 < laxadedi> lol deen
11:14 < laxadedi> I need an innovative idea to begin with, we have 1 year to think about the way that we are going to sell it
11:15 < laxadedi> the target of the app could be really small or for everyone
11:15 < laxadedi> the main idea is just to be innovative : something that doesn't exist yet
11:15 <@EastByte> something that doesn't exist yet...
11:16 <@deen> i don't get the scope btw
11:17 <@deen> I'd like a secure sandboxing mechanism that doesn't need superuser rights and would bring proper security to linux systems
11:17 <@EastByte> oh that's a nicee idea!
11:18 <@EastByte> laxadedi: finding a new idea which fits into the modern market ist pretty hard
11:19 <@deen> I'd also like DDNet's webclient to work as a passive client so you can watch tournaments with it without being actually connected to the server
11:19 <@EastByte> finding a market nich is comparable to finding security holes widely used software
11:20 <@deen> EastByte: if only it was that easy to find a market niche!
11:20 <@EastByte> haha
11:20 <@deen> AFL is pretty great to find security holes without any manual work
11:20 <@EastByte> deen: I though we wanted to make the webclient livestream passive
11:20 <@deen> hm?
11:21 <@EastByte> filestream distributable via cdn
11:21 <@EastByte> wasn't that the idea?
11:21 <@deen> i don't understand or know
11:22 <@EastByte> server snapshots -> datastream -> distribute over http -> to webclient
11:22 <@deen> ok
11:23 <@deen> A network monitor for Android would be cool
11:23 <@deen> that reports which apps phone home to which addresses
11:29 <@EastByte> offline for today, cya
11:29 <@deen> bye EastByte 
14:27 < Nimda> Grand Shotgun by IRGNW just released on Solo at 2015-05-20 14:24
14:45 < o_be_one> deen, hi, does i need to ask xrothx for pw ?
15:39 <@deen> yes

17:03 < savander> http://savander.pl/upload/tileset_1.png
17:03 < savander> http://savander.pl/upload/tileset_particles.png
17:03 < savander> i found this on archive.org
17:03 < savander> in teeworlds
17:03 < savander> hehe
17:03 < savander> :P
17:06 < o_be_one> funny ^^
17:08 <@deen> should use it for new maps
17:08 < savander> but
17:08 < savander> it's buggy
17:09 < savander> a bit
17:14 < xRoThx> Hello
17:14 < savander> hi
17:16 <@deen> hi
17:17 < xRoThx> How are you all? 
17:21 < o_be_one> fine, ty
17:22 < savander> oh good
17:22 < savander> i fixed this mapres
17:22 < savander> i guess
17:22 <@deen> savander: ^^
17:23 <@deen> now put it on ddnet forum and mappers will usei t!
17:24 < xRoThx> :P
17:24 < savander> what a beautiful tileset!
17:25 < savander> which section xD?
17:27 <@deen> mapping
17:28 <@deen> they must be pretty old
17:28 <@deen> teewars 0.2 had more modern ones already
17:29 < savander> maybe
17:29 < savander> was in archive 2004 ?
17:29 < savander> or smth like that
17:29 < savander> (oldest ones)
17:29 < savander> and i downloaded it a long time ago, don't know if it still there.
17:35 < savander> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1480
20:09 <@deen> Woah, server hosting http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1481
20:09 <@deen> The prizes are crazy
20:09 <@deen> 1 € per hour per server
20:10 <@deen> So for DDNet's 200 servers that would make 144 thousand euroes per month, what a deal!
20:11 <@EastByte> yea he will soon realize that it doesn't work out
20:15 <@deen> 1 € per month would be fair
20:15 <@deen> and people would actually pay it maybe
20:15 <@deen> because it's not much for a clanserver or personal test server with nice ping
20:16 <@EastByte> I think this guy isn't from the teeworlds community
20:16 <@EastByte> he properly does not know
20:17 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/20_May-15-20_17.png
20:17 <@deen> wooo, i know your rcon!
20:17 <@EastByte> he hosts call of duty, css, tf2, teeworlds, unreal tournament
20:18 < o_be_one> what are you talkin about ?
20:18 <@EastByte> the panel looks kinda professional (design)
20:18 <@deen> I bet hosting TW will give him the most ddos attacks of all these games =/
20:18 <@EastByte> there is not even a ddrace gametype
20:20 <@deen> ouch
20:20 <@deen> so that's just some pointless advertisement?
20:20 <@EastByte> yea
20:20 <@deen> I guess I should remove the thread
20:21 <@heinrich5991> I think he said he had ddrace?
20:21 <@EastByte> ohhhh there is ddnet
20:21 <@EastByte> sry
20:21 <@deen> ok
20:22 <@deen> someone should get a kimsufi server and give out cheaper TW servers
20:23 <@deen> i guess xrothx wanted to do that
20:23 <@deen> but didn't find anyone who wanted to make the interface for him
20:24 <@deen> savander's solution of a free AWS server doesn't seem too bad either
20:24 <@deen> talking about money, today someone asked me how much I earn with DDNet, haha
20:25 <@EastByte> DawnDN asked me that too
20:31 <@EastByte> being a teeworlds hoster you could host thousands of tw servers without wasting resources
20:32 <@EastByte> just kill empty servers but still keep them in the teeworlds server list
20:32 <@EastByte> no one will join them anyway
20:32 <@EastByte> and a server takes about a second to start so it can be done on the fly
20:33 <@EastByte> (when someone tries to connect)
20:33 <@deen> don't need to kill them
20:33 <@deen> DDNet servers have a powersaving feature for when they're empty
20:33 <@deen> ;)
20:33 <@EastByte> still wasting ram :P
20:33 <@deen> right right
20:34 <@deen> alright, then kill them and run them back on demand
20:34 <@deen> or use some force-swapping
20:34 <@deen> Anyway, a single Kimsufi server for 20 € has 16 GB RAM and 4 cores of an i7
20:34 <@deen> that's probably enough to host the entire TW
20:35 <@EastByte> not even worth it
20:36 <@EastByte> would be a nice project to put such a hosting service on a cheap vps
20:36 <@EastByte> webinterface written in a system lang like nim
20:36 <@EastByte> tw servers on demand
20:37 <@EastByte> force swapping like you said
20:45 <@deen> yep
20:45 <@deen> but i have enough work with ddnet
20:45 <@deen> mappers and clans would love it
20:47 <@deen> ahaha, i would _not_ have said that: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1481&p=14646#p14646
20:48 <@EastByte> 91.121.155.7
20:48 <@EastByte> it's ovh
20:48 <@deen> yes
20:48 <@EastByte> Roubaix it seems
21:29 < o_be_one> deen, for hosting i know the best and cheapest hosting to do that ..
22:36 < savander> ovh it's not very good location
22:36 < savander> but for testing server, why not.
22:36 < savander> i had kimsufi with 4gb ram
22:37 < savander> but cpu was bad (Atom N2800)
22:37 < savander> servers just lagged.
22:38 < o_be_one> thats not ovh problem, you choose the wrong server ^^
22:38 < o_be_one> no problem with ovh in my side :)
22:38 < savander> i know
22:38 < savander> it's not ovh problem
22:39 < savander> i just said, this cpu is too bad to host few teeworlds servers :P
22:43 < o_be_one> yes :(
22:44 < o_be_one> and you pay too much for wha you have :/
22:48 < savander> no
22:48 < savander> i don't said that.
22:49 < o_be_one> oh
22:49 < o_be_one> you have the ks2g ?
22:49 < o_be_one> 3€/month :D
22:50 < savander> now i don't have anything, only vps
22:50 < savander> for websites, and testing
