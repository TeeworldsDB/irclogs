04:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> oh nvm
04:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I found it
04:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it's network-wired
08:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes env vars are such suckers
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is this ignored, the configure (which calls pkg-config) gets the env vars.
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i put it before the cargo build it works, but here not

08:24 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i am watching it since a long ass time but was always to scared to put money in
08:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** now it somehow became a meme stock xxxxxxxxxD
08:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ‚ú™ are you beyond meat enjoyer?
08:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like their nuggests and burger pats
08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dont like their pricing
08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs vegan food is never in the world that expensive xd
08:26 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea thats one of the reasons why the company is on the brink of bancrupcy since a while
08:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** actually their expenses are quite high they dont make any profit
08:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** man stock market messes with my head
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's hard for me to believe it's bcs of the resource they using
08:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i could have become a trillionair this month
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tja
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or lose all your money
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome to gambling
08:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea fr
08:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** every other time i would have lost with the stock :D
08:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i somehow knew it had to bounce eventually
08:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> y r u even gambling
08:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u rich
08:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the company can not go to 0 while jupsti still eats their nuggets
08:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just play safe

08:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually you are
08:29 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> @chillerdragon https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10824/
08:32 < bridge> <timakro> I want to use `auth_add_p` on our servers and wondering is there a website I can send people to where they enter their password and then copy the hash and send it to me?
08:33 < bridge> <timakro> I want to use `auth_add_p` on our servers and wondering is there a website I can send people to where they can enter their password and then copy the hash and send it to me?
08:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** why let them chose a password
08:33 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> https://ddnet.org/modauth/password.html
08:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i generate all passwords for my staff they should use a password manager anyways. Ain't no way i would let them use 123 as pass
08:34 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> the one ddnet uses is randomly generated
08:34 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> its a bit insecure as the wordlist is public /:
08:34 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> you could brute force the hashes quite easily
08:34 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> (relatively easily to random ascii)
08:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i still partially remember my ddnet password 
08:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it was so funny xd
08:35 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> also it means you never share your password
08:35 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> you have to send it to the person
08:35 < bridge> <timakro> that website is awesome, thx
08:35 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> üëç
08:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i also store my passwords in plaintext :D so i can send them out once they are forgotten instead of having to reset them
08:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ‚ú™ you remember the magic command to make the linker find libs?
08:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** rdconfig something
08:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ldconfig?
08:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but with sudo
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** was about to send this xd `ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied`
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hello i am new
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** holy shit it worked
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks jopsti
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but why do i need it?
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i did not need it yesterday xd
08:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my build broke over night
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, did u do a sys update or smth
08:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe
08:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont think so but im really confused how that thing works
08:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i never needed it before i touched teero stuff
08:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and its not the first C lib i use
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what you doing but you can also control the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directly
08:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea but i dont want to have to do that
08:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or maybe i should point that to /usr/local
08:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but hm ddnet_protocol lib always just works there
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway ldconfig simply writes a cache and if that contains outdated information, then it probs finds libs that dont exist anymore
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or if u locally install stuff it still finds system libs
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why u run it
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no black magic
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can't even tell ya why this is faster than just asking the filesystem
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but well apparently it is
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe it's stored in memory all time? üòÆ
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how big does the cache need to be that the latency of reading multiple paths is faster than reading a whole cache üò¨

08:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** one does not simply merge ddnet prs
08:55 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im so frustrated with the lack of ddnet merges i dont want to touch the repo anymore atm i need a break
08:55 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** just merge downstream ddnet is dead
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> please make good prs
08:59 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> oh ):
08:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 i looked 3 seconds at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10824 I could not care less about it. If you like it just merge it. I wont touch it.
08:59 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> this would have to be added to do the snd_game_volume_others

09:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what do i want with it xd
09:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i just want you to close your open prs

09:01 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i once told you to finish all your sound prs so we dont have so many open prs thats it
09:01 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** where can i see them jopsi?
09:01 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> theres 2 sound prs

09:02 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> `sample_loop` is no longer waiting on anything
09:02 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> but it was in draft so i thought it was

09:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ignore the bar
09:03 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> does this have to be done for every skin?
09:03 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> or is it magic
09:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's automatically done for each skin
09:04 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> woaw nice

09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sick
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what did he want
09:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well lets not talk about it xd
09:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it was just a funny coincidence
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** because once i copy pasted 3 lines of cmake from one sdl repo to another
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** then yesterday i copied it to teero repo and he said i am magician
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sick
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and then yesterday too the sdl maintainer copied it yet to another repo
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** crediting me
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how does he know about teeros repo
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i just didnt do shit d
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he doesnt
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thats what makes it funny
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he must have felt the code being copied
09:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and it reminded him he wanted to do it too
09:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** me doing that for sdl was like 1 year ago
09:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> it is, our wavpak has to be updated
09:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i feel like a grandma telling a coinidence story thats just so boring af xd
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont really get it anyway
09:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wait ok
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but man do i hate ffmpeg building
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just wanted to say that again

09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was random thought i had to free from my head
09:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
09:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its just the code i moved in sdl 1 year ago was moved yesterday again but smh i got credited but i didnt even write it xd
09:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and i moved the exact same code into teeros lib yesterday
09:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so its the funny coincidence
09:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u get it now?
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oke
09:11 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** is it fonny?

09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> loading screen?
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hope you mean connecting screen
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs in ddnet-rs there is no loading
09:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> o yeah
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blazulite connecting screen might be a good moment to test one of your designs
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's small
09:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yea
09:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I thought on adding a silly animation of a tee running on it xD

09:51 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yea
09:51 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> can I try to host a test server?

09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you know how to open ports
09:51 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> well I have the vm louis gave me access to
09:51 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so I can use that one ig
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `./server "sv.port 8303" "sv.register true"`
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> smth like that should be enough
09:52 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> alr
09:52 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> is there any setting for the uhhhh
09:52 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> rcon pass server name and all that?
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the thing is
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you should use accounts for that
09:53 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ohhhh
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> truth is, i havent added accounts mapping to the server config yet xD
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but your account is unique
09:53 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ah fair enough xD
09:53 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I have one B)
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i need some kind of alternative rcon login anyway
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it even exists, but currently only for local servers
09:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat my favorite debugger you want to look at https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/issues/387 by any chance? :D 
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so on local server you can already do rcon cmds
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also just register your local server public btw
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ofc requires the client to be open, which sucks
09:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> have I mentioned that I fricking love ddnet-rs?
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :brownbear:
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has potential xdd
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 20 years it releases
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> trust
09:56 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> It's better late and well developed than rushed and unstable
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i used it the last days and yeah lots of stuff suck, and lots of stuff are just so cool
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instant replay is soo nice
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use it lot
09:56 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> YEA
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and f1 console is just nice (with small bugs)
09:57 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I love how you can select the text
09:57 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431929674812100788/image.png?ex=68ff33ee&is=68fde26e&hm=13cd515217740e4730ea05a3f7cd67decaaadb226d27a536087f4d10963a3d6f&
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> totally on purpose
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not bcs i just slammed that and didnt care
09:57 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> :kekw:
09:57 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yes I thought so
09:57 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> (it's kinda messy for scrolling)
09:58 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ChillerDragon: if I get to have enough time ima try making a silly port of Bomb to ddnet-insta
09:58 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> cuz... why not
09:59 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> also lua gametypes support when
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uf btw, fng is super buggy xD
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think ddnet-10 compat sucks hard rn
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is that vanilla
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno about vanilla
09:59 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it's vanilla local server with alivefng (I don't even fucking know how it got there btwüò≠)
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> OH btw I forgot to tell you something I was thinking about yesterday
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> remember that one ddnet-rs-data issue I opened
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> well I was thinking it would be cool to make skins have their own .json too
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so yu can customize stuff even more
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> example: eyes distance
10:00 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> (meaning canonizing nouis will be possible)
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think we dont need that bcs
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can do that in animations already
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so better add animations support
10:01 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> fair enough tbh
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it doesnt exist in animations, i'd still add it there
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you can rotate, scale and stuff
10:01 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hell yeah
10:02 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @big eyed bencie porting bomb can be just a matter of copy pasting this xd https://github.com/M0REKZ/kaizo-insta/tree/104bd94946e355b0ff4d70bbd5fad67cb845c55b/src/game/server/gamemodes/vanilla/BOMB
10:02 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> oh
10:03 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> oh right
10:03 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> damn they beat me to it \:(
10:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well its still downstream
10:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: where do i get solofng1 map?
10:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its probably still work to copy paste it
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller
10:03 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I just remembered the time I wanted to port instashield
10:03 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> but failed
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> didn't u have like a CI map
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with all ddnet features
10:03 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> horrendously
10:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ‚ú™ coverage.map in ddnet repo
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh wow, we put it into data üòÑ
10:04 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> btw jopsti why can't I go far the window with the cursor
10:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat https://github.com/ddnet-insta/fng-maps-06/blob/master/ctf5_solofng.map
10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what?
10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> outside?
10:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and here the entires server config @milkeeycat https://github.com/ddnet-insta/solofng-cfg
10:05 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yeah
10:05 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> :C
10:05 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431931848405155900/20251026-0905-44.6761323.mp4?ex=68ff35f4&is=68fde474&hm=19344e454a96cdae283500cd41a5bc065f7c02fcb07f3820e6775b9e27ed59f0&
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet doesn't allow either. i think it was kinda hard in SDL2, bcs their states is random on different OS...
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe with winit it's easier
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but you can do `inp.dbg_mode true` in f1 and restart
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it will also go outside ingame then
10:07 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> true
10:08 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> would be cool if it was unlocked in the UI but locked in-game
10:08 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that would make sense I think
10:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> same guy already beet yopu to it
10:09 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> WHAT
10:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes and no
10:09 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> HE DID?????
10:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on windows it's a mess in fullscreen
10:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> yeah, link to the client is
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would probs depend on if you fullscreen or not too
10:10 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> https://github.com/M0REKZ/kaizo-network
10:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ping me when/if you solve the issue
10:10 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> https://github.com/M0REKZ/kaizo-network
10:10 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> o yeah
10:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat i have no idea how to approach it 
10:10 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> do note code is under different liscnece
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i add to todo list, maybe i fix it some day xdd
10:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat i already looked at it months ago and could not make any sense out of it
10:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you know how to reproduce the error?
10:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> woww I sure do love adding cheats to my client!!!
10:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431939047823245362/image.png?ex=68ff3ca9&is=68fdeb29&hm=1b94a6044a28b9781aaa00f17fe299540f778080a204c295bd69c5624c0f44e0&
10:34 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> oh no ):
10:34 < bridge> <melon> :froggo_cry:
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @pluskz no offense I like your work and you're a god at coding 
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> but
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 
10:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> why
10:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> also, as you added instashield visual support it would be neat if you also made a prediction thing for it
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://tenor.com/view/fbi-gif-2734175389934997010
10:37 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> its not ddnet server, not kz server, not vanilla and not fng
10:38 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it's batman!!!
10:38 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> it should be an allow list rather than a deny list and even then ddnet/vanilla cannot zoom so any client shouldnt
10:39 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 100% agreed
10:39 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> apparently the TeeFusion guys disallowed Kaizo Client lol
10:39 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431940392428765296/image.png?ex=68ff3de9&is=68fdec69&hm=0a085c7067e8e2934b3e03a72389ebab0f580f26ebbd23376dbba27ca1b32450&
10:40 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> teefusion is an allow list
10:40 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> probably doesnt know what a kaizo is
10:40 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> https://github.com/M0REKZ/kaizo-network/issues/17
10:41 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> generally speaking, why adding that?
10:41 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it makes no sense at all
10:42 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i wish they just contributed to tclient
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> hehehehe
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i should merge that scoreboard one, storma and kaizo have it i think enough people want it theres not any reason to deny it
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i will probably steal someone elses implementation the one in the pr is a bit
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> eeehh
10:43 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> what scoreboard thing?
10:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> where you can right click add friend/mute/etc
10:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i mgiht do my own implementation
10:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i want to make it customizable for the mod tools
10:44 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> i don't get it I can't see anything
10:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> idk how it works on the clients
10:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> but it exists
10:45 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> try stroma
10:45 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> link
10:45 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> <a:catCheer:1254881461006368798>
10:59 < bridge> <Assa> good morning
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs adjusted the distance to the player <-> player collision size e.g. hopefully skin size
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431945613599178874/test-hook-line_2025-10-26_10-49-11.mp4?ex=68ff42c6&is=68fdf146&hm=63977e63b56300cbebfe3f3a00b690c40180bdb73a985b7afb0c79c6e2d1834b&
11:03 < bridge> <kebscs> can you show with pou
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> I see this message with ddnet-nightly btw
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> pou?
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> poop?
11:04 < bridge> <kebscs> -Baby_Dou_KZ-
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> is that a skin?
11:04 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://ddnet.org/skins/>
11:04 < bridge> <kebscs> yes, should be on top
11:04 < bridge> <kebscs> if sorted by name
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> there the hookline will look to short, and on fatskins it will look to long
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> if that's what you want to test
11:07 < bridge> <Assa> like this is expected.
11:07 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431947446463758458/screenshot_2025-10-26_11-07-06.png?ex=68ff447b&is=68fdf2fb&hm=a7825ab198f94d268f1e1bed5a239db444c4717f83a08580387171215d9e4872&

11:08 < bridge> <Assa> and if you'd play this skin in zcatch, I'd disable skins.
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> this skin doesn't even have feet, literally unplayable
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> yes, I am so old school that I look at my feet in order to know if I have double jump.
11:11 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> Loading screen idea
11:11 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431948383685316689/image.png?ex=68ff455a&is=68fdf3da&hm=7ab6785487f15ba5799791ff33b8c4a563ed6c9decfa7f0fab0030c9db5f2b64&
11:12 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> The BG would be a screenshot of the map that's actually being played
11:12 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> maybe fetched from <https://ddnet.org/ranks/maps/>
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> loading takes around 10ms per map on ddnet-rs
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could just show the map
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everything in ddnet-rs should take less than 1s
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else it's sucks
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this little guy is animated btw
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431948818814865550/20251026-1013-07.0996604.mp4?ex=68ff45c2&is=68fdf442&hm=20598f3f0c7e937bab15ccbf2f35b1c520f9747a79f96cec2153c58a98349a34&
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> actually
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> not really
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> at least not in my case
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it takes a while to parse the map and all that (when talking about ddnet legacy retrocompatibiliy)
11:13 < bridge> <Assa> make a minigame where you need to plug a plug into a router
11:13 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it takes a while to parse the map and all that (when talking about ddnet legacy retrocompatibility)
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you know how to enable a terminal in windows?
11:14 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> uh yea
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `./ddnet-rs "dbg.bench true"`
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you see how long what takes
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah true, downloading can also take more time
11:14 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://tenor.com/mcazc5Mg1za.gif
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but downloading a fullscreen image takes just as long
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
11:14 < bridge> <filoqcus> https://tenor.com/view/pipotam-baby-hippo-hippo-wash-shower-gif-3406421565683572068
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that's why it's blurred
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so it doesnt need to download fullscreen
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> like
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> not a big image
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> but a small one instead
11:15 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> kind of like how whatsapp handles the precached images
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best would be if the menu background map would simply be nicer
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like having a region for loading
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> having a region for settings
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> etc.
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.7 kinda tried that
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but honestly not good enough
11:16 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> in my design the bg map doesn't even exist thoü•∫
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but do you want to completely drop it?
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's nice customization
11:16 < bridge> <filoqcus> When will ddnet-rs be released? üòÑ
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> especially easy customization
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can download it every day
11:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I mean, the bg could still be customizable, just not as a map with these "points"
11:18 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> they're there in DDNet/Tw just because the UI doesn't really use the whole screen
11:18 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> specially the main menu
11:18 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this is a different case
11:19 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> the UI actually takes the whole screen, so there's no way to do a main focus in the background in order to make it be much full of stuff (example: the sun in the default one, or the snowy one)
11:19 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that's why I prefer something simpler, something more flat
11:19 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that can still be customized color-wise, but not design wise
11:20 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> tho that's just my opinion, I know players would prefer if the game was *entirely* customizable
11:20 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> which is why I suggested letting players/modders use some kind of css-ish file to customize how the menu looks itself
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but this can all be done with background maps
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can use by default a flat one
11:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> both the layout and the design of it as a whole
11:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I wasn't talking about the bg on this tho
11:21 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> but yeah fair enough
11:22 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> wait i just realized this is to make the teamchat messages more obvious
11:22 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1431951044472082665/image.png?ex=68ff47d5&is=68fdf655&hm=f5ae765d83d9e4846f695a52a383e4a7a64741a05435880bb70ed7281b18d4fa&
11:22 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this is genius
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually it's just me being lazy
11:23 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ecks dee
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of proper design just put border xD
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like it like discord when you get pinged
11:23 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> talking about this ima make a concept for how the different message types could work like in ddnet-rs redesign
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's more decent
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blazulite
11:23 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @jupeyy_keks
11:23 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> woah prq jumpscare
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ingame ui really needs a redesign
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> about menu ui, we still have to talk.. i want smth where communities are visible rn
11:24 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yeah I took a lot of inspo on that for ddnet

11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we really need some collection of all your concepts, i lost track
11:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> "inspo" as for "straight up plagiarism"
11:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> but eh :D
11:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> want access to the figma file?
11:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so u can take a peep whenever you want
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can already tell ya, if the chat window is always that big, ppl will dislike it
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc it looks cool on a screenshot
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but playing with it is annoying xD
11:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it's not always big

11:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> thinking about it this shouldn't really be a thing in ddrace honestly
11:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it's irrelevant for ddrace
11:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it should just be on instagib/vanilla modes imo
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hard to say
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i prefer that over chat msgs "team x has finished"
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the selfkills are maybe too much
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they spam too much
11:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I don't think that's bad tbh
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all chat stuff is just a workaround
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you do /top5
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you actually want a nice ui where you can see leaderboards instead
11:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> real
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so no logs or anything?
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just that
11:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> i would rather not show them by default
11:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> no normal player understands the more "advanced" texts
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true true
11:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this text right here could update

11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dunno a single line somewhere
11:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so for example
11:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> uhh wait lemme throw a quick concept real quick
11:36 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> to show what I mean with what I'm gonna say
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can you cancel?
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD

12:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat I sadly have no idea how to reproduce I just see the occasional logs of asan in production
12:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder if i should start turning on teehistorian to investigate such unreproducible bugs but idk sounds like work xd
12:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do you have a core dump?
12:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah, it will probably have secret values, nvm xd
12:34 < bridge> <patiga> link link link
12:46 < bridge> <melon> @patiga
12:46 < bridge> <melon> oh thanks discord, it told me that message is new >:C
12:47 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> nevorr
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I'm pretty sure https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/blob/01949170919308bd1a0048a7270b0a418e897281/src/game/server/gamemodes/base_pvp/base_pvp.cpp#L1949 gets called somehow
14:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat i tried to reference the logs i think you are onto something
14:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `2025-10-19 15:00:08 E ddnet-insta: cid=11 changed from ddrace team 1 to ddrace team 0 but is still alive`
14:07 < bridge> <Assa> CHILLER why do you approve something I found a flaw with?
14:08 < bridge> <Assa> sec need to read more
14:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont approve your flaw
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> nah github ui trolled me, didn't show me your comment without reloading
14:10 < bridge> <Assa> just your approval xD
14:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** javascript
15:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> is it possible that its corruption and hash collision
15:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> hash(correct packet) == hash(corrupted packet)
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> really good question, theoretically yes but so unlikely that you have to submit an example to the world
15:10 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> does ddnet also have hashes
15:10 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> or does it let udp handle it
15:14 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> udp splits everything into 16 bits then sums them
15:14 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> then the checksum is the number to add to make it 2^16-1
15:14 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> a collision is very easy to do
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> I was talking about normal sha256 or more
15:15 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> welll udp doesnt do that
15:16 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> idk how often bit swaps are
15:16 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> idk how common bit swaps are
15:16 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> but do 2 of them anywhere and you break it
15:16 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> idk how common bit flips are
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> this depends on the network and technology, like even on that level they are uncommon and there are failsaves or extra bits for error correction. Modern glass fibre has a very very low error rate
15:17 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> like most network problems its usually on the user end than the majority distance
15:18 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> if udp checksums are the only failsafe then it is possible for it to fail catching the failure
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> yes probably, and we have control over both ends
15:20 < bridge> <pluskz> Well, allthehaxx client (a accepted client) has zooming in other mods that are not vanilla and fng so I just replicated what the accepted client does xd
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> what do you mean by accepted client? lol
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> don't wonder if you get autobanned by anticheat in the future
15:22 < bridge> <pluskz> A client that even Heinrich contributed to

15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't look at the markdown tho üòÖ
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blazulite i try the eyes thing now
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> resizing stuff is always hard.. loss of quality and stuff, but let's see
16:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> ehhhhh
16:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> it does have lua scripts which admitadly are up to the user to not exploit
16:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> but i think thers a version without
16:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> contributions from people arent indicators of acceptance
16:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> really all clients apart from ddnet and teewords are accepted (i cant think of a better word)
16:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> endorsed!
16:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> eh
16:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> it is alot of word to make sure a client isnt adding unfair things
16:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> especially when unfair is not well defined
16:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> but zooming in other gamemodes is definatley unfair
16:13 < bridge> <pluskz> Is zooming in Teeware unfair?
16:13 < bridge> <pluskz> Or Monster
16:17 < bridge> <pluskz> Anyways you are right, it is probably better to add the whitelist instead of gametype blacklist for zooming
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blazulite looks fine ig

16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno, if there is a difference i'd say the left looks better, and that is the rescaled one xdd
16:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> accepted?
16:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ath???
16:29 < bridge> <pluskz> xD
16:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yayy
16:32 < bridge> <pluskz> I just didn't want to play zoomed in on a big screen, sad
16:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> well then play ddrace?
16:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> :kek:
16:34 < bridge> <pluskz> :(((
16:39 < bridge> <remakepower> Yeah, that's annoying.
16:41 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> git gud
16:43 < bridge> <remakepower> :nouis:
16:47 < bridge> <remakepower> That's why I don't play fullscreen Teeworlds on a monitor that's nearly the size of a TV screen.
16:49 < bridge> <manikoo> wow fancy
17:02 < bridge> <Teero> chillerdragon you nut
17:02 < bridge> <Teero> 6,6 isnt even the position you are standing on lmao
17:05 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> teeware yes, you can see more grenades when they are falling down
17:06 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> probably not that strong of an advantage but you can see where monsters are faster
17:08 < bridge> <pluskz> on monster would more like a personal advantage since it is not a PVP mode
17:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> well one could argue you are fighting other people for money
17:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> the solution is just port mosnter to ddnet-insta and allow zoom B)
17:11 < bridge> <pluskz> wdym xd, it is not coop?
17:11 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> well survival is not.. very hard
17:13 < bridge> <pluskz> also when i join a monster server everyone just votes free points for all until they become OP and then get bored and leave xd
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i swear the f1 console in ddnet just randomly deleted my input everytime i tried to write "connect localhost" (<- deleted when i reached `loca`".. then tabbed out to record, and it was fixed
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> weird bug
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i can reproduce
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> start client -> go main menu -> start local server -> type "connect localhost" in f1
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok no need to start local server
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually no need to go to main menu xd

17:24 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> hehe
17:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero so what is 6,6 then?
17:28 < bridge> <Teero> some bs number
17:28 < bridge> <Teero> you are dividing twice
17:28 < bridge> <Teero> map is shifted by 200
17:28 < bridge> <always> hey chiller do u think 128p is coming on ddnet 20.0
17:29 < bridge> <Teero> it's already in the clients no?
17:29 < bridge> <always> well official servers
17:30 < bridge> <always> and some of the block servers i see have 128p
17:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so i need to divide by the shift then @Teero ?
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> ????
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> no just remove the divide
17:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but 200 is too high
17:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i want a number from 0-10
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> rbooo
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> readddd
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> the map is shifted by 200
17:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so?
17:31 < bridge> <Teero> to account for the death edge
17:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** unshift by 200?
17:32 < bridge> <Teero> no
17:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i get my number then
17:32 < bridge> <Teero> 203,206 is the number you want
17:32 < bridge> <Teero> that is the position
17:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no i want a number between 0 and 10 :C 
17:32 < bridge> <Teero> or do - 200 if you will
17:32 < bridge> <always> teero how does ur imgui ui look
17:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oke
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> doesnt happen on steam client üòÆ
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that one of these sdl-compat shit bugs
17:33 < bridge> <Teero> idk, not that great
17:34 < bridge> <always> can i c or is it top secret
17:36 < bridge> <Teero> https://youtu.be/C8CI0jBYP4M?si=XxdPyQBM7-zKL8bi
17:36 < bridge> <Teero> some things have changed since then but not much
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably related to SDL version, works for me
17:37 < bridge> <always> doesnt look that bad
17:37 < bridge> <always> isnt that the default imgui font
17:37 < bridge> <always> maybe u could change the font
17:37 < bridge> <always> and removing these

17:38 < bridge> <always> oka
17:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @always 128 is far from polished, reviewed and merged
17:45 < bridge> <always> so do u think by the time 20.0 rolls around it will be added ?
19:17 < bridge> <imilchshake> oooh im not  the only one?
19:18 < bridge> <imilchshake> had weird problems with DDNet not being able to properly capture the mouse after switching focus, when using sdl3/sdl2-compat so im still chilling on sdl2 xd

20:05 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> its very annoying they did that tho
20:05 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> sdl2-compat should be different from sdl2
20:06 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> both should satisfy sdl2, but sdl2-compat be the default
20:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> yeah. my understanding is that sdl2-compat is sdl3 but with some backwards compatability layer?
20:07 < bridge> <imilchshake> seems like its not compatible enough :justatest:
20:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> yis
20:07 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> yis
20:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> why is it the default then :cammo:
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> its not just the default
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> theres no sdl2
20:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> fair, they completely purged it from official repos
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> not fair
20:08 < bridge> <imilchshake> thats kinda crazy
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> sdl2-compat is not perfect
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> far from it
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> theres glithces that make it unusable
20:08 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> which have been left unfixed with open issues
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> showing that they are not high priority
20:09 < bridge> <imilchshake> :pepeW:
20:09 < bridge> <imilchshake> does sdl3 have any benefits at least?
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> its not like this a permanent thing
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> they can fix it
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> yis
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> uses ids instaed of array index for many things
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> more consistent naming
20:09 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> more apis to platform dependent things (some things though are questionable when controlling caps lock is out of scope)
20:10 < bridge> <imilchshake> that sounds nice:)
20:10 < bridge> <imilchshake> xd
20:11 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> yeah
20:11 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> they also have redone some vidoe stuff to match reality better
20:11 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> except ddnet doesnt care about reality and kinda depends on the old one
20:11 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> and i cant get it to work
20:11 < bridge> <imilchshake> ooh just found ur PR #10246
20:11 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10246
20:12 < bridge> <imilchshake> nice
20:12 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> kinda waiting on someone who knows what they rae doing with ddnet-libs
20:12 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> it should be added before its added in sdl3 to make the pr not fail
20:13 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> then i can start throwing virtual machines at it
20:13 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i also got multi monitor back again so i can test that
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> red ci

21:37 < bridge> <filoqcus> `Sdl 3 attemp 1000...`
21:38 < bridge> <filoqcus> `Sdl3 attemp 1000...`
21:38 < bridge> <filoqcus> `Sdl3 attempt 1000...`
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i am pretty sure sdl2 compat is its own library which just provides sdl3 implementations of sdl2 functions. not a different version of either library itself
21:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i am talking about how arch linux packages them
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> what has been the main thing holding the sdl3 port(s) back
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i havent seen the code
21:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Addnet-insta%2Fddnet-insta+%22dieing%22&type=code it's `dying` btw xd
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> just a lot to do?
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> or is there a technical challenge
