10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Hey,
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> just tried building the master, but I get `make[3]: *** No rule to make target 'release/libddnet_engine_shared.a', needed by 'DDNet.exe'.  Stop.`.
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> I Use Windows + MinGW.
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> 
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Earlier, I see `[40%] Built target rust_engine_shared_target`, last time I built there was no rust code in DDNet I think... Is this related?
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> 
10:41 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Any hints appreciated 🙂

10:49 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> also, if I run make again the console prints

10:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> did you regenerate the makefiles
10:52 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Oh yea, a few times. Or do you mean after a specific step?
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wasn't that fixed already in latest ddnet code
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What version do u compile
10:54 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> master
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Up to date?
10:54 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> yea sure
10:54 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> just cloned
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Guess u can manually move that file for now
10:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> huh?
10:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It will be somewhere in the build directory
10:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Simply at the wrong place
10:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> the following works for me
10:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> `git clone https://github.com/ddnet --recurse-submodules`
10:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> `cd ./ddnet`
10:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> `cmake -B ./build -S . && cmake --build ./build`
10:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> creates all targets as expected
10:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> gcc.exe (Rev6, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.1.0
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i could try -G to make it use make
11:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i use ninja normally
11:01 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> doesn't seem to be the case... I did a full directory search.
11:01 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Interestingly, I can see the file in CMakeRuleHashes.txt: `bd543074308499423d5b2703dffb2685 release/libddnet_engine_shared.a`
11:01 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> The file is not there though, just .rlib and and .d extensions.
11:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Do you have a target dir in root dir?
11:02 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> nope
11:04 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> output of that command: https://pastebin.com/0YqiSqpD
11:06 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> gcc.exe (Rev6, Built by MSYS2 project) 10.2.0
11:06 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> ^ is this too old?
11:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> oh  sry, i didnt read carefully
11:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u have no rust compiler installed?
11:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think that's the issue. i just added mine as a snapshot of around when my env has been updated last. sys upgrade couldn't hurt. it's prob rustc/cargo tho
11:06 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> I have. otherwise CMake doesn't even run through
11:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> try installing ninja and doing -G Ninja ig
11:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> cuz that's what works for me
11:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> `PS C:\Users\l.ccc\Documents\Repositories\ddnet> rustc --version
11:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> rustc 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)`
11:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> seems like it could be a build system thing
11:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> sure, I can do that... but would be nice to pin the root cause and if its not an issue on my end fix the cause upstream!?
11:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> not suggesting as a fix. just to see if it is related to which build tool
11:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> You could share the Makefile that was generated by the cmake command
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> i tried a make build just for the fun of it and wow i forgot how slow 😴
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> my poor little cpu putting along
11:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> tho i feel like it should be using more jobs by default right?
11:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> with ninja or make?
11:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> make
11:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> make usually uses only 1 core
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i feel like it was a cmake pref
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> pass --parallel to cmake
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah there it is
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> when u also build with cmake
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but if u manually call make: make -j 20
11:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> whatever core count u have
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
11:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
11:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> u can do way more than core count. make jobs don't correspond directly to cpu threads
11:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yep, i usually do core count *1,25 xd
11:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but i use ninja most of the time anyway, to not having to deal with that :D
11:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or thread count actually*
11:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128253983912370228/image.png
11:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> 😃
11:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> make -j 40 xd
11:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wtf xD welcome to the matrix
11:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a easy fix is to use linux
11:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
11:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> another ez fix is to use rust only, right?
11:19 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> BTW I USE LINUX GUISE
11:19 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> so
11:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
11:19 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> yea, it works with WSL
11:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> ryo does the other common trope
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> 'educating' ppl in passive convo about the difference between free and oss
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wsl is fake
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> wsl is as real as it gets
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> build worked w make anyway there goes my hunch
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not real
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :catgun:
11:20 < ws-client> <Jupstar> unreal
11:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> what's fake about it? the image is the same
11:21 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128254607848644699/Makefile
11:21 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> here is the makefile @jupeyy_keks
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what
11:21 < bridge_> <villager114514> May I ask what is the relationship between onsnapinput and tick
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its good to educate
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> we all know already
11:22 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> you are just spamming a constructive convo with elitism
11:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> we just don’t care about stallman’s pointless distinctions
11:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> truth*
11:22 < bridge_> <villager114514> Does he execute onsnapinput for each tick
11:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well a tick certainly snaps
11:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt bring anything about stallman
11:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @gutzufusss mh seems like it uses CMakeFiles\Makefile2 additionally xdd
11:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my argument that linux fixes this is true
11:24 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> x
11:24 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128255501965213758/Makefile2
11:25 < bridge_> <villager114514> What is the relationship, whether it is one-to-many or one-to-one, and how do I know which the tick is in the onsnap process
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wait
11:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> are u doing client side code?
11:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> :justatest:
11:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> 🚨
11:26 < bridge_> <villager114514> yes
11:26 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> no, im sure he is talking about snapping server side input. dude go fix some whitespaces
11:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @gutzufusss CMakeFiles\rust_engine_shared_target.dir\build.make xd
11:26 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> no, im sure he is talking about snapping server side input.
11:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok i wont help u make a bot
11:26 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> i will villager
11:26 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> dm me
11:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont
11:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> see
11:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> windows users amirite
11:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why would u help him bot
11:28 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128256387802206319/build.make
11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and im sure he is s alt acc of another that got banned from this chat
11:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @robyt3 dont u build on windows
11:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe u know
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i checked this guy gh
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is definitely into botting too
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kekw
11:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 do u know why this fails on windows?
11:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^ log
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 no legit devs these days
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :PES4_Cry:
11:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Does not __obviously__ look wrong to me
11:36 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> whats ur github again?
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont talk to botters
11:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> why is he bot now? xd
11:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what did i miss
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check his gh
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on discord u can stalk a bit
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
11:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ah rip
11:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk his client seems dope
11:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> nani
11:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar> input scripting is sadly always a different word for cheating
11:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s not its only feature
11:43 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but _the_ feature to make sure not to promote it in public
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> bot dev checklist:
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - windows
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - client side code
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - build issues
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - new to chat
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - somtimes broken english
11:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> hi guys client’s first release next week
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hi
11:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ryozuki why is this so true XD
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what u talking about ewan?
11:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar> they always have build issues xDD
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh I don’t have build issues ig I don’t qualify
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’m getting a cool issue with my loader tho where it crashes only in release mode
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> new to chat too
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> so i have to set up a relwithdebinfo build
11:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> fhviosm
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i always build rel with debug
11:47 < bridge_> <villager114514> That's it. Let me explain how, I want write a detection bot on the TeeWorlds server. My goal is to detect significant deviation in the player's perspective. Each tick detection does not work. I wanted to write an anti cheat test, so today I wrote a simple aimbot to test, which is already written. However, the anti cheat I wrote for the server does not work, and it cannot detect the simple aimbot i wrote.
11:48 < bridge_> <villager114514> That's it. Let me explain how, I want write a detection bot on the TeeWorlds server(ICTF). My goal is to detect significant deviation in the player's perspective.

However, the anti cheat I wrote for the server does not work, and it cannot detect the simple aimbot i wrote.
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if ur doing antibot for ddnet there is a stub library
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for tw idk
11:48 < bridge_> <villager114514> not for ddnet just for tws
11:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check where the antibot interface is hooked on ddnet
11:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it will give u leads
11:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the code isnt that different iirc
11:53 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> lol, im not a botter. i was the one who got ATH unbanned on DDNet by REMOVING cheat features. but okay. btw, i remember you spreading malicious lua scripts disguised as cheats back in the day.
11:54 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> if you are talking about the external tw stuff... this shows once again, how little you know about teeworlds dev.
11:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ??? nice invent lmao
11:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> botter talking mighty high
11:54 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> if you have anything more to say, please dm. i wanna keep this on topic...
11:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its funny cuz ur the one spreading misinfo
11:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i never touched lua in my life
11:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i despise that lang
11:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so shut yer mouth botter
11:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur the noname here
11:56 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> Meskalin ô.O
11:56 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> does that ring a bell?
11:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> pls take off topic attack to dm
11:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> or just don’t
11:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye he is the one attacking
11:57 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> ?
11:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> good one
11:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> I would be incredibly surprised if someone is around this bubble as long as you have been and has never touched or used cheats
11:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i in fact never did
11:59 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125765388140019712/1126899872369487942/cool_hamermemre.demo.mp4
11:59 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> 
11:59 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> this demo says otherwisre
12:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh shit
12:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whats that
12:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> everyone has a past lol. who cares now if you did it then
12:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> just don’t be so elite
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dude unrly believe him?
12:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i legit never cheated
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and its kind of sad how easy u get swayed
12:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ??? where is this video a proof lol
12:00 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> its not
12:00 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> its a random demo lol
12:01 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> i want to make him angry at this point
12:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @Discord Mod bad faith troll botter
12:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> just so u know GutZuFuss all ur deleted msgs stay in the chat archives
12:01 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> so anyways, ill just wait for my old friend heinrich to come online
12:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xddd
12:02 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> then fix it in my local setup, and you elitist little virus spreader can rot in hell @ryozuki . this discussion is hereby ended and i will not comment further
12:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> 😃
12:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
12:02 < bridge_> <Iza> To me it seems like a civil discussion
12:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> it’s v civil
12:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is reflecting
12:03 < bridge_> <Iza> Ah he deleted some messages?
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> irc doesnt forget
12:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> anyway ryo i have no way to know if you ever cheated or contributed to the cheat bubble but it rly doesn’t matter
12:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> and ur response gives off rly insecure vibes that makes me think you have at one point
12:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> but idk
12:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @mpft kind of saddened u think like this
12:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im just rly passionate about ddnet
12:04 < bridge_> <Iza> Guys chill
12:04 < bridge_> <Iza> Switch topics
12:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> :justatest:
12:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but ill say it again
12:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i never botted xD
12:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> without a proof, this is a one sided blame anyway. So please end this topic here, thanks
12:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok
12:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
12:08 < bridge_> <Iza> Help him make the bot so you can send the staff team the unique identifiers of the bot 👍
12:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
12:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> what’s the staff team gonna do
12:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i prefer doing useful things like i did
12:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> telegun, fixes, wiki, teesmash, rust, more rust, some tweaks here and there
12:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> talking about free software
12:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but not botting
12:10 < bridge_> <reitw> Ur childrens will learn 2 languages
12:10 < bridge_> <reitw> Ur native one and rust
12:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> why the native one?
12:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bloat
12:10 < bridge_> <reitw> Spanish ig for ryo
12:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> english if its still relevant
12:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then rust
12:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why bother with spanish
12:10 < bridge_> <reitw> Aren't u
12:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just learn the international lang
12:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
12:10 < bridge_> <reitw> Lmao true
12:10 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> hi rei 😄
12:11 < bridge_> <reitw> Yo xush
12:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> learn
12:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> imagine having kids tho
12:11 < bridge_> <reitw> U can spread the rust vibe
12:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nah
12:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they probs wouldnt wanna be coders
12:12 < bridge_> <Iza> I doubt they’re gonna love coding when you push them to it
12:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
12:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would just show them im passionate about it
12:12 < bridge_> <reitw> You can show them but not force
12:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and they decide what they wanna do
12:12 < bridge_> <reitw> They should learn by themselves
12:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they probs would want to be influencers
12:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> instead of astronauts
12:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
12:13 < bridge_> <reitw> :justatest:
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i hope we talk about AI kids
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and human
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> not human*
12:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u could genetically modify next humans to remove violence would u do it
12:16 < ws-client> <Jupstar> hard to say, maybe it also has evolutional benefits to be violent some times
12:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> no children
12:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> giving birth to a baby is also violent
12:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> the world can’t afford it
12:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> :twintri:
12:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> :satya:
12:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i see what u did there
12:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1678545170508267522.html
12:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36675934
12:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’m not into ai. what do i Glen from this
12:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> - all of github
12:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> glean
12:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> quagmire
12:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the details on how they made gpt 4
12:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> "We believe it has a total of ~1.8 trillion parameters" uff
12:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> a brain has 86 billion neurons (but analog ones ofc ^^)
12:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> the future is grim
12:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
12:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> still lot to get to brain power
12:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gpt itself has no memory either right
12:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well it also depends how u compare it
12:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> gpt-4 know basically everything.. but often not correctly
12:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sure it can compute fast
12:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it lacks the human brain thing, intuition, abstract thinking, philosphy, being aware of one self
12:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well is the question if it needs that to be helpful
12:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> are all these things "intelligence"?
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think they are key to questions related to society
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> e.g how to manage a human colony
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the best most efficient way
12:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> animals can be intelligent without being self aware or having abstract thinking
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u need to factor human behavior
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @mpft i dont think thats intelligence
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its just instinct reactiong
12:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok depends
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on how u define intelligence
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
12:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> jacuzzi
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we could say gpt is intelligent in some areas
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it still kind of feels fake to me
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it doesnt feel like an entity
12:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i'd say gpt-4 impressed me mostly by the absolutely insane language capabilities.. but logical thinking is ofc completely trash xd
12:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just a agregation of data
12:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for example
12:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gpt lacks initiative
12:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it wont do anything unless u ask
12:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats the definition of robot
12:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
12:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> it could never make such a masterpiece as jacuzzi
12:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > "Intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, τ. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped".
12:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> funny quote
12:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> 😺
12:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> look at this dude
12:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> he’s smiling
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Some skeptics believe that there is no meaningful way to define intelligence, aside from "just pointing to ourselves".
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > it was always creepy when it understood my bad formulated bad english question better than me myself xD
12:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> are u ok ewan
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont u need to sleep
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > LMAO
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > Ewan u are 17
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ur way to think about this world will not change every year
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > for atleast next 8 years
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > good luck
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > will now*
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > wtf
12:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think it will
12:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when u get a work
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > was typo xd
12:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> get ur routine
12:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> outside of school
12:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> I think intelligence can be any force employed for self preservation
12:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > it will change every year now
12:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u get to decide what to do, which will mostly be just work
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and u need to find some goals
12:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> I need a work
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or u will depres
12:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar > xDD
12:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> goal is work
12:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> need job
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> after that i mean
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not having a goal can be depressive xd
12:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> goal = make money
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> after u get a job i meant
12:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> move out
12:36 < ws-client> <Jupstar > after u got a job u will eventually see your time being worth more than money ;)
12:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> or go to school again
12:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye thats my goal
12:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to move out
12:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its also nice to be able t osave lot of money
12:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im kind of a limbo
12:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> latest interview was rescheduled too far so they already had other candidates
12:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> z z z
12:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
12:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im glad im not searching for jobs rn
12:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its pain in ass
12:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ewan move to germany, then u get money until u 25 for free xd
12:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t want government’s money
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar > why not xd
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar > u dont have to pay it back
12:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can just as easily jump on unemployment for a few weeks here if i decide to move out
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont move out without backup money
12:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u can
12:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t like it in principle
12:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> taking government money without a need for it
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why not
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it sounds very american
12:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> it’s poor people behavior
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pff
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its what everyone does
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> even rich
12:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rich most than most
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yes
12:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe the narrative is different here
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also u pay it with ur taxes
12:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when u work anyway
12:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar > everyone cries for subsidies
12:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar > every company xd
12:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
12:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar > the money has to be earned else where
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > anyway, if u find a job u really like its fine i guess
12:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> here being on government assistance means you are underachieving and lazy
12:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well everywhere
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and then?
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > who cares xd
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > u can take the time to learn rust
12:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s bad
12:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have time
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and be better than all your coworkers
12:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur still 17 anyway
12:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
12:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i worked at 21
12:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i already worked with 16, ur lazy af
12:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
12:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yea
12:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar > but i also stopped working one year later xD
12:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> I am a freeloader
12:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nah
12:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur 17
12:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> enjoy life
12:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> Can’t

12:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yea they don’t know shit just repeat what mom says
12:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my father always said either study or get a job
12:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yeah u have to study ofc
12:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> I want to do one or the other
12:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > for the free money xd
12:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > but there is no study limits
12:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > u can just not study
12:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > nobody cares xD
12:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can’t school here without going into debt

12:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> i love this img
12:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar > dont pressure urself so much
12:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don’t see why I shouldn’t
12:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar > depsite your life, you have nothing to loose
12:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> government finds me as an adult in less than 1 month
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u cant vote
12:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> i need to get my name on the lease and stuff
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to me the gov doesnt see u as an adult
12:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’ll be able to vote then
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> isnt it 21
12:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> no
12:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> 21 to drink
12:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> 18 to vote
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah xd

12:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar > xd
12:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think that is also 21
12:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i saw vids of fathers buying their kid a glock
12:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar > but luckely your father has a gun
12:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea but I don’t live with father
12:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> no guns here
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > thats pretty dangerous xd
12:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> what is
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > Ewan you can also try to find remote jobs
12:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u should
12:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea that’s what i do
12:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> remote is best
12:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> all jobs i can get to
12:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> last one was not even American company
12:50 < ws-client> <Jupstar > do you look for junior jobs? or what exactly
12:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> I was having interview at 10 pm
12:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes or internships
12:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> i go off of what the listing asks for experience
12:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i'm surprised that it is so hard for you tbh
12:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i think i could get internships pretty much everywhere
12:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> out of school maybe
12:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > bro u 17 xD
12:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> wdym
12:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar > for them u basically a student
12:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> most companies dont hire underage
12:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> college graduate of a 4 yr degree here is 22
12:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> usually
12:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is my issue
12:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> the climate is also just bad
12:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
12:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on linkedin lot of ppl reach to me
12:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i thought america is the dream land of devs
12:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> my resume is barren and i have nothing to show for experience or schooling
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i'd have thought its rather in US too, but maybe im wrong
12:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can fix that
12:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do projects urself
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > or do free internships
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > accept a lower sallery first
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > then be the best
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and u rich af
12:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol do u think I’m turning down positions here??
12:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my first salary on half time was 700€ xd
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> half day
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or smth
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> forgot the word
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> part time
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
12:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> anyway there are plenty of opportunities for people with experience or school
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> join a bootcamp?
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its what most do
12:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> scam
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it doesnt matter
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u get to say u did x
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but ye
12:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i prefer to do projects
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my github helped me get jobs
12:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea that’s a long term thing
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also said i helped in ddnet
12:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> too long term
12:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> for rn
12:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
12:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar > then do a job without coding first?
12:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> i had a project that i pretty much continued only so i could have it on my resume for like a year but decided it wasn’t worth
12:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar > or is that a no go for you?
12:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk I would rather not
12:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar > the good about such jobs is, u dont have to take them serious at all :D
12:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t want to go outside where i live
12:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe if i lived in a better area
12:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar > uff
12:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t know if I should have left school
12:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar > just take the life as it comes
12:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar > dont questions your decisions too much
12:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> at the time the path looked clear and ez
13:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yeah but the path
13:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar > THE path
13:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar > not your path
13:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> once i realized i was ready for an internship or maybe a junior level job
13:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar > the path others want you to do
13:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> it seemed like a waste of time to stay
13:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> but all it did was remove routine from my everyday life
13:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > xdd
13:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > we've all been through that
13:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have nothing to show for the past 6 months
13:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> all i was being told is I can’t do both at once lol
13:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar > anyway, just continue, don't influence yourself into thinking that u fucked up
13:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar > that wont help
13:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk how long i should keep trying at this
13:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> is anything gonna change if i try another few months or am i just gonna waste more time
13:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar > depends on how exactly you try
13:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’ve been ‘networking’ as well as someone like me can
13:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i really dunno what u can do in america. but call the fkcin major and tell him your situation
13:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar > go more risk
13:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> wdym the major
13:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar > the mayor*
13:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
13:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar > tell him "i love this city and would like to make it a better place. im very good with computers, but its hard for me to find a job"
13:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar > just tell him smth he wants to hear xD
13:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wish i loved the city
13:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar > see, u dont go risk
13:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can also lie
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> get job
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> learn on the job
13:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> still can’t get in a room w someone
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur a minor too
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wouldnt go live with u
13:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> nah i mean
13:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can’t talk to anybody in charge
13:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> i talk to recruiters
13:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> they share the facts. which are that i have no experience or school
13:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> 😴
13:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> You are likely not using the correct rust toolchain. Run `rustup show` in your build directory to show your installed toolchains. For MinGW your active toolchain has to be a `*-gnu` one. For MSVC you need a `*-MSVC` one. Toolchain directory overrides don't work on Windows (at least for me). You need to set the toolchain globally either for MinGW or MSVS. If you use both, then you need to change the global settings manually whenever you use the othe
13:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then do a bet. One week u show ur skills. And if they don't take u then. They can fck themselves xd

13:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> lol
13:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> You are using MinGW, aren't you? So you have the wrong toolchain
13:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> how do i change it?
13:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> get rust from pacman
13:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Use `rustup`
13:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> u can get gcc rust from rustup on win?
13:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> thanks ❤️
13:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> now i can finally go make some bots @ryozuki  
13:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> 
13:09 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> BIG \s
13:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is no gcc rust
13:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its in the makings tho
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> only rust with llvm
13:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok. rust with gcc toolchain
13:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` is the toolchain I use
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gnu doesnt mean gcc
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is no gcc toolchain for rust
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gnu means the gnu abi
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> √
13:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> ✅
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is a target tripled
13:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it means

13:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
13:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i go sleep at 12 at most
13:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> work tires u
13:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> lately i have been going to sleep around 1
13:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> but I could never nap and maintain smth like that
13:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> not in my whole life
13:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s why I don’t usually nap but my face hurt so i did
13:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd

13:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Saved, thanks, I have much use for this
13:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> It’s from offtopic i think
13:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> amazing and accurate
13:24 < bridge_> <learath2> Sadge, everyone is only interested in cheating

13:28 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> idk if you remember me, but him accusing me of making cheats is just... yea.
13:28 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> when im reporting stuff to heinrich frequently and he told me he was also talking to you about it
13:28 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> just recently, 1 week ago maybe
13:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://youtu.be/4h4LOapwBW4
13:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> why such low fps
13:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> makes me sad

14:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Weird enterprise software gang
14:43 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> why is there an upvote option but not a downvote option LOL
14:58 < bridge_> <Iza> @zwelf2 are you still on the development of the teehistorian tool?
15:00 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Yes, and it had good progress recently: https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame. You can now convert teehistorian to demos (which also runs the ddnet physics)
15:03 < bridge_> <Iza> ah very nice. But I guess this version of the tool isn't being used on the teehistorian website right? How can I use this tool?
15:05 < bridge_> <zwelf2> if you have the teehistorian file run `cargo run --bin demo -- input.teehistorian mapfile.map output.demo`. (You need rust installed https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
15:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> oh wow, did u need to write the whole ddnet physics for that to work?
15:06 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Unfortunatly it still panics on some inputs (but I want to fix that soon)
15:07 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Yes, and I crated a lot of test files for that 🙂
15:07 < bridge_> <Iza> I've noticed on the current teehistorian version we have, it doesn't display the inputs very accurately
15:07 < bridge_> <zwelf2> currently ~500 unit tests for physics.
15:07 < bridge_> <Iza> I hope this is better in the newer versions
15:08 < bridge_> <zwelf2> with my replayer?
15:09 < bridge_> <Iza> I'm not sure who made the tool that we're currently using
15:10 < bridge_> <Iza> but learath mentioned you're working on a new tool, which is nice
15:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> #6819 and #5737 are still ready to be merged
15:46 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6819

15:50 < bridge_> <_gwendal> Hello there, do you guys think it's a good idea to work on @DDNet so he doesn't add that #0 in leave messages in #join-leave for discord users with the new usernames ?
15:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it is
15:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is this a request or u wanna do it
15:50 < bridge_> <_gwendal> nah i wanna try it
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> go for it
15:53 < bridge_> <Iza> as far as i know, the bot is taking the usernames from a discord api, but the discord api isn't really updated to the new name system yet
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im sure the discord api is
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its a new field or endpoint
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> discord rly does their api quite well
15:54 < bridge_> <_gwendal> maybe the py module isn't updated tho
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-structure
15:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its probably the python library method
15:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not the api itelf
15:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it should just use the username field
16:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @gutzufusss @ryozuki no personal attacks btw
16:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @gutzufusss did indeed create a legit version of ATH
16:07 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> bruh im the original author
16:07 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> whatever im gonna leave this discord
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> feel free to do so
16:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> did you change the rust toolchain?
16:08 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Hi, is there a way to change the map of a demo? 
16:08 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I wish to update a map's background for a video because the current one is too dark.
16:08 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I tried to open the demo in the editor to find the exact version of the map, edited it, replaced the old one and played the demo again but it seems to be ignoring the new map and overwrites it.
16:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki stop it
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt say anything wrong
16:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> moderation discussion → DM
16:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no exceptions
16:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> @ryozuki you are a massive fucking dick hole. i hope you die in a car accident. 
16:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> 
16:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> have a nice day 🙂
16:08 < bridge_> <gutzufusss> taking the fast way out
16:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's theoretically possible but there are no automated tools for this right now I think
16:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> maybe @zwelf2 has a tool like this, not sure
16:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> For most demo files the map is also embedded in the demo file, so changing the map file in your maps folder won't change the demo
16:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> You could remove the map file from the demo, so the map will get loaded from a file
16:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then you probably also have to adjust the SHA256 and CRC of the map in the demo so the player doesn't complain
16:13 < bridge_> <zwelf2> I wrote one for the wiki, but it doesn't work with the current version, because it only changes the crc: https://gitlab.com/ddnet-wiki/ddnet-wiki.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/scripts/demo_change_crc.py
16:14 < bridge_> <zwelf2> I wrote one for the wiki, but it doesn't work with the current version, because it only changes the crc: <https://gitlab.com/ddnet-wiki/ddnet-wiki.gitlab.io/-/blob/640cd1e7d9498cdb14840d34e1408d50df0a6cbf/scripts/demo_change_crc.py>
16:14 < bridge_> <patiga> I'll try to write a small python script
16:15 < bridge_> <patiga> crc and sha256 are calculated normally, right? no teeworlds quirkiness
16:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Doesn't CRC use a different starting value than normally or something like that?
16:16 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Thanks for your answers, I'll just wait 😄
16:16 < bridge_> <learath2> The current implementation is straight from libtw2 it was mostly a proof of concept kinda demo generator
16:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> CRC is not the normal zlib CRC, but sha256sum is normal
16:19 < bridge_> <learath2> @heinrich5991 didn't you once make a tool to minify demos by removing the embedded maps?
16:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> don't think so. I didn't want that tool to exist ^^
16:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> for archival reasons
16:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh but the crc is still wrong it won't help
16:21 < bridge_> <learath2> I think it was needed to fix a mistake I (or maybe you? I don't remember who did that part) made when adding sha256 to demos
16:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I made a small tool in JS that did that
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it's hosted on ddnet.org
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> yes that one
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/ddnet/fix-demo.html
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't exactly remember what it does but maybe it breaks it enough that it will just load any map? 😄
16:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it only fixes ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff sha256 though
16:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, and it does sanity checks
16:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so it won't break anything
16:23 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, then you'll need to wait until @patiga comes through 😄
16:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> The default starting value for CRC is 0 in TW
16:24 < bridge_> <learath2> @zwelf2 do you not have the dev role out of choice?
16:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> Default CRC starting value is `0xffffffff` according to google
16:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> He is the secret admin let's face it
16:25 < bridge_> <robyt3> Default CRC starting value is `0xffffffff` (`-1`) according to google
16:25 < bridge_> <patiga> ah, that helps
16:25 < bridge_> <learath2> :justatest: wym haha
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Secret carrying ddnet
16:25 < bridge_> <zwelf2> Never thought about it. I'd be happy to have it ^^
16:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> someone was faster than me
16:26 < bridge_> <learath2> There you go, enjoy :Celebrate:
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> People elitest
16:26 < bridge_> <learath2> It's actually all me, you and I are the only real people active in this channel, the rest are my other personalities
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Purple
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> *
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ah right. Almost forgot
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks for reminder
16:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> @vy0x2 should also get the dev role
16:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> done
16:30 < bridge_> <learath2> Are you sure about the crc not being just zlib crc?
16:30 < bridge_> <robyt3> The zlib dictate a starting value?
16:31 < bridge_> <learath2> Not really
16:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes. because the starting value is different
16:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> other than that it's the same
16:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required initial value for the crc. Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement)
16:31 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, in zlib docs at the very least they also use 0
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required initial value for the crc.
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> link?
16:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> `uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);`
16:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/zlib-crc32-1.html
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the correct initialization
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (see my quote of the docs)
16:32 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, I understand now
16:32 < bridge_> <learath2> yeah I was misreading it
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we should maybe start ignoring crc
16:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in the client
16:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> `// Only check CRC if we don't have the secure SHA256.`
16:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Seems like we do that already when loading maps
16:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah nice 🙂
16:37 < bridge_> <patiga> oh good
16:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd null out the CRC though
16:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so that it's clear it's unused
16:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @patiga
16:38 < bridge_> <patiga> oki 👍
16:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so u made rust
16:42 < bridge_> <learath2> It's possible
16:46 < bridge_> <patiga> stackoverflow down :ouch:
16:46 < bridge_> <patiga> ah back
16:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> works for me™
16:53 < bridge_> <_gwendal> Okay it's done i guess
16:53 < bridge_> <_gwendal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128338196502171710/Discord_mfH2RiQc6P.png
16:53 < bridge_> <_gwendal> it looks quite bad but well :justatest:
16:53 < bridge_> <_gwendal> the code looks quite bad but well :justatest:
16:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> nice. can you do a pull request?
16:56 < bridge_> <_gwendal> hmm i'll try
16:56 < bridge_> <_gwendal> but i'm not really comfortable with github, i just have some basic knowledge
16:57 < bridge_> <_gwendal> should i fork the whole main tree to change what is needed in my own repo ?
16:57 < bridge_> <_gwendal> then pull request ?
17:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, that's how it usually works
17:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
17:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you need help on the way, please ask
17:02 < bridge_> <Iza> @learath2 can we use this too for #bans ?
17:02 < bridge_> <learath2> No, different bots
17:02 < bridge_> <learath2> I thought I fixed that already tho
17:02 < bridge_> <Iza> no
17:03 < bridge_> <raf> Guys, how can i make a tee from the server side?
17:04 < bridge_> <raf> thank you so much who will answer because I can't find the answer for a long time
17:04 < bridge_> <myrkotov> Just snap character and player with specific id
17:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Well let me fix it then, thanks for the reminder
17:05 < bridge_> <raf> but i wont to tee will physic
17:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @_gwendal already fixed it
17:05 < bridge_> <_gwendal> @heinrich5991 i'm not quite sure which checkbox i should select
17:05 < bridge_> <_gwendal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128341289851703296/opera_MME0hpdpWl.png
17:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> currently the correct thing is selected
17:06 < bridge_> <raf> but i wont to tee will physicфд
17:06 < bridge_> <raf> but i wont to tee will physical
17:06 < bridge_> <patiga> ayy, that might just be a first try :D
17:06 < bridge_> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128341561869095042/2023-07-11-170538_1920x1080_scrot.png
17:06 < bridge_> <patiga> ah, should probably test with a non-default map
17:08 < bridge_> <patiga> yep
17:08 < bridge_> <patiga> alright, finishing touches
17:09 < bridge_> <_gwendal> i think i just created the pull request in my own repo lol. i probably should've commit it in my own repo then create a pull request with the real repo ?
17:09 < bridge_> <_gwendal> i think i just created the pull request in my own repo lol. i probably should've commit it in my own repo then create a pull request with the real repo instead ?
17:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> correct
17:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you link to your repo?
17:10 < bridge_> <_gwendal> https://github.com/Gwendaaaaal/ddnet-discordbot
17:11 < bridge_> <_gwendal> now that i merged my own pull request i should be able to pull request it on real repo
17:11 < bridge_> <_gwendal> yeah i am
17:12 < bridge_> <_gwendal> :D
17:13 < bridge_> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128343339213799547/demo_map_changer.py
17:14 < bridge_> <patiga> @pipou_tw here you go :)
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> note: CC-BY is not recommended for code
17:15 < bridge_> <patiga> hm
17:15 < bridge_> <patiga> what is recommended?
17:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://choosealicense.com/. e.g. MIT
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that would be similar to CC-BY, I think
17:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Does this also set the map size of the demo to zero? I think the client doesn't load the demo correctly otherwise
17:16 < bridge_> <patiga> it embeds the map
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do you write the map size then? ^^
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, you do
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> rust code is often licensed as `MIT OR Apache-2.0`
17:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> AGPL
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u used to use gpl, what changed?
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> best license
17:23 < bridge_> <patiga> hm it does kind of feel silly to write a long license as MIT into such a small script, as I read it MIT doesn't even have the BY part of CC-BY. can I just do CC0 and call it a day? ^^
17:23 < bridge_> <patiga> @ryozuki when I write smaller scripts I don't really think copy-left is all that useful
17:23 < bridge_> <patiga> with twmap python scripts I do agpl because the python module is agpl
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont get the sense of that
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but well its ok
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just write "MIT" instead of "CC-BY" I think
17:26 < bridge_> <patiga> its a tool I'd gladly see in the ddnet repo for instance, is such a tool interesting and worth a simple pull request?
17:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure if we have a policy on these tbh ^^
17:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> @heinrich5991 Can you merge #6819?
17:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6819
17:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> done
17:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> thanks
17:58 < bridge_> <patiga> (just for the sake of completeness, script with another license)
17:58 < bridge_> <patiga> keywords: demo change map replace file exchange

17:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant open in mobile to check license
17:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now in wondering
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> MIT
17:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah xd
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> discord previews it for me on desktop
18:01 < bridge_> <patiga> I consider this script inside of the normal ddnet ecosystem, as such I prefer permissiveness. Now that I write this out loud, MIT might not be exactly that but eh
18:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks for the script 🙂
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thanks for the script
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and sry for blabbering license stuff xd
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u may want to add it to a gist
18:03 < bridge_> <patiga> yw! and no worries :happy:
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and linl
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> link on wiki
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant type
18:03 < bridge_> <patiga> ah good idea
18:05 < bridge_> <patiga> hm I though there was a collection of script files in the wiki itself, but I guess that was just the old wiki
18:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> would be cool
18:07 < bridge_> <patiga> @zwelf2  also had for example a cool velramp visualizer script in the old wiki
18:07 < bridge_> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/ddnet-wiki/ddnet-wiki.gitlab.io/-/tree/master/scripts
18:09 < bridge_> <patiga> it produces this graph
18:09 < bridge_> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1128357297916215306/Figure_1.png
18:09 < bridge_> <patiga> hm that graph would fit nicely in the movement page
18:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> svg svg!
18:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think `matplotlib.pyplot` can do it 🙂
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> would be cool if the graph would be displayed, and while u moving it has a "cursor" where on the graph your current velocity is
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then u can see it in action
18:14 < bridge_> <raf> Is there a method which calls then server start?
18:14 < bridge_> <raf> Is there a method which calls one times then server start?
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> main(
18:15 < bridge_> <raf> location plsw
18:15 < bridge_> <raf> location pls
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> engine/server.cpp
18:16 < bridge_> <raf> thx
18:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> engine/server/main.cpp I think
18:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> these days
18:16 < bridge_> <raf> yes
18:17 < bridge_> <raf> is it
18:17 < bridge_> <raf> it is
20:30 < bridge_> <chairn> sorry, but i don't know anything about firegun
20:44 < bridge_> <chairn> would be nice to discretize it just like the game does in 0.03 step or i think slightly more for speed so the tee moves
