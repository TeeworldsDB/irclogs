01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i absolutely love it when straight people try to tell gay people what they should or shouldn't be offended by (BONUS POINTS if they don't actually give a shit personally)
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but meh, such is expected from people who think free speech is better than fair speech unbigoted speech
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but meh, such is expected from people who think free speech is better than unbigoted speech
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but meh, such is expected from people who think free speech is more important than unbigoted speech
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lolz, IRC cowards won't even see the real message i typed since i had to edit it, so even if they choose to argue they argue about the wrong thing :troll:
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wat
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you didn't see the other conversation likely
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think IRC sees all the messages
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what conversation?
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> was it in this chat?
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> free speech is freedom from being arrested not freedom from consequences of your actions
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya im too lazy just exroll
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya im too lazy just scroll
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I just assumed it must be offensive. But yes you are right I do not know for sure. Also Heinrich saying that it is official urban slang for lame kinda changed my perspective.I always thought gay is as offensive as faggot. And did not really make a difference. I always got the impression that many people use sexuality as a insult but maybe I’m mistaken here.
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@lynn)
05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also are you implying I „don’t give a shit“? That’s rude.Just because I do not want it censored does not mean I do not care.
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No sorry not going to read that do you got a tl;dr? Are you saying it is illegal to have a game server with unmoderated chat if there are more than 10 players?I doubt that that would have actual legal consequences. And I mean there are big unmoderated game servers such as the 2b2t minecraft server. Not sure how German law applys there but never heard of any legal drama there.
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Avolicious)
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea sorry if you don't want it censored why would i assume you care if it was said
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it wasn't directed at you though
05:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also im not going to suffer a heart attack if someone says "gay part" but it would be cool if people said dumb or lame part instead
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> faggot is definitely worse than gay and queer though, these are normal words that the LGBT community uses. sometimes gay ppl say "fag" as a joke but it's normally only directed at close friends
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> How does the ddnet client snap 64 clients at the same time?
05:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if Germans are allowed to censor the fucking name of a dead man then i kindly request we moderate using the same standard for other words
05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also, i really don't care if they say this stuff if i know they care and are comfortable around LGBT people. I can really only say this about the USA community, since there is very rarely someone against LGBT but Europe servers are terrible from my experience
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> funny how Europeans will complain and say they are socially ahead of Americans when they are still so behind on not hating gay people :)
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I do think its just cause america has a smaller community. As a whole this country is pretty bad
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nah i don't even agree with that
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> you live in washington
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> a large amount of people in the south do
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> this country is so fucked
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> most of them don't play video games
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> its not even just the south
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we have more players from cities than anything else
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I live in a "blue" state
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> midwest people are more indifferent
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and you know how many people are so fucked
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not going to argue case by case with you
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> majority of Europe is like that
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not the case here
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> all the racism and homophobia i see here
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I was at a party and some guy comes up to me asking if we should kick these guys out for kissing
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> kick him out
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Im not gonna say europe has no problem with bigotry
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the guy asking xd
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but usa is worse for sure
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> was couple months ago
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and it was my roommate
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would rather have a country with a lot of people supportive instead of a big majority that are indifferent to bigotry
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which is much of the attitude ppl here have
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> from many conversations
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> by here i mean ddnet not usa
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> our supreme court is toying with the idea of removing gay marriafe
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not going to continue i just wanted to respond to what was already said
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i dont disagree that usa is way better in ddnet
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but as i said i think thats cause we just have less people so people cant be shit heads
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @murpi USA test server passwords broken again
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > test4321 doesnt work as rcon password on usa test
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > also the mod password only gives helper status
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> same issue
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also is it easy to add tele prediction (red, blue, hook, weap) for at least teles with only 1 destination
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if so could someone do it 🥺
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you guys keep drama out of #developer please?
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think this was a github issue since 2017
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea #237
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/237
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oldest issue i think
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oldest open issue i think
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oldest issue still open i think
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think we should go through all the old issues and resolve them since we have better code to do so
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "we" have most likely not the time to do so 🙂
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> By the way, how are color valies generated? Example: `cl_laser_inner_color: 11206591`
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> By the way, how are color values generated? Example: `cl_laser_inner_color: 11206591`
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hmm
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> HSLA to RBGA conversion
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you take the number, you put it in a 32 bit integer, and each 8 bit represents one of the channel
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> base number is in HSL i think and then it's converted into RGB
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That's weird. Any reason why it's specifically that?
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no idea
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you mean the big number or HSL?
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> big number is easier to handle in a single variable
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's quite standard
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ah. I guess that makes sense. I'm just trying to create an outside program to easily deal with these values, since I can't find anywhere that not only recognizes that, but also the 0 to 1 strings used for ColorRGBA
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > the 0 to 1 strings used for ColorRGBA
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> :what:
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> `ColorRGBA(0.074402f, 0.074402f, 0.247166f, 1.0f)`
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's just the same representation but as floating point between 0 and 1
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 1 corresponding to 255 in integer representation
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 0.5 being 128
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Exactly, Though I can't find a program that does this automatically
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just divide by 256
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> chairn
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just divide by 255
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or multiply by 255 for the other way around
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im not manually dividing a bunch of numbers by 255
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> which is why im making a program for this
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't know what you're doing, but how many numbers do you have and in what format?
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The plan is that I'm streamlining a way to quickly edit the laser colors in my multilaser-colors PR, since I'm updating the colors a bit, especially an inconsistency with the colors I found
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just use ColorRGBA * 255 and cast to ivec4?
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or vector4_base<unsigned char>
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Does the test rcon work now?
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes, looks like it
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> more like, cast ColorRGBA to vec4, multiply by 255, and cast to vector4_base<unsigned char>
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @louis What about now?
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Does the rcon still work?
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Hmmmm
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Technically simulation doesnt continue before snapping is complete. Snaps happen tee by tee, not all at once
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> will it happened in 64+ players?
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> (not crash client
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just use hex rgb colors too if that's any easier. Idk if you need the conversion in code or practically
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, but I want to keep it consistent within the code, since the piece of code I'm editing uses this type of coloring
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then use https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1006437327423422496 i guess
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't snap more than 64. 128p servers cheat by dynamically adding and removing tees that are close/far
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> otherwise, you can also use the Pack function with colors
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and get individual channels by masking & shifting
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely use Pack, don't bother with casts and stuff
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> okay, i tidied up my code just a tiny bit for the multi-colored PR. I'll wait until something else needs to be addressed with it until I release the commit, so that there's more to it
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm why waiting? I don't think there will be more comments soon on your PR
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks is there maybe a forum for AMD developers? I did get an adequate-ish response on an nvidia one, maybe we can get the attention of someone on the driver team
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://community.amd.com/t5/opengl-vulkan/bd-p/opengl-and-vulkan-discussions
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems there is staff going around too. I think it might be worth making a report there if you are confident it's a driver issue @Not Keks

10:38 <+ChillerDragon> deen: say nothing if you like emacs
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhhrhrhrhr emacs fan confirmed
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 send some +v to this poor deen
10:38 <@heinrich5991> the channel is -m
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> ye ik
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> wait wot is -m idk irc looks to me like he cant talk
10:39 <@heinrich5991> only if the channel is +m (moderated), +v (voice) has any effect
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> a
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> irc pro
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> so deen is an actual emacs enjoyer then o.I
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> maybe he always was but our toxic environment makes it hard for emacs users to out them selfs
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> vim supremacists
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> @lynn this was a trol btw and now i really dont care. I actually do not mind emacs users being bullied in school. Cancle me
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006483081529655376/unknown.png
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> oh its cancel not cancle
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> do you cancel your cancle?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wth happend there?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is there an attack going on this server?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> really weird graphic glitches like someone posted devil html code
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> which server?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't see anything of that sorts
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet client has html viewer? xd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> discord 😄
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> As you all know github is my social media and i promote its usage as a social network and all ...
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> but omg the fakin "PLEASE LIKE SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE" should stay out of it.
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> it always makes me dislike :D 
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1660034866.png
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> joke's on you, there's no dislike button
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> ye not on github -.-
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> but if ppl in yt video says "pls like" and mean it. I usually dislike and close the video out of disgust xd
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> mfw you're too incompitent to make anything good so you beg us to like or subscribe
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> i don't think its that actually
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> it probably actually helps reminding people that like to content that there is a like button
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk its always the shittier yters who do that
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is what discord looked like for a split frame <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454>
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> if it wouldnt work it woulndt be that wide spread
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> electron apps be like
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> just use a proper gtk client
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait its against ToS of discord
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhrhr
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the forum reply equivilent of a video i saw where it seemed like a person who animates for dumb stock animations and commercials finally snaps
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> we need that in ddnet readme to go viral on github
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> this repo is trending #1 https://github.com/trending
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> gotta sell our soul for clicks
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> im sure deen approves he is big on github marketing :D 
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> @fokkonaut there isn't anything about portalgun
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> github.com/ddnet/ddnet
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> ..
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> portal gun is only in F-DDrace which is not public
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> so you have to code it your self
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> actauly
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i got an F-DDrace server
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> is not online now
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i even ask a guy that know very well c++ and say that he dont know how to
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> or nvm
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> or even taser
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> even taser
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> how the fuck can i program that thing
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you could even ask Bjarne Stroustrup, won't really help you
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> start small, start by modifying a chat command
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and compile that
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i arl do chat command
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> is not only for me
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you manage to compile it?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> taser
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> what to compile
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> what do you mean
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you create a DDNet-Server.exe with your changes
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> ?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said you did a chat command
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> wait 2 seconds
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you do that?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i send u the files of the taser
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> that dont work
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> to fix it
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> 😄
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I won't fix your code if you can't answer basic questions
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> what
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> repeat
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you say you already did a chat command
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please show how you did the chat command
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> bruh u know first video of chiller?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i do that
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i just look some thinghs about c++
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you take a screenshot of your changes?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> why should i
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> but ok

11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> you can buy that from a ''shop''
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you registered the command?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yes
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens when you type the command on the server?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it say 'no such command'?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no, so you get it but you dont get freeze
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> and dont work even has laser

12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you explain?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F-DDrace is private, as ChillerDragon mentioned
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> Enable variable taser
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> sorry if my english is not well
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> im italian
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are they using a non-open-source version of F-DDRace?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I think F-DDRace was open source at some point; are they using a newer version than that, which wouldn't be covered by the open source license?)
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> aa
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no sorry it is a S-DDrace
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006506285249855488/Cattura.PNG
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He uses DDNet++
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 If I ever go open source again, can I do something with licenses there, to prevent people from "stealing" and publishing it with their names? That happened before, and I wouldnt want that to happen again, but I think its unavoidable
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean in the server, that credits are removed there?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like in chat commands?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Stuff like that, and renaming without mentioning etc
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> so is fixable that

12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try checking whether your code is actually executed
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> ?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add some `dbg_msg("dbg", "test");` to the code
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> but where
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have code that should be executed, but doesn't look like it's executed, place it there
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you'll find out whether it's being executed
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you say people don't get frozen
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe place a few around here
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What would I do in case of violation?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (standard gpl also seems to have these terms, agpl is just the strictest that I know of)
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the same that you do when your code is stolen, realistically nothing
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 do you know git? If you could share a repsoritory with the code you are working on that would be very insightful
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if someone publishes it somewhere, you could send a dmca notice
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> okay i will see
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> amh how to do
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i add some
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006509527581073528/taser5.png
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://github.com/ChilliWood/S-DDrace
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow you are chilliwood? :D
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i ask him if he can do it
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> a
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> oke thats ddnet++
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i dont know to use git
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> there is already a working taser in ddnet++ no need to code much
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He is Bot qd
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ad*
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> rly?
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> dox dox dox
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> what do you mean
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> why u say he war me xaxa
12:38 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut enforcing licenses is hard
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> so chiller what do you mean
12:38 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut especially if you do care about running the software not only about republishing the code
12:38 <+ChillerDragon> so you first have to proof that the server runs your code
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> @Netsu_07 just use the taser that is there already
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> you do not need any code changes
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> where is xd
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> in the shop
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> or where in the code?
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> do you want to copy the code out into your mod or just access it in game?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i dont understand sorry
12:40 <+ChillerDragon> you need a level 30 account then you can buy it in the shop after you bought police
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yes
12:40 <+ChillerDragon> yes
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> where i find the code
12:40 <+ChillerDragon> why do you care?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> cuz i need
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> xd
12:40 <+ChillerDragon> is across multiple files
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> how to enable it or just let it go
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> for example here https://github.com/ChilliWood/S-DDrace/blob/c91bc9203032d38af1d98393fd60781e2d586f10/src/game/server/entities/laser_ddpp.cpp#L47
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> you buy it in the shop
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> does the account system work for you? You need to register and login first
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> and the shop?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yes it goe
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> goes
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> nice
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> then /buy police
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> this is getting really offtopic -.-
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> i create a different accownt sistem
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> okay
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> a no wait
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> no no sorry, the shop and accout system
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> isn't different
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> is from the client
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006514145748856942/Cattura.PNG
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> the taser shoot, but dont freeze
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> Chiller can u send me the code of the shop?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> or is in multiple files
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> Chiller can u join
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006516761195196446/Cattura.PNG

13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> @ChillWood поговорите с чиллердрагоном и спросите его
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> Chiller
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> Hello
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> Help me pls
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> im at work chill 
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> ChillerDragon
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> Post it on git taser

13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> @fokkonaut I didn't post under my own name
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> You do not want to take me to your DDNetPP development
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> If you don't want to. Then I will improve
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Very original server name :D
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> yea bro
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> best name
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> Listen
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> just decided to take @fokkonaut
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> And once the code is open. Why can't you take it and change it
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen I have updated twmap-tools to include more checks, including checking for time cps and map settings, could you update them for the discord bot when you have the time? (also relevant for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5642 @heinrich5991)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, care though, I renamed the binary names to switch from underscores _ to minus -
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm, just realized I should do a ddnet-discordbot pull request for that
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> That is literally the ddnet++ readme with the credits replaced :D 
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> > https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006524961915162664/unknown.png
14:13 <+ChillerDragon> kinda sounds like "We" means ChilliWoood 
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> > Post it on git taser
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> no idea what that means
14:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga poggers 
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :D
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> also - is better than _ thats cool even tho the master of all standards decided to pick teeworlds_srv
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillWood> ChillerDragon help me pls
14:44 <+ChillerDragon> on what
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Honestly I don't know how our ddnet-discordbot works. I'll try to find the binaries 😄
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> found the last time we updated https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/903710214757417000

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, works
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome, thanks :)
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> trust
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I've done everything required. @Tester If something fails for the next map test upload, tell me
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Netsu_07> rust no cool
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> lmao trust includes rust :D
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> there is tcc the tiny c compiler so when build trust the tiny rust compiler o.O
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> @Tester :trol:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Didn't know github.dev is so advanced already, really nice
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But coding on phone still sucks, it didn't rekognize my backspace, so i had to select the to replace text and overwrite it xd
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga when do you invent a tool that analyses a map and converts it into something searchable xd
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> E.g.
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> A map with many clouds
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> A map with many draggers
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> A map that has laser doors near the mid xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what kind of file format do you have in mind? o.o
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> map as a database?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> map as a png? ^^
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think python bindings are close enough :p
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, a sqlite database is not the worst file format
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huh
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you think it could map well into it?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> first I would probably do tiled though https://www.mapeditor.org/ / https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Very general, I'm not that familiar with TW map format
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Definitely less familiar than you
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Guess a database with predefined map properties could make sense. Smth with good query speed. I need to use it for all maps from heinrichs pool
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on the hand, I'm not familiar with databases ^^
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have a table for that: mapinfo
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But ddnet only i assume?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes

18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/stats/ddnet.sqlite.zip
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but like, how efficiently can a database save something such as tilemaps? I would imagine that such data wouldn't really fit well, would it? like we would have to do x coordinate, y coordinate, id, tileflags, some map+layer key
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Yeah i also need design properties. Maybe defined by the texture the tile or quad uses
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> U can just save stuff binary or json. But this also isn't the goal
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but if you want to search for doors in the middle of the map, it would need to be able to be queried
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh, json is already possible cause of mapdir :D
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> although tilemaps as json the way I did it there produces very large files
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> OK let's face it. I need an AI that translates my English to a map and shows how much percentage it fits to a map xdd
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I know the map had rather thin tile walls and only vanilla assets and a dragger in the mid.. Stuff like that
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> while you are on it, could you find that small cave map which was played on with the bomb mode?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Xdd
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Has a cave on it and is small xdd
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Would be nice
18:54 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar patigas lib can turn  maps into json. Json is easy to search. Dump it into mongodb and you have your database as well
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> oh forgot to scroll was already mentioned :D
18:56 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar what are you even looking for?
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> Should be easy to write a simple python script that goes over the gametiles and check if its a door and if so checks if its in the middle
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> please add option to have the old ninja freeze back
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i know i said it many times but the game has become abit less fun for me to play because of that one thing
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it sounds ridicilous but i cant help it
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> alot of people also prefer old ninja freeze
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> im not talking about freeze bar btw
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> that change is good
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> just the particles and ninja sword
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> @c0d3d3v i've heard you're reasoning on why you don't want to focus on adding it back right now but idk man, I did give the new design time for me to adjust to it but even after all this time it still is just weird for me
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and not as fun as ninja freeze
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> cl_old_freeze would be all i need
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I tried to get an old freeze mode in BEFORE the whole thing got merged, because I knew exactly how some people would feel.
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For me the stars for example are even a gameplay thing, also the stars on the ninja weapon. It lets you time pretty nicely when freeze or ninja is over aswell as they are static in the world and dont move with the tee, which feels natural/fitting and teeish.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> About the ninja stars being removed: I really think that this should not have happened, because now you always have to move your eyes to the HUD to see how much ninja time is left.
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> just use your eyes
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> duh
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> they're working on moving the ninja timer to the tee i think
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> so that problem should be solved
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Still, in my opinion it's not teeish, cuz in teeworlds nothing is static. Weapons rotate, laser doors' end points jiggle, ...
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It feels not pleasing, and it's very weak of you to say "just use your eyes duh", when you yourself just said this
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Learn that others have their opinion too, because why should someone listen to your preferences then?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i found it funny to say that in the moment
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but as always everything is a preference thing
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats true
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But also I agree with the particle thing
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and the sword
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I myself disliked the ninja skin itself and always disabled cl_show_ninja, but the particles and sword made it look complete, plus the stars.
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am playing with the freeze bar now for a while, and with missing ninja weapon, and other than the devs said, I still didnt "adapt" to it in sense of really liking it. Of course, the game is playable, but it's not what I really prefer. And that has nothing to do with not testing it enough
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Is there any "Drop-Down List" control in ddnet client?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> they're trying to make the game more appealing for new players
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> which i get
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but don't just completely lock the old players away from their prefered playstyle
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i mean when i started playing ddnet i was confused why i was a ninja when i got frozen
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but it got close to me as i played more
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> ?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> yes there is a drop down for graphics backends in the settings
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> yes there is a drop down for graphics apis in the settings
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> oh ok
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I'm thinking about adding possibility to change entities in other game modes than ddrace
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Tater\: TATER CLIENT
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> !
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Isn’t that a thing?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> By you?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Lukamane for what parts do you want "old" options?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ye
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> did you have a question about it?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> old freeze particles and ninja sword in freeze
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> like in the same package
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and old ninja timer with stars too?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> no
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> new timer is good
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i mean i dont need the stars
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> maybe others want it tho
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> would you also like the ninja timer if it would look like this https://fittingcentermondaysunday.com/e/0qjidmyus5cj
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> not exactly like this *** the desing is not finished, but the position
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> not exactly like this *** the design is not finished, but the position
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> yeah it would be alot better if the ninja timer is on your tee like the freeze timer
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> just make it look abit different
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> so you can differentiate
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ok, then I will open an issue for an option for the old stars instead of the freeze bar, ok?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Including ninja animation
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> for ninja animation there could also be just a new animation, but I'm not sure if that makes even sense... because your click action does not really change anything... it was just an animation
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i think i didn't clear it enough what i meant by old freeze particles
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i didnt mean the stars
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i meant the actual particlas surrounding the tee when its freezed
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah you want only the ninja sword? not the stars
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> now we have snowflake particles for freeze
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the current freeze partices (snow) will change  a little bit in the next days (the positioning and behaviour) so maybe wait a little, if that looks nicer for you
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No I just saw your name and had to say it!!! You are pretty much my biggest competition. tater and chillerbot are pretty much the only somewhat developed open source ddnet forks
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Tater)
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but i want the old particles back, with the ninja sword also
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> like make those 2 in one command
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> for example "cl_old_freeze_mode"
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Ah sorry, missed that completely. Yes, you do have legal consequences if you're located in germany or austria for example. The law based on the server location applies automatically, doesnt matter if you're from panama and host in europe. 
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I already had been in touch with WKO ( Wirtschaftskammer Österreich ) about the whole topic & asked their lawyers or persons with a background in law regarding server hosting & service.
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Even if you host servers for free, you're a service provider ( Dienstleister by law in DE, AT ). If there is nobody taking action against you wont have legal drama, but you could 🙂
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> and for the ones that want the freeze stars you could maybe make "cl_old_freeze_timer"
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but i think more people just want the old ninja freeze back than the timer stars
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Ah sorry, missed that completely. Yes, you do have legal consequences if you're located in germany or austria for example. The law based on the server location applies automatically, doesnt matter if you're from panama and host in europe.

20:16 <+ChillerDragon> @Tater your ddnet fork is by one star the second most starred one. If you get your mom to star you are the num1 most starred ddnet fork o.O https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1660068910.png
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> :o
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> eeee/ddnet is trol iDDNet is server infclass is niche so its basically just us two
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/network/members btw i use this nice firefox addon to get a rich preview in the forks tab https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github_forks/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> totally no shameless selfplug
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i suggested already that the snowflakes should be spread exactly like the old ninja particles
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> maybe thats what they're doing
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but i definitely want the ninja sword back in freeze
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> so to all the people who dislike the new ninja stuff. Maybe you have a higher chance of @Tater adding more ninja options to his client. Since tater client is big on configs while ddnet is not at all.
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> especially with the animation when you hit before you get freezed xd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ChillerDragon: Your extension is really cool!
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pls only render ninja bar if ninja activation tick != 0 or smth, cuz i do have some things where ninja is permanent as a weapon that is being held
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ChillerDragon: The code quality in my fork is probably not as good as yours. for me it was mostly just a learning project but now there are lots of people using it so I guess I am maintaining it xd.
