18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you need a vector

18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do u guys think is ezy working on? A tool that cures cancer with teeworlds aim positions? Or an aimbot?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :thonkery:
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> stupid question
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon  but all people from ddnet helped you too for coding bots
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> seriously
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they did
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but serverside bots are legal and nobody helped me with zz which was only for scientific purposes anyways
19:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1198: Update modhelp.py (master...pr_ddnet_update_modhelp) https://git.io/fNTYw
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 mind taking a look at that? ^
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be pretty straightforward and I need it to deploy it to the other ddnet servers
19:05 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: should these really be env vars?
19:05 <+Learath2> maybe command line args?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> env vars was easier üôÇ
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with flask
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because you run flask apps with `flask run`

19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmmm, actually have no idea where that one comes from
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did someone enable webhooks somewhere again?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh @heinrich5991 I can't filter that :/
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not? üòÆ
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's coming through github, not running through the filter
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I can extend the filter to support it, I just can't do it right now as I need to replicate the message

22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> @ChillerDragon im not coding a bot
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> im coding a bot, who is acting like @ChillerDragon
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> and also my code doesnt even work on ddnet
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @ezy you better do
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> since collision->gettile gets me same output on a freeze tile and an air tile and heinrich told me theres no other way checking which tile is at a specific x and y coordinate without having to code like fukin a lot
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> xd
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> if u suck my dick @lola then i will make a balance bot for u
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I'm 13 (almost 14), you are pedo!
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> ya and ur fake
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> he is 16
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> where hes a pedo?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> nope
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> sure he is
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> there
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> whats wrong with u
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> xd
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> lola aka kevin
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> who is kevin? üòê
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> lola
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Canis Lupus> lola u r a troll
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> stop calling me troll! you are troll!
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> but guys can u explain me why ryozuki got a ban for asking for credits?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> obviously if he helped and gave the code to chiller then chiller could verify that it wasnt a troll right?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> and also i personaly think a ban for a potential troll as a trustworthy ddnet supporter is too much
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> u might think hes not trustworthy anymore now but if u didnt think so before then thats also not a very good relationship between ddnet staff
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> people are so short sighted
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Why you all undermine decisions without a broader knowledge of the subject, ugh
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He just had to ask for credit like that right?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since we never give credit to anyone right?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> make a public scene out of it for the heck of it
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> It wasn't directed to you learath
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> rather to ezy
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he could have just given me or anyone else a message and he'd have gotten his credit
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm responding to @ezy aswell
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but maybe you are responding to him, then k
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I really hate childish behaviour
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone involved in the development in ddnet knows how credit his given, but he had to make it a mess
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is*
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> But you know why? because he's super Millennial
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> like, everything have to be like he want
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When did we ever not give credit that it was justified to call us out on it?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> ugh
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> im questioning the situation with knowing what ryozuki told me
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> stop questioninig
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> im curios
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He can question it just fine
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you are not responsible for him
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> i support him tho
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm telling you, he wanted to create a drama out of it and I wanted none of it
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Oh my god.
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> After all, he talked too much
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and behave like a child sometimes ( actually often recently)
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not the best reason to ban
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it was up to you there'd be no bans, we hear you
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We also don't think that's how you run a community. Not one this size anyways
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't even understand, why he was lasts so long here.
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> üòõ
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because we are expected to tolerate everything
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Incitement community is good?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Especially in such a small community? If he would be a bit more serious with his behaviour then it would be tolerable
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> does my acc need to be confirmed to commit anything
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You can only pull request to ddnet
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> then if admins accepts it, it would be merge to official repository
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> before that, you can fork repository
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and work on it, on your own
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like seriously, have you ever seen me call that guy out on anything, even his ridiculous behaviour for the last couple days
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> It wasn't about you
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it was about him
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Most complains about system came from childrens
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> thanks @Savander
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> maybe few of them who can argue in a proper way instead of forcing "their truth"
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that they are children, it's that they didn't want to discuss anything in the first place
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> On point
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I don't get it either, ryo is a nice guy. But takes things way too far.
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as long as you call it a discussion then when we don't want to hear it we are suppressing free speech
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask anyone, I actually liked the guy
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't say i don't. But he looked like he take something recently
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't say i don't. But he looked like he took something recently
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still fine with him tbh, but I doubt he likes me anymore üòõ
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Like, everything what we said was "no, you are wrong im right"
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Its the catalan against the spain
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> without trying to solve problem witha agreement
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I mean, people like to talk. (like me now LOL). But don't want to think
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Being used to kick dust around, without coming with solutions
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Realistically how to come to a consensus
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Everyone can spread what they want. But without good arguments you can't do anything
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and that's why they are angry
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Angry or just trolling
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> not everything is troll
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i don't like to say that word too often
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I know
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing I can do anymore, I tried to help him. I understand that he is mad, but that doesn't justify everything
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I know right. He didn't convince me as well
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But both choose the same side so now and then.
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> (now it was about latest biggest drama about rules)
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I dont even get who is interested in all the information admins should share according to them.
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't know but few years ago, people could talk much morepolitely
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't know but few years ago, people could talk much more politely
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just one thing we don't share üôÅ
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I remember that we have "revolution" about rules as well
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but then we talked why it was bad, and how to fix it
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah world is so weird nowadays, everyone seems more... agressive
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> instead of "LOL REMOVE IT"
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> "YOU ARE HIIDING EVERYTHING, WE WANT FULL TRANSPARENT"
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 3 people said
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Btw, tbh. üòÑ I prefer to have calm mods and admins
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> It the fault of social media that the world turns this way.
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> instead of fearful beacuse of full transparen
23:24 <+Learath2> I'd also prefer if everyone would be chill
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Yea, it could be
23:24 <+Learath2> we have a small community of people who enjoy a niche game
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe not everyone, it's not possible. But mods and admins are big part of this community
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> without them, it would collapse
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they shouldn't feel breath on their own necks
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> For me, the rule is perfectly fine.
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Canis Lupus> if someone doesn't like the community then they should just leave, instead of to complain
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> exactly!
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Especially when THEY SEE THE RULES
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> before joining
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you don't like them? Then bye bye, no one is holding you here
23:27 <+Learath2> I mean, you can also try to change them
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well bye bye
23:27 <+Learath2> but there is a respectful way to do it
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Got to go to sleep
23:27 <+Learath2> underhandedly calling us all asshats isn't the way to go about it
23:28 <+Learath2> night @n000b
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Only 6,5 hours leftüò¨
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> U2
23:28 <+Learath2> @n000b school tomorrow?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No full time jobüòÅ
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Yes, you are right
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but latest events was a topic to my talk üòÑ
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> It was just too much
23:31 <+Learath2> @Savander talk? you gave a talk about this?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> OVerall situations from recent
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> time
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> anyway, it was more like monologue
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I think you got my point, nothing else to add :p
