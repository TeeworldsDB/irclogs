11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> almost there:
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/65
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i can finally use wayland, epic
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hope they get it done before the year ends
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/202210010816.1317F2C@keescook/
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Subject: [GIT PULL] Rust introduction for v6.1-rc1
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really want to see some first driver written in it. maybe a rewrite of an existing actually. good for comparision 😄
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks they already did
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the nvme driver
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it perfoms the same as the c one
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32820219
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe something more cpu bound is more interesting
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well similar, seems there are some cases where it performed measurably worse
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if only llvm wasnt buggy with the noalias feature
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust would be faster in some places
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (not saying this specific to this case)
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah could be llvm issue, or maybe a gcc frontend for rust might generate better code
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but anyway its also not interesting only from performance point of view:
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - build times
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - quality of code (how many bugs will it contain)
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - debugging tools etc
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz llvm rly was only focused for C/c++ issues
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust made llvm better
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by pushing bugs and fixes
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the noalias thing is a known issue
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57259126/why-does-the-rust-compiler-not-optimize-code-assuming-that-two-mutable-reference
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Quality of code is hands down better, build times probably are of the same order of magnitude should be similar, tools idk. Debugging rust with gdb hasn't always been the smoothest of experiences for me, though it might just be a pebcak.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the answer explains a lot
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok, i often read on reddit or other forums, ppl will join development of the kernel as soon as it supports rust, bcs they feel more confident
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But i cannot really imagine why this should be the truth... you don't magically have more insight about how hardware works etc.
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Sure not having security issues creates kind of confidence, but if the kernel crashes.... it still sucks xD
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you dont have to know the intriquacies of C and its possibles UB to contribute to the kernel
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes y ou need to know about hardware
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and currently most good rust devs know a lot of c too
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are being silly. Interacting with real hardware is still not safe. They won't contribute shit
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In my experience C is not the problem, working with Linux core stuff like memory management is just complex and interconnected. Not sure about drivers
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think most ppl contribute to drivers
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they make up the most
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially the part where rust is being introduced. They'd have to be the ones building safe abstractions over the hardware. You'd still be working in the very scary part where rusts safety guarantees havent come in yet
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway rust is only for drivers yet
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (I implemented Kernel Samepage Merging for anonymous pages once to get less memory consumption when running many similar VMs, but that's the extent of my Linux kernel development experienc)
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64859526/does-linux-kernel-list-implementation-cause-ub
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The kernel actually does invoke implementation defined behaviour a lot actually. That's why it only compiled on gcc for the longest time and still as of now
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes sense
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> UB per the standard doesn't always have to be UB per implementation. E.g. signed integer overflow, virtually every implementation overflows in a sane manner
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was it for work?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> university project, probably back in 2011
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, it was actually the opposite. Anonymous pages worked with KSM already and I tried enabling it for memory mapped files
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like a fun project
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it worked in the end, but I only tested with pretty small examples
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> 2022-10-02 16:15:02 I discord: error initializing discord instance, error=4
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> can someone explain this error
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably that it didnt find any discord running
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on your computer
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> why you need to install discord to play ddnet 64bit? i mean 32bit start normally without problems
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> but skins loading insane long xD
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u dont, u can ignore that error
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is your client not starting or what?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> this is the only output i got from the console if i try to run 64bit version
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> friend of my
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs bcs nobody cares about 32bit anymore, and discord doesnt provide an API for that
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what operating system?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> teeworlds 64bit over steam and download is working fine... ddnet 32bit working fine but ddnet 64bit not
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> GPU?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if he has an AMD card:
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.org/news/amd-beta-opengl-crash/
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he should try vulkan or downgrade to a stable driver
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if he has an old computer, see pinned messages in #bugs
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> yea he got an amd
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Right click DDNet in Steam, add "gfx_backend Vulkan"
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> can he change to vulcan in ddnet-settings.cfg
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with "
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add gfx_backend Vulkan in the end
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but pls with a K not C 😄
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> all cool ❤️ i will try it now
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> all cool ❤️ i will try it now with him
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> thanks, it works
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> might go to japan the last week of the year and celebrate new year there
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ill try some original ramen there :BASED:
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japan is very very pretty and has amazing food. Good choice for a trip
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spent 2 weeks and didn't even get close to seeing everything I wanted to see 😄
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
17:36  * Chireal slaps FlowerFell-Sans around a bit with a large fishbot
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I just made a script to automate the procedure of having mutliple cursors/keyboards at the same time under X. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Multi-pointer_X
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Tell me if you want to take a look at the script :)
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I would upload a vid of me playing with my brother from the same pc but ddnet doesn't capture the second mouse xD
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did you mod the client for that?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean i know that SDL sends a deviceID
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it doesnt work out of box does it ? XD
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> no it didn't work
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Atleast with the second mouse
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, when splitscreen support ^^
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Else the keyboard were fine
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah ok, nice ^^
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Else the keyboards were fine
