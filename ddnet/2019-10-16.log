00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what did i notice @Learath2 xd
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also does anyone remember what the point of having a front layer was?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª mishighlight, oops
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok xd
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meant to highlight @Jubjub
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why didn't we allow multiple game layers?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> convenience
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao codewise?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> complicated or no?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, I was recoding it and wanted to check whether there was a specific reason to have a front layer
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like tiles that can only be placed on the front layer for some reason maybe
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i guess hook and unhook has to be in game
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> for vanilla compatibility?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes there is that
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao is there a demand for more then one front layer?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sometimes yes
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but donâ€™t add unlimited game layers
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> way too confusing
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could make front layers unlimited
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imagine how that would look ingame
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 10 tiles stacked above each other
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There being 1 game layer is mandatory tho, because of vanilla as you said
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well front layers aren't really rendered except for overlay_entities
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye thatâ€™s what i mean
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess many people play like that
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, it's just an idea, wanted to know if it'd be a useful feature
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well in the end its up to the mapper
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you also happen to know why TILE_BEGIN and TILE_END are slightly fatter then other tiles? ðŸ˜›
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is that start and finish
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> to make them unskipable then
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are already made unskippable by the other check we have though ðŸ˜•
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it was the old fix that then got removed
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That then was forgotten*
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the freeze blocks and such are just fat enough so you can't fit in between them without getting frozen right
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that's how it is
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> were servers updated to 12.7.1?
04:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 12.7.1 is only a small linux client fix
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 &&|| @deen the git revision thing seems broken, /info shows a very old commit
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen can you roughly tell me what version of debian you're building the releases on?
12:45 <+Ryozuki> if deepfly is the natural way new maps will be done then so be it
12:45 <+Ryozuki> what about when speedfly wasn't a thing
12:45 <+Ryozuki> and then it was discovered
12:45 <+Ryozuki> new maps and old maps*
12:46 <+Ryozuki> it would be cool if nimda also sent github messages
12:46 <+Ryozuki> ima update aur
12:50 <+Ryozuki> we still have this warning
12:50 <+Ryozuki> warning: array subscript [2, 2147483647] is outside array bounds of â€˜const char [2]â€™ [-Warray-bounds]
12:50 <+Ryozuki>    84 |   for(int c = 0; c < 4 && pStr[Index]; c++, Index++)
12:50 <+Ryozuki> it may trigger someones OCD
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, false positive I thnk
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is cl_background entities supposed to do?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> show entities
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nvm
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_overlay_entities` is what I'm talking about
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean `cl_background_entities`
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> itâ€™s the map file thats displayed as background in entities
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> iirc
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> such a weird idea for a feature
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 while you are here, do you have any idea how I can go about cleaning up HandleTiles?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 Debian 8.9
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you want to clean up?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The huge if statements
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `if(GameServer()->Collision()->IsSwitch(MapIndex) == TILE_SWITCHOPEN && Team() != TEAM_SUPER && GameServer()->Collision()->GetSwitchNumber(MapIndex) > 0)`
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1474
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or this e.g.
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki let me fix that
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you know how to? ðŸ˜›
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, we have the same false positive at work a few times ðŸ˜„
14:35 <+Ryozuki> :o
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I could also make that into a two-liner with macros, but maybe let's postpone until we need more temporary warning disablements
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that makes the code a lot longer
14:48 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991 is nimda yours?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you happen to know how m_FreezeTime works?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's written in such a confusing way
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or Ryozuki? ðŸ˜›
15:01 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 freezetime was written by the prediction code guy
15:02 <+Ryozuki> i dont remember whats his name
15:02 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 ping pong
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, how can you ping from irc? ðŸ˜„
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just do @
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Did 12.7.2 make blockers jump spam not "fluid" anymore?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> This shit
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> 
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/634019127257858048/unknown.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> It recently got changed so you d "glide" up with the same velocity the whole time right?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> By instantly resetting your dj
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> And buffering it?
16:08 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991 did u recently change stoppers?
16:08 <+Ryozuki> that might be it
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I did
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it should be fixed now, the problem mentioned above
16:09 <+Ryozuki> ah i see
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Also pls fix deepfly being broken on dummy again
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Before all dummy maps get broken xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Oh nvm too late
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <'faceless> Does anyone already reported about that with the new ddnet update deep freezed tee cant rocket when got hammered? Stargazing map is now impossible to finish as 2ppl (info from @PEWPEW, he checked it on the map)
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <'faceless> Have anyone already reported about that with the new ddnet update deep freezed tee cant rocket when got hammered? Stargazing map is now impossible to finish as 2ppl (info from @PEWPEW, he checked it on the map)
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <'faceless> Have anyone already reported about that with the new ddnet update deep freezed tee cant rocket when got hammered? Stargazing map, for example, is now impossible to finish as 2ppl (info from @PEWPEW, he checked it on the map)
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fixed on master
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> fixed on master (12.7.2)
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <'faceless> Ye, i just have checked it, it works, thanks
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the new hammer thing handled server wise
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just makes everything so much easier...
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> i found a new bug
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> when you are deep and have laser
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> u can spam 24/7 with it lol
22:20 <+Ryozuki> that was expected
22:20 <+Ryozuki> u could even have a row of tees inside freeze, u hammer the first while others hold hammer facing the other dir
22:20 <+Ryozuki> then they all hammer
22:20 <+Ryozuki> i think its possible and makes sense
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> i mean you can laser without beeing unfreezed
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape does it work with other weapons?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> idk
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it doesnt work for me
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> even with lazer
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> it was kinda buggy
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> only half lenght
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> was it on hearts
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds like prediction bug
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ie it only looked like you shot
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> idk if it only looked like or it actually worked but i saw it lol
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lime/Marcel/<BÂµmM>/Snape> no it wasnt on hearts
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why do hearts even freeze
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it makes no sense
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hearts should like
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> give u a freeze shield or smth
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> jdk
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk
22:55 <+Ryozuki> oh wait change was only for hammer
22:55 <+Ryozuki> so i confused things
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 200 iq
22:58 <+Ryozuki> 250*
