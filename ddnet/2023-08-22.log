00:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think so
00:15 < bridge_> <learath2> Thought about it a bit, update: I don't think it's possible to do this without changing the calls and without performance hit
00:17 < bridge_> <learath2> It is kinda weird that something so simple isn't really possible in C++ without some insane metaprogramming magic that I cant even think about
00:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes ddnet
00:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@yekrm)
00:27 < bridge_> <Voxel> nuh uh
00:27 < bridge_> <Voxel> not until you finish your pr
00:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> My pr is already playable
01:01 < bridge_> <deen> @robyt3 any plans for working on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654#issuecomment-1612162585 ?
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> ryo if i go back to primarily running Linux on my desktop, do i wanna use gentoo
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’m not really familiar with the benefits
01:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I like arch
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah i already have used arch for a few years and i like it too
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> but i want to try new thing
01:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in gentoo you spend quite some time compiling stuff AFAIK, but I've never actually tried it, so take my advice with a grain of salt
01:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, then go ahead I guess
01:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I heard nix or qubes is also interesting
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> For a while I was running Windows so I could develop Windows specific apps but I haven’t done it in a while
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah i like nix
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> interesting packaging
01:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> unfamiliar with qubes
04:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> IMPORTANT QUESTION:
04:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> Would these cursors go inside of `weapons` or `hud`?
04:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143368707645636740/weapon_grenade_cursor.png
04:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> I think it'd make more sense if this went into weapons, but at the same time, this is a hud element, or more accurately a gui element.
04:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> bah
04:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143378888471359528/image.png
05:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> I forgot how pointers worked. How do I get the value of the name of the assigned pointer for each sprite element?
05:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> For example: `container.sprites.Add(Sprite("part_slice", set_particles, 0,0,1,1))`
05:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> I'm trying to print `particles`, since that's the name of the set it's being pointed to, but I keep getting an error.
05:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143382983617806336/image.png
05:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> I forgot how pointers worked. How do I get the value of the name of the assigned pointer for each sprite element?
05:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> For example: ```py

05:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> nvm i found out how ^^
05:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just forgot to put `.target` before `.set` ^^
05:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> why python
05:31 < bridge_> <totar> Should I keep waiting on this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6775
05:32 < bridge_> <totar> @heinrich5991
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> why not
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> we are cooking tonight
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143387449523961876/image.png
05:34 < bridge_> <Voxel> @heinrich5991 good progress on the sorting phase! i think tommorow im going to set up the actual slicing tool!
05:35 < bridge_> <Voxel> What I did was reuse content.py (crediting matricks of course), and edit it a bit so that it includes what location it should be sorted into
05:35 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143387972226519111/image.png
05:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> A
05:39 < bridge_> <Voxel> well here's my plan: i'm using Pillow for Python, and I'm going to be setting it up in a way where you can put all the assets into its own custom folder, and you can run the program and have those assets packaged into its own set
05:40 < bridge_> <Voxel> because if i were to do it with an executable, it's just going to package all the default ones and skip the juicy custom assets (because lets be real i dont think most of the asset modders actually replace the main images. if they do id be surprised)
05:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> why is that what an executable would mean
05:44 < bridge_> <Voxel> because how would it know how to sort the custom assets
05:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> personally i would just do like dilate and have the first arg be a source img and have a second optional arg for output destination for CI or w/e
05:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> like, you drag & drop an image called foo.png and it would slice the images and put them in ./assets/foo/*.png or whatever
05:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> or invoke it from the command like & provide foo.png & an output path
05:50 < bridge_> <Voxel> i mean the thing is, will it just package the single image?
05:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> Wdym
05:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> because i was planning to also resort the entire thing because
05:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> look at how unorganized game.png is
05:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> and why exactly isn't extras a part of particles.png
05:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> ./assets/foo/game/*.png, ./assets/foo/extras/*.png
05:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> ./assets/foo/game/*.png, ./assets/foo/extras/\*.png
05:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> yes but that also begs the question: what happens when you go two game.pngs one after the other?
05:53 < bridge_> <Voxel> will the files overwrite?
05:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> ./assets/bar/*/\*.png
05:53 < bridge_> <Voxel> whats bar?
05:53 < bridge_> <Voxel> oh wait
05:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> ok so that means if i have a custom game.png called Awesome.png, and i put that into the slicer, will it be put into `assets/awesome/game/*.png`?
05:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yes
05:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> well
05:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> ./assets/Awesome/game/*.png
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> So you're telling me
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> I have to rename ALL of these to awesome so that it's completely organized and I can send out the zip file for it to embed properly?
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143393029462437889/image.png
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> So you're telling me
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> I have to rename ALL of these to Awesome so that it's completely organized and I can send out the zip file for it to embed properly?
05:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143393029462437889/image.png
05:56 < bridge_> <Voxel> because idk how the zip reading thing will work but i can only imagine its going to be like a game pack
05:56 < bridge_> <Voxel> unless each and every sub category is going to be its own zip
05:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> are you reading the zip at runtime
05:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> are we?
05:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> im literally only writing the slicing script
05:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> i lack context
05:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> now that i think about it how WILL the zip files be treated?
05:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> i will now stop coding until i get further context onto how ddnet will use these zip files
06:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> if i were doing it, i would add an option to the slicer to package the input asset as an uncompressed tarball
06:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> and the game could transparently read this tarball or each file individually in a neighboring folder
06:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> so ./assets/whatever.tar would be equivalent to the ./assets/whatever/*/*.png
06:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> so ./assets/whatever.tar would be equivalent to the ./assets/whatever/*/\*.png
06:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> and that’s how it could be packaged
06:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> perhaps the tarball could be the default behavior and the tool would place the tar either in the pwd or neighboring the source file
06:02 < bridge_> <Voxel> i put my question in #6753
06:02 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6753
06:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143394746534989954/IMG_3556.png
06:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> xd
06:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> anyway yeah if i was to implement it i would add it as a tool
06:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> call it asset_slice perhaps
06:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> seems to match the grammar in place for the map manip tools
06:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would provide a generic way to bind a source image to multiple outputs with defined regions, names, and categories
06:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> so you could have multiple layouts (like for old gameskin layouts? is that a thing?)
06:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Don't use zip files. It makes content creation more annoying
06:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Deploy is the only pro thing about it
06:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But zipping your files every time u change something sucks
07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> Same as having to use a new game.png imo
07:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> Distributing a game skin comprised of multiple files in a non-archive form would really suck
07:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> A game png would directly be an image
07:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No need to zip it
07:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Also zipping PNGs is basically useless
07:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or does Windows automatically disable compression
07:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Default behavior
07:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well i find it ok. The downsides of zips are bigger
07:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No file preview sucks extremely
07:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If we ever have a skin system like 0.7 . One always has to download the whole zip. Read the whole zip, just to load a part of it
07:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe import button for deploy xd
07:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway,i feel like the zip feature is not a clear improvement. Even over what we have now. The pros and cons don't justify it. Maybe we should discuss it more before voxel wates all his time
08:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> What could happen is you can have whole ‘resource packs’ and you can choose their priority within the client
08:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> Like Minecraft
08:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> Some sort of manifest in the top level of the archive describing which assets are provided in the archive
08:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> Cuz ppl already have matching gameskins + entities + whatever else
08:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So you want to zip a whole data directly basically?
08:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Directory
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> Maybe. I was only thinking images at first but no reason not to have sounds like that too, IDK if ppl have custom sounds yet?
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> Also not skins
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> Skins should be separate
08:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Some have custom sounds
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> But unless the need is presented then I don’t think it’s worth it
08:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> Going from vaguely categorized images to this elaborate system would be a big jump
08:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> I just think of ppl like broso who have custom entities, gameskin, maybe a map file for entities bg & an autoexec’d cfg file to set that up
08:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway.. from deployment POV it's cool.. i just wonder if it sucks from creator perspective to have 20 instances of inkscape open for all individual files. Then have to zip everything every time u test ur mod
08:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And ultimately maybe have higher load times xd
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> In my theoretical implementation it would be straight from existing game.png form to archive
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> Archive would be an option on by default
08:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So we support multiple variations
08:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In other words, bloat xd
08:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> Higher load times only if decompression is needed, which uncompressed tarballs don’t present
08:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> ❓
08:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well this sounds like archive and legacy work both
08:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What tar balls xd
08:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> U didn’t read what I said earlier?
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Tar balls require 7z on Windows
08:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> Not if the tool does it for them
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But yes i apparently haven't read it
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> Tar is incredibly simple
08:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It is. But it makes previewing impossible on windows
08:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> For normal userd
08:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> S
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> Idk why you would want to but fair
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> Preview by loading it in the game
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> Way more effective than trying to guess how itll look ingame
08:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> Uncompressed zips would also be a good option but unfortunately they are hard to make for most people
08:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> It requires specific cmd line invocation & I don’t remember the option existing in archivers like file roller on Linux, and I don’t think you can do it at all on Windows without the command line version
08:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> It would be less bug prone if we expect users to use the ddnet tool to create these archives. Potentially decompress them too, if that’s what theyre into
08:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> asset_pack/asset_extract? or auto detect task by file extension or lack thereof of first arg
08:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> asset_pack/asset_extract? or one tool which auto detects task by file extension or lack thereof of first arg
08:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> Unrelated but ATX case recommendations? Ideally space for 3-4 2.5” drives and potentially radiator(s)
08:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> And no lights. If lights, no rgb
08:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> dunno, smth like this maybe:
08:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.amazon.de/NZXT-Flow-Dual-Chamber-ATX-PC-Gaming-Geh%C3%A4use-High-Airflow-perforiertes/dp/B0BJHHPCQL/
08:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe that's overkill for you
08:55 < bridge_> <teero777> Dell precision t7400 case xd
08:55 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143438212170256407/Dell_t7400_s_compeve.jpg
08:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> Possibly overkill, I tried looking at NZXT cases specifically but some cases just don’t have pics of the back of the interior (right side from the front)
08:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> Which is where those drives are in my current case. Thermaltake something
08:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
08:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> I suppose most cases have enough space in the front for a rad + fans if they’re open on the front, right? My current one is not water cooling focused at all but I bet it would fit. I would only do an AIO anyway, no need to shell out all those extra bucks for the water cooling accommodations
08:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/Inter-Tech-CXC2-mit-Sichtfenster-Midi-Tower-ohne-Netzteil-schwarz_1233721.html
08:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have this for my home server
08:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i turned off the fans, they were bit annoying xD
08:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> Looks pretty good. I kinda like how the drives mount. A bit dated looking though
08:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> I wish I could show you the one I have. It’s a fantastic case. Just small
08:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i bought it in 2019 apparently 😂
09:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://a.co/d/hg8by2U
09:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> This looks decent
09:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> Ah this is what I have
09:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://thermaltakeusa.com/products/s100-tempered-glass-micro-chassis-ca-1q9-00s1wn-00
09:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> No photos on the site showing how the drives mount. There are 2 detachable plates on the back which you can screw the drive into . The plate itself has 4 screw holes for the drive, a leveled lowered part so you can insert it into the case and use only 1 fastener (which is a thumbscrew on the other side)
09:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> Also one full size hdd mount thing on the bottom that I could never figure out how to use. It seemed to hold my excess cables just fine. Now that I have a modular power supply it’s got no use
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> Looks like its big brother is the S300. Nowhere to get it from, though
09:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> Might grt the NZXT H5 Flow
09:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’ll have to sleep on it
09:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> What’s the smallest AIO i can comfortably get away with using for my 7900X, do you think?
09:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Any
09:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> Would it perform better if I got an air cooler at the same price range
09:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> Would it perform better if I got an air cooler at the same price range as a small AIO
09:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Probably. If the sink is big
09:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yea hmm
09:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> I can get nhd15 for about as much as the avg 240mm aio. maybe a bit less
09:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It might also be more durable
09:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> True
10:25 < bridge_> <teero777> ey is it easy to plug in shaders into ddnet?
10:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fractal design does good cases
10:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/
13:49 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> everytime i use the ingame updater and the game restarted the resolution is wrong, the edges are a little cut off and the mouse sense feels like with vsync on, aka delayed and not as precise
13:49 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> since a few updates, cant recall which exactly
14:36 < ChillerDragon> why mfing cargo breaks half of the ci runs
14:37 < ChillerDragon> average rust stability
14:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it detects if you work on bot content
14:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also lower load times for uncompressed zips, probably. isn't that great? performance!
14:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm willing to provide a tool that lets creators use the old "everything in one image" way of doing things
14:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the discussion issue is over here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6753
14:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> useless, when u want smth u do it anyway. i will not invest too much time into the legacy stuff anymore and just go full ego with my own stuff then rq xd
14:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> since when was this legacy?
14:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> once this goes in this will give people more freedom to add in content
14:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for me the cpp codebase is legacy 😂
14:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> rusthead
14:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i want to see your workflow for new content
14:48 < bridge_> <teero777> is the speed of a speedup just a unsigned char in the src or is it just limited by the editor?
14:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> first step is replacing most texture atlases with single images
14:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it is in the source indeed
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> answered my own
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143527378480545792/image.png
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> ye
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> ;((
14:49 < bridge_> <teero777> wanted to make mega boost....
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep.. even if i generally like it. I have huge concerns about usuability.. do you open 20 inkscape instances then when modding?
14:50 < bridge_> <teero777> btw why are the mapsizes ints instead of unsigned ints?
14:50 < bridge_> <teero777> the thing with lua would be cool for mapping scripts
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or do you draw in a atlas and convert it
14:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao, why does everyone like lua
14:50 < bridge_> <teero777> no one does
14:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> no, you just open the game.png and then split it afterwards
14:51 < bridge_> <teero777> but its way simpler to implement than other scripting languages. at least thats what ive heard
14:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and for the new stuff?
14:51 < bridge_> <Voxel> you edit those seperately
14:52 < bridge_> <teero777> would that not have a huge performance impact while loading all the images?
14:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so there are your 20 instances? XD
14:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or I'm going to provide a script to re-assemble it into some new form of game.png for you
14:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> someone's making a genetic multithread image loader
14:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just for editing
14:52 < bridge_> <Voxel> someone's making a generic multithread image loader
14:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, because they're in a zip file, it's all one file for the file system
14:52 < bridge_> <teero777> ah okay
14:53 < bridge_> <teero777> i saw the pr. yea
14:53 < bridge_> <teero777> ah okay
14:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well first proove that this is even faster
14:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without zip, you can more easily opne them with many cores
14:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you didn't prove that it's slower, either
14:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just above your message i give a legit reason tho
14:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> other than zips, which uncompress compressed images
14:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> this is exciting. imagine in the future being able to brodcast what theme of weapons you're using through the server. since most of the useless images in a pack arent being loaded itll much more efficient than it used to be before
14:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how do you think it will help not loading useless parts?
14:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you always at least have the overhead of the zip header, independent of the content
14:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they do not, since we'll be using uncompressed zips
14:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I find it disingenious that you ignore this, not even address why you think it might be false
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs your claim is ppl open the zip and swap stuff out
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd like to know if windows leaves the zip uncompressed in this case
14:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably not
14:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but I'd guess most people will not do that, and for those, I claim, it'll be faster
14:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok, on what machine?
14:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can i assume 6 cores? pretty standard
14:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sure
14:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and ofc a SSD
14:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
14:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and probably windows ^^
14:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so we have to assume windows defender too?
14:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah 😦
14:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why is that even a thing
15:00 < bridge_> <teero777> lol i just discovered a bug.
15:00 < bridge_> <teero777> i made a map 10,000,000 big.
15:00 < bridge_> <teero777> i can only fall upto y 524288
15:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> windows defender probably makes opening/closing many files even slower
15:00 < bridge_> <Voxel> im thinking a tiny bit. should `hit1` and `explo1` stay inside  particles or should it be grouped with the weapons, since the gun muzzle flashes are also grouped there
15:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it might analyze the whole zip.. that's not better
15:01 < bridge_> <Voxel> not like itd do anything, it all just images
15:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mhh good question, i also thought about that recently. One could say an explosion is only the cause of a projectile, which is unrelated to the weapon.
15:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But i wouldn't know a good category for that.. It's kinda physic effects
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are they currently in particles?
15:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> muzzle flashes are in game/weapons. explo and hit are in particles
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and projectile trails?
15:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> pistol bullet trials are in game i think. smoke particles are in particles
15:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> pistol bullet trails are in game i think. smoke particles are in particles
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok.. well gun trails are similary sized to the gun projectile. so maybe that could be the logical argumentation.. But consequently it should be a particle i guess
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno rn how the ddnet source code handles it
15:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> i think when we start moving forward with this we should name the assets things that make more sense
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> seems like it's a particle in the source code
15:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> like why is the rifle still named laser? and the pistol simply named Gun?
15:07 < bridge_> <umudo21> hello, I was banned from Multimeyasmap, it was supposed to be opened at this time, but it didn't open, my little brother threw people or something, sorry
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rifle is weird yes
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pistol is ok?
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gun sounds like the word group for a pistol
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. a shotgun is also a gun
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or is that your complain? XD
15:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the time is in UTC , convert it using the internet
15:09 < bridge_> <umudo21> how do i use the internet
15:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you already do, so that's not an excuse
15:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "What is 17 o'clock UTC in Paris"
15:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> wdym why is rifle weird
15:11 < bridge_> <umudo21> I don't know Turkish
15:11 < bridge_> <umudo21> I don't know Turkish
15:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's english
15:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> better than saying "lemme get laser" "i am holding a laser"
15:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> shotgun is also laser in ddnet
15:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so you want to name the laser rifle?
15:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to me shotgun in ddrace is actually a new weapon: puller or smth
15:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it simply used shotgun, bcs that's unused
15:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I never call it rifle ingame, I'm always using "laser"
15:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also "ninja", not "katana"
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> unfreeze_gun
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pull_gun
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> useless_gun
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
15:16 < bridge_> <Voxel> i guess in terms of modes it makes a bit more sense
15:16 < bridge_> <Voxel> grenade_gun
15:16 < bridge_> <Voxel> alert_gun
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> hammering_gun
15:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> ok fine no renames
15:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> except pistol
15:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> gun_gun
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Voxel what's your current structure tree?
15:18 < bridge_> <teero777> haha
15:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> that would go so hard tho
15:19 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> imagine mods with actual different weapon visually
15:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> for how assets are organized?
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well how they are structured xd
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks check at the end. are those just floating point errors?
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143535064139968665/2023-08-22_15-15-18.mp4
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> things are buggy in the distant land of teeworlds
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can you just render what u mean xD if it's at the end
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> no no
15:20 < bridge_> <teero777> need the gui
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> i have folders for:
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - weapons
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - particles
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - map_items
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - hud
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - gui
15:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> - emoticons
15:21 < bridge_> <teero777> i get stuck at 524288 y
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok, how for example does weapons look like
15:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> im mobile
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> does it simply have dirs:
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> - gun
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> -shogtun etc
15:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> windows defender probs check zip files.more aggressive so its slower on those
15:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> each folder just has all the respecting weapon assets in it. i dont want it to go too deep into folders for the user's sake
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a png is a simple header check i think, zip needs uncompression(?)
15:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> ryo we established it wont be compressed
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for the AV check
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> still windows defender has to check it
15:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hashes or whathever it does
15:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it has to "unzip" it
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok.. we could at least think about smth like this
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> weapons/default/...
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> weapons/my_mod/...
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> weapons/another_mod/...
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In case we want to plan to allow multiple assets in future... How exactly do you imagine overwriting assets else?
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean game.png should™️ be in assets like the game.png mods
15:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> i guess
15:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> another problem is what if you want to change weapon skins but not hud skins
15:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> like ddnet now
15:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep
15:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> ~~game.zip, particles.zip~~
15:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
15:25 < bridge_> <Voxel> 😬
15:25 < bridge_> <umudo21> Do you know how to make a rainbow skin my brother is crying because of it
15:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> lol???
15:26 < bridge_> <umudo21> Do you know how to make a rainbow skin my brother is crying because of it
15:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> why is your brother crying over ddnet
15:26 < bridge_> <umudo21> no
15:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> hold on lemme find the thing
15:26 < bridge_> <umudo21> @_voxeldoesartTHANK YOU
15:27 < bridge_> <teero777> ChillerDragon: @jupeyy_keks i am the first tee in the teeworld to discover the farlands

15:28 < bridge_> <Voxel> Most frequent questions, especially related to binds can be found on the DDNet Wiki: <https://wiki.ddnet.org/>
15:28 < bridge_> <Voxel> :wiki: Wiki page for binds: <https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Binds>
15:29 < bridge_> <Voxel> rainbow tee is in the wiki
15:30 < bridge_> <teero777> @_voxeldoesart haha i still remember once i wrote a script to make 255 cfg files to achieve rainbow xdd
15:30 < bridge_> <teero777> with binds ofc
15:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What's your x coordinate?
15:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or y
15:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> fascinating
15:30 < bridge_> <teero777> 524288 y
15:30 < bridge_> <teero777> 1.5 x
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I c
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then yes
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Floating point
15:31 < bridge_> <teero777> floating point already at 500k??
15:31 < bridge_> <teero777> weird
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Probably during quantinize
15:31 < bridge_> <teero777> but why cant i go further??
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why already
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Its already inaccurate after a few thousand
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well the velocity probably quantiszes to 0
15:32 < bridge_> <teero777> the velocity keeps going until max but i cant get my position further
15:32 < bridge_> <teero777> ill try with teles
15:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> We conv the float to 1/256 or smth.. and the accuracy is already too bad
15:33 < bridge_> <teero777> then why are we using floats? xdd
15:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> i remember a map being so long that you basicallu fell down and if you went fast enough you stop midair at the finish line
15:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno. Legacy reasons
15:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> @louis.place remember we raced
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> wtf? default client is limited to map to 10k in each direction xdd
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> how tw
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> how tf
15:34 < bridge_> <screeeny> you can easily reproduce with falling in blue tps too
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> my map is 10 mil
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> no the position
15:34 < bridge_> <teero777> not the position
15:35 < bridge_> <screeeny> i meant this to stopping midair
15:35 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm okay...
15:36 < bridge_> <louis> down60k or smth
15:36 < bridge_> <teero777> xDDD
15:36 < bridge_> <teero777> so im not the first one ;(
15:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> no you arent
15:36 < bridge_> <teero777> i just said that
15:37 < bridge_> <botondpont> waat
15:37 < bridge_> <screeeny> If you reach rly high speed your speed starts getting multiplayed by a ramp value, i visulized it once here https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/1064935260678262845
15:37 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> what are u saying
15:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> its not cuz of speed
15:38 < bridge_> <screeeny> maybe im talking about sth else
15:39 < bridge_> <screeeny> oh yes didnt see the video
15:40 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm okay if im a little under 524288 y then the y coordinate just completely freezes
15:40 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143540146084520046/image.png
15:41 < bridge_> <teero777> and i can do super long hooks ig
15:41 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143540337856495657/image.png
15:41 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> oh wow
15:41 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i could only get my camera to far lands
15:41 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> using glitches
15:41 < bridge_> <teero777> the width of the aimline is bugged too
15:41 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i remember the tiles being stretched out
15:42 < bridge_> <teero777> xDD
15:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and tiles were placed where they shouldnt
15:42 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> some also werent visible
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, we need physic changes xd
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Will be biggest drama ever xddd
15:43 < bridge_> <teero777> what is happening with my aimline @jupeyy_keks ?
15:43 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143540963294326874/aimline-wtf.mp4
15:43 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> lmao
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe with a season 2 it would be acceptable.. 99.99% of the game would probably feel the same anyway
15:44 < bridge_> <teero777> how tf does my position influence the width of my aimline?
15:44 < bridge_> <teero777> i dont even have custom width enabled
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Its bcs the hookpos
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The hookline basically simulates a hook
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So the hook is probably also longer
15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or broken
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> All calculations that use the pos are basically broken with this
15:45 < bridge_> <teero777> i dont think it does. or was it in a new update?
15:45 < bridge_> <louis> although ive never seen it severe as this
15:45 < bridge_> <louis> so here 🏆
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Its always been that way
15:45 < bridge_> <louis> it does
15:45 < bridge_> <louis> in a map with hook tunes your hookline can become longer or shorter
15:45 < bridge_> <teero777> then why can i mishook when going fast and the line is green?
15:45 < bridge_> <teero777> yea
15:46 < bridge_> <teero777> that just a multiplier
15:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That's someone different
15:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It calculated the hook as if you were not moving
15:46 < bridge_> <teero777> yea
15:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> As soon as u move it's basically invalid what u saw
15:47 < bridge_> <teero777> ima test some weapons down there
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> had to install an old client just to do this
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143542091570499594/screenshot_2023-08-22_15-47-35.png

15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> textures bugged like that when i take camera far off the map border
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> at some point they just dissapear
15:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and at some other point some tiles just stretch a bit
15:49 < bridge_> <louis> werent u trying to show me that a while ago souli
15:49 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i did
15:50 < bridge_> <teero777> even the editor is bugged at 10,000,000 y
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well everything is bugged with these floats xD
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Minecraft also gets Buggy when doubles getting inaccurate
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U can watch it on YouTube
15:53 < bridge_> <teero777> damn thats a thick tele right there
15:53 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143543406904225812/image.png

15:57 < bridge_> <teero777> AHAHAHAH
15:58 < bridge_> <teero777> ill post a vid later
16:15 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 woah far lands! yikers. I remember years ago i tried creating a 10k x 10k map but my client crashed when i tried to open it xd
16:16 < bridge_> <teero777> xd
16:16 < bridge_> <teero777> mine is 10mil x 6
16:16 < ChillerDragon> gaming pc moment
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> with 6 i mean 6 not 6mil btw xdd
16:17 < ChillerDragon> a
16:17 < ChillerDragon> xd
16:17 < ChillerDragon> scam
16:17 < ChillerDragon> you flat earther?
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> nah
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> earth is horizontal
16:17 < ChillerDragon> xd
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> i mistyped
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> i mean 6 x 10mil ofc
16:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> I can make plans to work on it next
16:50 < bridge_> <teero777> but will you?
16:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's high on my TODO list now
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> How long is your TODO list 😬
16:55 < bridge_> <patiga> @teero777 I also experimented with large maps once. it is quite interesting that you can actually feel the difference between each segment of the map where the float inaccuracy get slightly worse
16:57 < bridge_> <patiga> you can use the twmap python module to use a scripting language to produce maps :)
16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> Undefined, my TODOs are mostly stored as a bunch of bookmarks in Firefox and as git branches with an mostly empty "TODO: xyz" commit
16:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> put performance todos on highest 😏
17:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/cppfastio/fast_io
17:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> > RUST IS SLOW. Also Rust does not deal with locale. Think how bad it is.
17:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> :santatrollet:
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i tell ya, variadic templates beat everything
17:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sadly most ppl seam to unaware just how awesome they are xd
17:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (+ concepts ofc)
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i guess with procedual macros you can basically achieve the same what i would want
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i dunno why it's slow in their mind.. but maybe standard rust is slow indeed xd
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean it looses against Lua
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in hello world xd
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> shame
17:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> The benchmark where Rust loses was "Print out ten million integers from 0 to 10M to file. Then reopen that file to scan back."
17:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see
17:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like they might have missed buffering
17:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> unfortunately I can't find the source code they used
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> issue opened: RUST AIN'T SLOW BRA
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i kinda would like to see a benchmark game, but only with idiomatic code (per language)
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then c wins everywhere lmao
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is no idiomatic code in c xd
17:10 < bridge_> <teero777> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWVPOXt24kM
17:10 < bridge_> <teero777> kind of really low effort
17:10 < bridge_> <teero777> but here you go
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 r u a coder btw?
17:11 < bridge_> <teero777> yea why?
17:11 < bridge_> <teero777> i just do it for fun
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well back when i was young and didnt know about such stuff like inaccuracies etc.
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i always found such "bugs" mythical
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i wondered if you feel the same xd
17:12 < bridge_> <teero777> the only magical thing i have is memory corruption...
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i remember i played a game where you were glitched high up in the air and fell for a long time
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it kinda gave me chills
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> same for stuff like walking out of maps (in 3d games)
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> was always scarry
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nowadays i only see it logically 😭
17:13 < bridge_> <teero777> ahha whats up with the line spaces xDDD
17:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> lol, I think have that in Geoguessr with what players call "rifts" in the sky
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> back in elementary school, my sitting neighbour always put an extra line after every line
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and it always looked fancy
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess that's why i still do it up until today 😂
17:15 < bridge_> <totar> I wonder what happens if you remove the quantization
17:15 < bridge_> <teero777> i once tried to beat zelda ocarina of time on my first pc. i had like 4 months of progress then i fell out of the map and my save file wasnt working after....
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lol, nice. never saw these things
17:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can see examples here: https://geohints.com/Rifts
17:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that sounds rather depressing xd
17:16 < bridge_> <teero777> those look cool
17:17 < bridge_> <teero777> knowing less is sometimes better
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well pretty often tbh xdd
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is a saying: stupid ppl are more happy
17:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> same, but with tw
17:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just wonder and think about the code that does X
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and yes rust doesnt buffer by default
17:24 < bridge_> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks ich actually do remember 1 magical thing
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Finally Saint Ryo will save us xd
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo when open issue
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> blaming them for no skillz
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lmao

17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> totally no bias
17:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd start by asking for the rust source code
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tbh in case the benchmark is well done. it's good that it exists, it will make rust better
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but there are so many fcking libs(language independent), that just do synthetic benchmarks to look good
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and that's just annoying
17:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if they dont provide the source code
17:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then all the readme is bs
17:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for starters
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's clickbait xd
17:27 < bridge_> <teero777> there were always some videos about pokemon ruby/sapphire on how to get X pokemon that is litteraly not avaiable ingame. it was basically just someone with a modded game doing specific steps to get the pokemon. i ofc didnt know it was modded and tried to repeat the steps in the videos for hours xdd
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Robyte baited me clicking it because of that quote xDDD
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well pokemon was such a huge deal back in the days..
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as kids we didnt really know how to google. and back then there werent 2000 pokemon wikis
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so stuff like Mew gltich etc. were actually done over mouth propaganda
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And it worked so well.. Even tho 50% of these glitches didnt even work xDD
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that was the real fakenews time xDD
17:29 < bridge_> <teero777> xDDD
17:29 < bridge_> <teero777> but it was fun
17:29 < bridge_> <teero777> best time of my life tbh
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i would even dare say he ran rust in debug xd
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> quite possible
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> don't trust the benchmark you didn't fake xdd
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is a chinese issue
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> that mentions all the issues of this repo
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fast_io may have incomplete or unfair parts in its comparison with traditional streaming I/O.
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> In terms of speed:
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Intel C++ is not included in the comparison (C++ 11 over C++ 20 may not be right, but performance comes first).
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Failure to include the rest of the compilers that are part of the Windows GCC implementation in the list of comparisons, while picking the most mediocre performer, MinGW-w64.
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Failure to provide (as much as possible) uniform compilation parameters.
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     When mentioning the speed of the Rust programming language, not mentioning whether to compile in Debug or Release.

17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> epic xd
17:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> didnt u need a encoder
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i specifically need an audio encoder
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in pure rust
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> best is if it would be vorbis
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> currently the only thing not rust is `ring` :/
17:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what does a audio encoder
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i hope i can remove it some day
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it encodes audio
17:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's probably not removable. hmmm. maybe you could do it with inline assembly
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sounds good enough
17:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if rust compiler supports some asm
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> could rust itself standarize some instructions needed?
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or what exactly is blocking it
17:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> rust supports inline assembly
17:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it does
17:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> asm macro
17:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/inline-assembly.html
17:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the problem is compilers. you can't write constant-time code in any non-assembly languages I know of
17:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/unsafe/asm.html
17:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so between inline asm and ring, which ultimately also uses asm then.. is there any burdon?
17:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> burdon?
17:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> burden
17:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, you mean perf implications?
17:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean anything at all
17:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is it all about perf or what?
17:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there are no non-perf differences between rust inlien asm and actual asm AFAIK
17:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd be ok to loose a few ms.. tbh
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are the constant time algorithms used for certification creation?
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are the constant time algorithms used for certificates creation?
17:48 < bridge_> <patiga> I would guess it is about highly security related code, where you are happy that one implementation seemingly gets it right ^^
17:49 < bridge_> <teero777> yey
17:49 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1143572545166123058/image.png
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or are side channel attacks also a problem for the encryption and decryption itself
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well crates.io has no binary crates.. so i need a c compiler
17:49 < bridge_> <patiga> afaik, yes
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's kinda annoying
17:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also encryption/decryption. maybe even particularly that
17:53 < ChillerDragon> heinrich sos
17:53 < ChillerDragon> watafak is up w `CNetObj_PlayerInput`
17:53 < ChillerDragon> is that a snap item thats not in the snap? :D
17:53 < ChillerDragon> but instead sent by the client
17:54 < ChillerDragon> which drunk trol decided thats making sense
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `CNetObj_PlayerInput` is weird 😄
17:54 < ChillerDragon> isnt snap supposed to be items the server sends to the client
17:54 < ChillerDragon> watafak
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you described it perfectly
17:54 < bridge_> <learath2> It's probably a hack we use for demos
17:54 < ChillerDragon> thanks senpaii
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not involved in demos AFAIK
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's just a "let's use this to generate a struct" AFAICT
17:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 😄
17:55 < ChillerDragon> im so gonna document the shit out of this
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Ew
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok but is inline asm different to normal asm?
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i still don't get what exactly is the difference between doing it in rust or c
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> c/rust makes no difference here
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> c is also too high-level for constant-time code
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> everything you can do in C is also possible in rust
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok i mean like
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u rewrite the c part
17:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what's blocking?
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> nothing, I'd guess
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but I think ring also includes assembly?
17:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i guess that's not a problem is it?
17:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you still need an assembler, which is sort of like a C compiler ^^
17:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so the rust inline asm, is architecture dependent (like let's say x86 asm)? while the assembler there is using a compiler?
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the rust inline assembly is arch dependent
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the actual assembler on the platform is another binary dependency you'd have to install
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> which is annoying, in a similar way as it's annoying to have to install a C compiler
18:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so in conclusion the problem is: there have to rewrite the asm they already have?
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so in conclusion the problem is: they have to rewrite the asm they already have?
18:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/macro.global_asm.html
18:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they should create an proc macro that reassmbles the asm to arch dependent asm
18:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this means they might not have to do it?
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is drama rn about sandboxing proc macros with wasm
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and precompiling proc macros
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have seen that there was a crate that can do that
18:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't understand the drama tbh. also, sandboxing proc macros does very little as long as there are build scripts
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk either
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also: are compilers even secure enough?
18:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not rly into programming during my vacations xd
18:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wanted a break
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rust knows no break
18:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but drama was started by dtolnay experiment
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tbh if you dont trust proc macros.. you also can't trust any crate
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as if you are checking the source of the crate you use
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> some people are doin it
18:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not, unfortunately
18:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> cargo-vet, I think
18:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> oh, cargo-crev as well
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have  a cargo crev trust repo
18:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sure but i just don't get where the source is different from the proc macro here
18:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hm
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well the thing is source doesnt execute code when compiling
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> proc macros execute code when compiling
18:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok but as soon as your start the exec.. it's over xd
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> really depends to which extend sandboxing will help anyway.
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they can't sandbox file access..
18:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's not true. build scripts exist
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
18:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> build scripts can also depend on arbitrary crates
18:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have no opinion on this regard on what they do, either way will be same for me i think
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just hope they don't destroy proc macros xDD
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i find them cool and abuse them hard
18:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its backward incompat
18:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to destroy proc macros
18:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so they cant xd
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for security they might do
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new rust edition
18:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this isnt just a thing they thought now btw
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> backward compability sucks anyway
18:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> who invented that xd
18:19 < bridge_> <learath2> He is bringing forbidden knowledge into this world
18:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> :gigachad:
18:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks wasmtime or wasmer btw?
18:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wasmer
18:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it claims to be the fastest runtime xdd
18:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's a convincing argument for me
18:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i use cranelift.. and they both use it afaik
18:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so they can't be too far off
18:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> except the one does some stuff overcomplicated
18:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the biggest bottleneck i saw were simply the huge function calls.. like the amount of functions that are called until guest function is reached
18:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://00f.net/2023/01/04/webassembly-benchmark-2023/
18:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> seems to agree, wasmer is a little bit faster than wasmtime
18:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> even wasmer cranelift
18:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't understand this one
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you mean rust functions?
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is wasmer interpreter or JIT?
18:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lets say u have a function `mod_run`
18:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> calling that function (in the wasmer API) seems to create a rather big call stack
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> jit probably, since it's using cranelfit
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, I see
18:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> TIL `%` works on `#ifdef`s in vim
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vim is so good
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rip

21:25 < bridge_> <teero777> Zeit wird noch nicht direkt gemessen sondern in gameticks. Ein gameticks ist 1/50 einer sekunde lang (0,02s).
21:25 < bridge_> <teero777> also ab gerundet.
21:26 < bridge_> <teero777> Zeit wird noch nicht direkt gemessen sondern in gameticks. Ein gameticks ist 1/50 einer sekunde lang (0,02s).

21:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> neither rounded down nor rounded up I think
21:26 < bridge_> <teero777> Not directly but by how the game works
21:27 < bridge_> <teero777> If you finish at say 1.57 seconds your finish time will be 1.56 seconds
21:27 < bridge_> <teero777> Since you have not yet reached the next gametick
21:29 < Huu> I am wondering releated to nyan cat, there are 35.44  .46  .48  .50  .52 times  https://ddnet.org/maps/Nyan-32-Cat
21:29 < Huu> I can reproduce 48 50 and 52 with an bug at start
21:30 < Huu> I saw also runs with 46 but no difference to the 48 run that why i am asking
21:31 < Huu> So 46 and 44 are for me still a weird that they exist
21:31 < Huu> Or can a potential 48 run can be counted as a 46 run just by tick luck?
21:32 < Huu> Since there is no deterministic 
21:32 < bridge_> <teero777> ddnet is completely deterministic except of teleport positions
21:32 < bridge_> <teero777> given all information ofc
21:33 < Huu> Hmm then i dont get why my potential 48 run sometimes count as 46
21:33 < Huu> Thats kinda weird
21:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Given ALL the information even those are deterministic now. We use a PRNG now
21:33 < bridge_> <billionray> 🦔
21:34 < bridge_> <learath2> The client just doesnt have the seed and the counter of the PRNG that's why it can't predict yet
21:34 < Huu> Not sure about that i can like show u an example where u get random results actualy on nyan cat
21:34 < bridge_> <teero777> given all informatio....
21:35 < Huu> where u get a 0,00 - 0,04 time disadvantage
21:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is determinism bound to the os of the server?
21:35 < bridge_> <teero777> the client checkpoint times that get shown aren't actually represented as ticks
21:35 < bridge_> <teero777> They use actual time calculation
21:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> r u testing with a sv in windows?
21:36 < bridge_> <teero777> the client checkpoint time diffrences that get shown aren't actually represented as ticks
21:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> curious maybe the time api has quirks xd
21:36 < bridge_> <teero777> So those might be false
21:36 < bridge_> <teero777> Never trust checkpoints
21:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh checkpoints
21:38 < bridge_> <teero777> @ryozuki btw quick ddnet hack is to lag the server with many friends and then play in slowmo for better accuracy :troll:
21:38 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd say it depends on the server triplet in general
21:39 < bridge_> <learath2> os-arch-abi
21:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Though ideally OS shouldn't(tm) be a factor
21:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Actually maybe compiler-arch pair is enough though I can't say for sure we didn't test it
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u sure the api syscalls if they are syscalls dont change a bit
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> scheduler or idk
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
21:40 < bridge_> <learath2> @zwelf2 has been reproducing teehistorian files, maybe he knows
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> interrupts
21:40 < Huu> I have a quick question, lets say i start Nyan Cat pressing D + Jump i will get a run with 48 but as i soon i hold D + Jump and then press kill i will start with a 0,02 ms delay what is the reason for that
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> even memory allocation if is slower
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> may slow stuff?
21:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u never know
21:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Shouldn't matter(tm) since we don't ever skip ticks
21:41 < bridge_> <teero777> when you kill you start in the air
21:41 < bridge_> <teero777> If that's mattera
21:41 < bridge_> <teero777> If that's matters
21:43 < Huu> Gonna record something 1 sec
21:45 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> thats just gd
21:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> tele aint random anymore?
21:47 < bridge_> <teero777> it's basically random
21:47 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Pseudo random
21:47 < bridge_> <teero777> no way for the client to predict without #6775
21:47 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6775
21:47 < bridge_> <steinchen99> nya nya nya nya nya nya
21:51 < bridge_> <learath2> It only appears random now. For the server it's deterministic

21:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> uff
21:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> starting arch after 2 months xd
21:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and ofc they give me like 1MB/s xd
21:57 < bridge_> <teero777> xD
21:57 < bridge_> <teero777> Why Update anyway if you don't want to install smth new?
21:57 < Huu> Here its visible https://imgur.com/MwsGdej
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> yea ik but itd be funny to troll blockers or gores players
21:58 < Huu> Inputs are D + Jump  on first run its aligned with ghost and i would get 48 run then i press kill while still holding D + Jump and i will get a 50 run
21:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> or hh players
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why do you assume u clicked the exact same time as ghost
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (jump)
21:59 < bridge_> <teero777> You will spawn in the air 1 pixel above ground
21:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> jumping changes your speed
22:01 < Huu> Intresting so thats why i lose also my dj intresting
22:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wow whoever in mozillas team made this first time setup screen is an ass xD
22:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>

22:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pure hate
22:01 < bridge_> <teero777> :justatest: :justatest:
22:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I also don't like it
22:02 < bridge_> <teero777> just had to setup a new windows machine. still hate every step of it.
22:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, i hate setting up windows xD
22:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2 million privacy questions
22:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u click no to all
22:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it still steals anything xd
22:03 < bridge_> <teero777> waiting 3hrs for basic drivers for the hardware to even work correctly
22:03 < bridge_> <teero777> waiting 3hrs for basic drivers to install for the hardware to even work correctly
22:04 < bridge_> <teero777> at least there are some debloating scripts on gh
22:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It's to protect children obviously
22:07 < bridge_> <yekrm> With nlite u get unattended installation and better performance by removing everything you will never use
22:07 < bridge_> <teero777> I was today years old when I discovered that there is a windows software to flash the windows iso to a USB stick. The twist is that the USB stick has to have a single ntfs partition for whatever reason
22:07 < bridge_> <teero777> Else the software doesn't detect it
22:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> bad idea
22:08 < bridge_> <teero777> Neither does it give any warnings/errory
22:08 < bridge_> <yekrm> Rufus?
22:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> windows to go. i used it at school
22:08 < bridge_> <teero777> Removing cortana etc
22:09 < bridge_> <teero777> yea I usually use rufus or dd
22:09 < bridge_> <teero777> but I had no raw iso and the torrents were slow.
22:10 < bridge_> <yekrm> https://github.com/AveYo/MediaCreationTool.bat
22:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> Those debloater scripts tend to remove important components
22:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what is the command under pacman to switch packages?

22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> [jupeyy@archlinux ~]$ sudo pacman -S mesa
22:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> Idk
22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i did this
22:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> It should prompt with a number
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk im gentoo based rn
22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
22:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> wdym? do you have to finish watching the animation in order to continue?
22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:11 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> we should add that to ddnet
22:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is like 2 seconds delay per step
22:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> ok
22:11 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wanna break from the ads? if you tap now to watch a short video, you will recieve 30 minutes of ad-free multeasymap, yes, really
22:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> :troll:
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> add a ddnet tik tok tab to the client
22:12 < bridge_> <yekrm> -1000 fps
22:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> making a ddnet intro anim that plays while loadinh
22:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have mesa-git installed
22:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> making a ddnet intro anim that plays while loading
22:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but want to downgrade to mesa
22:12 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> like discord
22:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> If you’re having dependency issues U can do -Rdd mesa-git and -S mesa
22:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> iirc
22:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i probably need a force command
22:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> trure
22:12 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> and we gotta add dumbass loading messages too
22:13 < bridge_> <Voxel> Did you know?: The bind for deepfly is-

22:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pacman -R --nodeps --nodeps mesa-git
22:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> worked xd
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> guess it's the same as this? 😹
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> isn’t that -Rdd
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yeah
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> Lol
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> GG
22:21 < bridge_> <teero777> use downgrade commands
22:21 < bridge_> <teero777> I think it's in the aur
22:22 < bridge_> <teero777> use downgrade command
22:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> someone should make a video comparing major versions of ddnet
22:23 < Huu> I reproduced a flat nyan cat with straight ground with just the start keep the same, if i jump on that platform i will get a time difference while without jumping i will get a faster time. Can someone explain me why
22:25 < Huu> Also when i dont press Jump my X Speed is constant at 18.59 as soon i jump my X speed jumps between 18.59 to 17.9 (i think) and as soon i land again back to 18.59
22:26 < bridge_> <rickslambiase20> Hello guys just wanna let you know have got some Top quality products Gas🍁 ⛽️ , shrooms🍄, coke, meth &Vapes🥢, Ice capz, Edibles🍪, Chocolate Bars🍫, LSD, Syrups, Skittles, pills , 💊 clone cards etc. Both for smokers are patients, Offer at moderate price, and also some polkadot gummies, edibles,road trip available just wanna know if you're interested in grabbing some?
22:26 < bridge_> <rickslambiase20> https://t.me/lambiaserickLtdstore
22:27 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> because ramping counts y speed too
22:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> (im pretty sure idk correct me if im wrong lol)
22:36 < Huu> So would mean to improve time on nyan cat to maybe get a 46 or 44 ms i would jump less stay mostly constant in Y i will test that out thanks alot everyone
22:44 < bridge_> <matodor> test it - `37.230.162.198:8303` [currently offline]
22:44 < bridge_> <DDNet> 37.230.162.198:8303 is not a DDNet or KoG server.
22:45 < bridge_> <swarfey> i found that bug a few months ago too, if i remember right it is possible just by setting the "local" variable in the playerinfo snap to 0 :D

22:48 < bridge_> <gerdoe> this one is server side thingie i suppose
22:48 < bridge_> <gerdoe> server can do anything with player camera anyway
22:48 < bridge_> <swarfey> yes, the snapshot that the server sends to the client
22:48 < bridge_> <swarfey> oh really?
22:48 < bridge_> <swarfey> was it always like that?
22:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> @matodor разве?
22:49 < bridge_> <matodor> can't)
22:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> duh
22:49 < bridge_> <swarfey> i just joined the server from matodor, he does some magic i think
22:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i did some tests back in 2019, was a thing
22:49 < bridge_> <swarfey> but i dont think it actually sets you in spectator mode
22:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> maybe i fucked up something xd
22:50 < bridge_> <swarfey> damn, thats interesting
22:50 < bridge_> <swarfey> would be a cool thing for new mods
22:50 < bridge_> <gerdoe> matodor says thats impossible tho
22:50 < bridge_> <gerdoe> maybe i was high or smth :P
22:51 < bridge_> <gerdoe> anyway i was about to make session competetive mod with classes like bf tee mod
22:51 < bridge_> <gerdoe> but drones xd
22:53 < bridge_> <swarfey> :p
23:01 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Yes it is possible, I'm using in in infclass mod: https://github.com/infclass/teeworlds-infclassR/blob/production/src/game/server/infclass/infcplayer.cpp#L149-L191
