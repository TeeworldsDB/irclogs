00:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
00:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> you get a response, tho "executed command `xyz`

01:07 < bridge> <kebscs> ah yes its recent bug
01:07 < bridge> <kebscs> chillerdragon hardcoded tune zones to 0 to fix vanilla demos
01:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So tune zone 0 is an actual tune zone? My bad. The way I red the prediction code I understood tune zone 0 as the world tune
01:27 < bridge> <kebscs> tune zone 0 is the default zone
01:27 < bridge> <kebscs> so if theres no tuine zones its 0
01:27 < bridge> <kebscs> so if theres no tune zones its 0
01:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah okay so I understand it correct then
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But what is the difference between m\_aTuning and tuninglist 0
01:29 < bridge> <kebscs> m_aTuning is local list is for everyone
01:29 < bridge> <kebscs> so when u set list[0] it set tunings for every tee
01:29 < bridge> <kebscs> m_aTuning is local, list is for everyone
01:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What do you mean by every tee? My dummy and me?
01:30 < bridge> <kebscs> everyone on the server in tune zone 0
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So m\_aTuning might hold the value of a non zero tune zone?
01:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is it like the currently active zone?
01:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why do we need both variables on the client side
01:33 < bridge> <kebscs> yes m_aTuning is current active zone
01:33 < bridge> <kebscs> can be 0 to num_tunezones
01:33 < bridge> <kebscs> TuningList() is used for prediction for other tees
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> m\_aTuning is not a int is it?
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s a tune params array
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo it should be an int pointing into tuninglist to avoid confusion
01:34 < bridge> <kebscs> yea its the params, got confused a bit
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s duplicated values with no clear relation
01:35 < bridge> <kebscs> makes sense for me
01:35 < bridge> <kebscs> one is for local, other is for preditcion for everyone else
01:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But the local one just refers to an existing zone
01:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well I guess we should wait for the refactor until there is the new tune feature
01:38 < bridge> <kebscs> looks like u receive m_aTuning from the server when your tune changes
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So that’s the world tune
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So imo that should also go into tune zone 0?
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> XD
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> no
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> u can be in tune zone number 1
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> m_aTuning will be params from tune zone 1
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> why 0
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh really?
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> yes thats why it broke
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So the server sends new tune params every time you touch a new zone?
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> local player is in tune zone 1, you set tune zone 0 so it breaks for every tee
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
01:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Crazy
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I really hope vanilla demos aren’t broken again .\_.
01:41 < bridge> <kebscs> i went on random vanilla server and tested shotgun and works fine
01:41 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how else to test it
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you watch the demo?
01:47 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
01:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok nice yea it should be fine then
02:06 < bridge> <notzxpixty> is there method to call hook function except m_Controls.m_aInputData[0].m_Hook = 1
02:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> if the hook state is only set on key up and key down events then thats what any function would do
02:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> also shouldnt that 0 be dependent on whether dummy is selected or not
02:31 < bridge> <notzxpixty> i changed to 0 for example
03:27 < bridge> <woidless> Chiller , check issues , and add new translate
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless you can't just remove placeholders in the translation. Also I saw it don't be pushy. I need to allocate time to cleanup your mess. Also is "ivent" really a russian word?
04:55 < bridge> <woidless> Да?
05:06 < bridge> <woidless> Yes
07:10 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragonhow can I make it show the number of kills in a row instead of the passage time in tab?
07:10 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon how can I make it show the number of kills in a row instead of the passage time in tab?
08:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless update and then its ``sv_display_score 3``
09:30 < bridge> <woidless> Thx
10:45 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon  is it possible to copy a map and paste it into another map? For example, Savannux + Dandelinux
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes same as you copy a part
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can use append for background and animations and you can copy parts by selecting multiple layers at once using shift
11:24 < bridge> <woidless> I want to create a hub with a teleport to these 2 maps, which I can do. But how can I copy it completely in Savannux with all the freezing, texture, and Dandelinux blocks
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to add the same tile layers in the target map and then you can just select a area in the source map and paste it in the target map btw this is more of a #mapping question
12:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> Chiller got adopted by Evelyn as personal assistant :greenthing:
12:29 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon  make it impossible to enter the tournament block with dummy
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am not sure if i like that
12:33 < bridge> <woidless> Well, make it possible to choose in the config
12:34 < bridge> <woidless> It's just so easy to get wins
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm todays merge didnt go so well ..

12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea it is xd
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bru i even have that bug in ddnet not just in my hax client
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did i mess that up on my system or is the master glitched?
12:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems caused by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9213, I'll fix it later
13:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice thanks
13:57 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon So you'll do it?
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its done i pinged you on github

15:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> :peperage:
15:50 < bridge> <montikboom> Anyone can give me tune commands in f2 to make game speed lower by 2?
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> Yo im pretty confused rn. when `sv_destroy_bullets_on_death` is 0 the reload timer gets reset to 0 when killing right? or is there some initial reload counter? i can't find it if so. but ingame there seems to be some sort of delay making it impossible to fire 2 grenades within 3 ticks
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> does the tee maybe not exist for a tick?

16:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> two tas questions in a row when open #botter channel
16:21 < bridge> <teero777> yes please
16:21 < bridge> <teero777> now answer
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no such tune
16:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean you can tune gravity to be lower and projectile speed to be lower but there is no general game speed tune
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> game speed tune can't exists cuz physics quantizing anyway
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> *using current tunes
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> chiller answer my question!!
16:23 < bridge> <teero777> where does that 1 tick go
16:23 < bridge> <montikboom> I mean using many tunes, not only one
