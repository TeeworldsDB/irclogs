00:02 < bridge> <louis> ye. also i think my prediction code for the shotgun collision has a skill issue
00:02 < bridge> <louis> can prediction only fire every 2 ticks cus of snaps or smth?
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> i think it fires multiple times per tick
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> depends what youre trying to do
01:18 < bridge> <kebscs> i remmber with the alternating switches, i couldnt predict properly, bcs the prediction would change state multiple times in a tick
01:18 < bridge> <kebscs> instead of once on 1 hit
01:40 < bridge> <louis> yea its doing that for me for some reason
01:40 < bridge> <louis> idk if its only for the alternating, ig i could check
02:10 < bridge> <louis> well idk as long as everythings in Tick() shouldn't it call once per tick :thonk:
02:23 < bridge> <totar> Prediction happens every tick
02:24 < bridge> <totar> Idk what your issue is though
02:26 < bridge> <totar> Snapshots are every other tick but  you knew that
03:44 < bridge> <Teero> til rustup can uninstall itself. very cool very nice

04:13 < bridge> <Teero> gh workflows are so useful.
04:19 < bridge> <slayerblacking> yo can u see my bug report?
07:32 < bridge> <melon> mooorning!
07:32 < bridge> <melon> @ryozuki ! - are you still semi in charge of the wiki?
07:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> not much
07:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if i have admin rights
07:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i do
07:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> why @blaiszephyr ?
07:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just busy with life
07:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> :d
07:42 < bridge> <melon> thats fair, just wanted to make sure xd
07:42 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place make sure you use the pred methods, even for intratick
07:42 < bridge> <melon> if you have time, do you mind adding me back into the auto-moderation group?
07:42 < bridge> <melon> i want to help Acqua out a bit
07:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can do that
07:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats ur user
07:42 < bridge> <melon> `melonew`
07:43 < bridge> <melon> `Melonew`
07:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> done
07:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i slept so bad today
07:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need 2 coffees
07:54 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
10:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the wiki back?
10:15 < bridge> <totar> this comment in kernel.h is funny, "works for now"
10:15 < bridge> <totar> 
10:15 < bridge> <totar> ```cpp
10:15 < bridge> <totar> // This kernel thingie makes the structure very flat and basically singletons.
10:15 < bridge> <totar> // I'm not sure if this is a good idea but it works for now.
10:15 < bridge> <totar> ```
10:15 < bridge> <totar> it predates the git history
10:22 < bridge> <melon> yeah its being restored slowly
10:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fromw hat?
10:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> from what?
10:33 < bridge> <melon> wayback machine, mostly
10:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah i see
11:16 < bridge> <carmine1985> Do you know if it is possible to rotate the camera? Is it necessary to paint on screen each thing with a rotation ? Or there's some ready made function provided by SDL?
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> This feature exists in sdl 3, but we're still at sdl 2, <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_DisplayOrientation>
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> it's certainly possible to do that somehow, however I am sure something will break
11:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont use texture drawing so you can set a draw texture then rotate that
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> might actually be easiest, to rotate everything in the shaders and only use vulkan or opengl3 for your test(?)
11:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats for potrait/landscape
11:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `SDL_SetRenderTarget(renderer, texture);`
11:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then make a quad and draw a texture with that etxture on it
11:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can apply transforms, make sure to zoom in an appropriate amount so you dont end up seeing black
11:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this will rotate hud aswell though which isnt very good
11:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont seperate hud very cleanly though so you would have to manually go through each component and set/reset render target
11:23 < bridge> <Assa> The netcode also certainly doesn't like this, so player might appear out of nowhere
11:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its rendering only
11:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you would actually need to use 2 textures so u can then render hud ontop of your transformed game
11:24 < bridge> <melon> i'd just go with Assa's approach of implementing it in the graphic shader
11:24 < bridge> <melon> 
11:24 < bridge> <melon> otherwise you'll burn yourself out just modifying each renderer call
11:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not everything goes through a shader though?
11:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does it
11:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and you still need to diffrentiate hud
11:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you could set a render flag instead
11:25 < bridge> <melon> hmm... true
11:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the modifying shaders would be less intensive
11:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if everything does go thru one
11:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ogl1 cant do it in any way so doesnt matter
11:26 < bridge> <melon> yeah it'd be for modern backends only anyway that way
11:26 < bridge> <Assa> you could add a rotating step to the vulkan pipeline. It's true, that not everything runs through a shader, but it doesn't have to
11:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait you could modify the quad rendering
11:26 < bridge> <melon> implement it for both shader and matrix :kek:
11:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait you could modify the quad rendering (this is still with render flag)
11:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you would also want to generalize a out of bounds function so you can modify it to give it increased range
11:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you dont have to zoom in
12:28 < bridge> <totar> Someone told me they have lag in newer versions, I don't have any solution for them
12:28 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287187497268412506/image.png?ex=68fab446&is=68f962c6&hm=da97dd87a189ed714392002a01800c2372fddbfbac3741afb0c97bdd89b12d4c&

12:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 look at dis trol assembly
12:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287379045020991559/image.png?ex=68fabdea&is=68f96c6a&hm=eaf6fa1d7a0928e7e02367804d9c53571ec9e07a8bd759b8795952f5c6968190&
12:41 < bridge> <aegisub> üçø
12:44 < bridge> <carmine1985> Thanks for considering my question. Specifying, I would rotate the camera by a variable angle, not the screen orientation.
12:44 < bridge> <carmine1985> Which would be an optimal way to achieve it, using functions and methods already integrated in the current source code?
14:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> üçø
14:21 < bridge> <bombencie> üê¥
14:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait quad transforms doesnt work due to texture mapping
15:15 < bridge> <kebscs> Closed as completed, right? :boo:
15:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, heinrich is totally against that idea, I predicted that based on the fact that he lacked to engage in this convo in the first place, with non other than one of the most influential players in DDNet
15:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> As he said, if a maintainer would like to be interested in having community voting despite a single decision and make a meaningful change, go ahead
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who is the most influential player in ddnet @cellegenrih
15:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nameless tee
15:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Stepfunn, most interestingly
15:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Even tho he just popped up few years ago, he already made a name for himself here and almost everyone knows him pretty much
15:30 < bridge> <totar> @learath2 what would you think of this idea if the the client requests an OTC for the specific address of the server, and then the account server only auths the client if it receives the OTC from the address that the client asked for, thus you can't MITM?
15:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ah, ofc
15:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :nouis:
15:32 < bridge> <totar> @learath2 what would you think of this idea if the the client requests an OTC for the specific address of the game server, and then the account server only auths the client if it receives the OTC from the address that the client asked for, thus you can't MITM?
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> chillerdragon
15:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> most influential 0.7 person
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> I would have to sit down and think about it
19:12 < bridge> <louis> this is different from osrs though, don't the developers of osrs create the polls with the intention of implementing either side? that seems very different from the community of the game creating the actual poll and expecting developers to implement one of the sides
19:24 < bridge> <Skeith> :greenthing:
19:33 < bridge> <totar> the developers of osrs also want to improve their game so they desire to know the opinions of the players :troll:
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> This. We are actively trying to destroy this game. I personally do an evil laugh every night
19:35 < bridge> <manikoo> lerato omg
19:35 < bridge> <Skeith> "Just as a very simple example of where it can go wrong: Imagine a little-used feature wanted by a small minority of players. They'd probably vote yes, the others would ignore the vote. The players voting yes would want the feature implemented then, but this would continuously waste developer time at the expense of the majority who don't care about the feature."
19:35 < bridge> <Skeith> 
19:35 < bridge> <Skeith> There's an option to skip the question in OSRS, skipped votes are omitted btw, if enough people don't care, then it can literally just be ignored
19:36 < bridge> <totar> louis is correct, the polls only work if the developers want to know the answer to the question.
19:36 < bridge> <totar> if you secretly hope they aren't going to pick one option then don't post the poll
19:37 < bridge> <Skeith> Ya
19:37 < bridge> <Skeith> You can quite literally look up all the times the voting system has had "problems" for OSRS
19:38 < bridge> <Skeith> I play OSRS, so I could just TLDR tbh, honestly the main issue is the devs wanting something and the players not wanting it lol
19:39 < bridge> <kebscs> voting would be nice when hein says he doesnt like smth
19:39 < bridge> <Skeith> But is that a problem
19:39 < bridge> <kebscs> then players vote in favor to get a feature in
19:40 < bridge> <kebscs> so we would get more opinions rather than just hein's "I don't think I like this"
19:40 < bridge> <Skeith> or the fact that RS3 players exist on the same subscription, so the 2 communities can somewhat sabotage each other out of spite :greenthing:
19:42 < bridge> <Skeith> Hey man, if we end up ruining the game, at least you nerds can move the fuck on to something else? :troll:
19:43 < bridge> <Skeith> Or we just launch oldschool DDNet
19:43 < bridge> <Skeith> fixed
19:45 < bridge> <Skeith> @learath2 $5 to reopen the post
19:45 < bridge> <Skeith> Honestly not an ideal look for hein once again
19:46 < bridge> <learath2> Ngl he really doesn't seem to be thinking about the PR angle of closing the issue called "Community-wide voting" complaining about how the decision making in this project should be more democratic
19:50 < bridge> <Skeith> Lets add it as a solution to heinrich
19:50 < bridge> <Skeith> seems valid
19:51 < bridge> <melon> having an issue that screams "maintainers just say no and close stuff the community wants" being closed by a single maintainer is
19:51 < bridge> <melon> peak
19:52 < bridge> <Skeith> He feels like he has definitely lost his marbles over the years
19:52 < bridge> <manikoo> chiller maintainer btw
19:53 < bridge> <Skeith> One thing he's not wrong about, other maintainers are too quiet
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not true
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what does that mean?
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> marbles are small balls
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did he lose his balls?
19:54 < bridge> <Skeith> His decision making feels like it's against the game more and more
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you say you know the size of them?
19:54 < bridge> <Skeith> Oh no, he's trolling!
19:54 < bridge> <Skeith> I'd never
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i disagree
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> heinrich never changed a single bit.
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i personally think that is his biggest weakness
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he is smart af, but he cannot adapt
19:55 < bridge> <Skeith> Juppyboy, why didn't you say anything in this post
19:55 < bridge> <melon> the issue wasnt graphic or rust related
19:55 < bridge> <melon> :Shruggo:
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> What do you think my biggest weakness is?
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that you talk but never deliver
19:55 < bridge> <Skeith> True
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> Actual truth
19:56 < bridge> <kebscs> its so rare to see other maintainer than roby and monthly deen release
19:56 < bridge> <Skeith> Learath talks then drinks instead
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we should make Jupstar the BDFL for ddnet ü§î
19:56 < bridge> <Skeith> He just talked back against me, I refuse
19:56 < bridge> <Skeith> :greenthing:
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> You have chiller out there every day
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If I'd be dictator I'd first of all free teeworlds
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so ddnet has compatition again
19:57 < bridge> <Skeith> Fuck a teeworld
19:58 < bridge> <kebscs> but chiller became one very recently
19:58 < bridge> <learath2> I really should start delivering things. I have like 8 projects, so I don't make progress on any of them
19:58 < bridge> <Skeith> If you mean free it from being ddnet's problem, I agree :J
19:58 < bridge> <Skeith> Time to abort the Teeworlds baby
19:59 < bridge> <manikoo> abort :nouis:
19:59 < bridge> <Skeith> nouis is the result of Teeworlds inbreeding, it should've been prevented long ago
20:00 < bridge> <Skeith> sometimes
20:01 < bridge> <Skeith> Aight guys, today we'll actually make meaningful decisions and changes to the game, surely?
20:02 < bridge> <manikoo> if juppy become that thing you said earlier, opengl renderers will be deleted from the game
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've ddnet-rs, i am happy.
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no limitations
20:02 < bridge> <Skeith> ddnet-rs isn't real
20:02 < bridge> <manikoo> no ddnet-rs is disabled ddnet's kid
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine heinrich's potential if he could stop his ideology
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he'd be free and do smart things
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of wasting his time
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am sadly only partially smart
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i have the motivation
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and mindset
20:03 < bridge> <Skeith> If he's so smart, why game bad?
20:03 < bridge> <manikoo> https://tenor.com/view/shia-la-beouf-fire-just-do-it-inspiration-motivation-gif-4214625
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> reasons are stated above
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> exactly
20:03 < bridge> <louis> game seems ok to me
20:03 < bridge> <Skeith> Sounds like a fucking idiot to me
20:03 < bridge> <Skeith> dunno
20:03 < bridge> <louis> Just need anti tas, accounts, more features
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i turn on boss music and be the boss
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is how you win
20:04 < bridge> <manikoo> "just need"
20:04 < bridge> <manikoo> ofc game is perfect
20:04 < bridge> <manikoo> except its bad side of community
20:05 < bridge> <louis> if i was dictator i'd add unlockable skins thru point +rankpoint progression too
20:05 < bridge> <louis> i love clout and cosmetics
20:06 < bridge> <Skeith> Put the coolest cosmetics behind the hardest things so people pay real life money to have other people do it for them
20:06 < bridge> <manikoo> ples no
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> Why lie? You are the vulkanwizard
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I wish I could spent more time on graphics apis, but sadly that is where my mindset ends
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> At this point I'm starting to wonder if I should just issue a bounty for someone to write a teehistorian TAS matcher
20:07 < bridge> <manikoo> vulcan 
20:07 < bridge> <manikoo> archmage
20:07 < bridge> <manikoo> vulcan archmage
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno why but for some reason you cannot just have endless motivation of any project
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ig there are some weird blockers
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never been like 100% at work
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Some people do have the ability to summon infinite motivation. I can't either
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs bcs i think that it's not truely the right thing to do
20:08 < bridge> <Skeith> noby would've had it done, but he's gonezo with irl, which is shocking tbh, how'd noby irl before yall freaks
20:08 < bridge> <manikoo> noby summon needed
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for ddnet-rs i defs would say i had insane motivation
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did like 90% of the code after my full time job
20:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is not even a joke
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> I don't speak street. What does gonezo with irl mean
20:09 < bridge> <Teero> i can do it sometimes. at some point you just don't have any more feature ideas or you get stuck on a bug, so have to pause
20:09 < bridge> <Skeith> gone
20:09 < bridge> <Skeith> he disappeared cause irl
20:09 < bridge> <manikoo> oh man we remembered same person xd
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> I can do it for a max of 1 week. Then I get bored üòÑ
20:09 < bridge> <Skeith> noby's my boy
20:09 < bridge> <Skeith> (not literally)
20:10 < bridge> <manikoo> :justatest:
20:11 < bridge> <Skeith> Honestly it wouldn't be too hard to wipe the current mess that is top5 and just prevent it in the future based on (accounts)
20:11 < bridge> <Skeith> But alas
20:11 < bridge> <Skeith> we're all stupid ig
20:11 < bridge> <louis> explain how you would do it then
20:12 < bridge> <Skeith> I'd manually fucking do it
20:12 < bridge> <Skeith> I've done worse
20:12 < bridge> <Skeith> And I have infinite free time
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> Wanna be the cleanup tsar?
20:12 < bridge> <Skeith> I can clean top5, but top20 is gone
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> Without accounts being there they just reruin the top5 too quickly honestly
20:12 < bridge> <Skeith> I aint touchin that
20:13 < bridge> <Skeith> Ya, make accounts, I wouldn't mind cleaning after
20:13 < bridge> <learath2> Can you find noby and ruin his irl so he comes back?
20:13 < bridge> <melon> reminds me of @teero777
20:13 < bridge> <manikoo> ruin someone's irl for the sake of the our beloved game
20:13 < bridge> <manikoo> sounds perfect
20:14 < bridge> <melon> yep sounds about right
20:14 < bridge> <manikoo> noby might just say no
20:14 < bridge> <manikoo> :feelsbadman:
20:14 < bridge> <manikoo> torture
20:15 < bridge> <Skeith> and afaik, there are other people that would gladly help with this process
20:16 < bridge> <Teero> lol
20:16 < bridge> <melon> AM I WRONG THO?
20:16 < bridge> <melon> you're coding till 4am DAILY for MONTHS now
20:16 < bridge> <melon> yet no accountss
20:16 < bridge> <melon> yet no accounts
20:16 < bridge> <melon> smh
20:16 < bridge> <melon> /s
20:16 < bridge> <Skeith> tsk
20:16 < bridge> <manikoo> ofcourse but only if it will truly help
20:16 < bridge> <Teero> @blaiszephyr no youre not wrong xD
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teero is defs a monster for his age
20:16 < bridge> <Skeith> The help would be being able to look back on the leaderboard with fond memories!
20:17 < bridge> <melon> thats what the raw power of 6gb ram does to you
20:17 < bridge> <Teero> i just dont have a life
20:17 < bridge> <Skeith> I mean, we can just start fresh and not give a fuck, which is what I've been saying for awhile now
20:17 < bridge> <manikoo> yeah, even if there is no me :kek:
20:17 < bridge> <Skeith> We're all dead in 100 years and so is this game
20:18 < bridge> <Skeith> WAHOO
20:18 < bridge> <manikoo> game will be alive as long as we are
20:18 < bridge> <Skeith> I mean, it's been around for quite a long time, and people are still having conversations like this, so it'll be around for awhile ya
20:19 < bridge> <melon> yeah skeith, you're old
20:19 < bridge> <Skeith> no u
20:19 < bridge> <melon> :(
20:19 < bridge> <manikoo> both
20:22 < bridge> <Skeith> The real solution is to remove the admins from their admin role prison, back to moderator they go
20:23 < bridge> <Skeith> Then they'll finally do something!
20:23 < bridge> <manikoo> #derekforadmin
20:23 < bridge> <manikoo> or me admin
20:23 < bridge> <manikoo> i will do nothing
20:23 < bridge> <Skeith> Admin role = retirement
20:23 < bridge> <manikoo> sure
20:24 < bridge> <Skeith> oh, ya you're fit for the role
20:24 < bridge> <manikoo> no im young
20:24 < bridge> <Skeith> louis is like 12
20:24 < bridge> <Skeith> louis is like 18
20:25 < bridge> <louis> False
20:25 < bridge> <Skeith> 19
20:26 < bridge> <Skeith> They grow so fast :feelsbadman:
20:26 < bridge> <louis> also false
20:26 < bridge> <manikoo> that many roles at young age

20:27 < bridge> <manikoo> divide in half
20:27 < bridge> <Skeith> I'm being bullied
20:27 < bridge> <manikoo> no
20:28 < bridge> <Teero> you can hire me
20:28 < bridge> <melon> hi being bullied i'm melon
20:28 < bridge> <totar> maybe if I get enough money and a reason
20:29 < bridge> <Teero> but im a complete retard i forgot that i shifted the map by 200 and thats why i couldnt see the pickups
20:29 < bridge> <totar> but I'd probably have to give you boring tasks compared to what you've been doing
20:29 < bridge> <louis> whats your expected salary
20:29 < bridge> <totar> most programming jobs are pretty boring
20:30 < bridge> <totar> that make money that is
20:30 < bridge> <manikoo> 6-7 ddcoins
20:30 < bridge> <manikoo> per year
20:30 < bridge> <Teero> pickups work in demos yay

20:31 < bridge> <Skeith> Makes me feel gay just lookin at it
20:31 < bridge> <manikoo> and watafak is this
20:31 < bridge> <totar> demo library
20:32 < bridge> <totar> actually this might be the most useful thing you've made so far
20:32 < bridge> <Teero> run_gay_25
20:32 < bridge> <Teero> there isn't any rust lib for it yet so yea it might
20:32 < bridge> <Teero> haha get clapped rust rewriters
20:33 < bridge> <manikoo> i have a large teero-made tas of some big maze
20:33 < bridge> <manikoo> thats treasure
20:33 < bridge> <Teero> xddd
20:33 < bridge> <Teero> what, you have the 50h one?
20:33 < bridge> <manikoo> biggest one
20:33 < bridge> <Teero> i might have posted it somewhere i guess
20:33 < bridge> <manikoo> sure
20:34 < bridge> <Teero> but you should thank tater for that, it's his solver
20:34 < bridge> <manikoo> couple
20:34 < bridge> <Teero> i only made the map and some extensions for it so it would work
20:34 < bridge> <totar> you provided critically important motiviation
20:34 < bridge> <Teero> XDDD
20:34 < bridge> <totar> I'm so serious
20:35 < bridge> <melon> his car simulation is good
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> give it one woman and his interest in tryharding the whole day is gone üòè
20:35 < bridge> <melon> teero should add modules
20:35 < bridge> <melon> so i can add my car's specs
20:35 < bridge> <melon> so i can add my cars specs
20:36 < bridge> <melon> bold of you to assume it requires a woman, @imilchshake should be enough
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah, didn't want to assume anything @teero777
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all of the homo
20:37 < bridge> <Teero> @totar btw this is what i meant before. i couldnt find a video

20:38 < bridge> <totar> nice
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> flash games from 2001
20:38 < bridge> <totar> no he did this irl
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> no, irl
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> nah i was describing a crash
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> but hard to describe in vc
20:38 < bridge> <Teero> i ran into a segfault
20:38 < bridge> <Skeith> Max confusion, time to add bikes to ddnet
20:39 < bridge> <Skeith> hein somehow f3s
20:39 < bridge> <Teero> XD
20:39 < bridge> <manikoo> headshot made some physics
20:40 < bridge> <Teero> @totar btw do you know what shader the AAA games use to load in assets on the fly? they dont just appear is a like a checkerboard appear animation
20:40 < bridge> <totar> what?
20:40 < bridge> <Teero> @totar btw do you know what shader the AAA games use to load in assets on the fly? they dont just appear, it's a like a checkerboard appear animation
20:40 < bridge> <totar> I think that's just a unreal engine thing
20:40 < bridge> <Teero> okay
20:40 < bridge> <totar> I think that's just an unreal engine thing
20:40 < bridge> <totar> the dithering thing
20:40 < bridge> <totar> I know the one
20:40 < bridge> <Teero> yea
20:41 < bridge> <totar> it's so they can do transparency in a lazy way
20:41 < bridge> <Teero> i dont like the font
20:42 < bridge> <Teero> maybe some semi bold will do
20:44 < bridge> <Teero> yea that looks ok

22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @thekid36 your moment to shine
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> I do know some Italian, but we have actual Italians here that can handle this üòõ
23:21 < bridge> <vahemaaa> great idea heinric
23:25 < bridge> <Teero> im so stupid. i was wondering why specifically the gun shooting sound wasn't playing in demos that i generated.... i had gun sounds turned off in the settings

23:26 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> IDFK WHAT TO PUT IN THERE
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm interested in server list. Did you ever create a concept for that?
23:27 < bridge> <Teero> don't its a window
23:27 < bridge> <imilchshake> hide a small smiley! :)
23:27 < bridge> <Teero> @jupeyy_keks go make that ui, now
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not today
23:27 < bridge> <Teero> that is what they always say
23:27 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> not yet
23:27 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> aye aye captain, I'll work on it rn ü´°

23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This weekend i want to tackle some short comings
23:28 < bridge> <Teero> i didn't know you were doing any fight sports
23:28 < bridge> <Teero> vs. children seems unfair though
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't fight against you
23:29 < bridge> <Teero> @jupeyy_keks open this demo
23:29 < bridge> <Teero> it will lock away your computer
23:30 < bridge> <Teero> the thing is the gun sound WAS played, but only once when the demo started. this is probably a demo viewer bug, not sure. if anyone wants to investigate
23:31 < bridge> <Teero> to reproduce open this demo with gun sounds turned off
23:31 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> :nouis:
23:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ok I fixed the empty space
23:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1172868875273117726/1431032484849647697/image.png?ex=68fbf05b&is=68fa9edb&hm=48016a12e63edc44c1a62a8ce0a0b8017433db395762a9389739000a38d959e8&
23:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> what do we think chat
23:32 < bridge> <Teero> also i think its a weird thing that your hearing range doesn't increase with zooming
23:32 < bridge> <Teero> epic
23:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @louis.place do u approve
23:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> oh right "dont ping admins for silly stuff" mb mb mb i forgot
23:33 < bridge> <Teero> make it DDRust netowkr
23:33 < bridge> <Teero> make it DDRust network
23:33 < bridge> <Skeith> dw, louis is a troll he deserves it
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I mean it is certainly ddnet-rs soo
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> talking about trolls
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hi skeith!!
23:34 < bridge> <Skeith> Sup!
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hyd?
23:34 < bridge> <Skeith> Doin, wbu
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> kawl
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I'm doing good I think
23:34 < bridge> <Teero> @blazulite are you good with UX?
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I'm bored af lmao
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I... think?
23:34 < bridge> <Teero> cool xd
23:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I try my best ü´†
23:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I'm not that good at it but
23:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hey I try xd
23:35 < bridge> <louis> the map image should be under the (i) Map instead of on the ranking
23:35 < bridge> <louis> and the ranking could have trophies or maybe a pedestal for top3 with player skins
23:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that actually makes a lot of sense
23:35 < bridge> <louis> but very cool very cool
23:36 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> could you make a little drawing of what you mean or smth? I can't really imagine it honestly x9
23:36 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> could you make a little drawing of what you mean or smth? I can't really imagine it honestly x)
23:36 < bridge> <louis> (also if u have dropdown for country instead of displaying a scrollable list i think u could fit in more space or just make it looked less cramped)
23:36 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yeah
23:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I was thinking in adding a chevron on the Country filter it actually
23:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> kinda like this

23:38 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> you're a genius mr louis
23:38 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hope u get a raiseüíØ
23:50 < bridge> <01000111g> 6Kopf
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> i have big ui/ux problems, everything is ugly.
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> i don't think imgui can be much prettier though
23:53 < bridge> <Teero> so it's okay
