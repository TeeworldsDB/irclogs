02:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> LOL
02:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since when can we click on the images on ddnet.tw/releases to get a map preview?!
02:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since a long time
03:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> @TcTc you can probably bind the remote console via config, idk if you can type in it without a keyboard tho
04:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hey guys
04:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> sorry for stupid questions
04:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can someone help me to make tune (for example gravity) for only one player?
04:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> every player have his gravity
04:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> he can type /gravity and number what he wanna
04:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> @fokkonaut congrats 😅
05:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> apparently that breaks prediction
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Leaving for like a week
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll stick to bug fixes after I get back, large features are just not fun to develop
11:32 <@deen> Where are you going?
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are there any tools out to combine race record files? you know the text files.
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon can you upload a sample file?
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good old classic score files
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fokkonaut

12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
12:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sorri irc
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gimme two of the files I'll write a tool to merge them
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea its not too hard but i wanted to make sure i dont revent the wheel and introduce bugs but if u want to do it thats nice
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it seems like i lost my one file tho xd i wonder when the server creates these
12:06 <+Learath2> deen: 2-3 day trip to a nearby city
12:06 <+Learath2> will probably stay a week tho, I always say 2-3 days before going, then friends convince me to stay longer :D
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> have fun there
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😄
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> \:D
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hf gl @Learath2
12:08 <+Learath2> we have guests home, they have kids, kids are watching cartoons, kids cartoons are the stupidest most annoying thing ever
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ur crazy
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> its the best thing ever
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they make me feel weird
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >its the best thing ever
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> really depends
12:11 <+Learath2> i'm not talking about cartoons for young ppls, this is literally toddler stuff
12:11 <+Learath2> repeating phrases 50 times kinda stuff
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 the 0's are checkpoint times btw, just in case you didnt know that
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, figured
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon if you don't give me two files to merge, I can't write a script
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 im struggeling to find the file which should be created by the runniung server seems like its not there
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon currentpath/records/ xd
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is no record dir
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i deleted it xd
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dfq
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991  https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP-data/tree/master/backup_records
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> go on server and write /top5
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are there
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then there is a file
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check everything @ChillerDragon
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when is this file cretaed?
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i deleted the folder after server launch
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon sv_score_folder
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye its records
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Finish once more
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess the folder is created on server launch and the file on finish
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, the file is always there
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it will write into it while running
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy i was right so i created the folder and then finished
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> y

12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i was just asking if there is a tool. I really could hack sonething together my self or even do it manually but if you want to create it it would be awesome. I can imagine it can be usefull in the future too 😃
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon change profile picture
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its crazy how unsopportive the people are regaring LGBTQP27829 and all the other stuff. They even censored a youtube video on kog i posted  that was made by gays lol
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont get it. So much hate without reasons.
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> dfk
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont hate, just its not June anymore
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what about june?
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (which I think was the reason you did it)
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh no im not that much into it
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk what was in jhune?
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you should rather tell @onbgy that winter is over since 2 years xd
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Pride month
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye no
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably yt algo turned me into a lgbt supporter during that month so thats how that happend
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/22414 😄
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just seen yesterday
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxD
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well fokko failed
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lez ban fokko for being anti lgbtq :banhammer:
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wat
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it makes sense because people stop being gay after 1 month. then they are cured.
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon if it was 3 weeks after christmas i would also say change pic if you have a Christmas hat on that pic
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing about me being anti lgbtq
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> jeez im trollin
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it is 3 years after christmas and onbgy still has his winter pfp
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki send me github pro my github is full xd
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (you can also use gitlab which has unlimited private repos IIRC)
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github pro is monthly payment huh? So if i stop paying all my repos get deleted if they are to big and made public if they were pprivate? xd
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have a public repo
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on github and its full
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean, full?
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github has also unlimited private repos
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> github is not your personal backup service 😄
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and gitlab is actually unusable for me because i cant survive on their site more than 20 seconds without rage quitting due to their design
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i spend 20 hrs starring at my github a day
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 LMAO xDDDd
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is @heinrich5991
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> gitlab is gud
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how should i backup and sync my tw data then?
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> USB Stick, like me lol
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have my configs and setting on a usb
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm not very backed up
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> gitlab private repos are free
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and you have to carry it around all the time
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github too @archimede67
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> no
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> gitlab is good
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon google drive, 15Gb free
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> because private repos yeah
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> they are not
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> no
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there was a change some time back
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @archimede67
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> rly
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTSEQ/203d6fc33c.png
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @ChillerDragon u dont even need to look at their design, from command line it functions exactly the same i think
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :p
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> …
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> when
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> last time i wanted to create a project it was still disabled
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTSFu/f8a3f8f318.png
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt pay
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon wtf you really use github as a drive
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but i know that if you have student developer pack u have them free
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes @fokkonaut  and it exhausting
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because github clning hangs up all the time
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @archimede67 https://github.com/pricing
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unlimited private repositories (under free)
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye so it has been changed
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but 1gb limited organisations
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's what I said
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess i need 3 organisations to backup my cutted demos xd
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> get enterprise
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what you need
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but what if i stop paying
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what happens then
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what should happen
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> remove my stuff
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i cant afford this for ever
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and also they dont advertise mroe storage
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just use a fucking drive
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or cloud
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> clouds suck
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can u even host git repos on clouds?
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you had a vps somewhere, right?
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but if that vps dies i loose my data
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could simply use that as a git server
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats not an option
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not? it's a backup, right?
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if github loses your data, you also lose it
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes a backup if my pc dies and my vps dies
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github doesnt loose it
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> just buy an external hd
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hard drive
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and where should i put it?
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and how do i sync to it from all over the world
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cant
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> u dont
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> thats why its secure
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have to tho
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> noone can access it
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i play tw in zimbabwe airport i want to sync my demos and maps and settings and screenshots
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> google drive
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol chiller u nobo
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 15Gb
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ima create a new org i guess
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :think_bot:
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 15 orgs on github is 15 gb
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1 acc in google is 15 gb
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yeah google drive
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> encrypt them before u upload if ur paranoid
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, maybe google will fake you in tw otherwise
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or save your settings on your phone xd then you have it with you
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Or make an cloudserver from your external harddrive
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i make my data public no need to encrypt it @onbgy and im sure goodle decrypts it anyways
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> crypto is secure against google
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did you find that out by googling it? :troll:
12:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe for now but they store it until quantum age and then they crack it
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the NSA you're talking about
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and quantum computing does nothing for symmetric ciphers as far as I'm aware
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yet
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK, this is not how it works
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quantum computers are modelled in theoretical informatics and those models tell you that it doesn't help for symmetric ciphers
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's even people doing post-quantum cryptography based on these models
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 why is it securr against google?
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the universe doesn't have enough resources to crack the encryption, according to our current knowledge
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which encryption?
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and how to decrypt it the
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then*
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> key
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut with the key
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought most common encryptions can be broken with money and time?
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be much easier to go to @ChillerDragon's house with a wrench and ask him for the actual files https://www.xkcd.com/538/
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> lmao
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon no. not AES with a secret key
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wasnt aes the worst? xd
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like worse than md5
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i know like 0 baut crypto i guess
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon google for `-1`
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a 1
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AES is a state of the art algorithm and is used to encrypt all your browser traffic, banking stuff, etc.
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont like that my passwords are showing up in htop is this fine? @heinrich5991
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i start a programm with -password and -login flag
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, then everyone on your computer can see them
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you shouldn't do that
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wonder if they have a config file
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but cant like everyone see my config gfiles either?
12:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> here, go use 2 billion us dollar to crack the bitcoin signatures
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt it more effective to go for all wallets at once than only one?
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go ahead, collect even more than 2 billion us dollar
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its just luck i can run it on my vps i pay anyways and pay 0
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what I want to say: apparently the cost of breaking whatever bitcoin uses is above 2 billion us dollar
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what are they using?
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2b in the worst case or average?
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> some elliptic curve stuff IIRC
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because in the best case it is first try luck xd
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon go buy some lottery passes
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no they cost money
13:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but in the best case you'll be a millionaire
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i could loose money
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. IMO the best case is irrelevant
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're losing money right now
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why aren't you utilizing your VPS completely?
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTT0y/631b7c73a7.png
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is a lill puffer left for more actvity on my servers
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTT4F/d01c9db897.png
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bro xd
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon aes worse than md5... do u live in a cave
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems like
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon btw is ur linux encrypted
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have arch on lvm on luks
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ezpz
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait its gnu/linux
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is my linux? you mean my vps or devices at home. Nah but anyways i have nothing encrypted
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its useless anyways :p
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if fbi comes to m house they will have to beat me to tell them the pass
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i saw many talks that gave me the feeling that the only person im locking out is me
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you want to get beaten ?
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont let the fbi in :p
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont let the talks make u dumb, encryption is always good
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> fbi will never come to your house
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not too sure
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> np problem
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> no problem
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and if you dont leave your devices unattende dtoo long all fine
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> encryption is good
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have to admint i left my laptops unattended at public paces for multiple minutes... but still
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it literally has no cost to have my drives encrypted
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i dont have to type a login password, just the encrypt password
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its annoying when u forget pw tho
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i am not as dumb as u sry
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :c
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> then dont forget the pw
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/b6d9a0379fb0f15ad6aba4e4695e14f6 report bugs
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh only a gist
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and even secret
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i will test it later thanks @heinrich5991
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you should make it public tho 😃
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon it's public by the link
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> aes and md5 don't even do the same thing, why are you comparing them in the first place?
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news, I think I'm staying, feel horribly sick
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont even know how one can get a "cold" in such hot weather
14:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_cold&oldid=904715499#Weather
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Never really though about it, but yes the temperature itself is probably only a factor
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the gist is that the weather only affects how likely you're to catch a cold, it's still a normal disease
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the name cold is what throws people off
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You kinda assume its because of the cold
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup
14:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> refactoring out components in reactjs is a new pleasure i found
14:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> after using it more, I've concluded the half assed c++ operator sugar is worse then them having non-opaque json_values
14:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> react :eart:
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> react ❤
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki yeah moving things into their own components is really pleasurable
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :frozen:
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> one big component it better :troll:
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't go too deep to oop-valley though, or you will end up like the other loonies who think encapsulation is > everything and singleton patterns are evil
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> (App component :justatest: )
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 my entire react apps usually consist of a single arrow function just to make people cry
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no but i had half file of code that had to be a compoennt 100%
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 perfectly nice 👌
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this json library passes out allocated json_value structs
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but their c++ "operator sugar" only operates on json_value's not pointers to json values
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so to use the c++ helpers you either need *s everywhere or an ugly copy
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think `operator[]` passes out references
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it doesn't operate on references
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> … so?
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you end up with things like `(*Data)["name"]` everywhere
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why not `const json_value& Data = MoreData["data"]`?
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know what the semantics of that would be off the top of my head
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like a pointer
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except without the `*`
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and how do I get the pointer back out when I need to free it? is it's address equal to the initial pointer?
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need to free it
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just a reference to the inner of `MoeData`
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> json_parse also gives out `json_value *`s
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I'm sure C89 didn't have magic destructors
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's the one thing you need to free
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but other than that, you can just operate on references to the large object
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> :justatest: 
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```js
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ABC.I18n = path => {
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67>     return moduleID => {
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67>         return (core, args, lang) => {
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67>             return core.i18n.get(path, args, lang, moduleID);
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67>         };
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67>     };
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> };
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `json_value *j = json_parse(buf); const json_value &Data = j;` Do I need to keep around the j, or does the address of the reference compare equal?
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> checked the standard, they are equal
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good question. I'd guess equal
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but I didn't know)
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that you need `const json_value &Data = *j;` (check for `NULL` on parse failure first I guess)
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can't really set a reference equal to a pointer
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm?
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, references take T not T*
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they take an lvalue reference I guess 😛
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to T
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'll forgive this shortcoming, I still don't like it
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should write my own json parser sometime, would be a nice exercise
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I definitely shouldn't have rolled my own serialization and deserialization in python
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> python ppl of #developer and #ddnet, what do you use for serializing your objects?
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bash
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> os.system()
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> os.system can't serialize anything
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> jq
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> python objects don't export well to stdout
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you ever not troll around?
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ovverwrite __str__ then
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 i don't
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm perfectly capable of rolling my own @ChillerDragon
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 do you even python?
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no he is js
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i did pacman in python
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> for my school xd
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i learned latin for my school
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is ur school so nice
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> where ever1 else was struggling with finding a maze's path
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> every1*
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well if you haven't serialized anything in python, you are definitely not the intended respondant for my question
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> a* is simple enough for path finding
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> that's why i said "i don't" :GWmythiBlobCool:
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye but
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the answer is "I don't", it's not really an answer to my question, right?
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> we needed to make our own alorithm
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> omg algorithm*
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 hug the right wall 😛
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> the shortest
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or "accidentally" roll a*
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> "oh my god, i didn't even know what it was called lol"
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 30 lines done
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😂
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, the likeliest one you'd roll by accident would be djikstra i guess
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> yep
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there a secure random function that generates a random string?
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> generate_password looked like it might do what I want, but it seems to do some, uhm weird things? 😛
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 good ol unicode
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTVK0/865a6e3452.png
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use openssl in my bash scripts :p
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> `''.join(random.choices('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', k=n))`
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> after 18 hours of messing around with unicode to get windows console to print proper unicode, I have become a certified expert in unicodez
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh tahts nice
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fix heinrichs script then thanks
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao inside ddnet code tho 😛
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> idk ddnet code
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont we have this random thing generator
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for timeoutcodes etc
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> after 18 hours of messing around with it I've learned that windows command prompt isn't even unicode compliant
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't even try to be, it's UCS2...
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only care about linux tho @Learath2
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh we do use one for timeout codes, let me check that
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was actually helpfull :troll:
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `secure_random_password` is a thing apparently
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm surprised heinrich didn't generalize that to a `secure_random_string` that takes a `const char *alphabet` 😛
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unicodez
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> unicode is a total mess tbh
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no single piece of software renders any text consistently anymore 😦
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are like a million characters that look exactly the same
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is there something like mapping in python?
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can i call a str method on each item of a list for example?
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> map()
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty i used a for loop already xd
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTWa1/db69109141.png
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i cant get ur script to support unicode @heinrich5991 :c
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> time to rewrite in bash..
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/b6d9a0379fb0f15ad6aba4e4695e14f6#file-cat_records-py-L48
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> change this to ` with open(db, encoding='utf-8') as f:`
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> adn then you get the result i posted
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the output is escaped somewhy
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i escaped it
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xf6' in position 4: ordinal not in range(128)
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i get a encode error otherwise
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you escape it, then expect correct output? 😧
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> python is so complicated
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> back to os.system()
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Encode the string properly?
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> why using python then
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy shell best
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> heinrich was so kind and provided me this nice script so i used that
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> rewrite in lolcode KTHXBYE
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sadly its python
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTWhz/0dbcebcc9f.png
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon can I have ur files? I wanna try
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> look at this native unicode support
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Youll also need to output the string raw
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no problemnmos whta so ever

16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sth like `sys.stdout.buffer.write(text.encode('utf-8')`
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its unicode, no language supports unicode nicely
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bash does
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bash barely cares about unicode at all
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon works fine for me
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hacker
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what os are u on jao?
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> win10
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im deb9
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides bash is barely a language
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol are you on a utf8 locale?
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wat dis?
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to do this on windows :c
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Show output of `locale`
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao>

16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how thats the conclusion you come to @ChillerDragon

16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I'm quite lazy myself, but srsly, I've never seen someone at your level
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 😃
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you considered setting up your computer properly?
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk how
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what to setup there
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for me setup mostly ends in mess up
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon on deb9 it's the same for me
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont even know how you fucked that up, the debian-installer literally asks u to configure the locale
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also works?
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yes
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> same output
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its fresh os
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i destroyed my vps a few days ago
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> messed up sys libs
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my hoster had to wipe out everything xd
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you put a rock on the enter key while installing?
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what python version
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> lmao
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt install it my self
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 3.5.3
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I have 3.7
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `dpkg-reconfigure locales`
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i also have 3.7 i think compiled from soruce
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pick en us utf8 one
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> command not found
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> with sudo
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTWqY/26f883d18c.png
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do computers work?
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess thats mb, should have put a # at the beginning
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DTWse/e3c38d42c9.png
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dat one?
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ye
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm locale didnt change
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> did u generate them
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to run update-locale
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then probably relog
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it was sth like update-locale LANG=en_US.utf8
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But dont know for sure, check the help :P
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also show `locale -a`
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 "Besides bash is barely a language" are u an enemy of stallman
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😡
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i ddint expect u to support bash lol @Ryozuki
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the church of emacs will exorcize you learath
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't take such black and white positions, I'm sure neither does stallman
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 python and rust handle unicode quite nicely
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see you found `secure_random_password` already
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 even if the language has nice support for it, peoples lack of understanding of unicode usually breaks things
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that might be more like it
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but python and rust both try to be helpful in that regard
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> making it easier to write correct code
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's overall not nice to work with unicode most of the time
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wrt. unicode
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idc tbh
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like that I can type japanese characters in most applications nowadays and it just works™
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking at you, teeworlds
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well rendering them out isnt too too hard
16:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problems start when you want to work with japanese text
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like tokenizing on a certain japanese character
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or modifying the skin color of an emoji :P
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> works perfectly fine in rust and python
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the first one
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh it worked thanks a lot @Learath2  and @heinrich5991
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> skin color emoji is something I haven't looked into yet
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon what worked?
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> record cat
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with utf8
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah 🙂
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 your script didnt work for him because he didnt have his locale set
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because he had a broken environment? 😛
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well is it really "broken" per se?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you expect programs to use utf-8, yes
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have to have a locale set?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well POSIX is a locale
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ env | grep -E '(LC|LANG)'
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LANG=C
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, one that doesn't support utf-8
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> My locales are also set up weirdly, I never really looked into what the different locales do
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just set my lang en us utf8
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that works
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you supposed to set lang tho? I think i remember reading somewhere that when you ssh in the client is supposed to export that
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think setting lang is the standard way to set the locale
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Locale&oldid=568013#Setting_the_system_locale
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyways, I have servers registering and clients displaying them
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll merge the ipv6 and ipv4 entries on the master and put up a pr so people can review it
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont like working blindly then having people tell me to essentially rewrite it
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm probably a huge part of that problem, sorry
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd be quite okay with it if you'd give me occasional feedback while I'm writing it
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But just knowing that you'll have me rewrite 3/4ths of it a day after I finish it really just kills my motivation
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't know how to fix this 😦 )
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh in other news, I've decided to make a 8 or 16 bit computer on a couple breadboards
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well you could try not ignoring it when I ask you to take a look along the way
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 Von Neumann ?
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do make it a habit to ask a lot of people while I'm still coding things, just to make sure what I'm working on is agreed on by a lot of people
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath writting the bible
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki well I dont really remember the von neumann architecture, but I was thinking sth like SAP1
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess SAP1 is a von neumann architecture
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of sap1
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its an architecture from a textbook
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really something that was ever used
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But a lot of people make homemade computers based on it
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 how do you feel about me possibly suggesting changes to a PR of yours with a PR to your branch?
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that'd be fine, if your pr is also green
17:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But who fixes it is rarely the issue as long as the suggestions dont really require too much work
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> The Teeworlds Machine Learning Project was hardly a success unfortunately. My first approach of training on human input turned out to be basically plain wrong. I looked into reinforcement learning algorithms after that (you know, the stuff that plays chess, go, atari and dota). I implemented the A2C algorithm which is pretty much state of the art (and could be combined with pre t <message clipped>
17:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for publishing negative results!
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> though no chance to fight the hype, you could publish as many negative results as you wanted
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very interesting
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll surely take a look soon, I was also planning on reincarnating my project to have a ml algorithm play gores
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> It's funny how you stumble upon "encouraging" articles like those even when just researching the topic (I still believed it could work then and didn't search for answers why it didn't work) https://himanshusahni.github.io/2018/02/23/reinforcement-learning-never-worked.html https://thegradient.pub/why-rl-is-flawed/ https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html
17:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 theres basically no documentation so feel free to ask me, I'll explain the basic idea+structure if you like
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @timakro "There might be a bug" xd
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Machine learning is very prone to bugs you don't notice. Everything runs, it even trains and maybe even learns something but the performance is worse
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> :/
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> very interesting project, yes. did you use an image of the surroundings/vision as input like in the first video?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i know ur a inner weeb
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601101175621681172/cvnu49qslva31.png
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :D
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me show you the saddest thing I've seen in a decade

19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> lol
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :P
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> r/programmerhumor is nice
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> r/programmingcirclejerk
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll change the registering logic before I pr this, I need to handle masters not responding better
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <₴Noob~> C++ forever ♥
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @₴Noob~ gay
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <₴Noob~> No u
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <₴Noob~> @FluffiexD bomb + gay = bombgay 🤔
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> true
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i know that json api pr somehow @Learath2 i could swear i actually saw it on github or is it only a meme?
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon wym?
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the kawaii pr
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where did u get that from
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it looks so familiar
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if it's a meme tbh, I just saw it on some other discord
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did we change between 12.1 and 12.5?
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3b1b is really fun to watch, gives a lot of intuition to subjects that are very abstract
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the last one about `exp(i * \pi)` was cool
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You did kinda have to overlook certain technicalities for it to be correct, but it's still a great way to look at it
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon can you give #1827 a try? It works fine on my computer, but I want to make sure
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i usually go to the apple store to test mac libs stuff to make sure it works fine on clean fresh new devices
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i can check if it still works and compiles on my machine tomorrow which is very likley
