15:12 <+o_be_two> hello
15:12 <+o_be_two> db is useful on ddnet to store times only or there is other utilitys ?
15:13 <@deen> o_be_two: hi
15:14 <@deen> db stores times, connection between teams, points, info about maps, saves
15:14 <+o_be_two> oh nice
15:14 <+o_be_two> and map rotation/vote no ? i remember about that now
15:14 <@deen> and checkpoint times of a race if the map has checkpoints
15:14 <@deen> map rotation/vote no?
15:15 <@deen> (don't understand that sentence)
15:16 <+o_be_two> oh no problem, i mean theres server config with add_vote, is it stored in db ?
15:17 <@deen> nope
15:17 <@deen> that's created with a python script from a list of maps in git
15:17 <+o_be_two> oh ok
15:19 <@deen> if you do /map to call for a map it checks the database to find the best guess
15:20 <+o_be_two> oh, awesome :o !
