01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 could you look at / merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/pull/25 please?
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it seems the easiest way to fix this particular problem would be to move the SnapFindItem method into the snapshot class and do the reverse lookup from the external type to the internal type and then compare each snapshot object with the internal type
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (the current fix doesn't work if you look for extended snapshot objects)
03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree that in the long term, a hashmap of ((typeid, id) -> offset) in the snapshot would be nice, this doesn't break iteration because it's just an additional offset map
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the approach in the PR works for vanilla types, which are the only ones we search for anyway(?)
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it breaks down if you search for extended net objects
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with pr you mean https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4300 ?
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you explain why it breaks it?
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, it doesn't fix the problem if you search for extended net objects
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does fix the problem if you search for vanilla net objects
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (i.e. it doesn't break anything, it fixes half of the things (and maybe all of the things we care about?))
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah its there to minize the uuid lookup, currently only ddnet\_projectiles is the only one that uses snapfinditem and is uuid
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the approach mentioned above works the same on non-extended net objects and has similar performance for extended ones (AFAICT)
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. translate the external type into the internal snapshot type (which is a no-op for vanilla snapshot types, and a one-time search for extended snapshot types)
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think the best would be to split the keys and have too snapfinditem branches
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the mapping is also only useful for uuid items
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> two\* xd
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which mapping?
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah i agree the mapping could be useful
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and generally having binary search too
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mapping from external type to snapshot type
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or extended typ to external type to be precise
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this approach doesn't need said mapping
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least not in an efficient way
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's an optimization. instead of looking up the external type of each item, it translates the external type we're looking for into the internal type so each item type comparison is a cheap integer comparison
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah

10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Windows 11 can run linux version of ddnet now
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> mouse doesn't work tho
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heh, that's cool
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Didn't know WSL supports X11
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ye it just did
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> it is gpu accelerated too apparently
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/906118099789574194/unknown.png
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> WSL runs graphical applications in Weston with an RDP backend
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> It sounds like a horrible idea but apparently it works well enough
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I think 15.6 wasn't pushed on Steam yet? Running without beta only gives me 15.5.4
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think its rc only rn
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, I reverted it since there were bugs
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm waiting for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4300 and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4301 forthe release
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I'll try to hotfix pnglite later today or tomorrow, but I don't mind if someone else wants to give it a try. Should be pretty straightforward ðŸ™‚
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I'll try to hotfix pnglite usage later today or tomorrow, but I don't mind if someone else wants to give it a try. Should be pretty straightforward ðŸ™‚
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.ncameron.org/rfcs/3123.html
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they added this on nightly rust
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 a list with all the tiles with a direction is here https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/master/src/bin/check_ddnet.rs#L100
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 if you want to approach this: would you rather do it in python or rust?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't like the way the github bot looks when I add a new tag
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rust ofc, may god never leave anyone in a situation where they are forced to use python
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath said it
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can filter tags if you want
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but leave master on
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and maybe stagging
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I never tag on master
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah its just for tags
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, actually I doubt it's the tag causing the message, isn't it more likely the branch?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i meant for when it shows new commits
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows new commits for x branch
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just filter for master and stagging
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, you don't branch for rc's
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> staging*
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, where do you tag these @deen ? ðŸ˜„
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe the fault is that I tag them both in my fork and on upstream
