02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> btw what are these country codes?
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> ```    '901': 'XEN',
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak>     '902': 'XN1',
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak>     '903': 'XSC',
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak>     '904': 'XWA',
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak>     '905': 'XEU',
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak>     '906': 'Catalan',```
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 906 was catalan apparently, else I can't find anything except for the code for it in the ddnet repo
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> nvm
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> k in case anyone needs it 
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> https://github.com/DaRealFreak/Teeworlds-ServerInfo
08:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1349: Don't ignore CONNECT packets with data that we don't know (master...pr_ddnet_dont_ignore_unknown_connect) https://git.io/fxRuz
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @DaRealFreak nice i will try to get it running c:
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ so desperately needs iterators ðŸ˜›
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/ ? or what u mean
16:02 <+Learath2> those are for STL types, I mean custom ones like in python and nim
16:02 <+Learath2> with the yield keyword
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yeah that would be cool
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReT> @Helper https://i.imgur.com/9zu0AzD.png
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReT> i rly refresh idk
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 my cmake-fu is pretty weak, how do we do optional dependencies?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to add in libnotify
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What would be the best way to create Server-Portals (tiles that move you from server a to server b with saving all player and character vars)?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no best way, it's a security issue
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how did BW do it?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably not actually switching servers
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you mean running multiple maps on one server?
17:21 <+Learath2> yeah, probably, you need client support for actual server switching
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> finally removed @Just a fish the evil ban mod
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> !!
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> finally
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but lot to do still
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there were never consquences for his excessive random banning i think
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo @Ryozuki look someppl i need help with naming a function xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh an plx no take me mod
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wont join a tw server until december
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon why :feelsbadman:
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no device that runs teeworlds with an acceptable user expeirence that is mobile. And i am not at home till december @n000b .-.
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Damm
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> HMMM :c
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I would have the same problem then
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> me2 with travelling around german
19:20 <+Learath2> Python is such a meh language for backend engineering, why do people keep using it?
19:20 <+Learath2> Django is like the most bloat I've seen in a long while and I've worked with angular on the frontend
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also found django to be to complicated
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like flask tho
19:57 <+breton> django is cool for generic tasks
19:57 <+breton> flask is cool for non-generic tasks
19:57 <+breton> ez
19:59 <+Learath2> I used Hug for a couple things, that's pretty cool. Flask atleast is readable. But tbh I think I'd rather use PHP
20:00 <+Learath2> Maybe I should give ruby on rails a look
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> It only displays how many friends are on the servers, is this some sort of new feature? I can't find any way in settings to disable it and show how many people are on the server in general
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/501100095471616010/unknown.png
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie is this on the github build?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> No, just the newest client update
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 11.4.4
20:37 <+Learath2> Hmm, doesn't happen for me
20:37 <+Learath2> I don't really know a setting that does it either
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Seems like something somebody could add because it filters only friends but either way I would prefer to see it the "old way"
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> br_filter_friends 0?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> i think that just checks the "friends only" option in browser?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> actually with it off its normal but not seeing how full the servers are when searching for friends is a little bit annoying
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> copy all your friend data on Masters.cfg in appdata, after that delete and done
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and after that delete the copy :troll::troll::troll:
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> @Learath2  since it's easily available on every platform, is easily scalable, requires less code than most other languages, is easily extendable by other languages and is also really fast for mathematical functions even though it's an interpreter language
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> go  also has most of these points, that's why f.e. google is slowly migrating from python to go
21:54 <+Learath2> agreed, disagreed, depends, agreed, what does that have to do with most backends?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @heinrich5991 0.7 version will be up on steam too?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> well only worked with django once few years ago so not too sure but I'd just say that people like to write less code while still having few good points of the language to count on
23:40 <+breton> oh the joy of being ddosed :3
