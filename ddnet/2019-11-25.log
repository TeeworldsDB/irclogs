01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think the best way to learn to code is to make programs to solve your most basic issues
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for example i started making programs to do my homework
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never rly finished a programming book
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i only tried to start reading a c++ book
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> books are old fashioned
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> internet is ur best friend
01:24 <+Learath2> Oh, so you are a skiddy? copypastemaster?
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what
01:25 <+Learath2> Can you even a hashmap without std::list?
01:25 <+Learath2> I bet you'd even use std::map directly
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made my own double linked list in C its nothing complicated
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh im avoiding c++ totally lately
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i enjoy C lot more
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> skiddo
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> books are overrated
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you want to implement a hashmap? go to wikipedia to know how they work, then program it
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no need to spend 50â‚¬ on a shit book
01:27 <+Learath2> 50M? 50 Million what?
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what are u talking about
01:28 <+Learath2> Oh, stupid terminal can't do euro signs
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never said 50M
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fix ur shit terminal
01:28 <+Learath2> Who pays for books anyways?
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol lea drunk?
01:28 <+Learath2> A book is the only proper way to learn C or you end up like the dimwits I see every day over in ##C that ask stupid ass questions
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nope
01:29 <+Learath2> a += a++; help, why is my code not work?
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt know u were that old fashioned
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> expected more from you
01:30 <+Learath2> If you are learning C, you learn from a book. If you want to learn whatever newfangled language you want, go ahead and learn it from whatever indian youtuber you want to learn from
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nope
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i cant even afford a book sir
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> I MEAN M'LADY
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never watched a indian yt i never read a c book
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are rly closed minded my god
01:31 <+Learath2> The nature of undefined behaviour makes C a venus flytrap for beginners that know no better
01:31 <+Learath2> I've spent dozens of hours helping people who refuse to read a book and just bang their heads against C for hours
01:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well you havent met me then
01:32 <+Learath2> Exceptions don't change the rule
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe u are rly into ur own circlejerk of book ppl
01:32 <+Learath2> Besides, I don't know if you pass rigor anyway.
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not open to other ways
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know if you pass rigor
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> lea drunk
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly
01:32 <+Learath2> @Ryozuki no offense but I literally spend atleast 2-3 hours a day helping people with their C problems
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol no offense not my problem ur mad about helping ppl 3 hours a day
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like i would care
01:33 <+Learath2> I've seen more of a sample size then you is my point
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well that's somewhat helpful for them, but not about your healthiness
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure ur own circlejerk
01:33 <+Learath2> You keep telling me i'm close minded. I've seen more then you
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah ur rly close minded
01:34 <+Learath2> Fine @Ryozuki drown in your ego instead of accepting that maybe I know a little more then you given I spend so much time actually teaching people the language
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think ur the one with lot of ego here boy
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me myself and i is the only correct here - learath
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eat ur fcking ego
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i agree, ryo just makes his statement for a reason
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and we see it exactly here
01:35 <+Learath2> I justify my claims, with atleast statistical evidence. You just swear like a child
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah statistical circlejerk
01:35 <+Learath2> Your evidence is yourself
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i evidence ur bullshit
01:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
01:36 <+Learath2> Sorry but 1 person is not of statistical significance, even if it's someone as GRANDIOSE as you
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who is the one who thinks is grandiose here? hmm?
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :monkaS: im sorry did i hear myself in that?
01:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ushould go to sleep
01:36 <+Learath2> I'm not the one pointlessly insulting the other party in an argument
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah ur point is reduced to that
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poor child
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well between me and ryo, im trying to be kind especially for understanding purposes
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what are ut alking about cellegen
01:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he did involve me as grandiose
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody talked about you
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who else would he mention then?
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bye
01:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bye
01:38 <+Learath2> My point is very simple. I've seen a lot of people learning C. I actually spend time teaching C. I'm yet to see someone learn proper C without resorting to a book.
01:38 <+Learath2> Your point seems to be that I'm in a cult of some sort?
01:40 <+Learath2> I don't get which part of me knowing more about the semantics of learning C offends you so much. Given my argument solely stems from the fact that I've seen more people
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so you say that the only way to learn C properly is to buy or rent a book, read it all the way and understand all of it? does not the internet evolved into a platform with every information gathered in one place aka google?
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i think u can learn just as well from the electronic version of the same books (.pdf)
01:42 <+Learath2> Ofc you can use a pdf. Another way to put what I'm saying is that, there is a huge lack of resources, especially quality ones w.r.t. C
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yeah, people will be on their goal who takes time and pressure on themselfs
01:42 <+Learath2> You can learn some kind of C from tutorials. But most of them are riddled with errors and even if you go off of resources that are correct, it's likely you will run into undefined behaviour
01:44 <+Learath2> Which is not trivial to diagnose at all, as you'd know if you'd seen some of the examples in that article on the llvm blog or maybe even experienced yourself
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean not all tutorials stand for one meaning, different ones exist for a reason, you just need to find which one is for you to start
01:44 <+Learath2> But I digress, I'm talking to a wall because @Ryozuki just skipped town after calling me a child
01:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he always does :greenthing:
01:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ðŸ§± a wall so funny
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can learn about ub without the need of a fcking book
01:46 <+Learath2> @Cellegen I'd agree for any other language out there. With C and C++ it is just very tricky to get right. There is a popular tutorial series by Zed Shaw e.g. Learn C The Hard Way
01:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your the one with the big fat ego to think ur way of learning is the only proper
01:47 <+Learath2> The guys tutorial is full of issues that he refuses to fix.
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but you have always been like this
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> x thing is the only good one
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> countless times
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no point in arguing
01:47 <+Learath2> I already acknowledged that exceptions do exist @Ryozuki you claim to have learned C fine.
01:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean i wont discuss people who recommend things people want
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk whats wrong with that
01:48 <+Learath2> I'm just saying it's not the experience many people have with learning C
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe the flex but besides that
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt make this just with C
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with all the languages
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its my way of doing things
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it works rly well for me
01:48 <+Learath2> With any other language, just go ahead and learn however you want, I wouldn't even argue
01:49 <+Learath2> All the more power to you @Ryozuki
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ryo, what advices would you recommend?
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk apparently im the exception here u should do whathever
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im rly bad at explaining myself so good luck
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thx for the advise
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thx for the advice
01:51 <+Learath2> You are especially mean today
02:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao for the record, I'm not drunk
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> hi , how can i insert failed_sql into database?
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just run the file as sql
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> @Learath2  ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 2840 in file: 'failed_sql.sql': You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '%s_race(Map, Name, Timestamp, Time, Server, cp1, cp2, cp3, cp4, cp5, cp6, cp7, c' at line 1
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, do you not have a prefix configured?
11:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyways, the %s needs replacing with the prefix
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooh, we don't add the prefix in the file anymore I guess
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but actually we could do that
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> @Learath2  thanks , i replaced %s to record and now it working.
