03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> what
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> didnt know they had a global version but that does look like it, but less bloated. also, our 360 is a "firewall" than an antivirus, maybe it was a different product

04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Valen_> hey does someone have the infection class mod binaries?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i was wondering if u thought that guy was cute

13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ```
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> bind mouse1 "+weapon2; +fire; +weapon1"
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ```
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ```
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> bind mouse1 "+weapon2; +fire"
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ```
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> why the +fire apply first ?
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> @heinrich5991
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> @murpi
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> üòÅ
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> because yes
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn hm. I don't find him particularly cute
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Astramast they all apply at once, and the server decides to do the +fire first when both happens at once
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> is it possible to do the first first, second second, etc ?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, not with a single command @Astramast
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> so i cant make that when i click mouse1, it takes the gun, fire, then take hammer ?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> D';
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> TmT
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think  +prevweapon works xd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fun? üòÑ
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> serious
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> current front page video is cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOQNpwLwutc
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, I never had this happen to me: https://youtu.be/cOQNpwLwutc?t=64 anyone else?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've had it happen before, but can't reproduce
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think there are maps using that
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yea its easy to set up.

17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> bind mouse1 "+fire;+prevweapon" this ?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> https://gist.github.com/b3z/1f2175a221cfa3f62060b2374e3aa200 got it from here
17:50 <+b3z> Whut? I got pinged?
17:56 <+b3z> @blacktyper that works a little different. So if you hit fire it switches to hammer and hammers once. With the next hook (which usually comes withing the next split second if you play gores) the weapon is switched back to the pistol.
17:57 <+b3z> That is why you also want to bind mouse2
18:02 <+b3z> Still you could swap that around and get what @Astramast described.
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what happened with zcatch
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> zcatch.
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe zcatch didn't catch an exception
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is no ranks on ddnet zcatch
