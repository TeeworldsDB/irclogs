16:28 < Nimda> ctf5_solo by imp just released on Solo at 2015-11-10 16:11
16:30 <+o_be_two> got my invite for letsencrypt :D
16:31 <+o_be_two> 8 domain names whitelisted
17:27 <@EastByte> invite for forum.ddnet.tw also arrived today
17:35 <+o_be_two> awesome, a friend already made his certificate online and it works very well
17:36 <+o_be_two> just he told me that servers seems to be busy so it took long time to get it, and you have to renew every 3 months
17:39 <@EastByte> yea, I think letsencrypt will work with some kind of auforenewal (e.g. a cronjob renewing certificate every 30 days)
18:04 <+o_be_two> sur
18:04 <+o_be_two> sure it will
20:31 <@deen> ddos on south africa...
20:32 <@deen> i look on http://ddnet.tw/status/ first time today and that's what I say, great
20:38 <@deen> see*
20:40 < minus> damn kids
20:55 <+o_be_two> hey deen whatsup ?
20:55 <@deen> hi
20:55 <@deen> would be so much easier to run servers without damn attacks all the time
20:55 <+o_be_two> yes sure :(
20:55 <@deen> o_be_two: nothing, i'm just back from travelling
20:56 <@deen> not doing anything ddnet related, except setting up chile again
20:56 <+o_be_two> how fun it was deen ?
20:56 <@deen> best time I've ever had
20:56 <+o_be_two> awesome !
20:56 <@deen> spent the last 2 weeks sleeping on random people's couches, new city every 2 days
20:57 <+o_be_two> ahah so nice, you was able to follow your plan and planning ?
20:58 <@deen> plan? haha
20:58 <@deen> I planned the country+city i was going to on the plane flight to that exact place
21:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: that doesn't make sense :D if you were in the plane that went somewhere, you already knew where you were going (?)
21:01 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, i knew what place i'm flying to
21:01 <@heinrich5991> but not the place where you were going to stay?
21:01 <@deen> but i didn't have a plan what to actually do there
21:01 <@heinrich5991> ah
21:01 <@heinrich5991> I guess I couldn't be that spontaneous :)
21:01 <@deen> places I usually found a bit earlier or on the same day
21:02 <@deen> it's really great to be spontaneous, sometimes I just met people and could spend a day or two with them without having to change plans
21:03 <@deen> i took some photos as well: http://hookrace.net/blog/travel-europe-2/
21:05 < minus> i see one effective mean against DDoS attacks
21:05 < minus> turning off the master servers
21:05 <@heinrich5991> deen: you were in edinburgh
21:05 <@heinrich5991> fuck
21:05 <@heinrich5991> I'm currently there
21:05 <@deen> oh, nice
21:05 <@heinrich5991> we could have met :(
21:05 < minus> why are you in edinburgh, heinrich5991?
21:05 <@heinrich5991> exchange semester
21:05 <@deen> well, that's the reason i posted my full travel plans before :P
21:06 <@deen> I stayed with a student in edinburgh and he showed me around the university
21:06 <@heinrich5991> for some reason I didn't think of that
21:06 <@heinrich5991> cool
21:06 <@deen> you should take the free hairy coo bus tour to the highlands
21:07 <@heinrich5991> were you on arthur's seat? :)
21:07 <@deen> and how do you like the city?
21:07 <@heinrich5991> I like it
21:07 <@deen> I think I was, yes
21:07 <@deen> I can never remember names, but we walked up a hill/mountain
21:07 <@heinrich5991> it kind of is "malerisch"
21:08 <@heinrich5991> lots of old buildings etc.
21:08 <@deen> picturesque
21:08 <@heinrich5991> and the hill in the centre of the city is awesome
21:08 <@deen> yeah, loved that as well
21:10 <@deen> i lived pretty close to the hills
21:10 <@heinrich5991> when were you here?
21:10 <@deen> when you hover the photos it should say, the first photo on the left is where I lived
21:11 <@deen> 2015-10-26 to 2015-10-28
21:12 <@heinrich5991> do you go to the 32c3? :)
21:13 <@deen> i proposed to hold a talk there. if it gets accepted, yes, otherwise probably no^^
21:13 <@heinrich5991> a talk :) I'll come
21:13 <@heinrich5991> about nim?
21:13 <@deen> yeah, haha
21:13 <@heinrich5991> cool
21:14 <@heinrich5991> but why otherwise not? :)
21:14 <@deen> it costs money and is far away
21:14 <@deen> i prefer to sit at home and watch all the talks
21:14 <@heinrich5991> says the guy who just travelled through whole europe :D
21:15 < minus> you going, heinrich5991?
21:15 <@heinrich5991> I am!
21:15 <@deen> I travelled nearly for free, getting cheap travel and accomodation at 32c3 would be more difficult
21:15 < minus> how far's hamburg for you?
21:15 <@heinrich5991> apparantly cheap accomodation can be very cheap
21:16 <@heinrich5991> if you don't mind bringing your sleeping bag and sleep in a gym (?)
21:16 <@heinrich5991> minus: berlin <-> hamburg
21:16 <@deen> ah, that's what I did in the Karlsruhe congress things, that's fine
21:16 < minus> heinrich5991: haha, bad luck
21:16 <@deen> minus: ~ 650 km
21:17 <@heinrich5991> minus: you going too?
21:17 < minus> pretty far
21:17 < minus> nope
21:17 <@deen> but i was close to Hamburg a few times this year already, hm
21:17 < minus> though if i went i'd fly
21:17 < minus> hamburg is like 800km from here
21:17 <@heinrich5991> which state do you live in?
21:17 <@deen> minus: BaWü or Bavaria?
21:17 <@heinrich5991> bavaria or baden-wurettemberg? ^^
21:18 < minus> *922km according to google
21:18 <@heinrich5991> wat
21:18 < minus> south-east end of bavaria
21:18 <@heinrich5991> (and a proponent of the CSU? :P)
21:18 < minus> salzburg airport is near :D
21:21 <@deen> it would be a chance to try out hitchhiking, I guess the ticket will be 100 €
21:22 <@heinrich5991> yea
21:23 <@heinrich5991> hitchhiking... does that even work? :)
21:24 <@deen> apparently yes
21:24 <@deen> I met a russian couple in brussels and they hitchhiked all the way through Europe from 1000 km east of Moscow
21:25 < minus> well shit
21:25 <@deen> it's probably not ideal in december though
21:25 < minus> that's gotta take ages
21:29 <+o_be_two> awesome pics serious :D
21:31 <+Learath2> deen: you missed your calling should have been a photographer
21:31 < minus> hm, can't ssh into ger
21:32 <@deen> minus: right, they disabled that
21:32 <@deen> EastByte: reenable please
21:32 < minus> disable ssh? Oo
21:32 <@deen> minus: tcp from every non-ddnet server
21:32 <@deen> against ddos attacks i presume
21:33 < minus> syn flood?
21:33 <@deen> o_be_two, Learath2: thanks, first time I had a camera in my life
21:33 <@deen> minus: no idea, happened while I was gone
21:33 < minus> it seems like someone tried to reflection attack 1-2 hours ago
21:33 < minus> Error: Unable to read database "/var/lib/vnstat/eth0": No such file or directory
21:33 < minus> awww
21:35 < minus> do you monitor bandwidth peaks? do you sample attacks (e.g. pcap capture some of it)
21:35 <@deen> minus: only manually
21:36 <@deen> most of the attacks were pretty boring ddos attacks
21:36 < minus> tho some are attempts to use the masters for reflection attacks
21:37 <@deen> those must be new
21:37 < minus> well, i'm not entirely sure that's what it is, but someone threatened with that
21:38 < minus> and published a tool to do so
21:38 <@deen> minus: ssh should work again
21:38 < minus> yeah it does
21:38 < minus> though no vnstat is enabled :D
21:40 <@deen> hm, i always just used tcpdump
21:41 < minus> vnstat just does traffic statistics. very simple, doesn't require much resources
21:42 < minus> you basically have to run vnstat -i eth0 -u once to enable it
21:42 < minus> maybe also enable it in /etc/default/vnstat or so
21:42 < minus> records total traffic
21:42 <@heinrich5991> it's quite neat
21:46 <@deen> might be enabled
21:50 <@EastByte> minus: on ddnet ger we always had daily tcp of length 0 flooding attacks (with different flags) 
21:51 < minus> /o\
21:51 <@EastByte> and the filter duration of nfoservers is pretty short for that kind of attacks
22:08 <@deen> i hope the chile server will get popular again. looks pretty empty now
22:09 <@EastByte> did the ip address change?
22:10 <@deen> yes
22:10 <@EastByte> meh
22:10 <@deen> they just gave me a fresh server
22:11 <@deen> better than nothing i guess since no one knows where to get good and cheap vps servers in chile
22:11 <@EastByte> yea
22:11 <@EastByte> btw. is GER2 running out?
22:11 <@deen> that's a good question
22:12 <@deen> to which i do not know the answer
22:12 <@EastByte> gametown is reaaaly strange
22:12 <@deen> oh right, gametown was the hoster, thanks
22:12 <@EastByte> no problem
22:12 <@EastByte> for some reason my vps got compromised there and was used for 1gbit flooding attacks
22:13 <@deen> wow
22:13 <@deen> that's pretty shocking
22:13 <@EastByte> well it got reset and everything appeared to be fine
22:13 <@EastByte> but then one week later the vps just got cancelled without reason
22:14 <@EastByte> no idea how someone could get on that server
22:14 <@deen> vulnerability in an old version of virtualization software they're using
22:14 <@EastByte> I thought so
22:14 <@deen> that's pretty much a dream. buy 1 vps, get access to all
22:16 <@EastByte> well atleast the gbit link isn't a lie
22:16 <@deen> it should run out on december 21
22:16 <@EastByte> ah okay
22:17 <@deen> no idea how well it's running and whether it still has no ddos protection
22:17 <@EastByte> I saw it down once on ddos
22:17 <@EastByte> but looks like such attacks are rare
22:18 <@deen> what i like about the hoster is kvm with 2 GB of ram for 5 € / month
22:18 <@deen> everything else is bad
22:18 <@EastByte> I will try to set up one on o_be_one's server, he said he is ready to provide lxc containers
22:19 <@deen> oh?
22:19 <@deen> that would've been good to know, paid for GER yesterday
22:19 <@EastByte> but I actually wouldn't replace the nfoservers GER
22:19 <@deen> if it runs well, i would
22:19 <@deen> have to run them in parallel for a month or so
22:20 <@EastByte> yea
22:20 <@deen> i'm also not sure what to do with the ddnet.tw server at harmony-hosting
22:20 <@deen> keep it running, buy a 5 € kimsufi server, merge with GER?
22:21 <@EastByte> merge with GER?
22:21 <@EastByte> well maybe we could just host ddnet.tw at o_be_one
22:21 <@deen> as it used to be before, run website and GER on same server
22:22 <@EastByte> okay, misunderstood
22:23 <@EastByte> the server at harmony-hosting is too weak actually
22:24 <@deen> is it?
22:24 <@deen> the scripts are just very slow python
22:25 <@EastByte> I think it's bad enough that it is swapping all the time
22:25 <@EastByte> and vcore often 100%
22:25 <@deen> swapping?!
22:25 <@EastByte> do I misinterpret htop again?
22:26 <@deen> i also had planned to optimize the scripts for memory usage
22:27 <@deen> but sure, throwing a stronger server at it would be much easier
