00:11 < bridge> <kebscs> no longer waiting for author, someone can remove the label ðŸ˜„
00:42 < bridge> <Assa> yes it does, however I needed to clip Force with MaxSpeed, because otherwise contributions like gravity or hook may get cancelled out by pure speedtile force, a speedtile force of 50 is massive compared to this
05:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> menu concept alpha
05:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> theres a LOT that needs to be done but this but i do believe that a proper automapper GUI would have a menu sort of like this
05:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> a list of tiles, and when you click one of them, you can edit its properties
05:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you can add new tiles, rearrange them by dragging them, add new runs, showed by a large break, and possibly a name (which is a comment in the automapper code)

05:59 < bridge> <remakepower> Is there any documentation on the DDNet master registration process?
06:01 < bridge> <remakepower> I want to create a fast porting implementation that works with some old mods
06:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is some info here https://codedoc.ddnet.org/
06:15 < bridge> <remakepower> Thanks
07:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> looking at all the specific index rules for ddnet_grass.png, it's easier to see how this works!

09:27 < bridge> <Assa> Here something to keep in mind:
09:27 < bridge> <Assa> - some tiles are connected and have other rules, like the big skeleton in grass main
09:27 < bridge> <Assa> - randomness: often you have a basetile and then some detail doodads in them, like bones in the walls or gold in desert main
09:27 < bridge> <Assa> - There are some tiles where your 3x3 rules don't apply and you'll find places where you need 5x5 relationships
09:27 < bridge> <Assa> - tilesets are often not complete, how to handle cases where tiles are missing
09:27 < bridge> <Assa> Good luck with your project!
09:48 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm...
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> It seems that my words caused a misunderstanding. I meant I was looking for a documentation on both of master server and game server registration.
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> Not only the master
09:56 < bridge> <remakepower> Oops, that document does have a partial explanation, but it's not detailed enough
09:57 < bridge> <remakepower> EDIT: that document does have a partial explanation, but it's not detailed enough
09:57 < bridge> <remakepower> Is there any more documentation?
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> do we have a sign function in the engine, just returning -1 or 1?
10:38 < bridge> <remakepower> There's a in teeworlds
10:39 < bridge> <remakepower> There's one in teeworlds
10:39 < bridge> <Assa> can't find it in math.h, searched for sign and signum
10:41 < bridge> <remakepower> I didn't find it in DDNet code, either.
10:42 < bridge> <Assa> also searched for sgn and sng, I guess this is deliberately not in in order to handle the 0 case properly
10:42 < bridge> <Assa> or I am searching for the wrong thing
11:08 < bridge> <learath2> Don't think we have one. I can't imagine where we might have used one
11:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Teeworlds had one, but it's gone on DDNet. What do you need it for?
11:24 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently working on different versions of new speedtiles, my latest idea uses the dot product and the sign of the dot product determines the direction of the projection of a vector. A projection from one vector to another can either point in the same or the opposite direction.
11:24 < bridge> <Assa> In this case the lenght of the vector is equal to it's speed, so I need the sign of the dot product in order to know if the speed is added or subtracted
11:24 < bridge> <Assa> If we don't have one, then int Sign = DotProduct < 0 ? -1 : 0;
11:25 < bridge> <Assa> If we don't have one, then simply `int Sign = DotProduct < 0 ? -1 : 0;`, I am just trying to program against ddnet standards and using it's stl, I just thought I may had missed it
11:27 < bridge> <Assa> Why? The max speed in the old implementation just limits the speed in the speedtile direction (and not orthogonal to it)

11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is there no std version
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> > I am just trying to program against ddnet standards and using it's stl
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think ddnet relaxed this, bcs why would you not use the std version xd
11:35 < bridge> <Assa> occording to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1903954/is-there-a-standard-sign-function-signum-sgn-in-c-c), no
11:35 < bridge> <Assa> occording to [this](<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1903954/is-there-a-standard-sign-function-signum-sgn-in-c-c>), no

11:37 < bridge> <Assa> > this is deliberately not in in order to handle the 0 case properly
11:37 < bridge> <Assa> hmm
11:38 < bridge> <Assa> For this this doesn't matter tho, because the lenght of the projection is 0, if the dot product is 0
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> guess I'll use signbit, thank you!
12:16 < bridge> <zhn> full ip redirect when :feelsbadman:
12:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> Never :feelsbadman:
12:43 < bridge> <avolicious> Having this feature on 512p servers & then taking over a server by just sending them there to vote F3 ðŸ˜„
12:43 < bridge> <avolicious> this is what we need
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> masterban :troll:
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> I think this is possible if you modify a proxy and force a reconnect. Maybe with an econ client detecting that this vote passed which in turn modified the proxy, while this _would_ work this would be [a totally bodged solution](<https://youtu.be/lIFE7h3m40U>)
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> daily reminder #9643 is ready to be merged
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gg bot ded?
13:09 < bridge> <Assa> bad bot
13:09 < bridge> <DDNet> Sowwy :c
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo users and @learath2 look at this https://github.com/VKCOM/nocc
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious I know you are trolling but as someone who would really like to see ip redirects I have to state your comment is not a real risk. Controlling redirects does not control votes.
13:39 < bridge> <avolicious> Thats true, but you can easily coordinate an attack with this type of "redirection"
13:40 < bridge> <avolicious> just 63p players join a server and get redirect the same time, because this would be legit
13:55 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, thats a problem. i cant force client to send packets directly to host i want redirect to, so, proxy servers are pretty useless in world of teeworlds
13:56 < bridge> <zhn> server should confirm accepting of these clients then
13:57 < bridge> <zhn> there's nice tedtalk about nocc, but its fully in russian
14:04 < bridge> <avolicious> too complex
14:07 < bridge> <zhn> if server-server communication is complex, id suggest server X sending to master a list (whitelist or blacklist) of servers that can or can not redirect to server X so client would distinguish if its good redirect or not
14:08 < bridge> <zhn> imagine server redirecting to localhost:8303 xdd
14:08 < bridge> <avolicious> even more complex
14:08 < bridge> <zhn> i don't see any complexity
14:08 < bridge> <avolicious> maintaining an allowlist/blocklist?
14:08 < bridge> <zhn> server owner would maintain it
14:08 < bridge> <zhn> like list all your servers and thats it
14:09 < bridge> <avolicious> how can the receiving server make sure that the player is really connected to the origin server?
14:09 < bridge> <avolicious> doesnt scale well
14:09 < bridge> <avolicious> atleast for server networks that are scaling up/down as needed
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> is therr any reason to make sure it is? if not it would be just a regular connection, no?
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> but you maintain community list somehow?
14:10 < bridge> <avolicious> it should always be just a regular connection to not avoid password checks and so on
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> ofc, that's why i don't see any problem
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> like why would you make sure it redirects from correct server if its regular connection
14:11 < bridge> <zhn> client should check it itself
14:11 < bridge> <avolicious> thats true, but the server can send you to any ip
14:11 < bridge> <avolicious> if there is a bug anywhere, a client can get redirect to a malicious server
14:11 < bridge> <avolicious> then using his login code
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, client checks if a) server in master list b) server ip is legit for this one
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> like how would you make it bugged
14:12 < bridge> <avolicious> the teeworlds protocol is unencrypted
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> and it solely depends on player imho, i saw many players joining vanilla servers and pressing their login bind instantly
14:12 < bridge> <avolicious> i can intercept and send the client a reconnection packet
14:12 < bridge> <avolicious> i can intercept and send the client a redirect packet
14:13 < bridge> <zhn> you could just intercept and get login without anh redirect wtf
14:13 < bridge> <zhn> any*
14:13 < bridge> <avolicious> i potentially could, this is already a risk
14:14 < bridge> <zhn> you don't need redirect to do malicious stuff if you are midman in mitm
14:14 < bridge> <avolicious> all fair points
14:14 < bridge> <avolicious> but why add another potential malicious way to send players somewhere?
14:14 < bridge> <avolicious> i would focus on accounts first
14:14 < bridge> <avolicious> or encryption
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> go to ddnet rs then, ddnet will not drop back compact rn
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> at least until heinrich epic comeback on quic pr
14:15 < bridge> <avolicious> you dont have to drop backwards comp
14:15 < bridge> <zhn> to have encryption and stuff?
14:15 < bridge> <avolicious> yes
14:16 < bridge> <zhn> fair, but i don't see any gates for redirect packet
14:16 < bridge> <zhn> it as exploitable as everything else in tw protocol
14:16 < bridge> <avolicious> it is, but if its not added one thing less to exploit ðŸ˜„
14:17 < bridge> <avolicious> if there is an intuitive way for the user, thats fair enough
14:17 < bridge> <avolicious> but redirection to a different ip should be clearly communicated to the client
14:18 < bridge> <zhn> then we have a carriage and small cart of exploits right there xd
14:18 < bridge> <zhn> ye, no one said it should not :justatest:
14:20 < bridge> <zhn> everything but the kitchen sink* ðŸ¤“
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> what you can do is a modified teeworlds server which acts as a proxy. But this would be slow, unfortunately
14:22 < bridge> <avolicious> i dont need a tw server for that
14:22 < bridge> <avolicious> simple udp reverse proxy should be sufficient
14:22 < bridge> <avolicious> SDR does this
14:22 < bridge> <zhn> not if i want to redirect in another dc
14:23 < bridge> <avolicious> ?
14:23 < bridge> <zhn> russia is pretty big, i want to proxy player on lowest ping possible
14:23 < bridge> <zhn> on server with lowest ping possible*
14:23 < bridge> <avolicious> what is your use-case?
14:23 < bridge> <avolicious> for this you need anycast
14:23 < bridge> <zhn> matchmaking
14:24 < bridge> <zhn> i have it, but its useless for my use case xd
14:24 < bridge> <Assa> uhh from inside of teeworlds? mud
14:24 < bridge> <zhn> ye
14:25 < bridge> <Assa> this is the direction I thought all city servers would eventually be, one big lobby server, multiple small minigame servers, with volleybal and whatever
14:25 < bridge> <avolicious> but in this case you dont need ip:port redirect
14:25 < bridge> <Assa> this is the direction I thought all city servers would eventually be, one big lobby server, multiple small minigame servers, with volleybal and whatever. You could even spin up severs on demand
14:26 < bridge> <Assa> you would need a redirect inside of the teeworlds protocol
14:26 < bridge> <avolicious> we have a redirect packet
14:26 < bridge> <avolicious> with port
14:26 < bridge> <Assa> oh we do?
14:26 < bridge> <avolicious> yes we do
14:26 < bridge> <avolicious> it is not fully backwards comp, but it just kicks non comp clients with a message to connect to a different port
14:27 < bridge> <Assa> nice, time to host the Assa-network behind a ddoss protection
14:27 < bridge> <Assa> nice, time to host the Assa-network behind a ddoss protection proxy
14:27 < bridge> <avolicious> you can only redirect port wise
14:28 < bridge> <avolicious> not ip:port
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> the same for ddnet, but ddnet-wise it would be just multimap system
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious i dont understand the attack how is 63 players connecting an attack?
14:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have written ddnet config file parser in rust
14:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> hell yeah
14:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> its not perfect but its mine
14:41 < bridge> <avolicious> automated, coordinated attack possible with the default ddnet client
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious still makes no sense to me
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you redirect 64 players to my server how do i suffer any harm?
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato did you see https://github.com/edg-l/teeconfig ?
14:42 < bridge> <avolicious> i can coordinate a vote attack for example
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how so?
14:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: ive seen it but does it parse .cfg files?
14:42 < bridge> <avolicious> 50 players join my server & i redirect them to your server just pressing F3
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato i think so 
14:42 < bridge> <avolicious> I join your server to see if someone is far
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious how do you make them press f3?
14:42 < bridge> <avolicious> asking them to do so
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?? xd
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like in chat or what?
14:43 < bridge> <avolicious> on my server
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in the chat?
14:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: sad
14:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> at least its mine
14:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> :feelsbadman:
14:44 < bridge> <avolicious> it is coordinated, so in chat
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so what is the redirect for then?
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can already do that
14:44 < bridge> <avolicious> to redirect them to the target server
14:44 < bridge> <zhn> so you need 64 friends that use latest ddnet just to fill chillers rpi5 servers?
14:44 < bridge> <zhn> 3$ ddos sounds better
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also writes ip in the chat
14:45 < bridge> <avolicious> sure you can do that, but redirect is much simpler ^^
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the whole nuts idea is still not simple enough to actually work
14:45 < bridge> <avolicious> there is no human interaction needed
14:45 < bridge> <zhn> ping -i 0.1 would do more harm
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you cant even control a 10 player t0 team to not destruct them self
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how are you supposed to sucesffuly convince a bunch of players what to vote xd
14:46 < bridge> <avolicious> by default players tend to press f3
14:46 < bridge> <avolicious> for whatever reason
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and even then its a one shot thing
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because if they need redirect to find the server they wont find back xd
14:46 < bridge> <zhn> never happened :justatest:
14:46 < bridge> <zhn> multez is just another universe i suppose
14:46 < bridge> <avolicious> sending players in an endless redirect loop also doesnt sound intuitive
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that sounds more like an issue
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if quitting becomes hard thats bad
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> it will prompt you anyway
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but that can already be done without ip redirect
14:47 < bridge> <avolicious> sure, but you get prompted all the time
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same issue exists with port redirect
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> i don't have any problems so id probably just hit cancel button on second redirect
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think spamming escape should get you out even if you do not know about the local console ``quit``
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> like wtf
14:48 < bridge> <avolicious> are you doing tickets on here?
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you are afraight of votes i am okay with accepting redirects to be opt in @avolicious 
14:48 < bridge> <avolicious> people ask you what to do if the page writes: "Doesnt work, open a ticket"
14:48 < bridge> <zhn> im in sauna rn
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who is "you" and what do you mean by tickets
14:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Even unticking filters in ddnet client is hard for a few
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> i suppose they're mostly russians
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is hard
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> and they didn't get well with english
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> defaults rule thats a fact
14:50 < bridge> <zhn> i can understand them honestly xd
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious are you still talking about the loop? this issue is not caused by ip redirects as i said before.
14:50 < bridge> <avolicious> thats true, this works right now as well
14:51 < bridge> <zhn> we need more heads in our discussion
14:51 < bridge> <zhn> leratoooo
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> problem is that its basically heinrich alone who makes this decision in the end. And he just says he does not like it but cant explain why.
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So there wont be any progress ever.
14:52 < bridge> <avolicious> add it to ddnetpp ^^
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no ddnet++ client
14:52 < bridge> <avolicious> sounds like a need for it then
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no because nobody would use it
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> thats an assumption
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> there are several clients in use
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but none of them are mine :D 
14:53 < bridge> <avolicious> that sounds like a you problem
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and even t-client doesnt have enough market share to make redirects interesting in there
14:54 < bridge> <avolicious> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1338870802761908274/image.png?ex=67aca81a&is=67ab569a&hm=86d51c60a4d703688741c26fcf7f81f2fafbdfbe5ad423fa974cbbf128f383da&

14:55 < bridge> <zhn> its kog tho
14:55 < bridge> <avolicious> Only KoG accounted*
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> gores players tend to use tater
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> or krx
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how much % chillerbot
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> bruh i forgot its voldemort client
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rule 7
14:55 < bridge> <avolicious> not displayable
14:55 < bridge> <zhn> top2 clients on kog so far
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too little or what @avolicious ?
14:55 < bridge> <avolicious> less than 0.1%
14:56 < bridge> <zhn> replace tater with ddnet and now its top2 ddnet clients xd
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: my implementation takes 1ns to parse ddnet server config but teeconfig one 24ns
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> hehe
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
14:56 < bridge> <zhn> whats teeconfig
14:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/edg-l/teeconfig
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/edg-l/teeconfig

14:57 < bridge> <zhn> double attackers
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn go upvote https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7480
14:58 < bridge> <zhn> uses some fancy lexer parser combo with runtime checks (probably)
14:59 < bridge> <zhn> nicely done tho, shootouts to ryo
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok now ez redirect
15:02 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, server-to-master defined whitelists/blacklists should solve problems that are listed there, although it should be perfectly done and reviewed
15:03 < bridge> <zhn> ok sauna time
15:03 < bridge> <avolicious> allow & blocklist*
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> interesting ticket, can't wait to create a server roulette
15:04 < bridge> <avolicious> we also thought about redirection hell from us to europe then to asia and back again
15:04 < bridge> <avolicious> sounds like a fun troll mechanism
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait wat no master server @zhn the master should not be involved in redirects.
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> redirection ban, now connect to the shadow realm (rus block)
15:04 < bridge> <avolicious> we also thought about redirection hell from usa to europe then to asia and back again
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client sends the target server a "hi i am being redirected" message and only initiates a connection if the server responds with "yes i accept redirects"
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> redirection ban, now connect to the shadow realm (rus block /s)
15:05 < bridge> <avolicious> okay, this is fun tho. If you wayblock you get redirect to rus server
15:05 < bridge> <avolicious> okay, this is fun tho. If you wayblock you get redirect to rus block server
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> yes that is what is discussed, with opt - in instead of opt - out
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa you dont need to have a vpn blocker if you redirect cheaters to servers where cheats are allowed and keep them busy there
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> everybody wins
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> if somebody is bored, I have something that needs testing: `https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/pull/2` The new speedtile is one right in the speedlayer of the current/old one, you see it produces arrows in the map editor, I don't know if this one works rn

15:18 < bridge> <Assa> Also if this is finished, I'll immediately add a feature request for a new tile ðŸ˜„
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> Also after this is finished, I'll immediately add a feature request for a new tile ðŸ˜„
15:21 < bridge> <zhn> is there any difference?
15:21 < bridge> <avolicious> wording
15:22 < bridge> <zhn> thats what i suggested first debating with avo, solution granted to be complex, idk why xd
15:22 < bridge> <zhn> ah, mb
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> that sounds like great spoofing possibility
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> that*
15:25 < bridge> <zhn> shouldn't client just initiate regular connection with no additional info? or this message will go into connection packet padding as mentioned in discussion? separated client packet sounds sus
16:06 < bridge> <Assa> argh signbit returns true if negative and false if positive, so nothing is won here xD
17:21 < femboypig> whoever move is gay!
17:22 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ðŸ•º
17:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - I guess for big structures there would be sort of like, a colored outline showcasing like, a pre-made tile group? I do want to introduce the concept of presets and stuff
17:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Randomness is easy, when editing a tile there'd be a slider from 0 to 100, and in this menu there'd be a small number at the corner showcasing its random%
17:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - I mean, the logic for that would be sort of easy. Just make a rule that checks for if a valid amount of space is available for big structures.
17:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Maybe in the future I could implement a way for smart checking? My main focus right now is to make a consistent and easy to use GUI for making and managing rules for tiles.
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> @hectavoxel if you can speak python we could work together on the SimpleDDnetAutomapper, because parts of what you describe are already there, like a GUI and a way for smart checking
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> @hectavoxel if you can speak python we could work together on the SimpleDDnetAutomapper, because parts of what you describe are already there, like a GUI and a way for smart checking. Also a way for ingame checking
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> When I started this project, most of the automapper was not documented and I needed to reverse engineer is. At least we have a wiki entry now
17:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Oh yeah, of course.
17:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I don't know much about python, but I'd be more than happy to help!
17:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> And, I did just add in modulo rules, which isn't merged yet, but when it does I'll think of a way to make a visualization for it
18:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @handerfall u here?
18:22 < bridge> <handerfall> ?
18:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah nice
18:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @handerfall you did not link sdl2 statically here https://cactuss.me/#download for linux it fails if sdl2 is not installed thats maybe not very nice for new users
18:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also can the client zoom or does it send zoom levels? I keep seeing people zoom on fng that all say they use cactus client
18:27 < bridge> <zhn> probably spoofed voldemort
18:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no spoofing more lying :D just wanted to make sure 
18:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious u have time for dms?
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp through that I found this, VK seems to be working on some very cool engineering
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> and it seems almost all their open source work is under MIT license, that's cool
19:03 < bridge> <handerfall> oh thanks
19:04 < bridge> <handerfall> zoom works the same way it does in the ddnet client
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what i thought
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> This is the new code of the speedtiles I am working on, anyone an idea while the diagonals are not working properly, only the vertical and horizontal speedtiles? This assumes MaxSpeed > 0
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> ```
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> float DotProduct = dot(Direction, m_Core.m_Vel);
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> // project current speed onto speedup direction
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> vec2 Projection = Direction * DotProduct; // direction has length one
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> 
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> // projection might point into opposite direction
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> int Sign = DotProduct < 0 ? -1 : 1;
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> float CurrentDirectionalSpeed = Sign * length(Projection);
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> float TempMaxSpeed = MaxSpeed / 5.0f;
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> //float SpeedupSpeed = length(Direction * Force); // direction has length one
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> if(CurrentDirectionalSpeed + Force > TempMaxSpeed)
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> {
19:14 < bridge> <Assa>     float NewForce = TempMaxSpeed - CurrentDirectionalSpeed;
19:14 < bridge> <Assa>     TempVel += Direction * NewForce;
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> }
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> else
19:14 < bridge> <Assa>     TempVel += Direction * Force;
19:14 < bridge> <Assa> m_Core.m_Vel = ClampVel(m_MoveRestrictions, TempVel);
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> ```
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> This is the new code of the speedtiles I am working on, anyone an idea while the diagonals are not working properly, only the vertical and horizontal speedtiles? This assumes MaxSpeed > 0, vec2 Direction is speedtile direction and has length 1.0, TempVel = m_Core.m_Vel, and Force is a float
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> ```
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> float DotProduct = dot(Direction, m_Core.m_Vel);
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> // project current speed onto speedup direction
19:15 < bridge> <Assa> vec2 Projection = Direction * DotProduct; // direction has length one
19:15 < bridge> <Assa>

19:16 < bridge> <Assa> ```
19:21 < bridge> <Assa> i am not even sure it's broken
19:27 < bridge> <Assa> guess I am going to add some debug code then ðŸ˜¦
19:56 < bridge> <zhn> they're tending to move from kphp to go, but their monolith is goddamn gigantic to actually rewrite it
20:12 < bridge> <Assa> I don't get any debug output from ddnet server ðŸ˜¦
20:30 < bridge> <Assa> NewForce can get negative, I now understand why
20:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Make sure you set `stdout_output_level`, `console_output_level` and `loglevel` to the correct level (`2` to see all messages)
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> the caveats of all of this shit, speed 1 speedtiles were patched out because "they were not working"
20:47 < bridge> <Assa> they are working, they are just not strong enough to overcome gravity or friction
20:47 < bridge> <Assa> I think i got it right now
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm adding support for mapbugs to the client: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9658#issuecomment-2651051308
20:48 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 are you more in favor of adding a new tile or fixing this?
20:48 < bridge> <Assa> I found over 400 affected maps ðŸ’€ I am in favor of a new tile
20:49 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, with so many affected maps adding a new tile might be safer than changing the existing one
20:50 < bridge> <Assa> also I am already working on an implementation, doing the PR for this today, this was much easier to implement than expected
20:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Assa moved from tw dev to ddnet dev?
20:52 < bridge> <Assa> long time ago
20:52 < bridge> <Assa> It also happened that I tried to implement new features for both in order to keep compatability
20:53 < bridge> <Assa> but I guess tw is actually dead
20:55 < bridge> <avolicious> You Need the Discord Client to send me dms no?
20:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot no
20:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just join me in game
