08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChÄ«mupurei> I'll probably ever install Void Linux and prepare a client package for XBPS ðŸ™‚

10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> how can i make a system that shows the name of the weapon in the upper left when i pick up a weapon?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> :think_bot:
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check out hud.cpp
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> @deen
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> how can i edit the coordinate of this message? when i take a rifle in my hand, i want it to write "rifle" under the hearts in the upper left.
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There is some code writing text for the clock at top
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In general DDNet runs pretty well on macOS. The high resolution with 120 hz refresh rate looks great, fun to just spectate like that
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314t> IDK I tried to play steam->ddnet on macos and sometimes after I launched it just black screen appeared with just macos pointer on it and nothing happened for few mins (untill I reboot my laptop, I can't even cmd-tab to some other window)
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314t> Sometimes it launches correctly, but sometimes this trashy thing happen. 
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314t> 
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314t> 
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x314t> MBP 2019 on intel7 and AMD 5300m graphics
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> weird, might be opengl related, you can try lower version
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I had no problems so far, but just moderated a bit and played 1 map
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mouse feels like it has acceleration even though I turned it off, running multiple applications is unnecessarily complicated, filesystem is case insensitive; but those are macOS problems, not DDNet ðŸ˜„
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Performance is also much better than my desktop: `ninja  53.30s user 4.54s system 826% cpu 6.997 total` (Release)
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> @deen i dont find my problem. i want change broadcast location
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> but how
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 53s to compile?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt ur other computer compile in 30s or smth
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember we compared it one day
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clang compiles faster btw
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, 7s total @Ryozuki, I think
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I have a question, DDNET costs a lot:
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/919654335636443136/unknown.png
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> you need to pay for servers etc. What about hosting on for example Free oracle plan ðŸ¤”? I am aware it runs on ARM but still, just was thinking how good/stupid idea is?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> free hosting is never good
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it may cost that but people donate quite a lot so its not a problem for now
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> totally aware of that  /
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> totally aware of that  /\
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> still... idk
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> i just like you can use their hosting for free. Their 24GB & 4 (arm) cores for free is still best performance/price if someone is looking for some amateur projects or hosting for game servers
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> and also, could you tell me what hostings are you using? Just few examples
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> If you go for free hosting, there is literally no SLA
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> ye, this is the biggest problem of it. They can just disable it or lower performance. And also i don't think there are things like that which could even ddnet put there. ðŸ¤”
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Just wondering tho
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Every hoster tries their best to get good hardware & stable pings and stable networks. Free providers could be used for some hobby stuff non time critical
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Yee i agree with that. And as i said, there are no things like that on ddnet network. Still good for minecraft server ðŸ˜Ž

20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fvck -.- im not made for graphics
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Neither do I
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We tried that, when there is a DoS attack the server just goes offline. When you try to contact support for a free product, you get redirected to a community forum
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have probably tried > 100 hosters already, see the comments at the top of this file for most of our current hosters: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/_includes/funding.html
