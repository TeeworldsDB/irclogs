00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn’t look parked
00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> works for me
00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> my domain tho i miss it dearly
00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> https://ewan.horse
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> I was never able to renew because my namecheap was flagged for fraud and suspended
00:13 < bridge> <bencie.> @cyberfighter
00:14 < bridge> <bencie.> do u know why?
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> they let minors create accounts but they don’t let minors keep accounts
00:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> @bencie. I am seeing so many: add this command and add this command, my brain Just declines These ideas on Autopilot :catblep:
00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> what do they want
00:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> I constantly See issues wanting more and more commands, it seems Like at some Point you need a dedicated Webpage Just to Show you all possible /practice commands :justatest:
00:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Personal and prolly Not Well Received opinion tho
00:40 < bridge> <furo321> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8072> :)
00:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> :angy:
00:43 < bridge> <bencie.> that's fair if the idea doesn't affect you,  I've also had the idea to add weapon commands out of frustration of needing to find the maps on every death. like on grim reaper I had to get different weapons multiple times cuz I kept failing lmao
00:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> If ewans "rescue on killtile" would,ve been merged WE could simply add a way to disable shields and Not worry about weapons at all, without having to add 5 new commands (or one generalized command) ig, But yeah i get your Point!, it Sounds useful But there could be better ways instead of Just making everything a command
00:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sry for random Camel and snake cases, Phone autocorrect sucks
00:47 < bridge> <bencie.> ye that'd be better imo
00:48 < bridge> <bencie.> in my experience in practice, rescue on kill wouldve solved 95% of scenarios where I needed  get weapons manually
00:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sad that the discussion ended Kind of rough and it got declined, maybe someone tries the Integration again
00:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yea I agree with heinrich i just didn't know how to say it. But I am under the impression that you enjoy writing code that is never used for anything. Which is sad because you are such a pro coder and there are many pains to be solved in the tw community.
00:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> This reminds me a lot of the so called tee in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128 does anyone know if the teeworlds protocol packed int has a name or follows any official standard?
01:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So teeworlds would be like LEB64? :D
07:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: im open to do any tw project after this one 🙂
07:39 < bridge> <cyberFighter> good site
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it was goated
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> or horsed
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
09:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I opend a pr to handle the http code 204 and github assigned me the pull id 204? lmao
09:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/barneygale/quarry/pull/204
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is too funny
09:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon now you are into minecraft protocol? xd
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye :D 
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gotta learn minecraft protocol to bring all the good stuff to ddnet hehe
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tbh i just wanted to play but the tool i depended on for gaming was deprecated so i guess i have to roll my own so im forced to mess with the fakin microsoft shits
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wish there was a good minecraft clone
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> minetest is so ugly
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and craft is so incomplete
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats all i know xd
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> bring tw protocol in Minecraft xd
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i think there are like a zillion minecraft clones
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat imagine minecraft without cheats xd
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no more speed and teleportation hacks
09:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: write own Minecraft :gigachad:
09:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Chillercraft
09:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Id like to create some goody little coop game
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I would prefer not to. Sounds time consuming to make it good and maintain it
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat then you do it
09:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> To play around with protocols and stuff
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just wanna game it
09:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I play mc using Tlauncher xd
09:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so? xd
09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat why are you not using the teeworlds launcher to play minecraft?
10:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710234372.png
10:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Prism is the official ddnet approved minecraft launcher

10:13 < bridge> <scrumplex> simps
10:13 < bridge> <scrumplex> ddnet is the official Prism Launcher approved ddnet client
10:13 < bridge> <scrumplex> sorry melon
10:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> :angy:
10:14 < bridge> <scrumplex> htop is the official Prism Launcher approved top program
10:14 < bridge> <scrumplex> 
10:14 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/pull/1412
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> use btop
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1217041554380947516/image.png?ex=66029546&is=65f02046&hm=64e1c283d6596449b73133e53309db82727d6ce710de690f862ab05952668456&
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its one of the few C aproved programs https://github.com/aristocratos/btop
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh its c++
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ✅
10:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> btop never felt practical to me
10:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> like it's cool to look at
10:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> but htop feels more intuitive to actually interact with to me
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do i always forget the command argument order for ln
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it ln -s target source
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> or other
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
10:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> ln -s <where should your link point to> <where should it be placed>
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i forget it too
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> tip free space: go clean -modcache
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why i have go at all
10:35 < bridge> <scrumplex> you can use ln -s with only one parameter too
10:35 < bridge> <scrumplex> that's how i remember
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> `du -sh * | sort -h`
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> to find stuff
10:35 < bridge> <scrumplex> because if you just define the target, it will just create the link in the current dir
10:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> ncdu
10:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> interactive!
10:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like copy
10:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remembered it using that
10:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1710236201_poo3Oo.png
10:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> ncdu is great
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok emerging it
10:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> and `dust` if you want a rust replacement for du
10:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, I also use ncdu
10:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1710236266_eoc1Ie.png
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that looks non-interactve
10:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> yeah it is just a replacement for du
10:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> while ncdu is an interactive replacement
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ncdu works with multiple drives right
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> man idk why i didnt setup lvm
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> im dum
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u setup lvm after the fact
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> transparent disks are so good for expanding
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it works with multiple mount points. `-x` to let it stay on one mount
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1217046563122057295/image.png?ex=660299f0&is=65f024f0&hm=5614cd3e62c080a8a8ba4a1d7da09add7b20fabe6d52514de4228e70b7ca4d98&
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> makes sense
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> .xlcore is ffxiv
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh wait
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt find steam library?
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably ni .local?
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah do i need to be at /
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i got my steam on another drive
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> Why do you want lvm?
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1217047025951047720/image.png?ex=66029a5e&is=65f0255e&hm=ec51e8dbfa3fbec6805b6cccc304305cffc464664e2bcd81ce6664b41cf197db&
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> raid presumably
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> because the disk i have / is 500gb and its always near full
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> while i got the other disks of 2tb near free
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i have them as mounted folders
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think with lvm i can have them for / too
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> zfs! (I heard btrfs can also do great things)
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> Is your home also in /?
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> btrfs unstable
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> yea
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is it, still?
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it has been abandoned
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> so, i think so
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i could move my home
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think it's abandoned
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > In 2020, Btrfs was selected as the default file system for Fedora 33 for desktop variants.[36]
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> pretty likely not abandoned, if fedora has it as default
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> Probably stable enough for home use nowadays
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> And yes not abandoned afaik
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> damn wonder where i heardf that
10:53 < bridge> <zhn> wasn't btrfs maintainer caught for killing his wife or somewhat?
10:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's reiserfs
10:53 < bridge> <zhn> ah makes sense
10:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki zfs (/btrfs) gives you the benefits of lvm plus more stuff
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> You can set up lvm after the fact iirc but for your root idk, I would be sweating bullets
10:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
10:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can convert ext4 to btrfs after-the-fact, I think
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> quite reliably
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> you can even do it in-place iirc
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, in-place
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> my volume has no issues 😃
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> been using it for about a year with the winbtrfs driver
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> which has awesome interface
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i got my home server with 1tb so ill move my stuff there and reinstall gentoo on zfs
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> why reinstall
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> how do u achieve the lvm thing on zfs
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> kernel
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> mobule
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i mean, does zfs have a specific config or smth
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you create a zpool that spans multiple disks
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> It’s builtin, I think they have zpools
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah ok
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> run some commands create device and register with fstab under the name u give it
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> iirc
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> is zfs speed the same?
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> or no noticable change
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use m2 ssds if that counts
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> Wasn’t zfs support on linux rather jank btw? Is it good now?
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like the biggest cloud fs now
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> Wouldn’t btrfs which is linux native be a better idea?
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's incorrect, setting up zfs has nothing to do with fstab
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> not zfs
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> lvm
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's probably more overhead than btrfs. you sometimes have to hold back upgrading kernels because zfs upstream doesn't support them yet
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know btrfs though, so I can't recommend it as the first choice
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because I don't have experience using it
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> Whenever I’m installing a new distro I go through this process of looking whether zfs is upstream yet, whether btrfs is stable enough yet, whether I’ll use lvm, then I end up just going for ext4 on everything and a split home
10:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> zfs will never be upstream, I think
10:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> due to license incompatibility
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah probably some license
11:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you're missing out on CoW file systems
11:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it makes backups of live systems possible in a way that's sane to think about
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> I did use zfs on freebsd back in the day
11:01 < bridge> <learath2> I use the very solid backup strategy of “If I pretend the disks won’t fail they won’t fail” and “Have important stuff on 4-5 disks”
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've only had one disk of mine fail m
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've only had one disk of mine fail me
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and it didn't even have important data
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (ssd)
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (laptop ssd)
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> I’ve had 2 die on me, hdd, they were far too old anyway, I’d already mostly replaced them, lost some ooooold homework
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually not true
11:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the 2/4 teehistorian disks failed without me noticing it
11:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you only needed 2/4 to restore it
11:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (thanks zfs)
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer smth that i can use latest kernel easily
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a gentoo user
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> :EZ:
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill probs go with lvm
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then you could try btrfs?
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> I think eeeee used btrfs ever since it was incredibly unstable
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btrfs also has built-in lvm, I think
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> And if Fedora is making it default it ought to be good enough now
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok mayb ill try btrfs
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> Yes it has builtin lvm and cow and other space age magic
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> checksumming
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that you know that the data is actually not corrupt
12:24 < bridge> <peter44h> I'm using f2fs on my laptop
12:24 < bridge> <peter44h> Since I think it's supposed to reduce wear
12:24 < bridge> <peter44h> It only has 64gb "MMC" storage, it's the worst thing about it
12:26 < bridge> <peter44h> It would suck if it broke but I wouldn't lose any code, I'm not too scared for it
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki btop better stands for bash top axaxax
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao it is
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btop is a c++ rewrite of bashtop xD
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowo scrumpli contributing to htop!! thats big flex! Almost coreutils level. I am surprised the htop soy devs use microsoft github. Them not using mailing lists is probably the reason why htop is not preinstalled on any relevant distro axaxaxa
12:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chiller u such a nerd
12:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> chillerdragon is back in the mines.
12:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> digging those juicy diamonds
13:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe he lost his bash history in the mines and is looking for that one there.
14:16 < bridge> <peter44h> My biggest "flex" is BusyBox vi
14:16 < bridge> <peter44h> And busybox touch
14:16 < bridge> <peter44h> Though in both cases people ended up rewriting my patch anyway
14:16 < bridge> <peter44h> The one thing I hate about mailing lists is that it is just not easy to search prior discussion, you either have to download an mbox and grep though it (which is still painful), and you have to keep pinging and following up patches, or else they will get lost completely
14:19 < bridge> <peter44h> It definitely works but I still feel like I'm doing extra work for no reason using it
14:19 < bridge> <peter44h> Finding rationale for previous changes is hard too
16:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/DDNet-Team-Searcher/ddnet_server/actions/runs/8251484628/job/22568632346 anyone knows how to make this thing pass ☹️
17:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> The solution was pretty easy, just remove everything related to macOS from `build.yml`
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> im proud to announce that edlang can handle projects with multiple files
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
18:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn you make me want to code a calculator in edlang now
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> soon when i add prints
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to but its more complex xd
18:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> formatting :justatest:
18:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
18:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw the edb new command uses the libgit2 api
18:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> to init the repo
18:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
18:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> git methods ? :poggers2:
18:37 < bridge> <sedonya> ok
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> Today I remembered C++ does not have flexible array members either. Why is C++ such a downgrade from C in so many things?
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> Ofc there are always workarounds
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> and tbh im happy C++ handles type safety and memory for you, apart from doign i
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> and tbh im happy C++ handles type safety and memory for you, apart from doing it kind of yourself in C
18:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> and tbh im happy C++ handles type safety and memory for you (in the context of an array ig), apart from doing it kind of yourself in C
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> it initialized the repo with the project
19:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
19:54 < bridge> <matodor> @tsfreddie ddnet-pvp has any config option for disable room settings changes for spectators?
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> But the very pretty `CSPSCQueue<CLogMessage>` I had in mind now has to become typeless because I can't know the length of log messages beforehand, so I'm now forced to either lose type safety or do heap allocations
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> All the workarounds I can think of come at some cost
