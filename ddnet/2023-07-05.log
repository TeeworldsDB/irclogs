00:42 < bridge_> <avolicious> Oh I see, because the C API Type Code expect a long long int... sadge
07:39 < bridge_> <gerdoe> so true ðŸ‘€
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no help for closed sourcerers
07:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ðŸ˜¬
08:33 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> o.0
08:33 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (<@302059820905922560_=47it=48ub>)
08:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Does this at every con ready? That would explain why connecting to local host is also so slow xd
09:04 < bridge_> <gerdoe> client info?
09:06 < bridge_> <gerdoe> patched it and nothing changed honestly xd
09:07 < bridge_> <gerdoe> or maybe i don't pay attention on every server load
09:21 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> not faster?
09:21 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> sadness
09:22 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> maybe its just an edge case
10:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> afaict, yes
11:55 < ChillerDragon> anyone else got irc ads in dms? :D
11:57 < ChillerDragon> jopsti just flush every message client and server side and turn on high bandwidth on server. it quadrouples the overall smoothness and takes up only 10gb/s
12:12 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> xd, i dunno how much it increases traffic, but most traffic happens bcs of snapshots or not?
12:14 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> how much overhead has our packet batching structure, if we have such a thing.. then u can estimate it xd
12:15 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @chillerdragon u the network doc, shows some docs mr doc
12:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> Jupstar: every snapshot flushes
12:16 < ChillerDragon> ye wat heinrich said
12:16 < ChillerDragon> the gameplay relevant part is fast
12:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no reason to flush on every message
12:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's already being flushed every 20ms
12:16 < ChillerDragon> i was obv troling
12:17 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yeah but why not do the theoretical calculation
12:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> during normal gameplay, I'd guess emote messages are the most common ones
12:18 < ChillerDragon> i dont even understand which calc u mean
12:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06.html: integer packig â†’ integer packi**n**g
12:18 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> if u'd directly flush every msg, instead of batching
12:19 < ChillerDragon> knackig packig
12:19 < ChillerDragon> thank heinrich
12:19 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> how much traffic would u safe if u'd do a different compression approach than huffman?
12:19 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @chillerdragon pls calc
12:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I tried to use zstd instead of huffman
12:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> could only get it to a level comparable to huffman
12:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (zstd with dictionary)
12:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: got any docs on the ddnet protocol?
12:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the low-level ddnet 0.6 network extensions
12:23 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> would defs be interesting depending on size of packet and compression algorithm used^^
12:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not aware of better compression algorithms than zstd
12:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (we also want fast compression/decompression)
12:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you tell me one, I could try
12:24 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i dunno, when i google there are many popping up with different pros and cons
12:25 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> most apparently focus on speed
12:25 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> https://github.com/lz4/lz4#benchmarks
12:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> zstd has better compression ratio than zstd AFAIK
12:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> zstd has better compression ratio than lz4 AFAIK
12:25 < bridge_> <reitw> We saw it heinrich
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so lz4 is likely worse than our current compression
12:26 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> but doesnt it always depend on the data
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> note that we probably need some sort of dictionary
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure if lz4 supports that
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes. I tested it on teeworlds packet data
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (not lz4, but I know that zstd usually performs better than zstd)
12:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (not lz4, but I know that zstd usually performs better than lz4)
12:27 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> mh i see
12:27 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 no i got no ddnet docs. but need some bcs idk how ddnet protocol works
12:27 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> and if performance would not matter?
12:27 < ChillerDragon> i will probably write some as soon as i start learning ddnet protocol
12:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if performance would not matter, one could look into lzma
12:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but that's rather for long-term data storage
12:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not on-the-fly compression ^^
12:28 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> well i am impressed that huffman handles so well tbh
12:28 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> is it even considered a compression algorithm, or more like packing?
12:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it replaces bytes by bit sequences
12:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> e.g. the byte 0x00 is replaced by the bit sequence 0
12:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> e.g. the byte 0x00 is replaced by the bit sequence 1
12:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/f508384d259c5ee49e68d42af90d0317003e721c/doc/huffman.md#appendix
12:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> see here for the full replacement list
12:29 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> so i assume the packets are simply too small to be worth for the overhead of compression libs which use some kind of dictionary?
12:29 < ChillerDragon> huffman is nice if you know how your data looks like
12:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's exactly where dictionaries shine
12:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> small packets
12:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because they give the compressor context it can reference
12:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> zstd with dictionary performed much better than zstd without
12:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (I generated a custom dictionary for teeworlds packets)
12:30 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> but still struggled against huffman?
12:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it was comparable
12:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> huffman vs (zstd with dict)
12:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> note that it's not strictly huffman, I guess
12:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it always takes the shorter of huffman and plain
12:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
12:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 615381    test_10000/a
12:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 585381    test_10000/compressed
12:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 933175    test_10000/uncompressed
12:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 760047    test_10000/zstd-default
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 534983    test_10000/zstd-dict
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 534249    test_10000/zstd-dict-nocontentsize
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 573934    test_10000/zstd-dict-nodictid
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure what `a` is
12:34 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> these are 10000 teeworlds packets
12:35 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> compressed = what currently is used?
12:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
12:35 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> a = noby
12:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah. `a` is likely the original packet data
12:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> with packet header
12:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> since it's exactly 3 * 10000 bytes larger than `compressed`
12:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess there are some wins with `zstd-dict`
12:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ~10%
12:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> creates a dict distribution problem though ^^
12:37 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i wonder how much and/or if lzma max can beat that
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I didn't use zstd max either
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wonder if lzma max can beat zstd with dict
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably not
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because it's lots of small files
12:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I can share the files if you want to run experiments on them @jupeyy_keks
12:39 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> did u also benchmark, i wonder if e.g. simd benefits zstd against huffman which we implement our own
12:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think zstd was not clearly faster than huffman
12:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> want to have the files?
12:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Sooner or later i have to write benchmarks indeed, i have to decide which compression i want to use.
12:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Are the files simply byte arrays?
12:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
12:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Guess can't hurt to have them^^
12:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but if you roll your own protocol, you probably need to use your own
12:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Yes
12:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It bin codes everything anyway. So many zeros fall apart xd
12:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> bincode?
12:43 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes
12:43 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> the rust crate
12:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
12:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1126101267266150431/test_10000.tar.zstd
12:44 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> ty
12:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (you want to compress the files in the `uncompressed` directory)
12:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> oh, I got IRC spam
13:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon
13:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im making a grammar aware ddnet config parser
13:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> grammar aware cuz sounds cool
13:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and cuz using lr
13:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Nice for what
13:13 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> not "for what", but "in what". In rust
13:13 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> xd
13:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> That part is obvious
13:17 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But what can I use it for? Finally vim tab completion ?
13:18 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Im pretty happy with my bash Config parser for checking correctness of config files
13:19 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Compat omg phone
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for example
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a good library in case u make a gui to edit ddnet configs
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im sure ur bash config parser doesnt show the errors indicated liike rust does with source code
13:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and mine is probs faster
13:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz LR(1)
13:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and rust
13:23 < bridge_> <wollwolki> Currently working on something compression related, you may wanna look at this paper
13:23 < bridge_> <wollwolki> https://www.areinhardt.de/publications/2012/Ringwelski_Energycon_2012.pdf
13:23 < bridge_> <wollwolki> Did a quick test run with the files above and got a small improvement using LZMH: 584338 vs 585381. Can probably be improved if someone knows about that stuff (I don't...)
13:23 < bridge_> <wollwolki> Here is the example code of the paper
13:23 < bridge_> <wollwolki> https://github.com/CenterForSecureEnergyInformatics/data-compressor/blob/master/DataCompressor/DCLib/src/lzmh.c
13:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> permalink: https://github.com/CenterForSecureEnergyInformatics/data-compressor/blob/2cf54f24dd109952f78d9836b5bccbc7fcb9a3bf/DataCompressor/DCLib/src/lzmh.c
13:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @wollwolki zstd with dictionary seems to perform better than that lzmh
13:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what files above?
13:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I deleted the discord again because I don't remember where I got them from
13:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I deleted the discord message again because I don't remember where I got them from
13:28 < bridge_> <wollwolki> But don't you need to distribute the dict for that? Or did i miss something
13:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, need to distribute a dict with the client
13:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but imho compression on the fly needs to be fast, even if slightly less efficient compressing no?
13:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd consider that fine
13:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes. zstd was okay fast IIRC
13:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 did u try arithmetic coding?
13:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> zstd uses something like arithmetic coding internally
13:30 < bridge_> <wollwolki> LZMH is too fast for the time measurment accuray of their testbench, would need to adjust that for these small files
13:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon: does ur config parser check against config types, min max etc?
13:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my crate parses the header file
13:37 < ChillerDragon> mine also parses the header file but only checks if the config exists or not
13:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nobo
13:37 < ChillerDragon> yea its actually a good idea to do more checks also like str vs int
13:38 < ChillerDragon> the nice thing about my setup is that it checks the code of the actual server it will run
13:38 < ChillerDragon> so it supports custom mods 
13:39 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki thats how my warnings look like
13:39 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1688295370.png
13:39 < ChillerDragon> shoutout to jopsti
13:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye mine loads the config options at runtime
13:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also color str int
13:40 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
13:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and saves the symbol
13:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and desc
13:40 < ChillerDragon> where does it look for the header files?
13:40 < ChillerDragon> now im motivated to improve my bash version
13:41 < ChillerDragon> but i really got other stuff todo x
13:42 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @chillerdragon why was the value even on 0.1? that alone sounds wrong to me.. or was it just a test? XD
13:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
13:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> macro config
13:43 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> macro config has everything
13:43 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar worked on my machine
13:43 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> so it evaluated to zero
13:43 < ChillerDragon> does it parse the macro config at runtime?
13:43 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> bcs string could not be parsed to int
13:43 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar there was a time or mod where 0 crashed the server and 0.1 didnt
13:44 < ChillerDragon> using it eversince and worked wonderfully
13:44 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> it makes no sense tho xD
13:44 < ChillerDragon> pst
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
13:44 < ChillerDragon> yes
13:44 < ChillerDragon> so where does it look for the macro file?
13:44 < ChillerDragon> do i have to provide on when using the lib?
13:44 < ChillerDragon> one*
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for now i copied it
13:44 < ChillerDragon> so u ship it?
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill make so u pass a path
13:45 < ChillerDragon> a
13:45 < ChillerDragon> k
13:45 < ChillerDragon> ok nice so i can use ur lib as a dropin replacement for mine
13:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it also saves the cfg flags
13:45 < ChillerDragon> if i decide to rewrite in rust
13:45 < ChillerDragon> but rust is such a bloat
13:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no u
13:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> rust runs on windows ðŸ™‚
13:46 < ChillerDragon> bash does too
13:47 < ChillerDragon> also not planning to switch back to windows servers anytime soon
13:47 < ChillerDragon> my shell scripts start my tw server
13:47 < ChillerDragon> its bloat to install rust and cargo and cargo install 10min to run a tw server
13:47 < ChillerDragon> while bash compiles and runst blazingly fast and is preinstalled
13:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not on windows
13:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> bash is very much a second-class citizen on windows
13:48 < ChillerDragon> yes
13:48 < ChillerDragon> but then not even microsoft uses windows for servers
13:48 < ChillerDragon> so who cares
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd probably use python over bash tbf
13:49 < ChillerDragon> python has similar bloat level to rust
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also comes preinstalled and is an actually useful programming language ^^
13:49 < ChillerDragon> havent seen a distro with preinstalled python yet
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "bloat" here? ^^
13:49 < ChillerDragon> it has to be installed
13:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> weird name, but ok
13:49 < ChillerDragon> ok python is slimmer than rust i guess 
13:50 < ChillerDragon> because no compile
13:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd guess python is installed on every server you use
13:50 < ChillerDragon> yea i see
13:50 < ChillerDragon> for stuff like that i would always use bash over python
13:51 < ChillerDragon> most of the time im just launching other tools which is just smoother in bash
13:51 < ChillerDragon> python just slows down development time while not even offering much better static analysis if it works or not
13:52 < ChillerDragon> most issues are variable typos those are caught as good by shellcheck as they are by pylint
13:52 < ChillerDragon> but its taste i assume i am just more effective in bash than python
13:53 < ChillerDragon> omg daily ddnet language bashing xd
13:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> its fine, python is evil
13:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> it sets new benchmarks, in slowness xd
13:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> the syntax is for masochists 
13:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @chillerdragon when rewrite ddnet in bash
13:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> no other deps allowed
13:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> bash is pretty useless without external programs
13:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> ^ @chillerdragon challenge for u
14:34 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I want to talk to a superior from ddnet to talk about a particular topic that is necessary to be in the game
14:34 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> go ahead
14:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this chat right here
14:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is a open source game
14:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> unless its a critical security issue u should say it here
14:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or a github issue
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I am writing to address a matter of utmost importance to the gaming community, especially those hailing from the beautiful region of Galicia. I humbly request your esteemed consideration in adding the Galician flag to the renowned game, DDNet.
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> 
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> Allow me to emphasize the significance of incorporating the Galician flag within the game's selection of flags. DDNet, as an online platform connecting players from diverse backgrounds, has proven to be a unifying force that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By introducing the Galician flag, the game can embrace the rich cultural heritage of this historic region and pay homage to its people.
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> 
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> The Galician flag represents the aspirations, values, and identity of a distinct and vibrant community. By integrating it into DDNet, you have the unique opportunity to demonstrate the game's commitment to inclusivity and recognition of its global player base. The sense of pride and belonging experienced by Galician players when they see their flag displayed alongside others will undoubtedly strengthen the sense of community within the g
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> 
14:41 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar some dude wrote a mc server in bash i think it ended up super wonkey because he ran into some limits
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> Moreover, introducing the Galician flag aligns with the broader vision of fostering cultural appreciation and understanding within the gaming community. As players from different corners of the world come together, they exchange not only gaming experiences but also glimpses of each other's cultures. By representing the Galician culture in the game, DDNet can become a powerful instrument for promoting cultural diversity, respect, and frie
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> 
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I understand that incorporating new elements into an established game requires careful consideration and technical implementation. However, I am confident that your talented development team possesses the necessary expertise to achieve this endeavor successfully. The inclusion of the Galician flag will undoubtedly be met with enthusiasm from both the Galician players and the wider DDNet community.
14:41 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> In conclusion, I implore you to recognize the significance of this proposal and take steps to include the Galician flag in DDNet. Your commitment to diversity and cultural appreciation will undoubtedly be celebrated by players worldwide, fostering a stronger sense of community and making the game an even more enjoyable and inclusive experience
14:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> a

14:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @tormenta_de_facha u know the catalan flag is there cuz i translated this to catalan
14:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but unless u translate to galician, i doubt it would be added
14:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> can we get the my backyard flag
14:43 < ChillerDragon> can we ban chatgpt users pls?
14:43 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> the whole message?
14:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> huh?
14:43 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> not chatgpt
14:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the worst is im sure this guy would be against adding catalan flag kek
14:43 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> no
14:43 < ChillerDragon> your wall of text is too big
14:43 < bridge_> <gerdoe> the whole game :troll:
14:43 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> i don t critise any flag
14:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tldr: he wants to add his spanish regional flag
14:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> I actually see no reason why this flag shouldnâ€™t be added. just add it
14:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> create a pool request
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz there are many more like this
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i personally wouldnt mind either
14:44 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I want to have the recognition to all Galician players
14:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> all 3 of them
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its probs just u bro
14:44 < bridge_> <gerdoe> â›²
14:44 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> then also lets add NRW flag xd
14:44 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:44 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia
14:44 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> no
14:44 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> its a bundesland
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> that text is chathpt for sure
14:45 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i still remember this one
14:45 < bridge_> <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3639
14:45 < ChillerDragon> the text is spam for sure
14:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I know people wrote texts like that before chatgpt
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> konsti would ask a certain flag kek
14:45 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> only important flag is taiwan
14:45 < ChillerDragon> also if we add any flags lets add lgbtq+69 rainbow flag first because its nice
14:45 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> maybe it is but i want to have it on the game for the galician players
14:46 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> that is not a region
14:46 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> Galician yes
14:46 < ChillerDragon> i feel offended
14:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> maybe we should remove flags ðŸ˜„
14:46 < ChillerDragon> yikes
14:46 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> add country flags, and regional flags. And put taiwan to country flags
14:46 < bridge_> <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1126131966132092980/image.png

14:46 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> 1 year message
14:46 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> the people change
14:46 < bridge_> <gerdoe> and still no meaning to add any new regional flag kekw
14:47 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i think we once said that we only allow new flags where wikipedia says its a country flag
14:47 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> and this isnt the case for yours @tormenta_de_facha 
14:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur best bet is to translate ddnet to galician
14:47 < bridge_> <gerdoe> if so ddnet should have been added like 89 new flags (russian states)
14:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think if you translate the game into galician, it'll definitely be accepted
14:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is how i got the catalan flag in
14:47 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> lmao
14:47 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 compare the gpt wall english with his other messages
14:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yeah @chillerdragon i agree
14:48 < ChillerDragon> he is clearly too lazy to write an actual proposal and just spams a wall of text that is ai generated
14:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> that seems kinda ridiculous to me man I donâ€™t see why there shouldnâ€™t be a flag for every actual geographical region with people willing to make the flag
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we live in ai society
14:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> " However, I am confident that your talented development team possesses the necessary expertise to achieve this endeavor successfully. "
14:48 < ChillerDragon> its not better than telegram ads imo
14:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> that sentence alone
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lot of political issues
14:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> who cares
14:48 < ChillerDragon> i care
14:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> some ppl recognize regions and others not
14:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we can also do free-for-all flags
14:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> there is no political affiliation
14:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then we'd get a couple of non-regional flags as well though
14:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> why
14:49 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki > konsti would ask a certain flag kek
14:49 < ChillerDragon> :justatest:
14:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lets add catalan independence flag
14:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> anyway players still can add flag of theirs if they want to
14:49 < bridge_> <gerdoe> but in their game client folders
14:50 < ChillerDragon> flags.teeskins.net download server when
14:50 < bridge_> <gerdoe> bruh
14:50 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:50 < bridge_> <gerdoe> another vram collapse coming xd
14:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> unclear why we'd limit it to regional flags if we open it up, I think
14:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> because the flag signifies where you are fromâ€¦
14:50 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @gerdoe XDDD

14:54 < bridge_> <gerdoe> oh
14:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> he already said
14:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> you donâ€™t read
14:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Who needs more than the world flag xd
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz game is in catalan
14:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you translate the game into galician, the flag is probably going to be added
14:54 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> if i translate whole game
14:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i told u
14:54 < ChillerDragon> because chatgpt proposals are auto rejected
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 10 times
14:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
14:54 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i wish there's no help from middle east to force cataloons to rebel

14:57 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @chillerdragon no but u
14:57 < ChillerDragon> no way its bairisch?
14:57 < ChillerDragon> i cant
14:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's Bairisch
14:57 < ChillerDragon> where in german?
14:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> what should I eat
14:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its similar but its its own language, u may understand a bit as a spanish, just like a spanish can recognize some portugese or italian
14:57 < bridge_> <gerdoe> food
14:57 < ChillerDragon> prezels
14:57 < ChillerDragon> and schweinebraten
14:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is it closer to spanish than portuguese is to spanish?
14:57 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> portugese is the same as galician
14:57 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> grÃ¼ÃŸ gott

14:58 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> it is facts
14:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
14:58 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> we can add it at 1. april
14:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> now I wonder if catalan-spanish is closer than swiss german-german
14:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> catalonia is quite old too
14:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (swiss german is incomprehensible to me)
14:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> grÃ¼zi

15:06 < ChillerDragon> at least ddnet already has a dragon flag :) 
15:06 < ChillerDragon> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet/ddnet/master/data/countryflags/BT.png
15:07 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> where is the traduction for ddnet?
15:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you need to edit text files
15:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you download ddnet, you can find it in data/languages
15:08 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> yea
15:08 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> okay
15:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> editing an existing file would be easiest for testing
15:08 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> thx
15:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> hi
15:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> If we add random languages to the game, we need a concept of fall back languages. If we don't have that yet
15:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Bcs i kinda doubt the maintainer will stay active xd
15:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how up-to-date is the catalan translation?
15:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we shouldâ„¢ get a better translation UI than text files
15:13 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> best would be over web, with directly upload/sync or smth (with accounts probs)
15:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we could use something like this: https://weblate.org/en/
15:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> tr files not good enough?
15:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> plenty of tr editors
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what is tr?
15:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> ts. sorry
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Typescript? Xd
15:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what is ts?
15:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> im thinking of po apparently
15:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> brainmoment
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, we don't support po right now ^^
15:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i think theres a bug in the serbian translations
15:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1126142451187449956/image.png
15:28 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> well i dont speak serbian
15:28 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> so maybe just fix it? xd
15:29 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ok
15:29 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> tbh the whole serbian translation looks messy, i wanna try fixing it some time
15:30 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> bcs of the space requirements?
15:30 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> or bcs of the translations
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> text shrinking was a mistake :p
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it looks worse than cut-off text
15:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> agreed
15:30 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> but loosing information isnt better tbh
15:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> scroll
15:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> or design better
15:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, but we don't have that :/
15:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> forcing people to provide better translations ^^
15:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> would be my strategy
15:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> the ui needs to not force size constraints on text unless really necessary
15:32 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> scroll is also semi good solution.., guess our UI is simply too bloated generally
15:32 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> like the language is very wordy
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i should update it
15:33 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> https://ddnet.org/news/client-translations/
15:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @jupeyy_keks custom fallback langs for translations would be cool, e.g if not all catalan or galician is translated, fallback to spanish
15:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> will that blend in?
15:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and then to english
15:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or will you notice that it's spanish not catalan?
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u will notice ofc, but if u dont know english u will understand
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz 99.9% know spanish
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe same with ukranian and russian etc
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> portuguese
15:35 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> tbh i hate the german translations xDD
15:35 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> KARTE
15:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> 99.9% catalonians u mean
15:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> cuz i sure donâ€™t speak spanish
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye i meant that obv
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i meant per translation fallback
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> catalan -> spanish -> eng
15:36 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i guess in europe pretty much everyone understands english good enough to start the game xd
15:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I had problems with english when I was young

15:39 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> "physics mode" or smth
15:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> entities is even weird in english
15:39 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> entities is actually a stupid word

15:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> tees are easily translated to t-shirts
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @mercadona_ is that a discord server?
15:44 < bridge_> <gerdoe> not at all cuz west-slav affected ukrainian so 50/50
15:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @mercadona_ non-english goes to #off-topic
15:45 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar i did apt install DDNet-Server
15:45 < bridge_> <mercadona_> sry mb
15:45 < bridge_> <mercadona_> nvm
15:45 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> since when does ddnet call external shell scripts? lmao
15:45 < ChillerDragon> i doubt it
15:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> I decided on honey bunches of oats
15:45 < ChillerDragon> i think i bugged something
15:46 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i think gpt translated it to "tea"
15:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Ð§Ð°Ñ˜ (ÄŒaj)
15:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there's a function called `shell_exec` in ddnet @chillerdragon
15:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> so appamore analyses the binary file?
15:48 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> and not runtime
15:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, it's runtime
15:49 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> we unconditionally call shell_exec?
15:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I have no clue
15:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was trying to give pointers
15:49 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> for what i wonder xD
15:50 < ChillerDragon> it was indeed a issue on my side
15:51 < ChillerDragon> i expected doing apt install ddnet-server and running DDNet-Server runs ddnet but it didnt :D
15:51 < ChillerDragon> it ran my old apparmor test which i put into /usr/bin/ and apt didnt overwrite it
15:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you should not put stuff into /usr/bin
15:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you're allowed to put stuff into /usr/local/bin
15:51 < ChillerDragon> yea i did it when doing my ddnet apparmor pr
15:52 < ChillerDragon> if i had put it in usr local bin the apparmor profile wouldnt have kicked in
15:52 < ChillerDragon> to test if it catches shell spawns
15:54 < bridge_> <teero777> what about making the text slide?
15:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> thats also just a semi fix
15:54 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> would you not be annoyed by it?
15:55 < bridge_> <teero777> idk? animated parts may be annoying but its better than not beeing able to read what it says because its too small
15:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> our font size is very big, so i assume this isnt really  a problem
15:55 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> the text must be really long xd
15:56 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> and then waiting 5 seconds to read it would also be annoying xD
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> perhaps we could use the tooltips someone introduced
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so you can hover the text
15:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to see the full thing
15:58 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> or load all translations and show the UI designer/programmer the longest one :D
15:58 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> and if the text is extra long, fix translations
15:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or get metrics for the text width and help translators see them out-of-game
15:58 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> or all of that xd
15:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> btw we could do a "edit" mode for all labels to become input fields
15:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> then they can edit realtime in the client
15:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> i think robyte refactored most UI code to use a Label() function
15:59 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> so it should work in most cases
15:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that sounds super hard ðŸ˜®
15:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but would be cool
16:01 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> @Robyt3 feature request 
16:01 < bridge_> <teero777> https://tenor.com/view/kermit-darkside-star-wars-evil-innerme-gif-13048146
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @robyt3
16:02 <@heinrich5991> test @heinrich5991
16:03 <@heinrich5991> test @jupeyy_keks
16:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you have to use the account name apparently
16:03 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> capital letters not allowed anymore if u want to ping
16:03 < ws-client1> <Jupstar> yes
16:47 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> Who did I pass the Galician translation to?
16:47 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I have finished it
16:47 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious how small are the kog server docker images?
16:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/
16:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's quite fast. have you tested it in the client to check whether the strings look good?
16:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can upload the translation to this discord channel
16:49 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> okay
16:52 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1126163655109644388/galician.txt
16:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you should probably mention that this is based on the spanish translation (in the header)
16:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the `Password` string looks wrong
16:57 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> what is this i don t understand what u refere
16:58 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> what is this i don t understand what u mean
16:58 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> what is that i don t understand what u mean
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> Password
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> == Contrasinal incorreta
16:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
16:59 < bridge_> <avolicious> Roughly 120mb, But the new Alpha Build is 62mb ðŸ˜…
17:00 < ChillerDragon> oh ok i thought mine is big :D
17:00 < ChillerDragon> i assume urs is closed src ^ 
17:00 < bridge_> <avolicious> We had to Compile grpc in it, so it added 40 mb ðŸ¥¹
17:00 < ChillerDragon> didnt u add grpc to save space? :D 
17:01 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> okay i have done the 2 things
17:01 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> I upload it other time?
17:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm still going through it, wait a second
17:02 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yep After we Are fully Done with it, i can replace curl, MySQL and other Packages and Build a scratch or alpine Container
17:02 < ChillerDragon> ok so u full on work in progress?
17:02 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yep
17:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @tormenta_de_facha is 'quecemento' a word in galician?
17:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I can't find it in dictionaries (I don't speak the language, I can't know though)
17:05 < bridge_> <mercadona_> you search on the rag?
17:06 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1126167150848114821/image.png

17:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you send a link?
17:06 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> https://academia.gal/dicionario/-/termo/quecemento
17:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks!
17:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @tormenta_de_facha can you re-upload the current version?

17:13 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious ok my first attempt w out maps is 22.9MB
17:14 < ChillerDragon> ah also no mysql
17:14 < ChillerDragon> probably super unfair comparison :D
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why do you want to put it into a container, ChillerDragon?
17:16 < ChillerDragon> i dont feel comfortable saying it out loud yet xd
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ok ^^
17:16 < ChillerDragon> dw ill share when ill do
17:17 < ChillerDragon> im probably too lazy anways so i dont wanna mention it yet
17:18 < ChillerDragon> anyways if someone needs a 22mb basic ddnet server dockerfile here it is https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-server-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> docker is closed private corporate bloat
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon can u do a pod for podman
17:19 < ChillerDragon> im using podman obv
17:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> permanent link: https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-server-docker/blob/cf2458532e0caf5fb8e568821230a810449ab686/Dockerfile
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
17:20 < ChillerDragon> i assume it also works w docker
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @tormenta_de_facha how do you abbreviate north america in galician?
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> should it be NA or AN?
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> same question for south america
17:21 < bridge_> <mercadona_> same
17:21 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> Is the same at spanish
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> at work we have self hosted github ci with m1,m2, cuda, metal
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> epic
17:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so NA or AN?
17:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I didn't understand your answer
17:23 < bridge_> <mercadona_> NA
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> na and an are wrong
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in spanish is EEUU
17:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> for spanish?
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estados_Unidos
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, but I don't mean the USA
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but the north american continent
17:24 < bridge_> <mercadona_> man, is NA
17:24 < bridge_> <mercadona_> NorteAmerica
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, understood
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was just talking about spanish with @ryozuki
17:25 < bridge_> <avolicious> @chillerdragon we had Problems with alpine because of musl as far as i can remember
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmm now that u say it, i never rly seen a the abbreviate form
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ppl here just speak about usa or south america xd
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and we just say america del norte or america del sur
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what about mexico and canada? ðŸ˜„
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> america central
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> canada?
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> america del norte?
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its north america right
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki where did you get the ISO 3166-1 code for catalonia?
17:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cat doesnt have it
17:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 900-999 are user-assigned
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is another iso
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk if there is another iso xd
17:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I also had my fair share of musl fun at work haha. But compiling ddnet from source with default flags is smooth. So no MySQL and whatever else you can opt into
17:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@avolicious)
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ISO 639-2 Code
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cat
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it would be      ES-CT i think
17:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:ES
17:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's the catalonia flag called? in ddnet?
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant open ddnet rn
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im at work
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it should tell if u open and search
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> XCA or something with x
17:38 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> CatalÃ 
17:38 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> is the name
17:38 < bridge_> <mercadona_> Yes, is XCA
17:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> who draws our flags?
17:46 < bridge_> <mercadona_> what do you mean?
17:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> This has two issues: 1) we can't show the real tooltip and the too-long-text tooltip at the same time 2) Every tooltip must be associated with a UI element ID, so we either add `static int s_TooltipFoo` everywhere or think about dynamic registering of UI element IDs
17:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> Would also need to introduce a UI element ID for every single `DoLabel`
17:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'd prefer if we just make it easier to check the length of translations so translators can ensure that existing translations fit, instead of adding workarounds for it
17:56 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Go to GitHub press t for fuzzy file search and Iâ€™ll find flags in no time
17:56 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@ryozuki)
17:56 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ull! Phone
18:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if thats the only issue, just mask the ID DoLabel gets ^^
18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. all pointers are even
18:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> `DoLabel` doesn't get any ID at the moment though
18:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> Pointers to CUIRect and text are usually not static
18:12 < bridge_> <tormenta_de_facha> one question we need to do this checklist us?
18:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i tought of something but probs not doable as easy as in rust
18:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u could gen a id with a macro using the current line and col and filename
18:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (idk why we talking about ids but i thought of this)
18:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> We need UI IDs so elements can have an effect when hovered, like being a button or showing a tooltip
18:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> `MouseHovered` works without, but this does not consider popup menus being above UI elements
18:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just redo all UI and do what egui/imgui does
18:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :ez:
18:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ur pr is wrong
18:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> DATA does not contain every file from directory data
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```c
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> program.c:24:79: error: alias must point to a defined variable or function
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> void ptr(program_return_values_t *, void *, uint64_t) __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("_mlir_ciface_program::program::main")));
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 can u alias a symbol not defined? xd
18:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u gotta use dlsym right
19:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```c
19:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> static int ptr() __attribute__ ((weakref ("_mlir_ciface_program::program::main")));
19:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
19:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this works
20:51 < bridge_> <learath2> mh, I'm not sure what you are trying to do here, but no you can not alias something you didn't define in this TU
21:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not defined in C itself but linked i guess
21:03 < bridge_> <learath2> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html I'm fairly sure it has to be defined in C in this TU
21:03 < bridge_> <learath2> (or C++)
21:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the second works xd
21:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gotta check what we rly do
21:13 < bridge_> <learath2> This is the problem with extensions, the document is like 1/5th the quality of the standard, documentation for `weakref` says you are allowed to not have a definition, but it also says it's equivalent to `alias` which explicitly prohibits having no definition
21:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, I see I was misreading it, I guess you need both declarations, anyway the thing is `weakref` allows the definition not to be there, that's why the second works
21:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
