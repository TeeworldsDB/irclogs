10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> Hello
10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> eny Body here?
10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> Hellllo
10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
10:21 < Hamid_Jigool> :-(
10:24 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna ask a question
10:24 < Hamid_Jigool> common
11:29 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: yes?
11:35 < Hamid_Jigool> hi dear deen
11:35 < Hamid_Jigool> Can you help me?
11:35 < Hamid_Jigool> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=68&p=29518#p29518
11:35 < Hamid_Jigool> see the topic
11:36 < Hamid_Jigool> Please
11:36 <@heinrich5991> well, where do you want to create that sound?
11:36 < Hamid_Jigool> :-S
11:36 < Hamid_Jigool> gamecontex.cpp
11:36 <@heinrich5991> where on the map I mean
11:36 < Hamid_Jigool> no on source mod
11:36 <@heinrich5991> sounds in teeworlds have a position on the map
11:37 <@heinrich5991> the first parameter to CreateSound specifies the position
11:37 <@heinrich5991> where should your sound go? :)
11:37 < Hamid_Jigool> "src\game\server\gamecontex.cpp"
11:37 < Hamid_Jigool> Serach for Happy for example
11:37 < Hamid_Jigool> emote happy
11:38 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna make sound when player have emote happy
11:38 < Hamid_Jigool> for example you know?
11:38 <@heinrich5991> so you want the sound to be on the position of the player that does that emote?
11:38 < Hamid_Jigool> ye whith CreateSound void
11:39 <@heinrich5991> so then you need to figure out a way to get the current player's position, no?
11:40 < Hamid_Jigool> ye
11:40 < Hamid_Jigool> in character.cpp 
11:40 < Hamid_Jigool> use m_Pos
11:40 < Hamid_Jigool> but in gamecontex.cpp it doesn't work
11:41 <@heinrich5991> I believe you're not really understanding what you're programming. you should ask yourself the question: where does the m_Pos in character.cpp come from?
11:41 <@heinrich5991> and how can I get that in the code in gamecontext.cpp
11:41 <@heinrich5991> perhaps you should try to read a c++ tutorial
11:42 < Hamid_Jigool> an Example code in charecter.cpp : GameServer()->CreateSound(m_Pos, SOUND_RIFLE_BOUNCE);
11:42 < Hamid_Jigool> this code work
11:42 < Hamid_Jigool> but in character.cpp ... i wannat creat a code like that in gamecontex.cpp
11:42 < Hamid_Jigool> you know?
11:43 <@heinrich5991> yes, I do understand you
11:43 < Hamid_Jigool> we must define m_Pos in gamecontex.cpp
11:43 < Hamid_Jigool> but i dont know how
11:44 <@heinrich5991> that is not the problem, you need to get the same m_Pos as you get in character.cpp. please read some c++ tutorial, or try to find the place where m_Pos is defined for your code in character.cpp
11:45 <@heinrich5991> hint: look into the header of character.cpp
11:48 < Hamid_Jigool> can we use the code in other file like player.cpp for emote?
11:49 <@heinrich5991> no, just copying code around does not work.
11:49 <@heinrich5991> see, in character.cpp you're in the context of one player
11:49 < Hamid_Jigool> or must be in gamecontex.cpp? i mean the file that emotes define in it
11:49 <@heinrich5991> so it makes sense that you have a global m_Pos, the player position
11:49 < Hamid_Jigool> ye
11:49 <@heinrich5991> but the position of which player would m_Pos be in gamecontext.cpp, where you have many player positions?
11:50 <@heinrich5991> from a logical point of view, it makes sense that there isn't a single position in gamecontext.cpp, you need some way to specify whose player's position you want
11:57 < Hamid_Jigool> Only one person has ever been able to do it, and he who does not teach
11:57 < Hamid_Jigool> I have about 3 years that I ask this question of all
11:58 < Hamid_Jigool> oh god :-(
12:27 <@deen> In ~ 2 days DDNet will have its millionth finish
14:42 < NiKiS> deen, hi, is there something you can do to ban a server in all ddnet clients?
14:43 < NiKiS> like does ddnet client use own master master-bans.cfg?
14:47 <@deen> hi NiKiS 
14:47 <@deen> no, we don't (and shouldn't do that)
14:47 <@deen> ) do that*
14:47 <@deen> NiKiS: we use the regular TW master servers
14:47 <@deen> why are you asking?
14:48 <@heinrich5991> deen: see #teeworld
14:48 <@heinrich5991> s
14:49 < NiKiS> deen, thanks
16:12 < Nimda> Mud by FÅˆokurka oo7 just released on Solo at 2015-11-17 16:09
16:41 <@deen> The new Mud map looks cool
16:41 <@deen> like a tutorial map
17:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #376: only send isddnet to server if gametype is ddnet (master...pr_isddnet) http://git.io/v4zgR
