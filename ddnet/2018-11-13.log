08:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Lexin well, replaying demo is not 100% the same as doing it live.  at least that should mean that it's something cpu side not gpu I guess
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Jupstar ✪ i could try testing latest betas in my laptop and making a scoreboard about it
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if nobody can profile it, the easiest would be to know what client version is the first lagging after 10.8.6
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lexin> @deen that‘s what it „felt“ like to me aswell. Obviously starting either 10.8.6 or 11.x they use the same config data and thus the same graphic settings.
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lexin> Either way it‘s mimimi on a high lvl since 10.8.6 is working for me, i‘ll just check out new version on rls and see if it works

23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen synconized option in the editor is not even working on latest 11.4.6
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> synconized option in the editor is not even working on latest 11.4.6
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i really dont know it was happent since 11.x versions so im not gonna download older versions to fix that
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or is it server based to even get it worked?? ddnet server were programmed to disable syncronized anim?
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Cellegen see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1318
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> it's by design
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ammm
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> k
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just pls
