13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> rip?
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it is best time to invest rn
13:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> we all knew that this lill crash spike will come because no brain money dudes joining the crypto scene. But the price will go back to 20k or even higher.
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 shows a "domain is for sale" for me
13:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Me either
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://bitcoin.pl/kurs
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> polish site, but you should udnerstand graph
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
13:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> "kurs" sounds german
13:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's polish
13:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :p
13:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> so polis is german?
13:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> never
13:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol
13:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Czy to brzmi jak niemiecki ?
13:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Anyway, polish has a lot borrowed words from foreign languages
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and Poland were occupied by over a hundred years, so probably we have something from german, russians etc.
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> especially silesia
14:00 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> or german was influenced by polish
14:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you believe in that?
14:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Nevermind, it's not historical channel
14:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye go #historical
14:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xd
14:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> The bubble of bitcoin broke
14:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What do you predict? next year 50k$?
14:04 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: forgot the o
14:05 <+Learath2> we were all expecting a crash, noone expected a 25% fall, nor did anyone expect coinbase to peg the price of btc to bch causing both to fall, nor did anyone expect 200b$ shrinkage in total crypto market cap
14:06 <+Learath2> pls don't be all, oh is normal
14:06 <+Learath2> is great time to invest tho tru
14:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye it is
14:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and i was 90% sure it will go down to 800 or 10000 for a short while
14:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> bubble xd
14:09 <+Learath2> if you were that sure you should have shorted btc :P
14:09 <+Learath2> also there is 9200$ difference between 800 and 10000

14:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> shorting crypto is evil lul
14:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> investing after crash is nicer
14:12 <+Learath2> I'd short it if I knew it'd crash this much :P

19:18 <+Learath2> I'm forced to hold bitcoin b/c if I move it to an exchange to sell I lose all my profits on transaction fees :D
19:53 <+fstd> Learath2: what stops you from setting a zero tx fee?
19:53 <+fstd> if it goes through, it's fine; if it doesn't, then it doesn't
19:54 <+fstd> my last 0 fee transaction went through within 12 hours or so
19:55 <+fstd> it's been a few months since, but people were already bitching about tx fees being so damn high and hurr
20:25 <+Learath2> 1 hr is around 40$ now
20:26 <+Learath2> I guess I could put 20sat/b and wait
