00:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chilleroni peperoni. I invited you to a repo. can you update your league servers to that version if possible
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet the upload failed again
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that happened quite often in the past
00:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> so that we can make sure that people use a trusted client for the next matches

00:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> k, now we need to host those executables somewhere üòÑ first tests look great, big thanks heinrich5991
00:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://downloads.zcat.ch/
00:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> server executables can be downloaded here.
00:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> for now, might move to the league website at some more sane time of the day.
00:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> big thanks to heinrich (Y) for helping with the trusted client

07:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think its something you use explicitly, this allows rust to express more its memory model and maybe more optimizations
07:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> good read https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2022/04/11/provenance-exposed.html
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The three core pillars of this approach are:
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     making pointer-integer casts ‚Äúexpose‚Äù the pointer‚Äôs provenance,
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     offering ptr.addr() to learn a pointer‚Äôs address without exposing its provenance,
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     and making pointer-integer transmutation round-trips lossy (such that the resulting pointer cannot be dereferenced).
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Together, they imply that we can optimize ‚Äúnice‚Äù code (that follows Strict Provenance, and does not ‚Äúexpose‚Äù or use integer-pointer casts) perfectly, without any risk of breaking code that does use pointer-integer round-trips. In the easiest possible approach, the compiler can simply treat pointer-integer and integer-pointer casts as calls to some opaque external function. Even if the rest of the compiler literally entirely ignores the ex
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
07:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> > However, it‚Äôs not just compilers and optimizers that benefit from this approach. One of my biggest quests is giving a precise model of the Rust aliasing rules, and that task has just gotten infinitely easier. I used to worry a lot about pointer-integer round-trips while developing Stacked Borrows. This is the entire reason why all of this ‚Äúuntagged pointer‚Äù mess exists.
07:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> well if u deal with pointers and do ur pointer stuff with that api its probs better

09:03 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, seems fixed. It nuked my custom arrow.png etc. in my data folder though :greenthing:
09:12 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you dont need it
09:13 < bridge> <syrinok> Already had backups and replaced them all :feelsamazingman:
09:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk how a different arrow.png helps with banning cheaters
09:15 < bridge> <syrinok> idk how your trolling helps with banning cheaters, you could've been a moderator. You've failed us all.
09:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> its your fault
09:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you said i could never be a moderator
09:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> put custom files in config directory, then they will never be overridden by an upgrade
09:25 < bridge> <syrinok> Didn't know it'd pull these specific files from that folder, good to know

09:27 < bridge> <syrinok> Roaming ddnet folder
09:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> archive.org is inside the US, and by association supports israel's war? sounds stupid

10:31 < bridge> <reitw> surrealdb good, apple no
10:32 < bridge> <avolicious> Apple Keynotes are awesome
10:32 < bridge> <reitw> should try surrealdb on a real project
10:32 < bridge> <avolicious> They know how to sell stuff
10:33 < bridge> <reitw> recently they know how to disappoint people on features
10:33 < bridge> <avolicious> Are you talking about Apple Intelligence?
10:33 < bridge> <reitw> not only
10:33 < bridge> <reitw> apple intelligence's issues are most commonly due to EU
10:34 < bridge> <avolicious> All the cool stuff is mostly limited due to EU
10:34 < bridge> <avolicious> Imagine you want to build your EU Cloud, but have no clue how hyperscalers work
10:34 < bridge> <reitw> yes, but even without it it wouldn't be released with all its components

10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't just work for games or game developers
10:55 < bridge> <reitw> well most of features are useless to me as I wouldn't use them
10:55 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont play games anymore
10:55 < bridge> <reitw> I like more open envs

10:57 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont play teeworlds anymore, no
10:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just remember all the good moments you had
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "It just works for me." would probably not have triggered my response ^^
10:58 < bridge> <avolicious> But I wanted your response üòÑ Sitting in a meeting right now & have to wait for others to finish their proposal

10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that true? that sounds bad ^^
10:58 < bridge> <avolicious> I do, I had fun for a lot of hours
10:59 < bridge> <avolicious> But at some point, you will have to move on üòÑ My financ√©e needs attention too, so less teeworlds guys
11:00 < bridge> <avolicious> But no worries, I'll continue to pay for the servers ^^
11:01 < bridge> <avolicious> And merge upstream ddnet

18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you mean with account?
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does ddnet itself crash?
18:32 < bridge> <reitw> I am so much of an Android user since years, ig I can't switch because I'd need to learn again to use smth else (people say Apple is intuitive, lmao absolutely not, it's as intuitive as android)

18:35 < bridge> <learath2> `specious` = seemingly reasonable, but wrong
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> `sagacious` = `shrewd`/`wise`
18:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> is specious pronounced: Spesius or spiisious
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> `spiishus`
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> `spiishes`
18:37 < bridge> <learath2> or `spi: É…ôs` if you know IPA
19:03 < bridge> <avolicious> I used Android for years, but had to switch over as Google Pay and several other products where kinda useless for me - even after talking with the vendors ( my banks & app developers ) I was pissed off. ( Had a OnePlus )
19:04 < bridge> <avolicious> So I bought an Apple, because you only get it from 1 company, Apple. They support it, you can go to a genius bar and ask your stuff and you also have seamless integration with nearly all products from the apple family. Thats my personal experience and I really enjoyed it

19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 50:50
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> Imagine all of TSMC, Intel, Nvidia secrets becoming public domain. Just the thought of it is pleasant
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would be interesting for sure, I also have my problems with how patents work.
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But that wouldn't mean you suddenly have the skilled workers to do the same out of nowhere.
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> We can keep paying the skilled workers, will also seize all assets of the corporations and the personal assets of the executives
19:16 < bridge> <learath2> It's the perfect plan, take back all the wealth the 1% siphoned off. I'll start planning
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> I just have to become the president of the united states
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ez

20:11 < bridge> <teero777> I doubt many would even understand anything
