00:06 < bridge> <kio> guyz
00:07 < bridge> <kio> i wanna do a button with a border
00:07 < bridge> <kio> and i did it but i want that the body of the button is 0.5 alpha and the border 1 alpha, how can i do a mask on the lower button that give border effect?
00:09 < bridge> <kio> thats what i want
00:09 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108516780831420476/image.png
00:10 < bridge> <kio> thats what i want

00:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> draw a round rect with 1.0f alpha, then draw another rect with 0.5f alpha and 1 pixel smaller on all sides
00:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> well, then you don't have transparent background
00:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> so I don't think it's possible
00:13 < bridge> <kio> exactly
00:13 < bridge> <kio> crying
00:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> you'll need to write your own function to draw the border then
00:14 < bridge> <kio> done
00:14 < bridge> <kio> but i don't want the bg
00:14 < bridge> <kio> idk how to remove a section of button
00:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> can you just render the button as a sprite?
00:16 < bridge> <Learath2> My brain is malfunctioning a little, are these two equivalent? `n & 0xB4 == 0xB4` and `n >= 0xB4`?
00:17 < bridge> <deen> I don't think so. replacing 0xB4 with 0x1
00:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unlikely
00:18 < bridge> <kio> @deen u know how to do that?
00:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm
00:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. 0xb8?
00:18 < bridge> <Learath2> If the very first bit is set, isn't it guaranteed that the numbers is either 1 or larger than 1?
00:18 < bridge> <Learath2> No it's not
00:18 < bridge> <deen> no idea, sorry
00:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, it's actually quite hard to check greater than when I only have & and == at my disposal 😄
00:19 < bridge> <kio> ok 😦
00:19 < bridge> <kio> jesus christ made this game
00:19 < bridge> <kio> :justatest:
00:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh there are ranges in u32 too
00:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you doing?
00:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> and no any other bitwise operation available?
00:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Nah, but I noticed I can actually just check if numbers are within a range too
00:23 < bridge> <Learath2> so I'll do 0&0xFFFF=0xB4:0xFFFF
01:39 < bridge> <kio> is it a good pratice?
02:41 < bridge> <Ewan> no
05:13 < bridge> <YupHio> Bruh wtf are you working on where you only have the & and == operators available? Genuinely curious
07:13 < bridge> <Voxel> oh shit wait
07:13 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108623416845676554/image.png

10:43 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
10:43 < bridge> <Voxel> what the hell

10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> proof
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> some more than could work didnt test xd
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int a = decltype(a)(5);
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int a = decltype(a){5};
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int a = int(5);
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int a = int{5};
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int a = {5};
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> auto a = 5;
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> auto a = int(5);
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> c++ is bloat af
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean they all have a similar scheme
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bloated
11:38 < bridge> <Learath2> All of the above and all of them are technically different types of initialization that can have different effects. (Not for a primitive like int, but still)
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am once again compiling llvm
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill die of old age
13:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> review PR in the mean-time
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which
13:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> this
13:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> we need a release soon or I will keep adding stuff :justatest:
13:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 no, keep going
13:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw i review it, looks good
13:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to learn how the textcontainer stuff works
13:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also wanna add/do more stuffs but idk what
13:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> very soon
13:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108716996310351944/image.png
13:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 17.0 will be big
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iwanted to add postgres support
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the postgres syntax differs way too much
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unlike sqlite and mysql, which they resemble
13:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i stopped
13:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you wanna debug a log then solving #4339 would be cool
13:28 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4339
13:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you wanna debug a lot then solving #4339 would be cool
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never said i like debugging :justatest:
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and is this still a thing
13:29 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah
13:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the issue should be updated to reflect the last update then
13:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i personally ignore old client issues
13:29 < bridge> <Robyt3> it's easy to reproduce
13:30 < bridge> <Robyt3> I renamed the issue to the duplicate issue that described it a lot better
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 can u send again ur issue bookmark
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with the filters
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i  forgot
13:30 < bridge> <Robyt3> `is:issue sort:updated-desc is:open -label:needs-discussion -label:to-reproduce -label:incomplete -label:"3rd party" -label:discussion `
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe someone can pin it
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ehem
13:31 < bridge> <Robyt3> basically excludes all the stuff that can't be immediately implemented
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we should label new issues tho xd
13:31 < bridge> <Robyt3> GitHub search for relevant issues: `is:issue sort:updated-desc is:open -label:needs-discussion -label:to-reproduce -label:incomplete -label:"3rd party" -label:discussion`
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ima label some
13:32 < bridge> <Learath2> I really need to get #5842 done and in :/
13:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5842
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 i think there is a way, to make a issue template, and that template can set labels automatically (normal ppl dont have rights usually)
13:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill look into it
13:32 < bridge> <Robyt3> "no label" either means it's an old issue, it's a new issue, or it's an issue where we are not sure about it
13:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Every update we make before I finish this is a little sus, there is UB in the updater :pepeW:
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 no, u need to do this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5558
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i asked if i should take over it
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> some days ago
13:33 < bridge> <Learath2> I asked a question in the comments
13:33 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm unsure how to finish that pr 😄
13:34 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean I can implement what was asked, that's not the issue, but is it good UX?
13:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, but maybe just create a label for "new-issue" or do you want the user to add labels like "bug" and "enhancement"?
13:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc we can make a simple 3 issue options, client bug ,server, bug, feature
13:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i saw it o na repo
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108719465388056667/image.png

13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it allows big customization
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can look into it
13:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> there are also some issues that are just like questions or support requests basically
13:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe we should add a label for those or eventually close them
13:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> #5899
13:37 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5899
13:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> #6189
13:37 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6189
13:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> Is #6594 fixed now?
13:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6594
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should upgrade SDL2 finally, so nightly players can report bugs early
13:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> yes
13:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> @deen
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki do u need a task for a pr? xd
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur tasks never good
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add tooltips for those ^
14:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> I opened a very simple issue, but I marked it with a new label "good first issue" so maybe a new contributor comes along
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we should do that
14:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet bus factor is 2 rn
14:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well 1.5
14:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> robyt is 1 and im 0.6

14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki what table do u have? XD
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>

14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Jupeyy_Keks did you try McPlant
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, is that meat alternatives?
14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ohhh, I crave some good makke donalds right now
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried them all xd
14:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
14:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> McPlant Burgers and McPlant Nuggies
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i find LIDL vegan nuggets good
14:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Hm.
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but generally i only use meat alternatives for nudels with bolognese
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So you dont like to have a nice burger or smth?
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> U just go with the more calorie salad? xd
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> In mcd
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> burgers sometimes, my mum sometimes makes one, completely self made
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are insanely nice xD
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> With meat?
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with fake meat, but also self made
14:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea okey
14:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Whats the reason u dont beat your meat, ehh eat some meat
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont need it, so i dont do it xd
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like to not kill animals for no logical reason
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea alright see your point
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt eat meat since 13 years. so i really dont miss it anyway 😄
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wow
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like to eat meat cuz its tasty
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i probably dont even know how it tastes anymore
14:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think i'll go to mc donalds today
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
14:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I have the rainbow glass

14:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks update to sdl3
14:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I should stand up and eat
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i was young, i always had chicken from ALDI. they were awesome, but they were also bumped with spices.. so it probably wasnt the meat itself that was nice xD
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets go
14:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i cant find sdl3 docs
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/milestones
14:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md
14:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well sdl looks like its still in dev
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like sdl
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but with rust, i prefer winit
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> SDL is unmatched feature and platform wise
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also like it keeps thing separate, unix philosophy
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for example, if sdl has a bug with audio, u need to update whole sdl
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> winit focuses on windowing and window input only
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it's way too unstable on Windows, even tho windows should be the most stable with most testers
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and providing a surface handle
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But i blame ms
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But the repo picture
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just noticed lmfao
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Such trolls
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel https://github.com/parasyte/pixels
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is also a good alternative to macroquad
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u know a simple thing to do to learn machine learning related stuff
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to look at rust crates
15:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> using gpu ofc
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess reading numbers in from pixels
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> ah very pog ryo and joüpsti doing room tour!
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> !ryo why u have electron bloat open instead of vim? busted
15:18 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> !jup u famous pro streamer or waddup with ur wall?
15:19 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c when do you do roomtour. but i bet everything made out of gold and diamonds
15:19 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i switch between vscode and vim a lot
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c yeah i tried it out to reduce echo
15:19 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbh it'd need to do all walls and that would suck xd
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so failed experiment xD
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> im scared of leak xd
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am open human
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cant leak anything

15:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> having access to teehistorian maybe we can train a ddnet ai
15:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time to buy big ssd
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> time to build client that is ready to get ai code plugged in
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u could for sure
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> !rust when ddnet-rs headless client?
15:31 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
15:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the first step is to make the format as simple as possible and without unneeded stuff i guess
15:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller do u have a headless client
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> i got all of them
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> ryo u rly gotta try out term-ux

15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 prepared for anti updaters complains?
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Axax i only have 1 Monitor
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> gimp 4
15:42 < bridge> <Knuski> troll

15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> inb4 someone has "nameless tee" as a friend and is now annoyed that they have 15 online friends all the time
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 do u know if the search is fuzzy?
15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> no, it's exact
15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> there is `cl_friends_ignore_clan` to ignore the clan
15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> but name and clan are matched exactly
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> exact ignore case?
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> omg i cant stop stalkin yo guys i find other ppls setups so fun xd
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684417454.png
15:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> no, `str_comp`, so also same case necessary
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> time to 3d print ryos key
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 has over 1000 teeworlds friends
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what a boss
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> are the optimizations hard?
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol yeah how do u have 1000 friends
15:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, I tested before with a lot of friends when we increased the limit from 1024 to 4096 I think
15:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> I used a script to create lots of friends lol
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> uwu robi u frint me?
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no its the other ChillerDragom
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :justatest:
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> ah F
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> a java script, if you will
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```java
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> public class GenFriends {
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>     public static void main(String args[]) {
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         if(args.length != 2) {
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>             return;
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         }
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         int min = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         int max = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         for(int i = min; i <= max; i++) {
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>             System.out.println("add_friend \"friend" + i + "\" \"clan" + i + "\"");
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>         }
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3>     }
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> }
15:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 Spectating is better word than Watching imho
15:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> be aware of discrimination ryozuki
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> ye also +1 for spec
15:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Chillerdragon would probably write "Speccing"
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> "java script" xd
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> speggsing
15:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> didnt you actually do that in /viewers xd
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> i might have ye
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 pr looks good, lot of todos about optimizing tho
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder what @Jupeyy_Keks would say
15:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, those are already on upstream
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684417791.png
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i give a fuck about out-game UI, as long it is okish
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> still waiting for a mail fron info@ddnet.org saying "woah there you have been playing quite a lot recently. Do not forget to sleep"
15:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> well, the second todo is on upstream. the `FriendlistOnUpdate` function is just empty on upstream
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it shouldnt make ur FPS go to 200 fps xd
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also thought about it
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its just menu
15:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> I think we could also render the friend tees in the friend list afterwards
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh true
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe we can remove the friends header
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more space
15:51 <+ChillerDragon> Generating friends with code yikes
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the way of the dev
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> robi pls code me a gf thank
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 wait i noticed it was java not javascript
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why would u do that with java
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> its a "java script"
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> just for the meme
15:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, we could do it like on upstream: move the buttons to the top
15:52 <+ChillerDragon> he pulled out java
15:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108754102030184668/image.png
15:53 <+ChillerDragon> robi when send image of ur setup?
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> moving buttons to top might be a too big change for our little players
15:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> It was just the easiest to use in that situation, because I mostly write java for job
15:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> I wouldn't remove the title then though, the other tabs also have the title
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah its fine
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe add some hardcoded special cases
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DDRaceNetwork => DDRace or DDNet
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks over verbose
15:54 <+ChillerDragon> my condolences
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know its what the server list says, but still
15:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> no wrapping?
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks ur verbose
15:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> If it gets too long it will decrease the font size
15:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> wrapping would be more complicated
15:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> marquee would be easier I guess lol
15:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> there's no workaround for flexible height it seems
15:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> duh
15:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for java job?
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah marques
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://badhtml.com/
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything moving like in the old days xd

17:58 < bridge> <Voxel> sounds fitting for ddnet-next
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> merged to master still f1 all good
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/5eeb3fa375750598b9bcb73b0178e9875894bd68
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> pressing f1 here and saying echo or printing the value of a config all shows
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> omg nvm
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> now its gone xd
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> wtf how
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i ran the client while it was still buildin faak
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> omg now my console is empty ffs
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> wait something is off
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> oh hm my update script is broken i have been updating my code base and merging and shit since months and still was running a old client how did i never notice xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet now is in rapid driven development mode
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lots of features, with lots of bugs
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic2
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen atomic can have a shared ptr! we just need c++20!
18:05 < bridge> <Voxel> if i knew cpp well enough id help debug
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the pre c++20 way is using standalone functiions https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im such a cpp expert
18:11 < bridge> <Voxel> i wonder how much we can optimize when we do switch to cpp20
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not much
18:43 < bridge> <Voxel> dang
18:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what can be optimized already doesnt change by using c++20
18:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (atleast 99%)
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> source: random guy in discord
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> servers should display the commit somewhere imho

18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm
18:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they do
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if u could optimize stuff, it probably is not enouhg to make 1-2 fps difference xd
18:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> :troll:
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how to find 3f890d1c08715624

18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wanted on github but ye
18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ❯ git checkout 3f890d1c08715624

18:56 < bridge> <gerdoe> kekw
18:56 <+DkrTremos> evening
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddbroken
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is this after my time fix or not
18:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108800426024915097/image.png
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so there is still the bug when u finish
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that ur time isnt updated
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the ui
18:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> checkout CPlayer::Snap
18:58 < bridge> <gerdoe> i think there's something related to score stuff
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is client side
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok no
19:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> im server side wizard
19:03 < bridge> <gerdoe> have never really touched client side
19:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> honestly the score code confuses me
19:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and this is all due to backwards compat
19:10 < bridge> <Voxel> who even plays 0.7 anymore
19:11 < bridge> <Learath2> I want to find all paths that visits each node at most once from A to B in a directed graph, DFS is the best I can do, right?
19:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     if(Player->m_Score < TTime || !Player->m_HasFinishScore)
19:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     if(Player->m_Score == -1 || Player->m_Score < TTime)
19:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     {
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         Player->m_Score = TTime;
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         Player->m_HasFinishScore = true;
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     }
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this on teams.cpp onfinish()
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> -1 usually is for no score
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but shouldnt this be if != -1 ?
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if != -1 i means there is a score right, so it should be set
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i thiink this if is backwards
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> TTime is
19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `int TTime = 0 - (int)Time;`
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bloat
19:14 < bridge> <Learath2> What is that double if even? 😄
19:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok i can reproduce locally
19:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, if there is no score or if the players score is lower than the team time, it should be set, that's how I read it
19:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im gonna try my fix
19:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> where is the sqlite db btw
19:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> found
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh god
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i printed a dif
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108805600709726289/image.png
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> current code  is this
19:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
19:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the score doesnt get updated
19:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on a new time
19:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> because it is only updated on -1
19:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which means only if u dont have a previous rank
19:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so that == -1 needs to be removewd
19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok if i remove the == it doesnt get set xd
19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time to dbg print
19:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/257310633211461633/1102222973076766861/ayaspin1.gif
19:20 < bridge> <Voxel> should we create a list of bugs that need to be fixed before rls?
19:21 < bridge> <Voxel> like the ones that NEED to be fixed?
19:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> woah its completly borked
19:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes it works sometimes not
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ryotime: score: -1, ttime: -8, time: 8.38
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ryotime: score: -8, ttime: -4, time: 4.22
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> I ryotime: score: -4, ttime: -1, time: 1.96
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> first, worked
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> second worked
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 3 made the rank disappear in hud
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ofc
19:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> -1 makes it disappear cuz -1 means no score
19:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we gotta add the bool back
19:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> use 0 instead
19:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> or 1 kekw
19:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> if 0 is legal score
19:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
19:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill use std::optional
19:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> don't
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its already used
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i introduced it
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> some time ago
19:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> where
19:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> and why
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look tooltips code
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz its cleaner
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and better?
19:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hehe
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed it
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or not wtf
20:41 < bridge> <Vincent Kadar> !!! Enjoy the most profitable financial market (crypto market ) as you get 100% profit...and you can also make up to $100k or more in 3days send me a private message and ask me HOW using NICEGRAM @Vincentkadar
20:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> no worries
20:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed it now
20:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a mess between the score being interpreted by the client and loading it from the db with a positive value
20:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 ^
21:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 1 test fails
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
21:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fixed
21:14 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108835019771875398/image.png
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> poggers
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> skins
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 17.0 biggest update
21:16 < bridge> <Ravie> I like the new list but do we really need tees in every ui place they don't belong?
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes we do
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet/compare/16.9...ddnet:ddnet:master
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it looks way more friendly
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yes
21:17 < bridge> <Ravie> it's bloat
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah its cute
21:17 < bridge> <Ravie> not when it's in every single ui rectangle
21:18 < bridge> <Ravie> it's cute in scoreboard, not every other random place
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it isnt anywhere else in the main menus
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is cute there
21:18 < bridge> <Ravie> it's in browser and chat
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and it makes lot of sense there
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tee skins make ppl easier to recognize
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially those who dont change
21:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like me
21:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> for friends it makes a lot of sense if multiple players have the same name
21:19 < bridge> <Ravie> why would they have the same name
21:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> happens a lot
21:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially chinese
21:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and also nameless tee

21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is not a bad ui element
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we can make a vote in #announcements
21:20 < bridge> <Ravie> @Jupeyy_Keks not until you close that gap
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108836746428420197/image.png
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao xD
21:21 < bridge> <Ravie> now it's too close
21:22 < bridge> <Ravie> you need just a little bit of padding but not so much that the text feels unanchored
21:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @murpi vote
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108836982110556221/image.png
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still looks worse tho
21:22 < bridge> <Ravie> this is lovely
21:22 < bridge> <Ravie> circle avatars suck anyway
21:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why u dont delete ur pfp then
21:23 < bridge> <Ravie> because it won't fix every other one
21:23 < bridge> <murpi> What's this about?
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> new friends list
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ravie doesnt want to show skins
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we want to
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 3 devs vs 1 ravie
21:25 < bridge> <Ravie> ddnet devs when reworking ui and they remember renderTee() exists:
21:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so make a vote
21:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in #announcements
21:25 < bridge> <murpi> we have skins in the server info list, why not have it in the friendslist as well?
21:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like that  logic
21:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> indeed
21:26 < bridge> <Ravie> I demand some tees in main menu, and some in irrelevant settings pages too for good measure
21:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we can provide that
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u dislike them in server info?
21:27 < bridge> <Ravie> server info needs at least 8
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes or no
21:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Ravie What's your opinion on #6613?
21:36 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6613
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess one problem is that they are directly below other buttons
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so many buttons close to each other
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108841083867242597/image.png
21:39 < bridge> <Ravie> @Robyt3 I like all of the 0.7 but please don't add tees in random places
21:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> :justatest:
21:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108841358279589888/image.png
21:40 < bridge> <Ravie> guys do you like my concept for the settings page?
21:40 < bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108841489305440357/settings_concept_2023.png
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ravie
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
21:41 < bridge> <Ravie> I said it needs at least 8
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "cute in scoreboard"
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is a scoreboard. Just a different one than the ingame scoreboard
21:42 < bridge> <murpi> You have an unassigned keybind for Tsin
21:43 < bridge> <Ravie> I mean scoreboard is one place where it makes sense cause those are actual tees on the server that you're on and it's not shoved in your face also
21:43 < bridge> <Ravie> too much is just too much
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh
21:44 < bridge> <Ravie> could argue that the ones in chat are fine also but the whole chat redesign is 🤢 to me
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i just dont understand is
21:45 < bridge> <Ravie> I can't stand the rounded rectangles and gap in front of text
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u say ddnet UI is so awesome
21:45 < bridge> <Ravie> teeworlds ui is awesome*
21:45 < bridge> <Ravie> and I love the 0.7 one as well, it's tasteful and not overdone
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is this good deisng?
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> info nobody cares about 99,99% of the time
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108842960625356851/image.png
21:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> ping is completely redundant
21:46 < bridge> <Voxel> STOP IT IM ON SHIFT AND SEE THIS IM LAUGHING SO HARDJJO99
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> unintuitive filters
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843057056579605/image.png
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ugly buttom part
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843116108189847/image.png
21:46 < bridge> <Voxel> THIS TOO
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bloated af
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843176145461389/image.png
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too much text
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843240754524170/image.png
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf happened here
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843293334327447/image.png
21:47 < bridge> <Ravie> true, ddnet ui is just too much, normal teeworlds is much better
21:47 < bridge> <Ravie> I get that some things need improving and they are improved, but in other areas there is just too much stuff and bloat
21:48 < bridge> <Voxel> this almost looked normal for a second
21:49 < bridge> <Voxel> im reading everything here hold on
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then lets start with 0.7
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843899759370240/image.png
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> text too close
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108843950070038538/image.png
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to edge
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> weird shadowing.. good idea, badly done imo
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108844055120576532/image.png
21:50 < bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel it's even funnier that a few hours ago I said to you that I like the new friends list because they didn't spam it with irrelevant tees xD
21:51 < bridge> <Voxel> oh my god lol
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh looks weird.. too many color changes, weird padding
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rect color is also padded
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108844320439664671/image.png
21:52 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah i hate that giant whitespace at the top
21:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> Zatline already did this for 0.7: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/3161
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> generally lot of space wasted..
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> makes it look good, but sadly also removes information.. so its a trade
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108844538128248872/image.png
21:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, 0.7 UI is really tiny
21:52 < bridge> <Voxel> still waiting on #5878
21:52 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5878
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that will make it worse
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah interesting
21:53 < bridge> <Ravie> @Jupeyy_Keks those are tiny flaws that don't stand out too much, at least someone didn't put some huge ugly elements that don't need to be there at all
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno, but i think without a background image it gets clear that the UI isnt beatiful
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108845061476728912/image.png
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u are a fan of roundings in roundings inside roundings with all custom background color
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to me this looks very ugly
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've never seen such unclean UI except for teeworlds
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ddnet even worse xD
21:55 < bridge> <Ravie> the bottom two windows are a bit jank but the top part is really nice
21:56 < bridge> <Voxel> i think we should make a mockup in figma of 17.0 UI before actually coding it in
21:56 < bridge> <Ravie> figma 🥜 🥜
21:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> we should release 17.0 soon
21:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like how ur pr is open since 2022
21:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tw in a nutshell
21:58 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah, but likr ryoz said, we need to fix all the bugs we caused with all these updates lolol
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 no hate against u btw, i know u spent lot of time for the UI
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its all personal taste^^
21:59 < bridge> <Voxel> lmfao i didnt realize this was a thing
22:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like bloated interfaces
22:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially if i know how to use em
22:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time ago  isaw a graph
22:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> usability vs cleanliness
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u like no interfaces xd
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in complex programs
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> terminal ftw
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pros need complexity to achieve better
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth like that
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont quote me
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> +jump +left +jump
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> exit
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the thing is
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> coding UI sucks ass
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and more
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz the code sucks ass
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and its impossible to make good looking ui code
22:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never seen it
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> writing your own UI library and coding in it is pretty hard anyway
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u have html + css u basically have industry standard
22:02 < bridge> <Ravie> pros need tees in friends list because their brain processes the tee's color faster than text so it lets them save precious time on joining servers
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but drawing some rects here and there and make it look great, hard
22:02 < bridge> <Voxel> something else about the UI: wtf is the ghosts tab in game?
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tees in friend list gives friends more personality
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ghosts is a tee from a demo
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> showing ur best time
22:03 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah but it only shows like, 1. from your best
22:03 < bridge> <Voxel> and no one even uses that tab lol
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont ask me
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a legacy game
22:03 < bridge> <Ravie> same with chat, and votes... and players...                 and server browser.....
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its also unrealistic to expert pro level design/code
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> expect
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> noboidy is getting paid
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the new devs get chased away by crying about features
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:04 < bridge> <Ravie> so much personality everywhere that it loses all of it :poggers:
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah its good
22:04 < bridge> <Ravie> ok
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think u just found smth to pick at
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and become obsessed
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just like me and rust
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a marriage
22:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> someday u gotta divorce
22:05 < bridge> <Voxel> tees in places are good...
22:05 < bridge> <Voxel> 
22:05 < bridge> <Voxel> ...under moderation
22:05 < bridge> <Ravie> nah it just annoys me so much when people make random additions to ui that make no sense from my perspective
22:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah and ur perspective isnt the only one
22:05 < bridge> <Ravie> but it is the minest
22:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but as i said
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u want to actually make ddnet urs
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> become a coder
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and make more prs than robyt
22:06 < bridge> <Skeith> The friends list is an abomination and I never use it :greenthing:
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is the only way to direct a project in open source
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that or pay someone
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well it got reworked
22:06 < bridge> <Ravie> I don't wanna make it mine
22:06 < bridge> <Skeith> oh?
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Skeith clicking 2 times on it joins the server  now!
22:06 < bridge> <Voxel> i use it! i like having friends
22:06 < bridge> <Skeith> wow!
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Skeith
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108848182244429954/image.png
22:07 < bridge> <Skeith> that's way better
22:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imagine having friends
22:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> robyt has over 1000
22:07 < bridge> <Voxel> that sucks
22:07 < bridge> <Voxel> i liked it when you could
22:07 < bridge> <Voxel> double click it to see what server SPECIFICALLY so i know if its a good server and if i have enough ping
22:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah u can do that
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with 1 click only!
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> usability increased, rare event
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just try nightly tomorrow
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or compile
22:08 < bridge> <Skeith> The tees make sense, a blob of text is worse to look at, I might actually use the friends list now
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ez
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im pro tees too
22:10 < bridge> <Voxel> i could go either way
22:10 < bridge> <Ravie> the tees just add too much random colors and stuff, hurts to look at, and they offset the text weirdly
22:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur offseted weirdly
22:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> man when i just look how much trouble i had with a friend designing the fng scoreboard to smth we both kinda liked xD
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> way too muhc trouble
22:11 < bridge> <Broso56> i think its way better honestly
22:11 < bridge> <Broso56> way more usable and way more info
22:11 < bridge> <Ravie> offset*
22:11 < bridge> <Voxel> wait a second
22:11 < bridge> <Voxel> what if you friend nameless tee :justatest:
22:11 < bridge> <Voxel> the entiee friendslist will be full of nameless tews
22:12 < bridge> <Voxel> the entire friendslist will be full of nameless tees since they are all seperate now
22:12 < bridge> <Broso56> then dont friend nameless tee ez
22:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108849674334502932/image.png
22:13 < bridge> <Skeith> unfriending noby
22:13 < bridge> <Ravie> for real the bottom one is so much less distracting and stuff, a pleasure to read in comparison to top
22:13 < bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108849816022298685/image.png
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i love the tee
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its easier on the eyes
22:13 < bridge> <Ravie> ❓
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vote on #general
22:15 < bridge> <Voxel> the one question is, how similar will this look to the info tab
22:15 < bridge> <Voxel> will they have similar spacing and tee placement?
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here is my image collection about making a scoreboard. everytime you change smth, u have to recompile the shitty source code xDDDDDDD
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>

22:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this channel is for ppl who spends too much time in the wrong things
22:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> i remember this
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mouse in scoreboard is cool, but scrollbar probs sucks
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 64p servers are bloat
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :^)
22:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go for 128
22:24 < bridge> <deen> I noticed that now I'm not using C++ at work anymore, I'm getting more annoyed by C++ 😄 My first Rust code at work took some time to get working though
22:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> haha
22:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats the way of rust
22:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/marketmove-mm-move-cool-trend-gif-25255233
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryo right now
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in his mind
22:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yes, one more in the bag
22:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> today i nearly started myself a cpp project, cuz i wanted to use the llvm cpp api
22:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i remembered thats a unforgiven sin
22:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and well lazyness kicked in
22:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just getting cmake to work is bad
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats indeed what i hate most about c++ and c
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dependencies and build tool
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in a world with only linux this would be different maybe xd
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @deen b4 u rq again. did u plan to build sdl soon?
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so we can test for nightly players
22:28 < bridge> <deen> Yes
22:28 < bridge> <deen> I was nearly done
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> n1
22:28 < bridge> <deen> Then got annoyed every weekend
22:28 < bridge> <deen> it's good timing since today is a holiday, so maybe I'll try again
22:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is it holiday?
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in germany it is
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw i fixed the score issue
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> deploy master!
22:29 < bridge> <Voxel> is this a sign for ddnet :justatest:
22:29 < bridge> <deen> Nope, I don't have much time for DDNet nowadays
22:29 < bridge> <deen> ok, building it
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sad
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i noticed
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but lately im motivated to code ddnet
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> deen goes into pension
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who follows?
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and we got robyt anyway
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the problem is
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think me jupstar and robyt have no access
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in case heinrich u and learath go rly off
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt they'd all go off at the same time without giving us a chance 😄
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well ups and downs are normal
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its been long since i coded too
22:32 < bridge> <deen> Not by chance, but if there were some suspicious sounding questions about ending DDNet 😄
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we need more 16y old coders who can spend all day
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u mean we need more slaves
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont understand this phrase
22:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is it missing a coma
22:33 < bridge> <Avolicious> Yeah its missing something 😄
22:33 < bridge> <Voxel> thinking about trying to take cpp more seriously but i wouldnt know how
22:33 < bridge> <deen> Not by chance, but there were some suspicious sounding questions about ending DDNet 😄
22:33 < bridge> <deen> Maybe someone will kidnap all DDNet developers
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah in #questions i seen it too
22:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
22:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the guy who said he is waiting for ddnet to end?
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean its his right to wait
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i wont stop until i reached my goal
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of 3000000000000000000000000000000 fps
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks we need to add inline assembly style optimizations
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go all the way xd
22:35 < bridge> <murpi> He probably asked because he wants ddnet 2
22:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe he wont, pension will be at 80 soon
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its in coding, gimmi 10 more years
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet pension is, when u die
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @deen do u already have kids?
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet that will change everything
22:36 < bridge> <deen> Pension is not the only major life event that takes time 😄
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> once they come
22:36 < bridge> <deen> in 2 months I will
22:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> damn
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> HYPE
22:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> congrats
22:36 < bridge> <deen> thanks
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> teach it ddnet
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would definitly do xd
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but too evil ppl for these little minds
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> too
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @deen it will defs change everything.
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i look at me how much i already like my niece (first baby in our closer family)
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and its not even my own child xD
22:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks having a niece is wayy different
22:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> than having a kid
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know
22:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i kinda half know the struggles of a kid
22:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my sister lives with us and had a kid
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i also mean from time management
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often play 1-2h with my niece
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my sister the other 14h per day 😅
22:39 < bridge> <deen> At least we have lots of parental leave in Germany, will have to see how that goes
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can heinrich or learath do releases btw?
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not being rude but, it may happen that u truly disappear for lot of time then xd
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> heinrich paid the steam access didnt he
22:41 < bridge> <deen> I think they have the permissions, but probably haven't run the setup script
22:42 < bridge> <deen> it's not fully automated, depends on Arch and a Debian VM: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/release
22:42 < bridge> <Learath2> I think we should have all the necessary permissions
22:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw i might go to singapure next
22:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on end of year
22:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
22:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Singapore*
22:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wont bring drugs, u can get beheaded there :justatest:
22:45 < bridge> <Learath2> I want to go to singapore sometime aswell, but I'm not in the mood to go anywhere
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its farther than japan tho
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 15hours of flight are tiring xd
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my flight lasted that, when returning, due to avoiding russia
22:46 < bridge> <deen> Just wanted to say the same, takes some time longer now if you're not flying with a Russia-friendly airline
22:48 < bridge> <deen> ~2 hour difference with Lufthansa vs Air China to Beijing I think for example
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had lufthansa
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and then Ana
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the only japanese airline i think
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well most famous*
22:49 < bridge> <Learath2> There is also JAL
22:50 < bridge> <Learath2> Singapore is extremely expensive btw, be ready 😄
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the 2 flights i had
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there was a japanese boy when going
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and a girl when returning
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they only got up once
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to toilet
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> insane ppl
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in a 14h flight average
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:51 < bridge> <Learath2> I was dying of food poisoning on my flight to japan
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its ok i go with my sister xD
22:51 < bridge> <deen> Is she bringing her kid too?
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my other sister
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rich one
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hentai
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 2000 patreons
22:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> crazy
22:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 2200 now probs
22:52 < bridge> <Learath2> can she take me to singapore aswell?
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
22:52 < bridge> <Learath2> We are good friends, I'll become a rust priest
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath and your sis
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> best couple
22:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> you have to forsake C forever
22:52 < bridge> <Learath2> hmm, not worth I guess
22:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
22:52 < bridge> <Learath2> I really want to go to japan again this year but I just don't have the time for it :/
22:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also wanna go back there
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its kinda fun how different it is
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i only went to a gaijin bar at night i should have been more daring
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im kinda shy anyway
22:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe I'll try going next winter, do some skiing, it's been so long since I got to ski
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> skiing in japan?
22:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Yep, there are some pretty good winter resorts around hokkaido
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> didnt know
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i go to the mountain close by
22:54 < bridge> <Learath2> and I get to have ramen in the cold and it can snow in the background
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pirineus
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Pyrenees
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:54 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't have anyone to go with, so I haven't went skiing in like 7 years
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> damn
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> once my friends got a driver license and 1 got a car
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we going places now
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill go near the border in france this summer
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also its common to go to andorra
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to shop there
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no taxes
22:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
22:56 < bridge> <Learath2> san sebastian and biarritz were both quite interesting
22:57 < bridge> <Learath2> but I'd guess you'd go to the eastern side of the border, closer to you 😄
22:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unironically
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill go near  the Catalan Pyrenees
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> park
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth like that
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which is inside france xD
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz it was originally catalonia hehe
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but they invaded
23:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
23:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway time to sleep, cya
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> night
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki get ddnet admin and add virus that secretly installs linux
23:22 < bridge> <Voxel> if my computer bricks itself because of this im sueing you
