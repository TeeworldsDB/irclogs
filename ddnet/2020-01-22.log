08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Someone published a DDNet paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11582 üòÑ
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like a popular name recently: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332522533_DDNet_Cartesian-polar_Dual-domain_Network_for_the_Joint_Optic_Disc_and_Cup_Segmentation
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> lmaoo hopefully the ddnet website gets some of the juice
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol nice
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where did u find that @deen ?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah wait
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not ddracenetwork xxD
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11582.pdf
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon just googled for ddnet
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also found the discussion of elxreno trying to get us into Fedora/RedHat: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787069
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh nice

16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> wrong link. it leads to the previous tournament discussion

19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when im in a situation like this where i fall a good amout before entering a single unfreeze, it doesnt register my shots most of the time and some times not even my double jump. this cost me rank1 on another map once, and its a problem with the connection
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/669602190947647498/screenshot_2020-01-22_18-58-22.png
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we get some crowdsource to fix corneums connection pls
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure I get it, but as you go faster the resolution of the input gets smaller and smaller
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you are moving any more then 1 tile per tick, it'll get very hard to accurately do inputs
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well on that other map i was always falling from the same height, and it took n9mkoik's shot input but not mine so i had to do a extra jump
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its not the same for everybody
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't quite get the part, so I don't quite get what happened. Were you moving fast?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wait i will search it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "doesn't register" isn't something that can really happen especially for shots, you'd need to drop so many packets
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> factoring in ping though, you'll never be able to get very consistent on a server anyway, it'd be nice if we had a way to verify teehistorian demos so the people speedrunning could do so on local servers where ping is not an issue
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> heres the part. im really not moving fast there
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/669603971887005716/screenshot_2020-01-22_19-04-48.png
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah. it worked on my lan server so i was pissed when it didnt work for real
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> actually... this part is different to what i said. but its the same problem for sure
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> btw i will legit pay you 50‚Ç¨ if you make a way to verify demos
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you need to rocket right before you go into freeze?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is one of those things that will always be a little inconsistent, depending on your falling speed and your ping, it actually can be impossible, I think
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After a certain falling speed, it's definitely impossible as the rocket will not travel enough in the tick before you get frozen to hit the ground before you
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what about double jumps tho. it just failed me too.  unlucky ping spike?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> verfiying demos would actually a cool thing
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or submitting teehistorian files idk
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon 50‚Ç¨ to whoever does it
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> below that speed you need to be lucky to be close to the edge of the non freeze block in the last thing before you get frozen so the rocket doesn't have to travel too far
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 is there anything untrusted about local servers that would be a risk to accept the runs as official ddnet ranks?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum double jumps suffer from the same problem at high speeds, but less so at below critical speed, I'd guess that was an unlucky spike indeed
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> hm ok
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon if we get teehistorian files we can run it through a server of our own to check that they didn't modify the server
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but then you could do easy record bot ranks because they dont fail on homeserver
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, there is that, we'd need to start working on proper bot detection aswell
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some analysis of the movement of the tee to make sure it's human-ish
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> replay bot is only human input
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> noby would be the guy but i dont think he cares much about ddrace
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum thats the thing i can record any run locally and then replay it on official servers anyways
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not that i recommend you doing that xd
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but since thats possible already we could also make a legit similar solution
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we could cross compare with other runs aswell
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well ur internet might be too bad for that but mine works supberb with replay bots ‚ù§Ô∏è
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no chuller. if you just replay online they will fail at some point due to laggs. so lags are literaly making the servers half secure now
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> chuller lol
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tested it üôÇ
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and there are certain things that give away the usage of a replaybot, things that I don't feel like giving away here üòõ
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea ik
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> assuming you dont mean going into corners before every part?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "we shouldn't mention bot detection signs"
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess there goes that one üòÑ
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Im 'corneum goes ahead and tries to guess bot detection signs
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 so local servers can record teehistorian without too much huzzle right? Even on windows. So we only need a way to replay teehistorian on official servers and then insert the ranks?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> just making sure. see? it wasnt a secret xd
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wat
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "something better stay secret"
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "is it <xyz>?"
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like such a bad strategy
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not even commenting on whether or not that is what learath2 means
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the idea
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to respond to something like that
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in such a way
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is thoughtless
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üò¶
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont get what i did wrong tbh.
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds like a fun machine learning project
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 7:17 PM] heinrich5991: "something better stay secret"
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [7:17 PM] heinrich5991: "is it <xyz>?"
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you did that wrong
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that was the first and most obvious way to detect record bot
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice. and then someone posts the second most obvious way to detect a record bot
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that would be dumb if a ddnet official posted it.
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but if i post it you know that you need better protection
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> security through obscurity is atleast a little helpful
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not saying this is the secret I want to keep hidden
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't even know what secret Learath2 wants to keep hidden
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why do you think it is a good idea to guess the secret
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just helping bot writers
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I'm pretty sure you don't like bots
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well i sure hope he has something solid that i dont know about. thats why i said i assumed he didnt mean said method because only having that would be insecure
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then tell your guess in private
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well any clever guess you have is a nice idea for bot writers, is the point @heinrich5991 is trying to make I guess
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> good point. but i am pretty sure it is/was very known stuff. especially bot writers would know about this thing
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I guess this one wasn't too bad, just don't guess more üòõ
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i will guess. but then i pm
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but how do you know im not telling a botwriter
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you would have to force stop thinking about ot xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you would have to force me to stop thinking about ot xd
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well if you are helping write bots, then your guesses are all known to the people who do write bots, so putting them here doesn't change much
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if you aren't and you don't want them to get ideas, don't post guesses publicly üôÇ
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> good for you that botwriters are even lazier that you guys üòó   tbh i dont even have contact to one
