00:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gg @vahemaaa 
00:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 cannot reproduce, and there is no error in f1 log, but randomly a skin failed to load and showed default instead
00:35 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i miss ui_scale
00:38 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or at least a way to resize the gigantic top time display
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i also wish there was a way to adjust the UI corner radius
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i get the look they’re going for but it’s rly extra imo
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> and if you play with AA off (like someone who prioritizes latency would) then they are all aliased and shitty looking
00:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> right
00:59 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ya idk client settings diff
01:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm thankful there are so many already but we should not be clientphobic so much
01:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or else I very may well potentially switch to tclient
01:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Switch to goober client
01:23 < bridge> <totar> AA does not increase latency! The cilent is lying to you 
01:23 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9569
01:24 < bridge> <totar> only vsync does
01:24 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont beleive you..
01:24 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385762295807873095/image.png?ex=68573f35&is=6855edb5&hm=ff89e070c12011943e4d8af32d36162c20294bb70b9fd3d5bd02f62c49cdd735&
01:25 < bridge> <totar> what it actually means is (may increase frametime)
01:26 < bridge> <totar> you should play with it on
01:26 < bridge> <totar> it's just better
01:26 < bridge> <louis> wow i was fooled
01:26 < bridge> <kebscs> what is frametime
01:26 < bridge> <totar> https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/129te2b/psa_use_frametime_instead_of_framerate_when/
01:27 < bridge> <totar> frametime is how long it takes for a frame to finish, so if your frametime is 0.5ms then youre fps will be 1000ms/0.5ms =2000fps
01:27 < bridge> <totar> but the relationship between frametime and fps is not linear
01:28 < bridge> <totar> the thing that determines your fps is not your fps, it's the frametime. So it's better to just measure it directly
01:28 < bridge> <louis> is it not possible to use aa only on places its needed
01:28 < bridge> <totar> if you still have multiple thousands of fps after turning it on then it will not change anything about your experience
01:29 < bridge> <kebscs> :frozen:
01:31 < bridge> <totar> specifically features like this usually add a constant amount of frametime, like 1ms or something. So if you have 3 features that take [0.5ms, 2.1ms, 1.3ms] respectively then you can predict what your fps will be with any combination of those features without guessing. If you just measured the FPS it wouldn't be obvious how they relate because of the non linear frametime->FPS result
01:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i wish that pipotam guy would say something rn
01:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> the math
03:34 < bridge> <Ewan> not in ddnet
07:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> That actually confused me too
07:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> I was wondering how it could "increase delay"
07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
07:23 < bridge> <pilonpl> Lower fps can kinda cause delay tho
07:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> Your monitor might not be able to display 1k fps but it's still beneficial to see the more up to date frame
08:21 < bridge> <totar> that's true except it also doesn't lower your fps very much at all
08:25 < bridge> <teero777> ~2k fps less for me if i go from 0 to 8x
08:25 < bridge> <teero777> so i drop from 3k to 1k
08:25 < bridge> <teero777> so i drop from 3k to 1k fps
08:55 < bridge> <totar> Don't use 8x
08:55 < bridge> <totar> 2x is way better than 0x
08:56 < bridge> <totar> also 1000fps is still enough either way
08:57 < bridge> <totar> People with good GPUs will be cpu limited and low FSAA has very little effect
09:24 < bridge> <teero777> on vulkan it's limited to 8 :(( on opengl its 32 i think. i need that fsaa 128x
09:25 < bridge> <totar> I can use 2x with vulkan
09:25 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385883201838387292/image.png?ex=6857afcf&is=68565e4f&hm=9c9b047eee8f9ef2ec9d10b5081a74f866a2ab3488539bdca23f8b91aefeddd1&
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> yy ik
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> i mean it's upper limit is 8
09:25 < bridge> <totar> oh
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> need more
09:25 < bridge> <totar> lol
09:25 < bridge> <totar> why is that
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> on opengl it's more
09:25 < bridge> <totar> is it hard to make it more than 8x?
09:25 < bridge> <totar> idk
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> idk ask @jupeyy_keks
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> why ever
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it only goes to x8, then your GPU does not support more
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On a software renderer I can make it x32
09:43 < bridge> <teero777> on opengl 3.3 i can make it 64x
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSampleCountFlagBits.html
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This is the official max supported currently: x64
09:43 < bridge> <teero777> also why is the counter button broken lol?
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think for OGL we cannot pre-query the limit cross platform
09:43 < bridge> <teero777> shouldn't right click decrease it
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it will set the limit next time you restart or smth
09:44 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lemme see, but probs
09:44 < bridge> <teero777> yea you're right it does. that's the reason it says it needs to restart
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Open an issue pls
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's defs broken, wasn't always the case
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> im lazyyy
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> im still fixing the bug
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> im still fixing the physics bug
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oge
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> i found like 4 issues already and fixed them
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> none were related to the actual bug i wanted to fix...
10:05 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks smart credit in the video xDDD
10:47 < bridge> <totar> I'm pretty sure (like 60% sure) that if you're in a server that has client mapping, and the server decide to client map your dummy to a different clientid everything explodes in the prediction code
10:48 < bridge> <teero777> zsh is trolling me?
10:48 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1385904144732127342/image.png?ex=6857c350&is=685671d0&hm=5ef8e2eda14bbd46fb0f50f765cd382b28e3838dc613b97d529c791468207a57&
10:48 < bridge> <totar> the client has no method for tracking the dummy's ID unless you swap
10:48 < bridge> <totar> ```cpp
10:48 < bridge> <totar>     if(m_Snap.m_LocalClientId != m_PrevLocalId)
10:48 < bridge> <totar>         m_PredictedDummyId = m_PrevLocalId;
10:48 < bridge> <totar>     m_PrevLocalId = m_Snap.m_LocalClientId;
10:48 < bridge> <totar> ```
10:48 < bridge> <totar> this is the only place that it figures out the dummy ID
10:54 < bridge> <totar> also the client just yeets the dummy's snapshot, that's nice lol too much effort to make it useful I guess
10:58 < bridge> <totar> I wish AI could flawlessly refactor the entire gameclient.cpp and client.cpp
10:58 < bridge> <totar> the longer I look at these files the less happy I become
10:58 < bridge> <teero777> guess where my happy level is from 0-10
10:59 < bridge> <totar> 4
10:59 < bridge> <teero777> good guess
11:03 < bridge> <teero777> im exporting kog general chat rn to win a future argument
11:03 < bridge> <totar> the initial dummy commit was so simple, so naive. gameclient.cpp and client.cpp were only 3k loc at the time
11:03 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/3dce4c94899f95c8b9ca52bd25fd6a2a52e10b62
11:04 < bridge> <teero777> im saving this commit for later, the networking code looks really simple
11:05 < bridge> <totar> hmm
11:05 < bridge> <totar> be aware the following 3 commits was fixes
11:05 < bridge> <teero777> xD
11:06 < bridge> <teero777> @totar wanna vc?
11:08 < bridge> <totar> the initial dummy commit was so simple, so naive. gameclient.cpp and client.cpp were only 3k loc combined at the time

12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 sos #10350 needs u
12:43 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10350
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am planning a few team related refactors and fixes in 3 repos having a proper enum would come in handy
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> gumo, the ddnet steam page says, that the game might show wrong controller glyphs?
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> gumo, the ddnet steam page says, that the game might show wrong controller glyphs for the steam deck?
14:19 < bridge> <melon> yeah i mean, the game only has basic controller support
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @avolicious 80% insane run deded on 45.141.57.45:8316
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> full maintainer carry
15:07 < bridge> <kebscs> @0xdeen ingame news tab isnt updated
15:12 < bridge> <kebscs> @learath2 could you check out <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10329>
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> im coming
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> nvm
15:25 < bridge> <teero777> chiller gone
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: the server crashed .\_. That’s why I pinged avo
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think it’s a real issue. Failing with a big team that slowly but safely was approaching the finish line is annoying. And it is something that stresses me out in the following runs as well knowing it can happen at any moment
15:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> finish faster :p
15:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye fr it’s full stress
15:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean some even already finished in time today
15:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The front of the long ass team
15:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, never seen "skill issue" spelled that way.
17:56 < bridge> <th.th9> I believe that if the skin is predicted, the eyes have to be tooط
17:56 < bridge> <th.th9> I believe that if the skin is predicted, the eyes have to be too
18:23 < bridge> <kebscs> i tried it with freeze
18:23 < bridge> <kebscs> but you cant really do that because you can set different eyes than defaulty
18:23 < bridge> <kebscs> but you cant really do that because you can set different eyes than default
18:24 < bridge> <kebscs> you can be frozen with different eyes i mean
18:25 < bridge> <lomination> Doesn't a simple condition solve this problem?
18:27 < bridge> <kebscs> didnt manage to find a way to reliably always tell if player has set custom eyes
18:28 < bridge> <lomination> Do you mean you didn't manage to do it or do you mean you don't think it is actually possible?
18:28 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont rememebr
18:28 < bridge> <kebscs> i thought freeze=the hurt eyes
18:29 < bridge> <kebscs> but then i saw you can set your custom eyes even in freeze
18:29 < bridge> <kebscs> and didnt manage to do it easily so its consistent
18:29 < bridge> <lomination> Okay
18:29 < bridge> <lomination> Is there any issue related to that?
18:30 < bridge> <kebscs> no
18:31 < bridge> <lomination> Should one be created?
18:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-live what is dis :kek:
18:32 < bridge> <kebscs> up to you
18:32 < bridge> <kebscs> for me its not noticeable
