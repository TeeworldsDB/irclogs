16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jeroen> idk if this is a small bug or if it is intentional. If you spec a player who is using hookline that is in a different team, the hookline doesn't turn yellow if aimed at a player but goes right through. I believe this wasn't the case in the previous version of tw?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tw doesnt have hookline
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jeroen it's a bug, but hard to fix
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> actually might be fixable nowadays
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jeroen> It wasn't always like this
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jeroen> That's why I asked
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it always was
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx- did you send me the demo already?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx- and also the output from command line please
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since I can't reproduce the issue
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq why doesnt the new ddnet client confirm closing the client
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its weird and dangerous o.O
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What's dangerous about it?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cl_confirm_quit_time
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> I fixed the issue so nvm
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is the default no confirm ?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i guess it still always asks you if you have unsaved stuff in editor
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx- well, it's still a bug
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ingame
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be nice if we could fix it for everyone else
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can disconnect acedentall
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, except if game time > 20 min
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ? xd
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Oh then i can send u the demo
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> serverside killprotection protects clientside closing?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we please change the default
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, clientside both
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo this dagerous option should be enabled by power users who know what they are doing
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw any idea why i dont hear gunshots on my new laptop?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tried ddnet 12.0.1 and ddnet 11.2.1
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> windows 10
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because they've been disabled by default since ddnet 5 or something
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> all other sounds are there
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can turm them on in sound settings
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol wtf xd
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is wrong with ddnet defaults xd
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> have you tried jetpack with gun sounds?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> have you tried vanilla without?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haven't played vanilla for 10 years so no
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i havent use jetpack for...
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> n joke
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but jetpack is fine for me
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and there is /ninjajetpack
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there is a client for vanilla over at https://teeworlds.com/ I think ðŸ˜„
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff i disagree with the defaults
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe the gun sound thing should be ddrace based only
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyway, ideally we'd enable sound for gun, but disable for jetpack
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or rather make ninjajetpack a default
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make a github issue and propose that as an enhancement
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sinisa3games but cant change pfp> ninjajetpack just looks weird
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the quit game pls
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would love to make an pr
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, ninjajetpack will never be default, it was more of a joke
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i guess you decline the quit or
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> losing sound on jetpack would annoy me (and probably morep layers)
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i like the sound feedback
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dont completely disable it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats not a good solution
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sinisa3games but cant change pfp> also ud have to change all of the fricking jetpack tiles
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but turning it of by default in vanilla is bad as well
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is worth a discussion issue
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but as he said its not a vanilla client
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the ideal solution would be to make the client load different cfgs for every game mode
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> then u can also hide useless vanilla hud in ddrace
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ideal ddnet should serve a ok expierence out of the box for commen gametypes imo
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but i dont see why default settings should be based upon vanilla when ur using a ddrace client
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if vanilla players want to use a ddrace client then its up to them to fix the settings
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> not the other way around
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @snail what's your opinion about the quit/disconnect/disconnect dummy confirmation?
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> a confirmation button for disconnecting dummy?
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah thats useless
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the button is not in a corner
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @snail yeah, i added one and made it consistent for all 3
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you dont press it accidentally
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so right now they only ask you after 20 min game time
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and even if you should always protect the main tee rather
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i think thats nice
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> missclicks often happen
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea well idc
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never disconnect  my dummy
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is almost no reason
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i wont complain if somebody adds that feature
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it doesnt rly matter for most users and its an additional anti missclick layer
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i really care that the top right corner you can easily hit by  pushing your mouse strongly in one direction
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that is dangerous if you loose your maintee then
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen wasnt ninjajetpack kamillentees idea :poggers:
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Also i dont find gun sound annoying not even for jetpack, dont make it disabled as default :monkaS:
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> He's your brother, you probably remember better ðŸ˜„
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> He told me years ago that you were testing jetpack as new feature with him like on Joyride if the switch opens for other players for example and if i remember right he suggested ninjajetpack but he wanted it that u move in the direction u looking at 
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> 
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Did you fix skipping tele with upcoming Joyride release or was it never possible?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno, might still be possible
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no its only possible with ninja 1 tile or of a tele with different number is next to the tele youre going into with speed and no hard block is between them.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Even shotgun/spec doesnt let u skip tele, you touch the tele u "skipped" as last.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Startline tiles and solotiles are also only skipable by ninja, finishtile can be skipped by too much speed btw
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no its only possible with ninja 1 tile or if a tele with different number is next to the tele youre going into with speed and no hard block is between them.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Even shotgun/spec doesnt let u skip tele, you touch the tele u "skipped" as last.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Startline tiles and solotiles are also only skipable by ninja, finishtile can be skipped by too much speed btw
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen the demo bug thing happened to me with a teehistorian demo
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think teehistorian demo converter might not store the demo file in there
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so then it's plausible
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but regular client demo shouldalways store the map, at least that's how I understood the code
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I had the problem on an old demo the error message is pretty clear and i was able to replay the demo by finding through exact right map on heinrichs index
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I had the problem on an old demo the error message is pretty clear and i was able to replay the demo by finding the exact right map on heinrichs index
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, old ddnet version tried not to store the map file inside the demo
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen would you add higher demo replay speeds to official client?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> y would be nice
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and very useful
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :GWcmeisterPeepoLove:
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And an extra speed between the low and very low speed xd
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The step is too big
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but f1, demo_speed 50 already works
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or what do you want?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didn't know
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :GWragMonkaS:
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks crazy fast to me ðŸ˜„
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> very useful for teehistorian demos that are 100min+ xd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Always when i ask deen for a feature he tells me a command that already do it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti why heart, u will have to use a new fresh version which u hate a lot
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen and yes ive had an issue with teehistorian demos for more than 6 months
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @Ryozuki i only need the commit lol
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i always have to rename my mapname in downloadedmap folder
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Limit is 64
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so annoying xd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but if you want more make a PR in demo.cpp:823
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> delete teehistorian f3
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @snail need more than x64?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> n
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> K
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the problem is that these high speeds can make the client entirely unresponsive ðŸ˜„
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye i was wondering how laggy would it get
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> at x64
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> doesnt it kinda blink
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> depends on how many fps your screen can do I guess
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Does teehistorian finally show weapon and dj using
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 256 is the limit on my machine
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> It doesnt on my teehistorian demo i got from heinrich
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> teehistorian shows hammer
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ik
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> teehistorian is replay bot
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> DDNet bot confirmed
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsamazingman: :banhammer: ðŸ¤–
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> omg 256 is unusable for me xd
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's mostly single core CPU bound
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also depends on how full the server is and whether /showall is on
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> even 128 is laggy on this demo
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what CPU?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and OS?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> windows
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try disabling the cmd output thingy
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might be interesting if that is causing performance issues
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and assuming you build yourself, Release build?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea smooth now
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> with release and no cmd
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but was it release before?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, then please try with release and cmd
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> works
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, good
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sinisa3games but cant change pfp> why u first disable cmd?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It used to cause performance problems some while ago
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but they should've been fixed, this was a good test case to see if they are
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> basically the rendering on cmd.exe window was quite slow and blocking
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sinisa3games but cant change pfp> isnt using windows generally worse
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye debian best
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> s
