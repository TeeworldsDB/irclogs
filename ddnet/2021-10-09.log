09:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ~~Imagine volunteering just for fun or avoiding responsibilities.~~
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in most open source stuff there is no docs introducing u how to code there
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u generally just learn the code base
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SmartBalls> hewwo there, im bored and wanna start coding on a tw server in the old fashioned n-lvl style
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SmartBalls> are there any like mod apis or something or how to for starters? :D
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> hey, would it be possible to create a "sort after" option in the tee selection? like your last selected tees / alphabetic order / last added ?
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can report that killing takes 1-2s seconds to apply on GER1 right now
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, input in general seems delayed
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ddos
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/896370929389670400/unknown.png
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it gameserver lags maybe?
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 no, it is vali
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> same for my server (also at secured)
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> If you bothered looking at the values above you would know no malicious traffic has been passed through
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So you wanna tell me my server and ddnet servers are randomly lagging at the same time for no reason? xd
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> No
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm saying it wasn't a ddos attack that was passed through
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> as shown above
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but its probably a new technique to bypass the firewall
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> No
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Then it would show above
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> like I just said
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 1k pps couldn't even harm a source engine server
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, but it can delay input of other players
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> No?
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 1k pps is nothing.
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ill see
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> That's normal game traffic, and it easily handled unless you're hosting on an Intel Atom
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> That's normal game traffic, and is easily handled unless you're hosting on an Intel Atom
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm still checking on this, but keep in mind that any customer running e.g. an unprotected IP address, then getting attacked, can cause lag spikes and such
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> (e.g. due to the actual node getting congested)
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm assuming this both happened pretty simulatenously, so this'd make sense.
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> just go through sources, there is no docs, there is no apis
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> apis lmao
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I think I have a really bad wip level mod flying around somewhere
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It the ddos spoofs real ips of players that are online their real traffic wont be ratelimited? Do you check every packet for valid tokens or what? @FÃ¤n
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If the ddos spoofs real ips of players that are online their real traffic wont be ratelimited? Do you check every packet for valid tokens or what? @FÃ¤n
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yeah, vali has real player ips and spoofs with them
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Can't go into much detail, but "spoofing real player IPs" will not work

15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> EU court rules no EULA can forbid decompilation, if you want to fix a bug (europa.eu)

15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds sane
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Bitwarden is very good :)Thanks for the tip
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Best manager i could find
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Yep, it's great
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @FÃ¤n lags right now again
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> weapon change takes seconds to get through
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ddos
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Are we talking about GER1?
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> because max we're seeing on the entire host node right now
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> is 30Mbps
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lag again
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you can see the history of a couple of minutes and could theoretically see an attack that is 5min back? @FÃ¤n
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it doesn't help if I tell you again and again that it's lagging right now
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm checking atm
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Do these lagspikes last long?
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when these lag spikes happen, they happen for a bit
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> like, < 10 secs?
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> each individual one is 1-2s
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, longer than 10s
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Well, is there a pause between the 10s
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> like, lag for 1-2 sec
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> no lag for a few secs
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> then lag again?
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm no
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when we constantly fired our pistols, some shots were missing
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I can't tell for sure I guess, it's already a few mins ago and I don't remember it that clearly ðŸ˜„
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> lagging right now too?
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sory wrong chat
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> players report at least
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> agreed
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> seem to be abusing the cooldown foir this
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> seem to be abusing the cooldown for this
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok let me just fix this
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok let me just fix this tgeb
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok let me just fix this then
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nice
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Ok, figured it out I guess
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Let's see if this works now
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Yes I did, nice!
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> btw server had connection drop for whole server for half a min yesterday
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> small thing but thought u should know
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> chl already ddos again xd
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FÃ¤n Chile location for secured.gg when? :D
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Chile has at least as many (good) players as GER
20:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> If you can provide us with 400-500Gbps of capacity, no problem ðŸ˜›
20:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xddd
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> ger1 getting bigboi ddos
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Takes ~10 secs to mitigate
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> so not a surprise
22:06 <+Irgendsoeiner> hey hey

22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> hi Irgendsoeiner
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FÃ¤n only specific players start to lag, not everyone
