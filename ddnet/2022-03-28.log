00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If server send you your position, this feature should work
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> that didn't really answer my question, does the server already do that or it needs to be changed?
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Yo, unrelated topic, but can you guys give me a coordinated example on how Celeste handles movement, such as walking force and jump? I'm trying to replicate it with similar functions, such as stable force (no limitations, the force will always be the same) and increasing force (force value will add with itself, every frame, until it reaches a limit, or goes infinitely)
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Here's an example on how I plan on accomplishing gravity
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957762725528875039/unknown.png
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Do I need to be aware of any different methods on simulating gravity?
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Idk, others can answer ðŸ™‚
08:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @bencie did you encounter any problems with RC2 yet, or didnt really play last days?
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> i didn't
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> have any problems
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok^^
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @è»Šé­„ Can you check if https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4906/files is an improvement?
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <è»Šé­„> that's I uploaded
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok ðŸ˜„
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <è»Šé­„> It's my first pull request, did I do right?
10:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, maybe next time try to keep all changed in a single commit, but it's fine
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <è»Šé­„> thanks
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <è»Šé­„> ok, thanks ðŸ¥°
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1648460158.png
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> the frametimes are interesting when `cl_refresh_rate == gfx_refresh_rate`
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (Vulkan btw)
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> it seems like its just desync between the actual refresh rate, and the refresh rate defined by cl_refresh_rate (if I toggle focus for DDnet I can sometimes get them to sync)
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1648460301.png
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is expected
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> this is after toggling focus a few times (because of cl_refresh_rate_inactive)
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cl refresh rate only cares about refresh rate of the CPU (how often it wakes up)
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if it misses a gfx frame, it will do a much faster cycle than when it hits a gfx frame
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> hmm i was always wondering, why it even existed. Is there any recommended value for it?
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> like 2Ã— gfx_refresh_rate or something?
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i set it to 0, one CPU core normally doesnt use much energy / my fans dont start to spin
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gfx_refresh_rate on the other side is the one you should set to your target fps
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not really predictable what else you can set it to, 2x gfx refresh rate can theoretically work.
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Tho it can still happen that you miss a gfx cycle
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you can try
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gfx_asyncrenderold 0
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> gfx_refresh_rate is 150 (a little above my monitors actual refresh rate)
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then the cpu waits for the GPU
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `gfx_asyncrender_old 0`
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> yep. Never seen a more straight frametime graph :D
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> is there a performance/latency penalty?
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well with 150 there generally is a latency impact xD
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> your mouse probs has 1000hz
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it should be ok, since u have pretty high end hardware
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just test it out and see if its ok for you
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> hmm nvm. I now have `gfx_asyncrender_old 0` but it didn't really change anything (was 1 before)
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I guess I was just lucky there
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah you have to use gfx_refresh_rate 0 then
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and only use cl_refresh_rate iirc
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> other way around also seems to work?
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think its this way around, even if it sounds weird
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (you said that the CPU waits for GPU?=
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (you said that the CPU waits for GPU?)
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it **must** enter the GPU check
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so gfx_refresh_rate 0 makes sense
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it will always swap the GPU then
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then it also waits for it
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> okay something is weird
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> All refresh_rates are 0 now
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> OH WAIT MANGOHUD
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I got a 150fps limit there as well
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> lmao
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> well, I guess that's the best option?
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all to 0?
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1648460836.png#
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> yes, MangoHud limits to 150
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well if you have that hud always enabled
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sure xd
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I configured it to be hidden by default, can toggle it with a hotkey
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess then its fine yeah
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (btw this is also the recommended way for the Steam Deck, never use in-game frame limits, but rather use the frame limits forced by MangoHud, makes a huge difference in power consumption)
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, dunno what mangohud injects to the vulkan runtime, but it defs can make sense
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> similar to how vsync is implemented on windows
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Btw. should I be worried if my GPUs coil whine is VERY LOUD with unlocked frames?
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it doesnt damage ur hardware
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u mean that
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I need to get a dB meter
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I hope so, don't really wanna buy a GPU now ðŸ‘€
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah should be ok
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just vibriting copper
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> similar to electricity converts in your town
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u ever seen one xd
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> but those generally don't vibrate with >1000Hz
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (I assume that the pitch of the coil whine correlates to the framerate)
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> OMG I AM GOING TO PLAY MIDIs WITH COIL WHINE
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs to power consumption
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also dont know what component directly causes it
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it doubt its the GPU cores that cause it
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> other tripple A titles dont do it and they use like 5 times the energy ddnet uses on my GPU ðŸ˜„
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I always assumed that the power delivery is the culprit. rendering a DDnet should be very fast, so I guess the power consumption rapidly jumps multiple thousand times per second, (but that's just a game theory)
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I always assumed that the power delivery is the culprit. rendering a DDnet should be very fast, so I guess the power consumption rapidly jumps multiple thousand times per second (but that's just a game theory)
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah quite possible and reasonable
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I always assumed that the power delivery is the culprit. rendering a DDnet frame (with no cap) should be very fast, so I guess the power consumption rapidly jumps multiple thousand times per second (but that's just a game theory)
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I am going to play around with Vulkan today. Maybe I can write a MIDI player that works with coil whine
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds good, play teeworlds background music
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in high pitch
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> lol
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> who needs a soundcard if u have a GPU
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im making a skin renderer in rust and noticed something in tee.js:
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```js
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,192,64,64,32,10,33,60,30); //back feet shadow
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,192,32,64,32,8,32,64,32); //back feet
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,96,0,96,96,16,0,64,64); //body shadow
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,0,0,96,96,16,0,64,64); //body
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,192,64,64,32,26,33,60,30); //front feet shadow
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,192,32,64,32,24,32,64,32); //front feet
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     ctx.drawImage(skin,64,96,32,32,36,14,24,24); //left eye
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all the sahdows should be drawn before anything else
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feet, body shadow should come before right? xd
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my result so far xd

11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is from tee.js

12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can notice its dark on the top side of feet
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> his is ingame
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957942177445593088/unknown.png

12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also does an unnecesary scaling of the feet shadow (on tee.js)
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks do u know what filtering method is used when scaling?
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gaussian?
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what kind of scaling?
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u mean when the GPU fetches the pixels?
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or when u resize an image
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i never really looked into tee.js
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks the tee body on default.png is bigger than whats rendered ingame
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is the scaling filtering method used
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah thats done on GPU
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so in ddnet its simply tri linear filtering
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957944442206167100/unknown.png
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u think is the best
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xd
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean all under cubic(trilinear) are better
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> higher quality
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd use them
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok they all have their advantages it seems... i mean thats always the case
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd say just test it out
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://i.stack.imgur.com/AaIAW.png
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sinc and lanczos look good imo xd
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> use FSR :troll:
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use ai upscaling to native resolution
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957949289068372019/result.png
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trying to get the eyes right
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks do u know what values direction.x has?
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957949367015309332/unknown.png
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a float
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a normalized value
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so if its 1, y is 0
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if x is 1 it means ->
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho im not sure about y
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think teeworlds goes down if y increases
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but honestly doesnt matter for your purpose xd
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957950787391217694/unknown.png

12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> this document should have all the relevant values for tee rendering

12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga what is webgpu doing xd
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe we can add this to the wiki
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly its rly hard to figure out the tee rendering code
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> have a complete map viewer without the mipmapping. currently trying to set it up to run with opengl, wanna do the first release after :)
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mipmapping in vulkan is rather hard
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno if webgpu splits the idea of vulkan and opengl
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or if it allows both
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> in vulkan you at least have blit, in webgpu you don't even have that ;(
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh yeah
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that sucks
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> there is a mipmapping example you can try to copy over that uses a compute shader, however I didn't have the motivation yet. in the future I think they wanna have either blit or automatic mipmapping
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/386
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean shaders can even improve it, but your texture needs to be set as render target, i dunno if this is more unlikely to be supported by all GPUs
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga what does 4/64 up exactly mean?
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 64 is the body size
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and up?
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> uh, up in space? along the y-axis
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> body is always a bit higher than the rendering coordinates
12:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah tee rendering is a bit unintuitive, lot of random values xd
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and 0.7 didnt fix it T_T
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we stuck with it forever
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ouch
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> it always bothered me that when I zoom in the tee looks off-center
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> wouldn't it just look more correct (at least to a new player), if we move the tee body to the center, along with everything else
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it would break all skins
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah then the feet might seem too low?
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah the body is in the ground then
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> meh
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it could have been fixed by fixing the textures
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> make better rules on how a tee is built in general
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> welp, I guess we are doomed
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> defs
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but at this point any change would probs look weird to most ppl anyway
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 0.7 eyes are also weird xD
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still dont understand it
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > feet:
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         10/64 down
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         7/64 left/right
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> down from what?
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> imagine you have a rendering coordinate
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the mid of a body
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> you put all the different parts into space, with their center point on the same spot, and move everything according to those values
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If I want to wait 1 sec. 
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I should count up to GameTicksSpeed?
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It seems that I have to wait 15*GameTicksSpeed
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Maybe it's related with fps?
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gametickspeed is correct, if you also use tick
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want to wait client side
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use time_get_microseconds
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or time_get() and time_freq
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still couldnt tell how to use that text
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so im trying by myself
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the eye is still weird

14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u understand what he meant when he said all quads share the same center?

14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried it
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but 10/64 down
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk from the center, its plain wrong
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> imagine u have a quad
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it goes -0.5 in left and top
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and +0.5 in right and down
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u have a quad with center 0,0
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah im working with pixels directly
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but thats how u have to imagine it
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all eyes etc are individual quads
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and all share the same center at start
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so 10/64 means the value of the division right
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok i guess ill have to work with opengl coords
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, the body quad u can imagine as 64 pixels
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so if that is the case u move 10/64 pixels
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all quad coords are from their centers right?
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (*64) bcs u use 64pixels
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just to be clear
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so basically the ratio as u said
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> getting closer xd
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> why doesn't the tee hide the old hookthrough entity?
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this only depends on how the mapper put the game layers
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if the front layer is before the game layer it should also be rendered first
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> ahhh, i see. thanks
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957995274578591804/unknown.png
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i updated the js script
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this looks way better
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957995310985134080/unknown.png
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than this old one
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah much better
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Rockus> nice one
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> eyes are still too small right?
15:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957998249560637440/unknown.png
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now?
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just any value that is not divisible by 8 is wrong
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt matter tho cuz its just a web render
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just trying values randomly xd
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> look pretty much like ingame now, but need to see when its finished
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but defs much better than the old one
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym when its finished
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when its online
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks merge it
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we see it
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the web updates auto
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better than this for sure
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957998908779405352/unknown.png

15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> so is there anything super specific that i need to account for when making a grayscale tee that's easy for recoloring?
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i tried to make an alternate glow_cammo skin for PlantKnight, but even if the colors seem to be identical, the coloring completely changes

16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hecking love the ddnet.tw web source code
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki why the d
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958006386044829726/unknown.png
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is that intendet?
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xddd
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fixed
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i noticed this
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958006615406161950/160417652-69b34380-274b-4797-a15d-d44f615925c8.png
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im doing this to fix it
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958006644053245992/160417673-27971c52-f037-4d0e-8581-a7675152c405.png
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> power of flexbox
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing beats my uniqueclan.net maps page
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958007014217383946/unknown.png
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so clean
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but trying to do this in ddnet.tw is hard cuz everything is a python 2 mess
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when webview for ddnet client
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> +300mbytes
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when does the web rebuild?
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try to slowly modernize the web
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first step, migrate to python 3
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit hard to edit it, cuz i can't reproduce a build of the web locally
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and lots of links are hardlinked to ddnet.tw
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so after porting to python 3 the website should try to be more easier to setup up locally
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thus making dev easier
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes pls xd
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think even deen has a local copy of that site running. Production = master :D
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks its updated
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/skins/
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice, finally not so ugly skins xd

18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> back when deen was pro xd
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> he's not anymore?
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i doubt he still plays does he

18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> XDD his dynamic camera dead zone
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> these videos are really old
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 6 years xd
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 8 years even
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i answered on your pr
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> not sure if you've seen it
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yet
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah u said u have no time xd
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why u here then xddd
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Undo function in editor (initial work by MAP94)"
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lie xdd
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> still running away from work
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn well thanks btw for all the testing
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i need to find some music to push me to work
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Should I proceed with smart pause feature commit?
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Any pro/cons/suggestions?
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when do you think it is useful btw?
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how about adding a new chat command instead of config /spause or smth
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd say /spec sounds more useful, then nobody can touch u, if thats what u fear
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> spec is not allowed on many maps though
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> smart pause would be a solution to that
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> map has no /spec -> turn on smart pause
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could just fix /spec to not allow spawn inside another tee, then u can enable it on all maps
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Yeah, people become tired to wait if they fail and go spect other teams
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (create exception for the 5 maps that need old behavior ofc)
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont even have a pause bind xD
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> On server side we could add a check that need enough space before unspec.
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> There are a lot of collision helper functions
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on a second thought, that would allow trolls to block u from going out of spec
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also annoying
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its optional
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so you can turn it on only in your team
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> while your newschool bud tries to do solo part
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i meant it relating to spec not allowing u if there is someone standing inside u
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it also affects /spec?
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just read convo xd
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> convo + your thoughts xd
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> from here
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> why not allow people to stand inside eachother using /spec?
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just read the convo
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then i said maybe we can fix /spec
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then i said
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah wait, there is a problem with trolls xD
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but generally, i dunno if you new to teeworlds, shotgun bug and collision bugs
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> if that was an actual issue then why aren't cheatable maps have spec disabled already
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> for example Unbalanced
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> if that was an actual issue then why don't cheatable maps have spec disabled already
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs map testers are potatos? i dunno
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why not always protect spawn so there is never a startline skip
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cuz fun
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs someone apparently likes creating cheats xd
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and now we have weird work arounds that tell you to start or you cannot finish the map xd
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> a lot do
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> not only trolls. Can also be that he is afk or timeout, and some are under him in /spec can then no longer get out of spec.
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but in that case you could also vote him in spec
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Not sure how old that map is. But removing spec influence top ranks, because of strong weak changing position
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Can't disable when it is enabled for long
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> top ranks are all cheated
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958053612355993660/unknown.png
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> top ranks are all skipped
19:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well you could decide to change it but we had lots of discussions about this and the conclusion was you cannot change skips like these if it is used already a lot
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least map name checks out
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Median time doesn't sound like a brutal map :p
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> yeah of course, it's really hard to get a middleground in a sitatuon like this. fixing /spec would make some maps uncheatable, and then you'd have to remove every skipped rank that used /spec
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> or else it'd be unfair
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> Unbalanced absolutely uses /spec, so if you don't remove these ranks, then noone else can cheat the map anymore which would be an unfair advantage to the current finishers
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> We don't remove ranks except if it is cheated or we remove a critical skip (one u dont need skills for).
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Besides it is difficult to touch these ranks. Because the players in the current top5 won't like this idea now.
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> yeah
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> I talk like i am still a moderator lol:pepeH:
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Knuski> U will remain one forever in our hearts <a:catKiss:933098278499794974>
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks Should we wait for someone to test https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4907 before 16.0 release?
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I guess it would be safer to do so yeah
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> dont change, make it better in future maps instead
