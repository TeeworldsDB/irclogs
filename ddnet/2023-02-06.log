15:14 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks I want to continue with twgpu (once I stitched together a demo reader with libtw2) and some things are still a mystery to me
15:14 < bridge> <Patiga> in particular: how do you work around not having array texture bindings in the web? Array textures just seem so damn comfy. I would like to use them for tilemaps and in the future skins of tees. do you do a draw call for each skin/tee? Currently I hack around using array textures for tilemaps by using those 3D textures, but that will fall apart once I introduce mipmaps, since 3D/cube textures also collapse on the z axis in mip maps
15:16 < bridge> <Patiga> do I need to create textures atlases? they seem annoying to work with
15:17 < bridge> <Patiga> -> texture atlases also sound like they will be really annoying to create mip maps for, if that is even a thing, I'll have a look
15:18 < bridge> <Patiga> yeah okay its possible with spacing but it still sounds weird to work with
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There are no texture arrays? Use them for tile rendering.. Emscripten is gles3 compatible and they managed to make it work(as e.g. the webclient works)
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that a wgpu limitation or actual webgl limitation?
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For skins I split them on the cpu BCS gl1.x
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Generally I have to say I am not really a fan of texture atlasses. They don't improve performance, they might make files a bit smaller and reduce io a bit. But they also make customization much harder
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't think u can easily mix them with skins anyway. Body is bigger than feet etc. I'd suggest for skin rendering split them or use integer sampling in shader. Or you need to render many tees at once on the GPU and want to put skins as whole in a texture atlasses? else I don't see a real use case?
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Also different sized skins make this harder again.
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Updating the texture can be costly as it is one chunk of memory.
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For tile maps they are a perfect fit tho^^
15:40 < bridge> <Patiga> ah, would you suggest a draw call for each tee? the transformations of the body parts is probably better calculated on the cpu, right?
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well if cpu isn't a hard limit that is probably easier. If‚Ñ¢Ô∏è we have skins similar to 0.7 u might have to do it anyway.  But since u target gles3 u can defs simply use integer sampling
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In glsl
15:44 < bridge> <Patiga> do you mean with integer sampling that I sample for an integer type instead of a float?
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah basically u sample the texels itself
15:45 < bridge> <Patiga> isn't float better to get the interpolation?
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah it's harder . But floats have a disadvantage as u not know the mipmap and even if u know. U won't get clamped edges
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then u have texture bleeding
15:49 < bridge> <Patiga> hm true one draw call for each tee probably results in easier code. one of my problems is that I still have zero clue which operations are expensive to which degree. I assumed that one draw call for all tees would just be much much more efficient and cleaner. for 0.7 skins it would be possible to create a texture array for each body part I suppose
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I thought glsl offers good functions. I can't find them rn tho.
15:50 < bridge> <Patiga> okay I guess I'll just not even start with texture atlases as they will probably cause more harm than good
15:50 < bridge> <Patiga> so far all my shaders are in wgsl, although wgpu also has optional support for spirv and glsl
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Problem is. U somehow have to tell the GPU which tee uses which skins. And this requires either building up some buffer/CMD every frame. A draw call might carry extra dependencies about which sampler to use. But in the end it's probs not too much difference
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Smaller textures also might be more cache friendly
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd say if u don't create too many calls a draw call is very cheap
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A draw call without state change is basically free
15:53 < bridge> <Patiga> oh interesting
15:54 < bridge> <Patiga> "lifehack: get more fps by always using the same skin as your race partner"
15:55 < bridge> <Patiga> you should add that to the gfx troubleshooting guide xd
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. Interesting would be if there would already be finished shaders for such stuff. Custom sampling. But i guess not many ppl want this
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. It already uses the same vertices tho. Depending on how clever the driver is. The GPU keeps them in a fast cache
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Esp. Since it's only very few vertices
15:57 < bridge> <Patiga> if you mean clamp modes and sampling type, those are all properties of the sampler, only partly defined in the shader?
15:58 < bridge> <Patiga> I really need to figure out if texture arrays are a thing in the web, I'll have a look
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In the end a sampler is also just a higher level component to help u out with this stuff
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U could use a uniform buffer and do all stuff your own
15:59 < bridge> <Patiga> oh wow, so the sampler maps pretty directly to shader code? I had no idea
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It could be possible GPUs have extra instructions to do it faster
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But considering how fast cuda cores are for many things. U could probs do stuff like this your own too
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They are
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The webgl2 limits mention max texture array layers
16:06 < bridge> <Patiga> hrmpf yes also found it
16:06 < bridge> <Patiga> I guess I'll open an wgpu issue, if its not too complicated I might try to implement it myself
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Only problem is probably that they have many backends don't they?^^
16:07 < bridge> <Patiga> wdym?
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Webgl shading language follows gles3. So you could fetch single texels
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Don't they support dx11 on breakup
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Desktop
16:08 < bridge> <Patiga> but wgpu won't allow me to create array texture sampler on webgl2
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean since u said, if it's easy to implement^^
16:10 < bridge> <Patiga> https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu#supported-platforms
16:11 < bridge> <Patiga> they do group the backends into different support levels
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In their dev docs they mention texture arrays
16:11 < bridge> <Patiga> the texture binding as well
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean in ogl u bind a sampler to a texture slot
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So only the texture has to support it
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The sampler only does thing like interpolation
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ddnet VK code only uses like 9 samplers total
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They are used for all textures
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In the shader u call texture with a vec3 iirc
16:14 < bridge> <Patiga> wait I am confused.
16:16 < bridge> <Patiga> in wgpu, a bind group consists of binding resources (https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/enum.BindingResource.html). only TextureViewArray requires the feature enabled. but since textures can be array by themselves, you only need a `BindingResource::Texture`
16:16 < bridge> <Patiga> aaaaaaaah
16:16 < bridge> <Patiga> I think I always missed that difference
16:16 < bridge> <Patiga> so it is already supported by wgpu
16:17 < bridge> <Patiga> :sendhelp:
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah sounds reasonable
16:18 < bridge> <Patiga> I guess TextureViewArray would be easier to work with, since then we would have individual allocations and don't have to update the entire thing
16:19 < bridge> <Patiga> but it also just sounds fine with Textures that are arrays themselves
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh does it work like that?
16:20 < bridge> <Patiga> is there such a concept in graphics as a growable buffer/texture abstraction? ^^ like double or smth the size of the array whenever we reach the limit and leave the unused stuff uninitialised
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Spec only guarantees like 16 texture bindings
16:21 < bridge> <Patiga> the way I understand it is that it is one binding consisting of references to the different textures
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not really. GPU copying is probably not the fastest. The memory is very specialized on fast reading of large chunks
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That would be surprising
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> From the name it sounds like it's the texture view for a texture array
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Every texture has a texture view
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In case the internal image is compressed or stuff like that
16:23 < bridge> <Patiga> that is what threw me off every time
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> From VK point of view at least
16:24 < bridge> <Patiga> `TextureViewArray(&'a [&'a TextureView]),` indicates however that we can use texture views from different textures
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah true
16:25 < bridge> <Patiga> but its so very confusing, you might be right and my previous understand might be correct
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why not call Ur array of texture view then xd
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's confusing. And to me the only logical explanation is that they wanted to abstract away multi texture bindings
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But it has a completely different max limit per shader stage
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Better be careful with it
16:26 < bridge> <Patiga> https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/enum.BindingType.html
16:26 < bridge> <Patiga> when we define the layout, there are no array variants, the texture is described by https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/enum.TextureViewDimension.html
16:26 < bridge> <Patiga> this does indicate that we need `BindingResource::ViewArray`
16:26 < bridge> <Patiga> aaaarg
16:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Usually there is simply a depth Attribute
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is there none for texture views
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Array layer referring to webgpu
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Are they simply missing access functionality?
16:30 < bridge> <Patiga> there is https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.TextureViewDescriptor.html#structfield.array_layer_count
16:30 < bridge> <Patiga> okay I'll open up an issue directly coz this is getting too weird
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But what exactly is the problem
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U have textures that have a layer count and a texture view that allows to say what layers you want to view
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's all you need
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> One texture 2d array has one texture view
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The texture view is simply a pre defined memory pointer
16:33 < bridge> <Patiga> hm
16:33 < bridge> <Patiga> so a texture_view_array is simply an entirely different thing where you can throw together any kinds of texture views from different textures together
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think this is simply multi texturing
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The name is just bad
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `#![deny(clippy::missing_const_for_fn)]`  add this on ur main module and rust will tell u to add const to functions that can have it, pretty pog
16:35 < bridge> <Patiga> but then how do you define the layout, when the `BindingType` doesn't differentiate between texture2darray and textureviewarray
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U use a single texture view
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is nothing like a viewarray
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A texture view is the same for all possible textures
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It already defines what of the texture u want to view
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The view array they have in the enum struct is just a variant for multi texturing
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It had nothing to do with the texture type
16:37 < bridge> <Patiga> ah you are right, the arrays are one layer above the `BindingType`
16:37 < bridge> <Patiga> https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.BindGroupLayoutEntry.html#structfield.count
16:37 < bridge> <Patiga> okay now everything seems to make sense, thank you :)
16:38 < bridge> <Patiga> I guess the only problem with using a texture2darray is that every layer must have the same size
16:39 < bridge> <Patiga> but I heard you have a strong opinion on skin size maximums, so I guess I can just scale them to the same size and it'll be just fine
16:40 < bridge> <Patiga> ah that is if I use texture2darrays for the skins, but it does sound better to me rn
16:40 < bridge> <Patiga> I'll see when I get there
16:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you want to do it in one draw call. How do u solve the transparency problem
16:44 < bridge> <Patiga> which one would that be? getting the limbs of the tees in the correct drawing ordeR?
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah drawing order and blending
16:48 < bridge> <Patiga> hmm

16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ez
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> redox os should become popular
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since the kernel is rust
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rustlib is rust
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nah
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Micro kernels suck
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/redox-os/relibc
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks using unsafe is not something inherently bad
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u gotta use it u gotta use it
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just add a safety comment
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually there is a lint to require u adding a safety comment
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Depends
16:58 < bridge> <yeeeey> Can the version of opengl affect the quality of the game?
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gl1 ugly
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> after all unsafe is there cuz the borrow checker is not perfect
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but better than nothing
16:58 < bridge> <yeeeey> open gl 1.x/
16:58 < bridge> <yeeeey> open gl 1.x?
16:58 < bridge> <yeeeey> or 1.0
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes and 2.0
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and 3
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1.x
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use vulkan
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3.0 is the first good one
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> directx is ugly too
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like microsoft
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I've missed feelings about this
17:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well its also cuz the borrow checker cant ensure safety of ffi
17:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and native
17:00 < bridge> <yeeeey> If I had a vulkan  would the pixels be less visible when zoomed in?
17:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the good thing about unsafe is safety encapsulation
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sure u know where the bad memory access is. But if that results in having to resign every higher level stuff, then this unsafe was a design problem and not only unsafe.. kinda extrem case. But yeah
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ? Xd
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is your monitor broken?
17:02 < bridge> <Patiga> vulkan does not provide higher-quality textures, those come from the maps/skins
17:02 < bridge> <yeeeey> no
17:02 < bridge> <yeeeey> quality strange
17:03 < bridge> <yeeeey> ok
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Show screenshots
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And show what is wrong
17:03 < bridge> <yeeeey> 1 sec
17:05 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks it looked better in my head, one draw call for each tee does look cleaner to implement, off the top of my hat, I'd say
17:05 < bridge> <Patiga> - a texture2darray with all skins pngs
17:05 < bridge> <Patiga> - a constant vertex array with the vertices for the different limbs, including position, uv
17:05 < bridge> <Patiga> - a tee-specifc vertex array with the step size { vertices of each limb }, which has the tranformation matrices for each limb, and maybe we also include the skin index here
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Besides ash requires unsafe for every VK call anyway. I indeed only had one use case yet for unsafe
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And that was a performance reason
17:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye i think ash is the low level
17:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what about vulkano
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't want to use it
17:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a valid reason, provided u know its safe
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Learning yet another high level graphics api sucks xd
17:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but ye ash is all unsafe cuz it has to be
17:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its unsafe to call any vulkan api
17:07 < bridge> <Patiga> I created a ray tracer with vulkano for uni once, it was pleasant to work with iirc
17:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1072186851915481158/image.png
17:07 < bridge> <Patiga> not with the ray-tracing extension tho
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to get into vulkan and graphics again
17:08 < bridge> <yeeeey> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1072186983323029686/image.png
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its always kidna fun
17:09 < bridge> <yeeeey> why do i see these pixels?
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2nd screenshot? And which renderer there?
17:09 < bridge> <yeeeey> 1.5.0
17:09 < bridge> <yeeeey> opengl
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Are u that one guy again tw?

17:10 < bridge> <yeeeey> yes
17:10 < bridge> <yeeeey> Delete this message
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It resizes the body
17:12 < bridge> <yeeeey> If I had a modern graphics card with Vulkan would those pixels be less visible?
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BCS gl1 does not require to support non power of two textures
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
17:12 < bridge> <yeeeey> a. ok
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can also try a higher resolution skin
17:13 < bridge> <yeeeey> My maximum resolution is 1366x768

17:16 < bridge> <yeeeey> ok
17:19 < bridge> <yeeeey> I downloaded what next?
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Unpack and put skins in skins directory

17:50 < bridge> <newlesstee> where i will check when the player hook in character entity?
17:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, do it in gamecore
17:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can add a field to the character core
17:53 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991 how to check if player is authed in the gamecore?
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> add a field to the character core
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> bool m_Authed
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then set that flag from outside
17:54 < bridge> <newlesstee> hmm
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> from player e.g., or character.cpp
17:55 < bridge> <newlesstee> i will try
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its sad
18:03 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991 it worked!! thanks, but i'm setting on tick, there an way to set only when authed state changes?
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know how
18:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> setting it each tick is okayish
18:06 < bridge> <newlesstee> yes, thank you

19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and also update your GPU driver
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vsync shouldnt create black screens
19:39 < bridge> <i.> already did
19:39 < bridge> <i.> still getting black screen
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u did what i posted in the screenshot?
19:40 < bridge> <i.> not using stream
19:40 < bridge> <i.> not using steam
19:40 < bridge> <i.> all drivers fine
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then add it to the end of ddnet_settings.cfg
19:40 < bridge> <i.> sec
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah totally fine
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but without `"` in the cfg file
19:41 < bridge> <i.> ik
19:42 < bridge> <i.> well still blackscreen
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats ur hardware and opearting system
19:42 < bridge> <i.> e
19:42 < bridge> <i.> i3 4gb
19:42 < bridge> <i.> i3 4gb ram
19:43 < bridge> <i.> i mean it was working, then i press on it by misstake and it was already black xd
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```

19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also try to click "restart" in windows shutdown context menu
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that makes a clean restart without caches
19:44 < bridge> <i.> im using linux
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that makes stuff easier
19:45 < bridge> <i.> veri good!
19:45 < bridge> <i.> üôÇ
19:45 < bridge> <newlesstee> Hello, does anyone know how to put an lib on ddnet?
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> open a terminal in ddnet directory and type `./DDNet "gfx_backend opengl; gfx_gl_major 1"`
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its too hard to explain, best is your first try to understand c++ ecosystem and cmake
19:46 < bridge> <i.> when i save it and start the client from console the settings getting reseted
19:46 < bridge> <i.> lemme try
19:46 < bridge> <newlesstee> Could you give me an example?
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see the cmake directory
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there u see how SDL2 was added
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or opus
19:48 < bridge> <i.> well worked, also one question too. im only getting about 30fps ingame.. any idea what i could do?
19:48 < bridge> <newlesstee> @Jupeyy_Keks so much things
19:48 < bridge> <newlesstee> you mean this?

19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well you only said i3
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what i3? there are like 20 versions of i3s
19:48 < bridge> <newlesstee> i just want to add D++
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on what operating system are u?
19:49 < bridge> <newlesstee> linux
19:49 < bridge> <newlesstee> this?

19:49 < bridge> <i.> i3 M 330 2.13GHz x 2
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff thats old
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess u have to live with 30fps
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> turn on entities, lower resolution
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> search in arch wiki
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they often give help for old hardware
19:51 < bridge> <i.> i guess if i get 60 im fine
19:51 < bridge> <i.> xd
19:51 < bridge> <i.> im playing on my pc
19:51 < bridge> <i.> but also nice when i can chill in bed and play there
19:51 < bridge> <i.> can u give me a link
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> google can give u a link
19:52 < bridge> <i.> i hate google
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats your problem
19:52 < bridge> <i.> and google me
19:59 < bridge> <i.> @Jupeyy_Keks wow, only switched from vulkan to opengl and now i have over 300 fps
19:59 < bridge> <i.> XD
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah then u probably have a software renderer installed
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably lavapipe
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that also means u didnt do all these commands right
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs as u see they clearly reset to opengl
20:01 < bridge> <i.> because the config reset when i start ddnet
20:06 < bridge> <i.> well im fine, played a bit with the settings.. got about 800 fps now
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic gamer moment
20:24 < bridge> <newlesstee> pls, help
20:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/cleverca22/not-os
20:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks lel
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generate tw os out of it
20:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i installed nix on my debian vps
20:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill tinker with it
20:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> one of the great thinks about nix is it doesnt require nixos
20:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and nix-shell is awesome
21:48 < bridge> <newlesstee> Can someone help?
21:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's probably too hard to explain for me
21:56 < bridge> <newlesstee> I just wanted to add DPP(D++ for discord web hooks) to DDNet
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you only want to send web hooks?
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> webhooks are simple https requests
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can simply do them with the built-in https client
22:00 < bridge> <newlesstee> can you give me an simple example? @heinrich5991
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what OS are you on?
22:02 < bridge> <newlesstee> linux
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> quick tldr, but dont ping or dm later to help u (i wont answer): you need to create a FindLibraryName.cmake under cmake/ and then look at how another lib is added, like miniupnp, and u should figure it out easily
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u need to know cmake
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "easily"
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't do it "easily" either
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well its easy for me
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> depends on the library
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if ur findcmake doesnt work usually u need to add .so to the hint name
22:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i spend 30 mins sometimes withh that
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have a test discord webhook @newlesstee?
22:04 < bridge> <newlesstee> i have created an web hook
22:05 < bridge> <newlesstee> but i want to use, i find the D++ that can help me
22:05 < bridge> <newlesstee> but i dont know how to add in CMakeLists
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you share the URL, but replace the secrets with something else
22:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...edg-l:ddnet:encrypted_messages#diff-1e7de1ae2d059d21e1dd75d5812d5a34b0222cef273b7c3a2af62eb747f9d20a>
22:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is how i added libsodium

22:06 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> now type something like this in a terminal `curl https://discord.com/api/webhooks/10722288278472198/WJ_ttmFzObJUevzn9L-QxUMVeFt8Fp24wZIba --data '{"content":"test"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
22:08 < bridge> <newlesstee> i want to do this in the DDNet server
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should be able
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet has http
22:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, I understand. do you understand the `curl` request?
22:08 < bridge> <newlesstee> yes
22:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm trying to show you that it's simple HTTPS requests, we can do DDNet server next
22:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
22:08 < bridge> <newlesstee> hm
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try calling this function: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/911bd0e69a8fee9b02f0cea26d50ecc2f000bc3c/src/engine/shared/http.h#L187
22:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and then pass that to `Engine()->AddJob()`
22:11 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991 how to pass the json as char?
22:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
22:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `"{\"content\":\"test\"}"`
22:34 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991 how to pass the type of std::unique_ptr<CHttpRequest> in AddJob?
22:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you might be able to just pass it
22:36 < bridge> <Learath2> While I don't find this way of butting your head against C++ to learn it very efficient, you are probably looking for something along the lines of `make_unique<CHttpRequest>`
22:36 < bridge> <Learath2> We have many examples of it in the code
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they already have `std::unique_ptr<CHttpRequest>`
22:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Or maybe just a `HttpGet`
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> learning c++ the ddnet way
22:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> new book by learath
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but need `std::shared_ptr<IJob>`
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but `CHttpRequest` is derived from `IJob`
22:37 < bridge> <newlesstee> `error: cannot convert ‚Äòstd::unique_ptr<CHttpRequest>‚Äô to ‚Äòstd::shared_ptr<IJob>‚Äô`
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `std::move(your_unique_ptr)`
22:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `Engine()->AddJob(std::move(your_unique_ptr))`
22:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I would never suggest anyone in a million years to take this approach, C/C++ just aren't very suited to this. Though I know we disagree on this üòÑ
22:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a opportunity for a shameless plug
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @newlesstee https://edgarluque.com/blog/intro-to-ddnet/
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe this helps
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not related to http tho
22:41 < bridge> <newlesstee> I know I'm going the wrong way, but eventually I'll learn
22:41 < bridge> <newlesstee> Difficult things make me motivated
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> good
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we got a future dev here
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > This version of rustup fixes a warning incorrectly saying that signature verification failed for Rust releases. The warning was due to a dependency of Rustup including a time-based check preventing the use of SHA-1 from February 1st, 2023 onwards.
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > 
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Unfortunately Rust's release signing key uses SHA-1 to sign its subkeys, which resulted in all signatures being marked as invalid. Rustup 1.25.2 temporarily fixes the problem by allowing again the use of SHA-1.
22:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> using SHA1‚Ä¶
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in 2015 many ppl used sha1
22:42 < bridge> <newlesstee> Where is the Engine()? i only see in client side
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but ye shame
22:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ignore the Engine part, just call `AddJob` as before
22:43 < bridge> <Learath2> Like in an ideal world just the signatures `inline std::unique_ptr<CHttpRequest> HttpGet(...)` and `virtual void AddJob(std::shared_ptr<IJob>)` should just take you on one detour to `class CHttpRequest : public IJob` at that point the whole api should be quite clear

22:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im the internet observer
22:45 < bridge> <Learath2> So, how will the proper fix be I wonder? Maybe splitting the upgrade line in 2?
22:45 < bridge> <newlesstee> AddJob isnt declared
22:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how did you get this error?
22:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what code did you write?
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do a git diff and show us xd
22:46 < bridge> <newlesstee> ```c++

22:46 < bridge> <newlesstee> ```
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in which function is this?
22:49 < bridge> <newlesstee> DDRace.cpp (i dont know if i can change this file but i'm only testing)

22:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `GameServer()->Engine()->AddJob(‚Ä¶)`
22:50 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm guessing you meant a different reply üòÑ

22:51 < bridge> <newlesstee> thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is "upgrade line"? depending on the signing situation it's a bit hard and you need to maintain two signing paths
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but maybe it's easy and you can just upgrade everything to sha256
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> another question is why someone chose sha1 after 2015
22:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it was known-broken well before that
22:53 < bridge> <Learath2> As in what we have with update2.ddnet.tw update3.ddnet.tw etc. Split the line into two, one where you can upgrade all the way up to the last version with a sha1 signature, have a version that supports both signatures there and then future versions only support sha256
22:56 < bridge> <newlesstee> Can't change src/engine code? I tried to change some things and it didn't compile
22:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can change src/engine code as well
23:07 < bridge> <newlesstee> what function of str replace an character?
23:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you want to escape something for JSON?
23:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we got `JsonEscape` for that
23:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> @heinrich5991 i want to replace this char: `
23:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> to \`
23:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> to \\`
23:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you mean `"` to `\"`
