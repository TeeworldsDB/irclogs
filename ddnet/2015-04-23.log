01:47 <@deen> hope these are fine
14:21 < Nimda> Caldera by Â»Rogue. just released on Brutal at 2015-04-23 14:15
15:26 < Learath2> deen: Are you still hosting addnet server on 54.93.70.244:8304
15:27 < Learath2> cause if not there is something brokem with the serverlist on the javascript client
15:27 <@deen> Learath2: yes, i am, it has 23 players right now
15:28 < Learath2> then i just cannot connect to it with the js client for some reason
15:28 <@deen> sometimes the js client doesn't connect to some servers
15:28 <@deen> i don't know why
15:29 < Learath2> yeah ican connect with the normal client 
15:33 <@deen> Maybe a problem with downloading maps with spaces?
15:33 <@deen> hm no
15:33 <@deen> others work
15:34 < Learath2> eh the client stutters alot for me 
15:34 <@deen> This should be the map http://maps.ddnet.tw/Deadline%201_f722b59c.map
15:34 < Learath2> not sure if its a problem on my side
15:34 <@deen> nono, i can't connect to that 1 server either
15:34 <@deen> others seem to work
15:34 < Learath2> something about the serverside websockets stuff then
15:35 < Learath2> eeeee: any idea how i can reduce the fps stutter when moving ?
15:35 <@deen> nope, that seems to work
15:35 <@deen> I can see the javascript tee joining on the server
15:35 <@deen> only the client can't download the map or load it?
15:35 <@deen> Learath2: use chrome / smaller window
15:36 <@deen> or put the client into a div and make the div automatically smaller until you reach 60 fps :P
15:36 < Learath2> but i already have constant 60
15:36 < Learath2> its like a sudden spike
15:37 <@deen> have any other tabs open?
15:37 < Learath2> nope
15:37 <@deen> i'm not sure how browsers do it currently, but maybe they still just have 1 thread
15:38 < Learath2> i should have returned this gpu the day i got it ... its probably gpus fault now that i think about it
15:40 <@deen> i don't know, it stutters a bit for me too
15:45 < Learath2> having ping issues aswell so weird....
15:45 < Learath2> its fine in the normal client
