10:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> is masterservers are closed?
10:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> they seem to work for me
10:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> i dont have anyone server :\
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> just "Servers not found"
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> is there a way to compile ddnet using gcc instead of that shitty cl?
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> (through cmake)
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> on windows?
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you cmake through msys it should find gcc
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> hmh okay (yeah on win)
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> msys2*
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> doesn' t seems to work if I use msys
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but I saw there is a MinGW MakeFile generator
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> way much harder to compile something with cmake than with bam lol
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You open msys2, you go to the source directory, `mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make;`
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should just work on it's own, if it doesn't  that means you have cl.exe in your PATH, which you shouldn't have
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I have mingw & vs studio
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but cl isn't on my path
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so gcc is in your PATH, cl.exe isn't and it still finds cl.exe somehow?
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yeah xD
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well normally it doesn't need the full path of cl.exe
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> maybe it search for any vs installation & then so he can find out a full path directly of cl
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but wait i've didn't test using msys2 program for now, i've only tested the generator flag MSYS Makefiles
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I give up it sucks, i'll find a way to export back bam
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <♪♫> i'd cross compille it from a linux vm i've always find doing those things on windows annoying
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you need to specify the generator cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
22:55 <@heinrich5991> ReiTW: you can also use the gui if the cli does unintuitive things
22:55 <@heinrich5991> but yea, what Jupstar said is true
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even said you need to use msys2, that was literally my only advice
23:24 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: the bridge is still blocked
23:24 <+Learath2> btw :P
23:24 <+Learath2> oh it's not blocked, but it seems dead
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 well it wasn't working at all with mingw32 but it was ok with 64
