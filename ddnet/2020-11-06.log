00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well normal metals don't just randomly become superconductors at 0K
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neither does silicon iirc. You need some weird alloys to get superconductivity

07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> emm what?

07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> you now own Unique CAN | Football
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> btw spec cursor works pretty ok it seems.
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :tee_thinking: but i did simply scaled down the intragametick for the 25 snaps/sec thing

09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want hide time on record without hide hearts and shields ,scoreboard:saddo:
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 no option for that, sorry. also we're trying to reduce the number of options, not increase it
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> normally you is needed choice in first time just why need reduce of options?
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the idea is that for every option added the number of combinations of options explodes, and there is a higher chance of combinations breaking something
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we can't test all combinations
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but this still important for me
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have added a PR, let's see if others think it's ok
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> üëç ty
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want seems my the videos like any player normally so i should be leave hearts and shields.., but without showing i did win in million minutes XD
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want seems my  videos like any player normally so i should be leave hearts and shields.., but without showing i did win in million minutes XD
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want seems my  videos like any player normally so i should be leave the hearts and shields.., but without showing i did win in million minutes XD
11:15 <+ChillerDragonTL> Any reason you don‚Äôt have the ddrace Score activated? Your scoreboard shows -9999 instead of race times 
11:16 <+ChillerDragonTL> heinrich5991 meh will #teeworlds stay auth only? I don‚Äôt have my credentials on mobile 
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> excuse me , did you know how the bot make hyper-link like in this message : https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/338779500085116938/774050434126053398
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> see here so crowded

16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the patterns are simple arent they @Az2Poivron
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's `https://ddnet.tw/players/<playername>`
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Az2Poivron we use markdown for that, it's allowed for bots
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and maps/<mapname>)
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> again i suggesting put possibilty team in anyteam
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> > @Az2Poivron we use markdown for that, it's allowed for bots
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Az2Poivron> @deen does this requiere special autorisation in the server settings ?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was probllem points for teams and top5 ...
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you make other thing without points and name it /room or something
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think so
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was problem points for teams and top5 ...
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you make other thing without points and name it /room or something
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but normal people can't use markdown
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if was problem the points for teams and top5 ...
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you  can make other thing without points and name it /room or something
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> again i suggesting put possibilty team in anytime

17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis could you test if the graphics hang stops happening with gfx_opengl_major 2, gfx_opengl_minor 0?
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> wait can irc users use markdown or what are you talking about?
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> # test
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye later
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk:
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i thought ppl only get salty in vanilla's PRs
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> btw for the love of god i still can't figure out how to deal with demos. i don't know how to record local player's cursor and how to deal with server demos.
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> maybe send targetpos alongwith charactercore instead of spectatorinfo would be easier, but i can think of ways to use the data to do anti-aim or auto-kill on fng.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> so it is probably safer to only have it alongwith spectatorinfo
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and smaller
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :EeveeShy: plz someone tell me to stop, so i can go to bed. i don't know if we really need this in a race mod.
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it would be a cool feature
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the cursor view
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> make the data only sent to spectators that way it cant be used for that purpose
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is only being sent to spectators
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> that's why the demo is so hard to deal with
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh server demo does sound like a challenge
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and local player
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> spec in demo also "just works"
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> demo of spectating a player also "just works"
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> all these challenges are why i took the lazy route and just drew a tee
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :GhostHeart:
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> I mean the main part which is having a cursor when spectating is working just fine.
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ooo
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rly
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats cool
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://github.com/TsFreddie/ddnet/tree/spectator-cursor
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `teeworlds.cn`
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol awesome tho
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are u gonna push it
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> pr*
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Cuz why not
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Idk. I would like it to be working everywhere before submitting a pr
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fair
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> I can also just have a demo only netobject. Idk if thats a thing normally
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Also sounds like too much protocol addons
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think theres nothing wrong with it
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Well I don't like it.
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is there a better way
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Probably
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> If I can figure out how demo works exactly
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gl lol
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :GhostHeart: maybe I should just do it the easy way and let you deal with the bots
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but this would be a good addition to let everyone help decide on players who are detected
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> when its not a strong enough detection to be 100% sure
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> It's not really useful to bots in race or standard mods tbh. Only instakill or instafreeze styles games would benefit from a better autokill
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Which fng is one of them
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> couldnt u do that with angle already
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Ye. But you might be able to cut off some unessasary kills with the exact targetpos
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Idk why I did a edit
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ah
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess but
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why not just include it in demos where the player was spectating
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Also who knows. More data always means better bots probably.
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> better detection already does lead to better bots in a way
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> might as well accept it and continue doing whatever u can to mitigate it
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> I mean wouldn't you want to have your local cursor recorded in the demo to show off your sick skillz
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> couldnt it just create and insert that netobject into the demo as its being recorded then?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> That's what I'm trying to figure out
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :sonk:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> send a player their own cursor position from server (xd)
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and tell the client to not draw it by default
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> That sounds like a waste of bandwidth. But it is doable.
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Doesn't solve server demos tho.
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u could have an option to draw the cursor position sent from server
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> similar to the ghost tee in debug mode
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to judge latency
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Nah
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Maybe just draw it in debug mode or something
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk i would add an option regardless
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> in f1 at least
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> If there's an option for the debug mode ghost why not.
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Fuck it let's do it your way and just fuck server demos.
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yee
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who actually uses server demo anyway
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theyre huge
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Server demos are usually wack anyway
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> But if I do it again in vanilla, they would probably need a server demo version
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Or maybe I should just make it in vanilla and wait ddnet to move to 0.7:troll:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :ban:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 0.7 bad
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> .
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :07sucks: 
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :06good:
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :sonk: ban me for supporting 0.7
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie can you test if gfx_opengl_major 2, gfx_opengl_minor 0 makes the intel hang disappear?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah doesn't seem to happen
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it only happens with whatever it defaults to after turning off 3.3 from graphics settings
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie but to be clear u said it also happened with 3.3, didn't u?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just more rare
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm not sure honestly, it has happened a few times at random but maybe I had 3.3 disabled for whatever reason
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's possible that it got turned off with some update and I didn't notice for a while
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah alright
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen u up for one last test?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are calls to
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `RenderBorderTileEmulation`
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `RenderBorderTileLineEmulation`
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd really like to know if one of these two functions is causing it
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, do you have a build for me to try?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> source state* i can build myself
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u need to disable both individually if it doesnt crash anyway
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are only called once each
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (by one caller)
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ still hangs
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok thanks
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well only sus thing is that the map has a speedup layer which seem to be unused, but if that can cause anything, i dunno
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (the reason i call this sus, is, bcs of that it loads the speedup array)
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only problem is, that other maps, that use speedup, also call this xD, so they should be broken too, or some very black magic is going on, where this 2dtexture is used as normal 2d texture, bcs somewhere in the code a textureclear() is missing
19:24 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragonTL: is the +r the problem? do you know why it was introduced?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but since newer intel work... i dunno xD
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I should try without speedup layer?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nono, u done enough, i doubt this can be related
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its just random assumptions
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tested, still hangs
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it could be anything
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> are u testing in entities for the crash btw?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, only happens in entities
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats the strangest part about it
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least in this spot
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs in entities it doesnt even render alot
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs a timing issue after all
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs entities are the fastest
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's a timing problem, so being the fastest is probably what makes it happen
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> slowing down the opengl calls "fixed" it
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it has to be about changing images, since it happens when touching freeze
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> freeze isnt a new image tho
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ninja
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ninja instead of regular skin
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll try cl_show_ninja 0
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it changes images anyway
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the weapon and feets, body
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all single images
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also im pretty sure others had the bug without touching the freeze
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, still happens. maybe the stars then?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its funny that it happens at the exact same x coordinate:

23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, but you can just press ctrl-s all the time
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, but i think it can be a nice feature
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey, thanks for answer
