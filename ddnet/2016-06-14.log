14:28 <+nameless-tee> deen: nice! Are you gonna improve the game or this is just an example for the article?
15:00 <+Learath2> deen, small typo above proc testBox in the paragraph you wrote textBox
17:35 <@deen> nameless-tee: mainly example for the article
17:36 <@deen> Learath2: thanks
17:41 <+minus> didn't know DDNet had applied to Steam as well; I'm so out of the loop regarding Teeworlds things.
17:41 <@deen> minus: long ago and the community feedback wasn't that great
17:41 <+minus> mh

17:57 <+SusWombat> Hello
17:58 <@deen> hi SusWombat 
20:24 <+SusWombat> Just wanted to say awesome project! (ddnet) ive seen your great article on reddit. I loved to play ddrace some years ago awesome to see it still exists and even has a dedicated client :D
20:25 <@deen> SusWombat: thanks :)
20:59 <+minus> deen: you're dennis?
21:53 <@deen> minus: yep
21:54 <+minus> good job! then
21:54 <+minus> also, nice nim articles you got there
21:54 <+minus> they got me interested a bit more
21:55 <@deen> thanks
22:02 <+minus> deen: you don't happen to have a piece of nim that queries teeworlds servers (or masters) for stats (player count, etc) (and optimally can handle multiple servers and has an http interface to query stuff from)
22:04 <@deen> nope, doing that with existing python stuff
22:05 <+minus> got a link handy?
22:05 <+minus> trying to set up some stuff with that, pushing into prometheus
22:12 <@deen> what's prometheus?
22:13 <@deen> the python library claims to be written by you :P
23:21 <+minus> you're using my library?
23:21 <+minus> hm
23:22 <+minus> i was hoping for something more extensively tested/engineered
23:30 <@deen> haha, nope. works fine though: https://ddnet.tw/status/
23:58 <+minus> prometheus is a time series data store. it basically takes the job of rrdtool. except that you can use grafana as a frontend and get to make nice dashboards
