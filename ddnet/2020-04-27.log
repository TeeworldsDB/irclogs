02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ChillerDragon, are you there?
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen ^^ when you are around pls
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 hi
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> o/
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can you check error.log? I think I broke something with that
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that should have been an elseif not an else if
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, shouldn't need to be
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ^
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh the stupid closing brackets, I wonder why my IDE didn't complain at all
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\-(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-){3}[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$`Â is probably a better regex for uuids
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need to escape - outside of `[]` and not at the start/end of `[]`
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need to escape `-` outside of `[]` and not at the start/end of `[]`
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-){3}[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$` even better
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `[\da-fA-F]`
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `[[:xdigit:]]` ðŸ˜›
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky with grep u can use -E
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't like posix character classes?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ugly
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imo pcre is the best regex
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> PCRE has posix character classes
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but most of time u dont need them
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```This crate provides a library for parsing, compiling, and executing regular expressions. Its syntax is similar to Perl-style regular expressions, but lacks a few features like look around and backreferences.``` rust regex
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You never need them, they can make regex easier to read sometimes
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why most languages cant implement a full pcre
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think php and ruby are pretty complete pcre implementations
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> backreferences are badâ„¢ because they make the expressions no longer regular in the cs sense
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that means they are no longer guranteed to run in linear time
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (PCRE backreferences have exponential worst case)
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, is it because with regexes are supposed to be equivalent to some DFA and with backreferences we can no longer map it to a DFA?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `s/with//`
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the name comes from CS, "regular languages" are exactly those that can be accepted by a DFA
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how regex engines handle backreferences
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> backtracking
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> backtracking as in actually going back to when the match first happened?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, backtracking as in "brute force with backtracking"
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try to greedily match the regex, if it doesn't match, backtrack to the first position where you made a choice and make the next possible choice
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, what choice are they making?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `(a*)*`
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `aaaaaaab`
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, how much to match
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (this is an example where PCRE chokes btw)
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, this one is artificial, but people have been bitten by exponential regexes before (e.g. stackoverflow)
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, I wonder if someone came up with a smart way to do non-regular expressions decently efficiently
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://stackstatus.net/post/147710624694/outage-postmortem-july-20-2016
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is what happens when you get too comfortable with features like these
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with linear-time regex engines, you don't have to worry about it
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always assume a regex match is an order of magnitude more expensive then a more traditional approach
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure that means I use less regex in my code, but whatever, I'd rather have predictable performance
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linear-time regexes give you that predictable performance
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, but say we use a linear-time regex engine on ddnet, then I decide to parse something in js and copy over that regex
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> suddenly my linear-time regex can become an exponential cost ðŸ˜›
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> impressed by the response time by SX btw
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 34 minutes is impressive, indeed
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They probably have some builtin profiling somewhere in the code, it'd be impossible to track it down blind
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe some tracing of calls into the underlying engine
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my nginx will pass PHP_AUTH_USER just fine, the one on ddnet.tw wont
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now it decided it'll start to pass it along
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wtf?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm ðŸ˜„
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah another http header oddity
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yay to not upgrading decades old software because dinosaur forgotten servers we should still be able to connect to
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> elaborat
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, now that I think about it it's more of a PHP oddity
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as soon as you send 1 header, php will no longer touch the headers
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are all your responsibility
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we should not be sending commits to branches to github
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `s/github/discord/`
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Guys, I have weird problem / bug related with `game.png` image. With the default one, if I am in freeze, there are only two rows showing the health & shields bar. If I use custom one, done properly, dilated, without any additional images anywhere on it, I somehow have 3rd row of unknown thing
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/704319403424088174/unknown.png
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> is it bullet's sprite ?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I have no idea, but either way, I didn't draw any additional stuff on  the game.png, so I have totally no idea why anything is appearing in there
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...to make it funnier, I just realized that if I don't dilate the `game.png`, this thing is not appearing .-.
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, it's more complicated than that
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, the answer is it takes the last pixel at bottom right edge, so there has to be at least 1px space from the edge... but why?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> U can help?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Crying write with what already
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> u can ban players in game?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ask @Moderators
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or simply write who does what on #general including server ip & port
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> wrong channel
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> i have this one muted
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> dont ping mod here
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> general or showroom if you want to add an image to it
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Soreu is this u lol
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/704333041564123287/Screen_Shot_2020-04-27_at_9.07.09_AM.png
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only #general, not #showroom
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @onby umm, yep. Out of boredom checking all old DDNet clients for when that started appearing & when it changed. but older versions get banned from DDNet & KoG servers so tried on ur xD
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not 'older versions' but 708 specifically
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and a few other old ones
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm going thru every single one of old DDNet
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :P
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol he wanted to bot
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :kek:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> If i'd want to bot, I would use better clients than DDNet 7.8.2
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> hmm, that got me wonder for how long I might got banned on KoG now :think_bot:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dont they autokick
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> didn't look that closely on the info
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> either way, guess I have to start checking on local server now xd
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> bot on lan server :think_bot:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> shouldnt u try to test them by bisecting
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> find the halfway point between version 1 and newest and test that
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then if it works try finding the halfway point between that and newest and repeat
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yeeaaa, but I'm seriously bored
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do something useful
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> doing. Trying to find when that bug started appearing
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if ur gonna get banned, at least get banned while ur actually botting :zzzz:
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do it properly
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> shh
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok. shit won't work that way
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> on local server I don't have that 3rd row
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wtf even
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try on vanilla server
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but why I have it on KoG, DDNet, but not local srv from latest version?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just wtf
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> local server is ddnet too?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> y
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Soreu it's configurable
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @heinrich5991 huh?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, maybe I skimmed too much
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the autoban is a configuration option
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ah, that part
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> anyway, I still don't get how comes I have it on official servers, but not on local one
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try on ctf
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> in latest client I have weapon bullets here (CTF3)
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> in old af client too
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and they do show poperly
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for every weapon?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> pistol, sg, laser, rocket
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> since that bug appears in freeze, i guess it's related to ninja
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and can't test this one here
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on some dm1 servers there is ninja at the top
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> umm
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I think it actually might be bug related to KoG servers
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...because I just noticed (ye, i'm smart today) that I actually don't have it on DDNet servers
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> only on KoG's
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ah xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> weird
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> second thing I noticed is that I should have made backup of client settings before lanching older ones
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does that mess up the cfg
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> binds for sure
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think only everything but binds
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but some binds also changed, especially the `kp_` ones
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wrote to Qshar, maybe he has idea what they messed in the code about displaying ammo xd
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wrote to Qshar, maybe he has idea what they messed in the server code about displaying ammo xd
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> general only. not a proper channel but showroom if you want to add an image to it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen ^^ :/
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, @deen how familiar are you with nginx? am I not passing the header correctly?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's wrong with it?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao how do you generate the backups of the testing channels?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen it won't pass the real host in X-Forwarded-Host
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```nginx
