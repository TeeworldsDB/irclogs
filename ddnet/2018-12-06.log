00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo guis does some1 where all the sound constants are defined?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> things like SOUND_PLAYER_PAIN_LONG
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> grep is broken on windows o i cant search :c
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh maybe grep isnt broken on win its just not part of the src. Guess it is generated somehow -.-
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://puu.sh/Cd47G/72bc517fce.png
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have basically no changes
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> current master branch selfcomplied copied into the latest tw client directory
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it crashes on connecting
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> good luck i never successfully built anything on windows, IDEs are so confusing to configure, way easier to build things with mingw ^^
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use mingw :c
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why the error message lost me at visual studio
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i thought i build with mingw xd probably cmake found my visual studio and grabbed it
00:43 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: you should specify -G"MinGW Makefiles" to cmake to make sure
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well but what ever it takes it normally worked
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is there something that changed in the newversion
00:45 <+Learath2> No, windows is just an unpredictable platform
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i get the same vs error
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is the full cmd
00:47 <+Learath2> cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
00:47 <+Learath2> but that doesn't seem to be the problem
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
00:47 <+Learath2> that's not a compile time error
00:47 <+Learath2> that's a runtime error
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but cool anyways
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
00:48 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: debug it pls?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how
00:48 <+Learath2> using gdb ofc
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on windows -.-
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gdb sux on windows
00:48 <+Learath2> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G"MinGW Makefiles"
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well ima try
00:48 <+Learath2> gdb is the only usable debugger on windows
00:49 <+Learath2> what are you even talking about?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hue?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what what
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well maybe
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still i encounterd some really weird behavious with gdb on win
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not that i mastered it on any other os but still xd
00:49 <+Learath2> the only platform gdb doesn't work well on is macOS and that's because apple are dickheads
00:50 <+Learath2> "platform"
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i prefer gdb on macos over gdb on windows
00:51 <+Learath2> gdb on macos doesn't even work properly, the mach kernel just doesn't provide enough access, you need to codesign gdb then do some kernel settings blackmagic and only then are you allowed to use an older version of gdb because the newest version doesn't work
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well ur probably right xd just how it feelt for me
00:53 <+Learath2> anyways in this case the shortcomings of gdb on windows shouldn't really get in your way
00:53 <+Learath2> you just need a simple backtrace
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> building takes ages .-.
00:53 <+Learath2> also it probably is because of deen's changes
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could swear bam was lot faster
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the newest commit typo fix?
00:54 <+Learath2> he has the first use of <algorithm> in the codebase
00:54 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: you can try ninja instead of MinGW Makefiles, but I'm not completely sure if you can use ninja in mingw
00:54 <+Learath2> might be harder to set up
00:55 <+Learath2> also try make -j5 instead to use more cores
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hue
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont find the compiled client xd
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i found one
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> funny it is a different location now
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> HAHAHAHAHA
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> MinGW doesnt crash
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fok vs
00:56 <+Learath2> that's not possible
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i took the binary from /build and not from build/Debug
00:56 <+Learath2> you always use the runtime libraries from vs, it's probably just the debug build that doesn't crash
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because build/Debug had no client this time
00:57 <+Learath2> build/Debug? how were you even compiling this?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe it is the rls that doenst crash
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the debug that just didnt appear
00:57 <+Learath2> build/Debug really sounds like you were compiling with vs
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y thats what i was used to
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but now i compiled with mingw so there were no exe in build/Debg
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i found one in build/
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe it is a old vs one idk
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but this one worked
00:58 <+Learath2> the binary should end up in build/ yes
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the mingw debug?
00:58 <+Learath2> Either way it's weird that it crashes at all when compiled with vs
00:58 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: yeah all builds should be ending up in build/
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y /build/DDNet.exe is defnetly MinGW debug build
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tested it
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and that one doesnt crash hehe
00:59 <+Learath2> try a release build with mingw aswell
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just leave the debug flag out?
01:00 <+Learath2> yeah just cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or type=Releaase?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> works aswell
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe my vs is old
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and some ddnet update killed it
01:02 <+Learath2> I'd guess deens player sorting commit killed it if anything
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how di i reset ma git to a specifiy commti agian?
01:05 <+Learath2> git checkout commitsha
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ima rebuilding prior to deens sorting commit to ztest it
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Seems like i am still using mingw how do i switch back to vs?
01:07 <+Learath2> my modern c++-fu is pretty weak but from what I read I think it's about violating strict weak ordering
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah didnt deleted the cache
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is c++-fu ? xd
01:08 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: no idea, I haven't used vs to compile something in 5 years now
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy deleating the cahe did the job
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then it used vs agian
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y this one works
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so any commit after a1db76cdeff4232dd0865dfcbf7250aef66a7a38
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen pls fix
01:14 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: were you joining a ddnet server or a vanilla server with it when it crashed?
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> kog
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> based on ddnet 9x as far as i know
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 9.3.1
01:16 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: can you check line 2642 in algorithm?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do i find alogrithm
01:16 <+Learath2> it gives you the path to the file in the crash
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/Cd6gR/df7a4e1310.png
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks like wrong indentation for me
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
01:19 <+Learath2> gotta love the cryptic code in these files :P
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quick> @deen  bacheha batel an
01:20 <+Learath2> I wonder wtf DEBUG_LT_PRED even expands to
01:22 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: can you find out what that is defined as?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its the first time that i even opened some of these libs i think
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have no idea where to search
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> strange VS thing, never had any issue on windows when cross compiling master
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> bam server_release
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> [1/1] #1 link DDNet-Server.exe
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> link: extra operand ‘pthread.lib’
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Try 'link --help' for more information.
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> bam: 'DDNet-Server.exe' error 256
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> bam: error: a build step failed
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> what is this?
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bam?
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt bam depreciated
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we upgraded to cmake
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well "upgraded" hehe
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quick> :DD
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> old src
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm idk
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what src
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> old src ( 10.6.2 )
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gosh google spams me with advertisements on youtube wtf
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like google the search engine
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are dominant af why would they need ads
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> end of the year
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> left over money to spend
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm mby
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but im sure they coudl still spend it more wisly
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> spend it on ddoisng duckduckgo xd
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I would maybe switch to google if gugl takes ddg down with ddos but not if i see stupid ads
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what did they advertise
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Searching stuff is fun
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some fortnite shit idk
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oops
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> google is affiliated to fortnite?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i made this guy rq
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who is sirius even
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some chinese guy
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk baut fortnite and what google does
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it was this fortinite dance and a grandma
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and some searching food or what ever stuff
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 2 different gogole ads i had in the last hour
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> > they are dominant af why would they need ads
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> this logic is flawed btw
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo ads are usefull if people have to know your product
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobody knows that there are diffferent search engines
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because you don't just stop when you're doing good
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> always pushing further
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ads != doing good
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no bing user will switch to google on that ad xd
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Adds already pushed too hard today most people use addblocker because of that ^^
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who needs adblocker
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have ddnet discord
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Rhytm best adblocker
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> don't think their target are different users
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk why i even use ma browser currently
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lemme fix
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they also profit from their users using it more
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah true i remeber
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because its broken
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao fix it
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or i have to watch ads
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what browser
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #voice-text
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/Cd6Xa/f50b074640.jpg
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there it is agian
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and omg yt forced fokin darkmode header
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> looks funny
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> see they want you to search something specific
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> google will kill us all lol
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they gave some ai access to their servers
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> what was that website
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> google will eat himself
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> something like that
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk it
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> http://www.gwei.org/index.php
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> conspiracy
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon do u wanna fix a cheat
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> depends
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on?
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk tell me
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what cheat
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u should fix rythm
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only in private

01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon that error you see is probably my fault with the new sorting I added :/
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please take a look @ChillerDragon ^
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @deen  its fine!
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991  do you have a functional teehistorian file or me :O? mine seem either corrupted or I don't know x)
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 heinrich is busy :c
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> anyone got one off ddnet's teehistorian files for me? just trying to play around with it in python 😄
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> of*
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ddrace's*
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon  why is he busy :O?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> x)?
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk buys dude
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wait for his return since days xd and i notice people miss him all over the place xd
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> of, that kind of busy.
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> thought like one a few hours not online busy 😮
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> thought like a few hours not online busy 😮
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe @deen  or someone else has got a proper teehistorian file :O?
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Can't you create one your self?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jxsl13 i have a few hundred GB for you 😄
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what file size of teehistorian file do you want?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh meh @deen u didnt do it on master :c
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can you tell me the cmd agian to checjout your por
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, only want to push if that's the fix
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now it's on master, easier for me 😄
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oder so
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jxsl13 there you go, 3 random ones from GER with different file sizes: https://ddnet.tw/teehistorian/
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> data leaks o.O
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's less than you can gather by spectating on a random server
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't even contain chats
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy ikr
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw your pr works c:
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no crash when joining kog servers
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty for the fast fix @deen ❤
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry about that, I didn't think about what requirements the comparator of std::sort has :/
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and gcc didn't assert them
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobody could expect that
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, it does make sense
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if a < b, then b > a etc
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If anyone else wants to play around with teehistorian, @heinrich5991 has a nice Rust library here: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/teehistorian/src
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen what is the differnce between DDNET.ico and DDNet.icns in other/icons ?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am trying to get a custom icon for my own client
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> open them ico is for windows, icns for mac
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i opend ico on windows and tried to edit it with paint
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no good result
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't use paint, use gimp
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> an ico has different layers for different sizes
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm dont have it on my windows i think i try some webconverter
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there might also be a way to create it with imagemagick or other tools
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it doesnt update
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do i have to change something else
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> delete some cache?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> remove the build directory and try again?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y thats what i am doing rn
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lets see
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yay it worked c:
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/CdmvP/78c23f445f.jpg
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> love it
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ty deen
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I wanna read the format using Python and learn some data analysis vor whatever :D
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> vor*
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> four
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> btw, thanks, @deen
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> and wtf, 405 mb xD is that one year worth of data?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You're welcome
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> New teehistorian file gets created when map is changed
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Servers get rebooted after 24 hours once they are empty
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 24 hours Oo?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That might just have been a popular map on a pretty full server for a day or so
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> man, that's damn large
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we pack them after 1 week to save some space
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> how much space does compressing them save? to what size can you shrink that one file :D?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> give me a few minutes to run xz -9
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, but we only run xz -0f
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> too heavy on the server?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and doesn't save much more psace
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm k 😢
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> found another 431 MB file, compressed with xz -0f it's 158 MB
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 took special care to make the format well compressible I think
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm, that's pretty good
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[02:15:35] <Learath2> teehistorian@main:~/data/ger$ gzip -l 4193a96e-b0e8-4d1d-a8fb-edcf292e6245.teehistorian.gz
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [02:15:37] <Learath2>          compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [02:15:39] <Learath2>           161259316           481104542  66.5% 4193a96e-b0e8-4d1d-a8fb-edcf292e6245.teehistorian``` this was one test I ran couple months ago
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bz2 and xz get better results but also they are slower
14:36 <@deen> xz -0 is faster and smalle than gz
14:37 <@deen> and if you want really fast then use zstd I guess
14:37 <@deen> really small I mean
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really should be compressing my teehistorian archive :/
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have like 781GB now
14:38 <@deen> There is no good reason to use bz anymore, except for stone-age systems. xz is about 10 times faster to decompress and also compresses at similar speed but better compression
14:39 <@deen> Don't compress the files newer than 1 week though
14:39 <@deen> or they'll get recompressed
14:39 <@deen> find data -name "*.teehistorian" -mtime +8 -exec ./archive.sh {} \;
14:39 <@deen> retransmitted*
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> the internal UUID should correspond to th e file name, I suppose?
14:45 <@deen> no
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> in the teehistorian file
14:45 <@deen> yes
14:45 <@deen> we use that to store the UUID of a rank in the database
14:46 <@deen> and then we can look up the teehistorian file
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> now again, UUID , first 16 byte should correspond to file name?
14:46 <@deen> Learath2: are you syncing ger2 btw?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen yes if you have my teehistorian ssh key in ger2
14:48 <@deen> I guess
14:49 <@deen> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/zstd/dev/doc/images/DCspeed5.png
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jxsl13 ?
14:50 <@deen> lzma is xz, zlib is close to gz
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> the yes, no part kinda confused me, so the first 16 bytes are the uuid and are identical to the filename?
14:51 <@deen> reminds me of the opus graph btw: http://opus-codec.org/comparison/
14:52 <+Learath2> my stupid bank keeps locking my card for "fraudulent" transactions, it's just me trying to withdraw cash from an ATM...
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jxsl13 afaik the filename is the entire uuid, and the uuid is 16bytes, so I think the answer is yes 😛
14:53 <@deen> 278 GB for me btw with xz -0 on everything > 7 days
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> where the heck do you store the files of th epast years?
14:54 <@deen> Learath2: you might need to clean out your .ssh/known_hosts for ger2 though
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should all be archiving the same way so we can rsync all our backups together
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jxsl13 I have 781GB of them on my server 😄
14:54 <@deen> is xz -0 deterministic though?
14:54 <@deen> might depend on version etc
14:54 <@deen> I store them half on DDNet.tw and half on GER :D
14:54 <@deen> but no "past years", teehistorian is not taht old
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen yeah noticed known_hosts it should be syncing up now
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> any kinda magic number?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> magic number of what? 😛
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I get the same value for all of these teehistorian files within the first 16 bytes xD wtf
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm the first 16bytes might not be the uuid then
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gimme a sec
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's a json header
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> heinrich said yes 😮
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> https://openproject.johnbehm.de/projects/zcatch/work_packages/49/activity?query_props=%7B%22f%22%3A%5B%7B%22n%22%3A%22type%22%2C%22o%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22v%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22t%22%3A%22updated_at%3Adesc%22%7D
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> got a quoted answer x)
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/teehistorian.cpp#L63
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes it is uuid
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk how you are getting the same thing then 😄
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> jupyter notebook in a docker container x).. who knows
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> what might happen there
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> what's the encoding ._.?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first 16 bytes should be just raw bytes of the uuid
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heinrich5991 was adamant that endianness doesn't matter in this case
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> uuid is 32 values? but 16 bytes ._.?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> didn't say anything, 2 values are one byte
15:08 <+Learath2> why does endianness not matter though, I still don't get it :P
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe the uuid generation is symetric in that regard?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OHHH
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remembered now
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first 16bytes is the "magic" uuid
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> xD?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> is it one sam euuids xD?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> uuid?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> // "699db17b-8efb-34ff-b1d8-da6f60c15dd1"
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> yes XD
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> damn it
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 699db17b-8efb-34ff-b1d8-da6f60c15dd1
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> static const char TEEHISTORIAN_NAME[] = "teehistorian@ddnet.tw";
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> static const CUuid TEEHISTORIAN_UUID = CalculateUuid(TEEHISTORIAN_NAME);
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The actual uuid is inside the json header that follows the first 16bytes
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the endianness doesn't matter because you know the magic bytes 😃
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> so there is a magic numbe,r eh 😄
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A magic UUID to be exact 😄
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> next problem is, that after the zero-terminated header should be an integer, supposedly 4? bytes that define the message id and how to parse it
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm, those numbers should be negative that indicate messages, all I get is crap :c
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well did you read in the header?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> yes
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/520241709385383957/Bildschirmfoto_2018-12-06_um_15.14.26.png
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> oh boi, this is exactly the wrong version x)
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well just output 4 raw bytes from the file to see what's going on I guess
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/520243722684989442/Bildschirmfoto_2018-12-06_um_15.22.31.png
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> again, I'd just output 4 raw bytes to check it out
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> b'A\x1bF\x01'
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 65
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 27
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 70
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 1
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, that does look wrong :/
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how CPacker packs ints
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jxsl13 yeah as I thought, it's not that simple 😛
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> great xD
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First bit is the extend bit, the second bit is the sign
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the rest is data
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is for each byte
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm, k
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually only the first one has the sign bit
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> wait
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 4 bytes
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> only the first bit of all of these should be then the sign?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When decoding the integer, you go byte by byte
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first bit of every byte specifies whether another byte is following it
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The second bit of the first byte specifies the sign
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> dear jesus .. and thanks for the explanation
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the last byte is also padded if needed :/
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So basically just take 6 bits from the first byte 7 bits from all the others following it, if the first bit isn't set at any byte you break, at the end apply the sign according to the first bytes second bit
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm going out to the bank, need to tear the branch manager a new one
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i had a little idea today. when you kill yourself ingame i think it would be fun if a little animation plays where the tee makes the > < eyes, then shoots himself. any keypress interrupts the animation and the suicide so it would aslo work as a little kill protection
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds like an intrusive feature
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i forgot to mention it should be optional
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> that sounds like the kind of feature that u would use once or twice and never again
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> like telegun?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> rekt
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
