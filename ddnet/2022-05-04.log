17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can I change the server port via command line argument?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "sv_port 8304"
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `"sv_port 8304"`
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh good to know, works, thanks
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do we have a feature specification for this funny bug or may i fix it ðŸ˜„ the cause is a double logical error. Turrets only explode for one player at a time currently. I would like to change it so that the explosion affects all players. The clientID sets the priority ðŸ˜„ therefore it comes to the change between the two tees.

18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is a known "feature"
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think even if you fix it only for newer maps this would not be worth it
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @c0d3d3v https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2014
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD just make that part solo wtf is that feature xD its the same btw. for explosiv shotgun bullets
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I add it to my PR fix, then you can vote again ðŸ˜„
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> :/
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/971452797084131338/bullet_explosiv-2022-05-04_18.44.49.mp4
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> not very satisfying
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its known
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and used in maps i think
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what would you use that for xD that just slows down the process.... of moving tees
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> a feature that was created by a logic error ... oh man ey this gives me a headache. Well then I'll just leave it that way ðŸ˜¦ very dissatisfying.
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fixing these things requires thinking about backward compatibility
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one could try to fix it for new maps
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean ddnet is basically this
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hooking through corners was never intended as a feature
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unclear
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i saw a issue in teeworlds to fix it
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the grass_main graphics look like it should be possible
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's the current maintainers of teeworlds
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> there's also a bug in a pair of tees where one tee's hook strength is different than the other tee's :trollet:
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do maps contain release dates xD?
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the db
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh :/
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ddnet maps
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you find some way to do backward compatibility with that, we could probably also include it in the map files
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but also remember that differing behavior between maps is bad for players
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so all that has to be balanced
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (just like weird behavior is bad for players)
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I could just make a new turret that explode for all xD
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that still has this issue
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like we did with hookthrough
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and mark the other as deprecated
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/971455316006928444/unknown.png
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> sounds like c++ evolution to me
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think the fewest have even noticed the bug
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should release ddnet 2.0
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with all fixes
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and breaking all the protocol
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just leave it as it is for now and write just a comment in the code so you know that it is wanted.
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> ddrust when
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we would lose 90% of the devs
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> We just needed a better animation. The explosion suggests that everyone should be affected. If turrets would explode differently, e.g. only a explotion at the affected player, that would be a step forward.
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would probably be fine to do
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would u animate that
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that would make the bug a feature, but honestly, that's not satisfying either. because depending on the Cliend ID, someone can explode who is actually not in the line of fire, because someone is actually in front.
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://jackh726.github.io/rust/2022/05/04/a-shiny-future-with-gats.html
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a long awaited feature
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (for rust)
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <APFFF> Is the server-lag really all because of DDos attacks?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Servers are currently under attack, yes
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Left current broken but loved turrets, I do not understand why
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Right my new turret, with only the bug added I mentioned above
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://streamable.com/8us8lk
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if someone is bored <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5063> still needs testers
21:19 <+xq> Anyone know of a sane way I could parse the tournaments page at: https://ddnet.tw/tournaments ?
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www/tournaments
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> about merge 5060: Shields for specific weapons arent shown in switch layer. You can use them by bracing the tile it would take but they should also shown up in editor xd
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> but it works fine
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Hello, you probably already know about this  but whatever ðŸ˜›
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Maybe it will interest you and it will be usefull info for you, if not then just ingnore it.
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Konsti shows up in players list however he is not present on server (nor tab or pause menu shows him):
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> ps. had something similar when I joined a test server with 1mb map after 300 kb i disconneted and refreshed the server list there was (connecting). I went on some server and waited there to check again, refreshed the server list and still on that test server was (connecting). So I went back I've downloaded the map and (connecting) changed to my nickname. Server kind of keeps connecting info for too long in my opinion.

22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Probably connected to ddos
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try again now @Tsin
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I rqed 30 minutes ago
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I accidentally bricked the mastersrv a few minutes ago
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> heinreich ddoser confirmed
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> hehehe =]
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Omg people from F3ar clan still alive ðŸ¤©
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> yeah now the player list is accurate ^^
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for the report though
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've been sweating for a couple of minutes, wondering if anyone will notice ðŸ˜„
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :justatest: <-- rare pic of heinrich sweating
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> btw, however now there is diffrent bug =]
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> I only see 4 ddnet (ddrace EU) servers in ddnet tab. So master server is not giving full info or maybe there is some attack on it.
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah, looks like only 5 people are on usa which seems a bit weird to me
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> the bot does say its getting ddosed tho (but i feel nothing from it)
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> "from 16000 to 69" YOOOOOOO
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> good change when rls
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> It looks like usa1.ddnet.tw is kind of overloaded on CPU + RAM. Would it be possible to reboot it? Or is there a vanilla usa2 server?
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i always noticed that server struggled a bit
