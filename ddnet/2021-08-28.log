00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its bcs of how the print commands are flushed
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> can this be turned off by server?
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> or is it ddrace only
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is clientside iirc
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't send extended data
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i need the flags thi
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i need the flags tho
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> but i guess as long as it tells you everyone has strong then it is probably fine.
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you should send everyone that player has 0 id when another players have 1
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then there will be no bugs with prediction
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ye already did
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> that's why i'm asking if that can be turned off cuz it is useless for mods with no weak lol
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, exactly
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> ðŸ¥º
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> trying to compile any nodejs shit on centos6 is a fucking nightmare
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why do they always end up downloading some binary that requires glibc 2.17 ?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> is there an EASY way to return vanilla weapons to ddnet
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> without rewriting CEntity
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's mostly CCharacter that needs rewriting
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why are u using centos6 is the real question xd
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> work place on production machine
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rip
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with no admin right
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually, a lot of company using EDA tools still use red hat 6 based machine
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> okay... do u know any sixup vanilla servers?
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> sources
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, I tried my best but that patch is extremely hard to add to your own code
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> very few people bothered with it
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman:
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i saw chillerdragon's gctf 0.6/0.7 server
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> he might succeeded in it
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fokkonaut ported it for fddrace, chiller was making one indeed, timakro had it for unique and kog made it for old ddrace, that's all the implementations of sixup I know
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> why haven't you replaced the ninja skin during freeze yet?))))))))))))))))))))))) maybe redraw in next big update
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we get a good option we can definitely do that
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> use current player skin + frozen layer in front ðŸ¤”
