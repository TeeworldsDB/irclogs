10:50 <@deen> I found another way to use the bandwidth we already have
10:50 <@deen> Make a GIF clock and post it on https://news.ycombinator.com/news
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> haha, top1 gratulations ðŸ˜ƒ
11:42 <@deen> thanks
11:43 <@deen> had to figure out how to make haskell deal with thousands of open connections
11:43 <@deen> And sometimes the connection gets broken, don't know yet why
11:44 <@deen> Maybe I need to use some keep-alive http header or nginx proxy_pass is screwing me
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> hmm, I got no idea either and I also got no idea about functional Programming, the only thing i see is Haskell popping up from time to time as right now for example ^^
11:48 <@deen> this would have been 10 times easier to write in an imperative language
11:48 <@deen> but i had the framework in haskell already, oh well
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> what's the benefit of the functional way then ?
11:49 <@deen> no benefit here
11:49 <@deen> for some applications it can be good
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> can you give me an example problem that is nicely solved by functional programming ?
11:55 <@deen> https://hookrace.net/teaching/2014w/uebung_pp/ 3.hs is not so bad for example
11:57 <@deen> generally problems where you don't have to interact with the outside world
12:01 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> I see, so the math stuff in there can be nicely handled
14:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Does DDNet saves stats (from statboard) to some file, to check overall from all matches statistics?
14:08 <+ddnet-discord> <EryX> no
14:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
14:08 <+ddnet-discord> <EryX> Sorry ðŸ˜¦
14:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sad ðŸ˜¦
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> actually you can even save csvs: cl_auto_csv 1
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, but
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no statistics inside client?
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> nope, I guess you need your own scripts then
16:35 <@Nimda> CrashTV by Cellegen just released on Solo at 2017-08-12 16:30
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> any lib from ddnet has support to sqlite?
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> only mysql/mariadb on serverside
20:58 <+Chained> is ddnet-discord a gateway to the discord channel of ddnet ? 
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to the developer's one
20:59 <+Chained> thats a pretty nice idea :D
21:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
