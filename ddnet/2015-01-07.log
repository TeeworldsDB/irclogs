19:25 <@EastByte> deen: just wanted to ask whether there is a standard ringbuffer type in nim
19:25 <@EastByte> I'll ask #nim next time, promised :)
19:25 <@deen> don't think so, make one
19:26 <@deen> i've only seen circular lists :P
19:26 <@EastByte> hmmmm
19:26 <@deen> you want one that's fixed size?
19:26 <@deen> just use an array and access it using `mod`?
19:26 <@EastByte> mod?
19:27 <@EastByte> you mean I should loop through and swap?
19:27 <@EastByte> *shift
19:28 <@deen> shift?
19:28 <@deen> I don't know,implement it and you'll see how it works best :P
19:29 <@EastByte> I'll see, thanks^^

21:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #124: [WIP]Autoupdate revamped (DDRace64...dd_autoupdate) http://git.io/zNzUgQ
21:36 <@deen> Yay!
21:38 < Learath2> deen: found something missing the server update thing
21:38 < Learath2> no idea why we are updating the server executable from the client tho :/
21:39 <@deen> because people want to have the most recent server?
21:39 <@deen> to test their maps with all new features
21:39 < Learath2> what if they dont launch the client on their servers 
21:39 <@deen> I mean locally
21:39 <@deen> on their server they should update manually
21:39 <@deen> but most don't have a server
21:53 < Learath2> deen: instead of a bool for serverupdate i think we should just add it like a normal file
21:54 < Learath2> its not a special case like replacing a running executable
