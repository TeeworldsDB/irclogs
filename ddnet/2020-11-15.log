00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> > @Ryozuki don't  care enough to fix. will always keep conflicting with new code changes in updates
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> this is what I call working smart, not hard ðŸ˜‰
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why does ddnet lan server have kog voting system

06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie can i push to ur pr?
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> sure
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> do i need to do anything
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> doesnt look like itðŸ˜‹
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis not sure what that means
10:20 <+ChillerDragon> kog needs less yes votes to pass than ddnet
10:43 <@deen> sv_vote_majority I guess

11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imagine we'd have unlimited time, would be cool to write your own programming language ðŸ˜„
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Would it be possible to insert a command to prevent activation with ninjajetpack?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Would it be possible to insert a command to prevent ninjajetpack from being activated?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> I know it has been mentioned before, I think we should add the command to give you more freedom in telegun and jetpack
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Or another question: Why do you need ninjajetpack in the game at all? What if you just delete the ninjajetpack option?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> for fun
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> It only opens new cheats or blocks new parts
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> I see no reason to keep this shit xD
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, disable telegun while having jetpack
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> That's the point of the part
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would also make ninjajetpack and jetpack behave the same
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> This would not solve the problem
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought they do behave the same
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> take a look at this part and see what changes with ninjajetpack ðŸ˜„
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/777544616039678022/86767.png
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> without ninjajetpack = brutal part, with ninjajetpack = novice part
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :justatest:
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ninja jetpack op
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what changes? :x
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought it was just a visual change
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no without nijajetpack u shoot bullets out
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and this part if u shoot bullets at the wrong place it will tp u to the tele tiles and u have to restart
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i dont think its much of a big deal
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is there a telegun at that part @louis
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that a bug?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> should jetpack bullets not count as tele
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no they should
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theyre still bullets
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ninjajetpack was made to prevent annoying gun sounds
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> don't remove it
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can just turn off gun sounds @Chairn
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they also have some visual clutter
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> two ways to solve that IMO, 1) don't teleport on jetpack bullets (would make that part impossible), 2) don't allow ninjajetpack when you also have telegun
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or maybe just make ninjajetpack+telegun shoot bullets
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2) would make it impossible to have dedicated graphics for jetpack in the future
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> if telegun is not enabled then it would work as normal
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> could they add a separate tile for jetpack thats also telegun
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> or just a new server command  :troll:
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please no
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The sane answer to the problem is that jetpack bullets shouldn't teleport people
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, see 1)
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but seeing as the part is already there 2) could be acceptable
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's just confusing imho
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the part isn't on a released map yet AFAIK
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is telegun the only place where ninjajetpack and jetpack function differently
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK, yes
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> > take a look at this part and see what changes with ninjajetpack ðŸ˜„
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @CÃ¸ke why u leak my partidea
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what are these entities
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/777559639835279380/Screen_Shot_2020-11-15_at_9.44.15_AM.png
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> jetpack on off
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> telegun
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> @Im 'corneum look at #ðŸ’ªtaceht
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > u can just turn off gun sounds @Chairn
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @noby i want to keep gun sounds for the rest of the game, just not jetpack where i get spammed by my own gun
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> or u can turn off whole game sounds like me
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ðŸ˜„
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, it gives information on gameplay, like hook succeeding or not, taking weapon and other stuffs
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> suggestion: add so you can see maps in entities on homepage? ðŸ™‚
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> and maybe add a search for map creator
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does anyone know if the CCC will be free to watch
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since its online this year
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gues it will be streamed here https://www.youtube.com/c/mediacccde
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki not sure if it'll be streamed on youtube
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it'll definitely be streamed on their own site
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i caant connect my dummy on maps
