02:55 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: could *you* try out the script? :)
09:08 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: sure, but where does the known_maps input come from?
11:52 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: from my map archive. I'm developing that script that allows people to only send me maps that I don't already have
11:54 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: oh yeah, and am I allowed to add those maps to the archive?
11:54 <@heinrich5991> (forgot to ask that)
12:06 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: sure, but most maps will already be in your archive (I previously didn't play a lot)
12:15 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: the script explicitly tried to filter out maps I already have
12:15 <@heinrich5991> the known_maps input is in the same file btw, if you didn't see it
12:16 <@EastByte> ah, well that answers my question
12:16 <@EastByte> long lines are hardly noticable in vim without scrolling
12:19 < Killur> Hello
12:19 < Killur> Someone here who can answer a question about the DDrace mod?
12:20 <@EastByte> maybe
12:20 <@heinrich5991> ask you question :)
12:21 < Killur> I see "DDRace"-mods and "DDrace" (note the big / small R)
12:21 < Killur> it seems that DDrace is from DDrace-Network. Where is the difference to the other mid?
12:21 < Killur> mod
12:23 <@EastByte> huh, was the r always small in 'DDrace-Network' ?
12:24 < Killur> I dont know. But the 2 mods are also shown in a different color when I search for "ddrace"
12:24 <@EastByte> oh yea it was, I never noticed that
12:24 < Killur> DDrace is blue and DDRace is purple
12:24 <@EastByte> well, there are multiple ddrace modifications based on the old DDRace
12:24 <@EastByte> ddnet (DDrace-Network) is only one of them
12:25 <@EastByte> not sure what the differenced are, but most are simply outdated
12:25 < Killur> hm ok. Because I am looking for a way to activate cheats without the mod being called "TestDDrace"
12:25 <@EastByte> well, I guess we don't support that
12:26 <@EastByte> normal DDRace should never run cheats
12:26 <@EastByte> or do you want to use a completely different name?
12:26 < Killur> No I just want to activate it for admins.
12:26 < Killur> But when I turn it on it shows "TestDDRace"
12:27 <@EastByte> yes, it's supposed to be like that
12:27 < Killur> And I can't change it?
12:27 <@EastByte> it of course is possible, but we or atleast I will not support that
12:28 < Killur> Ok thanks
13:05 <@heinrich5991> Killur: why do you want to activate it for the admins?
13:06 <@heinrich5991> it'll just create a bad experience for the players
13:06 < Killur> Since im the only admin I will use it in rare cases. 
13:06 < Killur> But I have found a way now
13:16 <@heinrich5991> great :(
13:33 <@deen> EastByte: People renamed DDraceNetwork back to DDRace, for example on 4-Union server
13:34 <@deen> And enabling cheats might not be as easy as renaming "TestDDrace" to "DDrace" ;)
13:34 <@EastByte> or right I see, ddnet client doesn't work well on 4-union
13:35 <@EastByte> deen: so there is some kind of protection?
13:35 <@deen> EastByte: yes, after someone cheated no one can finish
13:35 <@deen> to prevent admins from doing exactly that
13:35 <@EastByte> ah
14:21 < Hamid_Jigool> hi dear denn
14:21 < Hamid_Jigool> hi dear deen
14:21 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
14:23 < Hamid_Jigool> i wanna buy an ubuntu server on internet mod with ram 2... can you install real DDnet on my host for Persian? and i should say that my ip internet but when have DDos its going to intranet
14:24 < Hamid_Jigool> so may our server connection with your database have problem when have DDos.. but when DDos is end server back to internet mod
14:24 < Hamid_Jigool> is it good or not?
14:35 <@deen> that does not work with the way ddnet currently works
14:35 <@deen> the servers are required to have a non-stop internet connection
14:35 <@deen> if you want to work around this, talk to EastByte. I'm not really interested in these intranet hacks
16:03 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again evrybody... how can i create an maps vote list like DDnet? (i mean with stars and recorde and ...etc like DDnet)
16:18 < laxadedi> DDNet is a relatively complex architecture with lots of scripting running etc
16:19 < laxadedi> you can get all informations on how it's running by checkout out the repositery that are on github
16:19 < laxadedi> *by checking out
16:19 < laxadedi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts
16:19 < laxadedi> this one should have everything needed
18:47 < Chained> how many minutes does the timeout protection last ?
19:12 < laxa> Chained: the timeout codes stays saved 10 minutes on server iirc
19:14 < Chained> thx
20:45 < Chained> can I tune this in the server settings ?
21:42 < laxa> look on ddnet, it's suppose to have all settings from ddnet on one webpage
21:42 < laxa> otherwise you might ask deen
21:42 < laxa> or it's hardcoded in the code and could be changed if you recompile the server
21:57 < Chained> well, maybe it would be an improvement, if it's not already tunable
21:58 < Chained> on the brutal servers e.g. it would be nice to have a bigger timespan compared to servers, which host mostly short maps
23:29 < laxa> I don't see the correlation between hard and easy maps for this...
23:29 < laxa> 10 minutes should be enough
23:29 < laxa> you already have the time to /save when your mate disconnect
