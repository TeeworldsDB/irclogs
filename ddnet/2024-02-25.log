00:44 < bridge> <teero777> how does it feel like to be in the past?
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not in the past
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the sun is above me but it is obstructed for you
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> light for me
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> dark for you
00:47 < bridge> <teero777> sounds like a skill issue
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> you didn‚Äôt train hard enough

01:00 < bridge> <arrowastaken> Hey! Is there any way to fix the screen tearing that occurs due to the FPS update not matching my monitor's refresh rate? VSync is terrible; it has a lot of lag. In other games, I don't activate VSync; I just cap the FPS, and it works perfectly, but it's not the same here :/
01:09 < bridge> <Ewan> No, that‚Äôs why VSync exists
01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> It fundamentally has to have lag because it‚Äôs waiting for the frame being rendered to finish
01:11 < bridge> <Ewan> You can try and change your game refresh rate to one that ‚Äúaligns better‚Äù with your screen but it‚Äôs never gonna be perfect
01:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> you can try tinkering around with cl_refresh_rate and gfx_refresh_rate - i have a 240hz monitor running on 15K FPS and i had to play around a lot to find fitting settings ^^
01:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> you can try tinkering around with `cl_refresh_rate `and `gfx_refresh_rate `- i have a 240hz monitor running on 15K FPS and i had to play around a lot to find fitting settings ^^
02:53 < bridge> <arrowastaken> omg
02:54 < bridge> <arrowastaken> idk how but this fixed it cl_refresh_rate
02:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> :owo:
02:54 < bridge> <arrowastaken> ah no
02:54 < bridge> <arrowastaken> it didnt üò¶
02:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> :OHNOOOO:
02:55 < bridge> <arrowastaken> i mean
02:55 < bridge> <arrowastaken> what can i do with this xd "cl_refresh_rate"?
02:56 < bridge> <arrowastaken> put it in F1 and then put the value of my monitor?
02:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> cl_refresh_rate is basically a way to tinker your
02:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> cl_refresh_rate just changes your refresh rate, you can also do that manually under the graphics settings
02:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> try changing cl_refresh_rate to the rate of your monitor (same hz)
03:01 < bridge> <triki> i still dont undested it impossible to add delay?
03:01 < bridge> <arrowastaken> y i did, but doesnt work either, i hadnt that problem b4, and suddenly i got screen tearing
03:01 < bridge> <arrowastaken> cl_refresh_rate 144
03:02 < bridge> <triki> just add delay on any packages.
03:02 < bridge> <triki> and i have hier ping then possible
03:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> weird question but did you correctly set your monitor to 144 hz? windows defaults to 60 even when your display supports more
03:03 < bridge> <triki> and i have higer r ping then possible
03:03 < bridge> <triki> and i have higer ping then possible

03:03 < bridge> <arrowastaken> yup
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> so it:
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> Happens with cl_refresh_rate and gfx_refresh_rate set to 0
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> you dont want to use vsync because it feels slow (i get that, feels horrible)
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> right?
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> so it:
03:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> Happens with `cl_refresh_rate` and `gfx_refresh_rate` set to 0
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> you dont want to use vsync because it feels slow (i get that, feels horrible)
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> right?

03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> drivers up to date?
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> what renderer are you using (vulkan, openGL)
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> what window mode are you using? (fullscreen, desktop fullscreen, etc)
03:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> right?

03:07 < bridge> <triki> what diff vul or opel
03:07 < bridge> <triki> what diff vul or open
03:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont wanna get into detail, but lets just say vulkan is newer and usually performs better on new machines, while openGL guarantees functionality on old machines
03:08 < bridge> <triki> videocard or smth else?
03:08 < bridge> <triki> cpu?
03:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> gpu - graphics card
03:08 < bridge> <triki> ty
03:22 < bridge> <arrowastaken> 1. ill set them to 0
03:22 < bridge> <arrowastaken> 2. Yes
03:22 < bridge> <arrowastaken> 3. Vulkan cus is better
03:22 < bridge> <arrowastaken> 4. Fullscreen
03:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> try setting them to 0 aswell as using another window mode (windowed-fullscreen) or (windowed-borderless)
03:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That is good to know. It might come in handy for ddnet\_hotui
03:40 < bridge> <Ewan> not portable
03:42 < bridge> <arrowastaken> it got worse xD, now i have microstutters
03:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
03:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> @mpft you know more stuff than me - any idea?
03:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> (i just pinged because you're still awake - you should go sleep)
03:44 < bridge> <Ewan> about what
03:44 < bridge> <Ewan> nah it's 7:44
03:44 < bridge> <Ewan> just evening
03:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> =!
03:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> where tf do you live
03:44 < bridge> <Ewan> america...
03:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> its 3:44 for me
03:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> oooooooooooooh right
03:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> like 3:44 am for me
03:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
03:45 < bridge> <Ewan> what is the q
03:46 < bridge> <Ewan> unlimited refresh rate isn't really a good idea, you can set it to that if you're curious or if you feel like you really really need the lowest possible latency, but 99.99% of the time it's not worth it
03:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it just chews up your cpu (`cl_refresh_rate`) and gpu (`gfx_refresh_rate`) respectively
03:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i have cl_refresh_rate at 0 to let the game tick as much as it needs to and gfx_refresh_rate at 120 (twice the refresh rate of my monitor)
03:47 < bridge> <Ewan> you will get tearing but hopefully no stutters
03:49 < bridge> <Ewan> btw, using `cl_refresh_rate` to address the vsync issue could work, but you really ought to use `gfx_refresh_rate` instead because the game loop & rendering loop have been decoupled
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> you can get tearing but hopefully no stutters
04:08 < bridge> <arrowastaken> you mean north america

04:36 < bridge> <Ewan> north america of... what was it again
04:36 < bridge> <Ewan> the americas

04:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> (i should stop with the whiskey at 4:45 am
04:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> (i should stop with the whiskey at 4:45 am)
04:46 < bridge> <Welshi> no
04:46 < bridge> <Welshi> alcoholism
04:46 < bridge> <Welshi> ftw
04:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> is
04:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> great
04:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> agreeed
04:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> agreed
04:46 < bridge> <Welshi> it's only a problem when you want it to be B)
04:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> tell my wife that, i just got slapped for still beeing awake lmao
04:47 < bridge> <Welshi> damn
04:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> nothing beats whiskey, teeworlds, and some anime on your second screen
04:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> ngl
04:48 < bridge> <Welshi> agree entirely except for the drink of choice
04:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> you dont like whiskey?!?!?!?!
04:48 < bridge> <Welshi> it's mid tier
04:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> whiskey is nr. 1 for me
04:48 < bridge> <Welshi> what are you, married?
04:48 < bridge> <Welshi> oh wait
04:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> married with a kid
04:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> so yes.
04:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> XD
04:49 < bridge> <Welshi> it be that way
04:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> nah whiskey was my favourite drink for like 6 years now
04:49 < bridge> <Welshi> wait I need help, anyone know how to use vim to move a file into a directory through a vpn
04:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> move a file into a directory "through a vpn"
04:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> do you mean ssh?
04:49 < bridge> <Welshi> ftp
04:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> setup SFTP and then use an interface i guess
04:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk a way to do that over bash
04:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> or any terminal per se
04:51 < bridge> <Welshi> fair enough
04:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> :P
04:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> my whiskey is running out
04:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> help
04:51 < bridge> <Welshi> get vodka
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym through a vpn
04:52 < bridge> <Welshi> champaigne
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> do u just want to move a file through vim
04:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> stores open up in 3 hours - wont stay awake till then i think
04:52 < bridge> <Welshi> need to send the file to a remote server, to which I'm connected using a vpn for the sake of making a website
04:52 < bridge> <Welshi> my wording wasn't great
04:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah use SFTP
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> why do you need a vpn to make the website
04:52 < bridge> <Welshi> school work, need to use the school domain
04:53 < bridge> <Welshi> college be like
04:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> they basically force you to learn everything on your own dont they? XD
04:53 < bridge> <Welshi> YES
04:53 < bridge> <Welshi> this teachers gives us RIDDLES DURING CLASS
04:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> XD
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> sftp -P port user@host.com
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> put (local file path) (remote file path)
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
04:53 < bridge> <Welshi> ily
04:53 < bridge> <Welshi> thank you
04:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> @mpft are you like a local AI
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> im a local I
04:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> I as in Inferior chad
04:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh wait Inferior is the wrong word
04:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i retrieve information except instead of pulling from a disk i pull from my brain
04:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> god damn
04:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> fix my code then.
04:55 < bridge> <Welshi> incredible
04:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://gitlab.com/BlaiZephyr/ddnet-translator
04:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
04:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> fix this for me will ya? ¬∞-¬∞
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i specified port syntax there because it's inconsistent between ssh and sftp commands
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> on ssh it's `-p` and sftp it's `-P`
04:55 < bridge> <Ewan> pretty annoying if you don't know it
04:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> imagine case sensitive syntax
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> what's broken
04:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> fifo files (pipes) on windows are ass
04:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> it wont close the pipe on shutdown
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> how are you naming the object
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> some scopes can't be accessed by other processes
04:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> `    let pipe_name = r"\\.\pipe\my_pipe";`
04:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
04:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats what google told me is the path of a fifo pipe
04:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> since it stays open after shutdown, it screams at me beeing beleaguered(?)
04:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> since it stays open after shutdown, it screams at me beeing overloaded
04:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk how to properly close/delete it
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> try prefixing with `Local\\`
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> can't remember if this works with pipes
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> but it should be consistent since it's just a win32 object
04:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't see a reason why one IPC mechanism would have a different naming scheme from another
05:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i coded this to properly moderate different langs on server's, but coding something FOR windows while not beeing on it is pain
05:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'll try it really quick
05:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats why i am happy that #8013 got merged - i can finally utilize it to test shit
05:01 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8013
05:04 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
05:04 < bridge> <Ewan> pipes probably aren't needed still
05:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> windows doesnt support fifo files (so i've read) - im just used to linux
05:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> `mkfifo my_pipe` is all i need xD
05:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean is there another way to send commands externally to ddnet?
05:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean is there another way to send commands externally to ddnet? apart from fifo?
05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> without modifying ddnet?
05:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> yes please, its not supposed to be included into ddnet, just used as an extension basically
05:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> i want to utilize it to moderate blockworlds, since we have a lot of polish, russian, and french people playing
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i would just make a thing of it though
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> integrate it into the server
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> but you already have this
05:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean i could pretty easily, but i cant modify the current source we are running on
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
05:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> and i think it'll be a hard no when i PR it to ddnet - it just add's unneccessary bloat ig
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> most people would be all for an in-game translation as long as it's done cleanly
05:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> marzzello wrote a pretty decent python script for it, running through a fifo file on linux - its not suitable for macOS or windows tho
05:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> marzzzello wrote a pretty decent python script for it, running through a fifo file on linux - its not suitable for macOS or windows tho
05:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> the script checks if the message is something that needs translating, translates it through deepl (requires an API license) - and outputs it as an echo - actually properly implementing it.. hmm
05:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> maybe a /translate command or smth
05:14 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the error msg on the pipe
05:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
05:15 < bridge> <melo∆û>     std:üßµ:spawn(move || {
05:15 < bridge> <melo∆û>         println!("Starting translation loop..."); // Debugging line
05:15 < bridge> <melo∆û>         if let Err(e) = loop_function(args, log_file_path) {
05:15 < bridge> <melo∆û>             eprintln!("Error in translation loop: {}", e);
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>         }
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>     });
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> outputs Error in translation loop: cant find file
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk error msg is in german xD
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```rust
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>     std:üßµ:spawn(move || {
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>         println!("Starting translation loop..."); // Debugging line
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>         if let Err(e) = loop_function(args, log_file_path) {
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>             eprintln!("Error in translation loop: {}", e);
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>         }
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û>     });
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ```
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> when opening the pipe?
05:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> when trying to access it, it finds the path to the .log file just fine
05:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> (i hardcoded it out of lazyness)
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> so this error is upon trying to open the pipe
05:19 < bridge> <Ewan> ok im going in
05:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> :poggers2:
05:19 < bridge> <Ewan> ok i don't have a deepl api key
05:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> considering your profile message, are you a statue?
05:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> ok its 5:30 for me - i'll go to sleep - gn!
05:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i had to go help my mom
05:56 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how u can tell this
05:56 < bridge> <Ewan> the file does not exist for me and your "Attempting to translate log file..." check seems to only translate the filename
06:25 < bleh> "nate higgers" instant vote kicked me on usa3 multimap
06:26 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
06:26 < bridge> <Ewan> not much anyone can do about that tbh
06:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like there should be a ticket web portal...
08:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I seriously still understand anything after like 2h googling xd

10:44 < bridge> <robyt3> You are not using the pipe interface correctly. The DDNet client/server will create a _pipe server_ while it is running. If you want to send commands to the client/server then you need to create a pipe client. Right now it looks like you are also trying to create a pipe server. See `scripts/send_named_pipe.ps1` how to send a message to a pipe server as a pipe client.
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> Finally someone with good taste here
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> Bootloader issues are the most annoying, thankfully I use refind
10:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> what's refind
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> üôè
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn't really know about the ddnet interface so i assumed he was gonna integrate some pipe func into the server just to send commands
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but something still wasn't clicking lol
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> leg day on Sunday
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
10:48 < bridge> <learath2> A fairly simple bootloader that requires no configuration
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm i see uefi and such?
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it also let u boot into ur motherboard
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat can u come dms real quick?
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> grub adds a entry xd
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aka #off-topic
10:49 < bridge> <learath2> It is a uefi only bootloader indeed. But it's 2024. I doubt you are using bios grub üòÑ
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i don't need to know key
10:49 < bridge> <learath2> Yep
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> I've been using it for 3-4 years now with no issue. I think I first used it when I had a grub issue

12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fuck
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> solve your issue with hot reloading
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what issue?
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i never had one
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dlopen just worked for me
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why does it crash for me üò≠
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's the only answer i found:
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31544567/crash-in-dlopen-receiving-sigbus
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you turn it on
12:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it scales right up
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it works for me the first time i load it
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only crashes on reload xD
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye dont write to the file 
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if i wait 2 seconds it also works
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also dont load while you are writing
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont anymore
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok then u good
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i fixed everything, i even move the file to somewhere else
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it now only reads a file hash checked private file that is 100% not the one before
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet_hotui/blob/2fa7d6f2e881db431bf74ad3696e01790cc8016d/loader.h#L98-L127
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 10 lines
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it just works
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u pro
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet 20 cents that one of my dependencies uses some global variables that causes this
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude i wasted like 4 hours on epoll shit
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then decided to use a naive file last updated check xd
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> global variables are evil chiller
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes they are in dlopen
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also static is the trollest
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you hotreload
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they always are
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``static int foo = 2; // never gets reset`` 
12:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> until ... hot reload
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> global vars you just pack in a struct and pass it as a void * to the thing in your dlopen 
12:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just pass ``pEditor`` and have all the ``pEditor->Config()`` globals ez https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet_hotui/blob/2fa7d6f2e881db431bf74ad3696e01790cc8016d/loader.h#L132
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just hate that it's impossible to debug
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i will wait for GPT 7
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``gpt7-cli --trace cargo run``
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for now a thread:sleep(2) has to work out xdddd
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> clean code
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> average rust dev using sleep to fix race conditions
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when in C it would just work because it has no race conditions
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> .. or something like that
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
12:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> huh
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Avoiding Thread-Local Storage"
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i agree

12:31 < bridge> <learath2> One issue with hosting your own mail is that google and microshit sometimes just decide everything coming from you is spam. Won't tell you what's wrong, won't give any reason
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish i could self host it but the world doesnt want me
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah

12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> you didn't advertise it well
12:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> and also what's purpose of tee-observer
12:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> have seen it on gh lately
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> it looks at master server
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> tracks changes in players etc
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> and broadcasts it as events

13:17 < bridge> <cyberfighter> damn you have to be a plumber for ddnet too now?
13:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> :MonkaS:
13:18 < bridge> <robyt3> You can use `(get-childitem \\.\pipe\).FullName` in PowerShell to get a list of all open named pipes
13:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you guys maintain a setup scripts for your new machines?
14:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> talking about .dotfiles?
14:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just in general i guess
14:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont u use windows
14:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i do
14:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got no suggestions
14:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> figured
14:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> same - NixOS superiority! :owo:
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i do have wsl which is unmaintained at best:justatest:
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have a zsh setup in windows but i dont think ive touched it since 2022
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh quick news. i got fired
14:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :feelsbadman:
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u doing now
14:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> got instantly rehired under a different company cuz some legal issues
14:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> troll
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway here if they didnt make a special thing to make it like its the same company i would ask for the money u get when u get fired
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, but having to transfer benefit accounts across provinces doesn't sound fine
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> because here if u worked in 2 companies in a year ur taxes change a bit
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fun*
14:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you pay your taxes yourself?
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> the taxes from salary are paid based on a % set by ur employer, but they know the correct % so when u have to declare u dont need to pay
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thing is if u earn less than 24k a year u dont need to declare
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> weird
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u worked 2 jobs u always need to
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> its complex
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> once a year u do tax declaration
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> most ppl dont need to do much cuz they only earn from salary
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u earned from stocks or etc
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> u declare it at that time
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
14:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we just go on an app and say whether we have medical emergency, housing rental and it just tell you how much they deduct from your prepaid taxes and i just need to hit confirm
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i guess u never had profit from stocks or smth
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the same here
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> u tell if ur married etc
14:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> having kids = tax deduction too
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> the gov wants u to fuck!
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> having ddnet = no taxes
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> true cuz u dont earn
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the simplest solution is the best
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
14:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i believe stocks are tracked already?
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> eh idk how its in china
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not here
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> depends where u do it
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u do it through ur bank, probs but if u do it through something like degiro not
14:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive never seen anyone have to file their earnings
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah cuz ur friends are wage workers
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they probs never were educated to invest
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant invest if u cant save  up after all kek
14:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually the app doesnt even have a entry for that
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well maybe china is different idk
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe u can trade without taxes?
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can only check your earnings
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> sounds crazy
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or trades are also tracked
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie oh maybe ur brokers are so controlled they charge taxes on the service itself
14:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> since all digital payments are indeed tracked here.
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> when withdrawing?
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> might be the case xd
14:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh wait that might be it
14:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz wechat had to update their gifting feature to a 200cny limit and add another form of payments like 5 years ago
14:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe they were like "you cant just voluntarily gift your 3000cny rent money to your landlord" and they just track everything going through the transfer system as expense and income.
14:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW:
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yet gov oficials probs do tax evasion
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh everyone do tax evasions
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> company teaches us how to deduct more
14:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats not tax evasion
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats playing the game
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> we all do that
14:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fair enough
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example the reason companies offer meal vouchers is
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> they dont pay taxes with that
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or reduced
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and so ur salary has "more value"
14:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
14:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i do hope i can get my 50k cny housing funds out of the foundation account when they switch my working locations
14:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but probably not gonna happen
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> wats a foundation acc
14:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon üòè
14:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1211306273627185202/image.png?ex=65edb7e0&is=65db42e0&hm=a8907546423d740b82ed545a0c69643a60a9a4f0402903e6139758b8e0a68f76&
14:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they make company deduct a certain percentage of your salary, double it and put it into a housing fund acc
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> invest
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> making money with money is how the world works
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and you get that back when you pay housing loans
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> loans for everyone
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2008
14:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it does technically doubles tho, but its hard to get it out all at once
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i could file rental, and get 1k out each month but the company have to put 4k in there
14:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :greenthing:
14:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just double check the app, there is indeed no way to file earnings. you can only check your earnings and file earnings that is not actually yours or not actually earnings. but they show you what you earn first.
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> `2024-02-25 13:54:27 I thread: !! 3` :monkaS:

15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why can't github anymore
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it used to work

15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did that like 2-3 times
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but before merge queue existed
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> done
15:55 < bridge> <robyt3> thx
15:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> last night that i dreamed to have a company that had an engine department. which just get report or feature request from the game department to contribute upstream.
15:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW: sounds like a bad investment of money after i woke up
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wonder if i can take loans just to open a game studio
15:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i feel like this whole job thing isnt working for me
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think everyone thinks that
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i feel like my colleague are doing just fine
16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk how they can see a unfinished and broken mess of a project and think, ye this is sellable
16:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :feelsbadman:
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that's probably the best they ever done xd
16:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> our PM and designer literally can not see the game does not even have a functioning title screen but they just dont care
16:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW: we are doing our first public playtest with outside insiders without a title screen on monday
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have a 10 item todo list last month, finished the 10 items, now i have 30 items in the list
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :monkaStop:
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i dont know how to work. i dont know how to manage people workflow. i tried to make standards but the designers just ignores any naming conventions and procedures because it is too much steps
16:06 < bridge> <gerdoe> arent they like
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW:
16:06 < bridge> <gerdoe> just dumb
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i cant just say taht
16:06 < bridge> <gerdoe> your problem that you care too much
16:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :feelsbadman: i just want to make cool stuff
16:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but the stuff isnt cool rn
16:07 < bridge> <gerdoe> i don't think your current job is the place where you really can make some cool stuff
16:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then why am i designing the game
16:07 < bridge> <gerdoe> from my view though
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW:
16:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> because you ready to design it ig
16:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd
16:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wrote the proposal and the plans and the technical documents for this project
16:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :pepeW: but the end product is just too overscoped by the level designer again
16:09 < bridge> <gerdoe> :justatest:
16:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i planned for a 6 room indoor environment. now it got turned into a 200m x 200m out-door open environments with sphere shaped buildings and no obstructions that are required to run at 72fps on a 5 year old mobile chip
16:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :HammyShock:
19:59 < bridge> <kekomonter> Omg 200k fps triangle :poggers2:
20:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how many gigabytes of code it took? :justatest:
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust rust
20:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> go go
22:31 < bridge> <reitw> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D04S2vHpXws @ryozuki yoo wtf...
22:31 < bridge> <reitw> bro's pc is a furnace
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:06 < bridge> <Dusquoes> Hi, i have a 0.5.2 mod that i want to play, should i make the mod ‚Äûnew‚Äú in 06 or is it ‚Äûeasy‚Äú changeable from 05 to 06?
23:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Code structure changed a lot between 0.5 and 0.6, protocol probably as well, it's likely easier to remake it new
