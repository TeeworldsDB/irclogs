01:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> i could do it but i have never played amucus and probably never will
04:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Already was thinking to make it, but since teeworlds doesn't have custom GUI that could be sent from server to client, it would be boring to make some ingame movements for quests.
04:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesnt have to be exactly like among us, you could use gun to tell crewmates what tasks you have, and each task could be a normal part
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there could also be different categories of tasks just like among us, some of which could be just solo parts
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like a fetch quest where you duplicate a solo part with different tp and go back, or just write code to check that you went to the top of a part and came back
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> a lot of ways you could do it imo
04:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe there are games that would translate better to teeworlds anyway
04:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no meme but battle royale teeworlds might be kinda sick if the combat was interesting enough
04:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> f-ddrace has a /survival minigame which acts simmilarly to battle royale
04:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> there are also special weapons which you can place and they all function in that minigame iirc
04:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> o cool
04:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is it team-based or ffa?
04:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ffa
09:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 has last man standing out of the box
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> lms and lts are really great gamemodes too
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like the removed binds in settings are also causing problems: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/4679778856494173400/
14:33 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why u ping me Ryozuki? cuz of that rust maximalist talk?
14:34 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> disliked the yt video :D

15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> nice, collegeboard doesn't support linux üôÉ
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Cant trust BYO devices in general. Full of malware and users click what they like.

17:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 seen that? symbol servers for linux sound quite useful
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope. not yet
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but with symbols in the elf itself, why would we need symbol servers?
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I guess for stripped binaries and stuff it could be useful
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for on-demand symbols
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> could someone maybe extend the timout limit in 'NUT Hardcore UNITED"? there are some with a 2-hour run
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga server and port pls, it's hard to figure out on an iPad
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> 176.9.114.238:8298
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> conn_timeout_protection, apparently, in seconds
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> GER
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if you want to do it you can btw
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which ger is GER?
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ger2
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> argh, let's hope this works
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can you also try?
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't find my command in the logs
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, seems to have worked
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Value: 10000
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> üëç nice thanks
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay üôÇ
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2021/luca-app-ccc-fordert-bundesnotbremse
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what is the luca app?
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, seems like some contact tracing app, why would anyone develop their own when there is a pretty great standard out there I wonder
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the federal government paid a lot of money to develop an app that had useful privacy protection
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but now some states are buying this software which doesn't have privacy in mind, it seems to me that the success formula is "less privacy protection ‚Üí must be better for tracing corona"
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, odd, I always thought germany was fairly socialist
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but corrupt
19:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where did I say something in relation to socialism? ^^
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You didn't but protecting citizens right to privacy is one of the things more popular in socialist governments
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in more hypercapitalist places the equation is "less privacy = more profit = better for the private sector = more lobbying dollars lining the pockets of govt officials"
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the gdr would like to have a word üòâ
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the gdr (russian part of occupied germany) is what had the stasi
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh cmon, giving examples of damaged socialist governments is getting old üòõ
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stalin was a nutjob
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also one big problem is, our government + digital stuff = huge RIP.
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> They are always uninformed and do random stuff that doesnt pay out xd
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these do happen, but not all the time
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the gdpr was a net plus already
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that was EU, wasnt it?
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to seee more successful examples of socialist policies, you should look further north in the EU
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbh, its also a thing of transparency. democracy isnt only about if you want equality. Even if they probably always somehow connected
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ do they reelect corrup politicians on germany
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc xD
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In spain its like being corrupt is a requisite to be elected
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No jome
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Joke
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> our minister of transport just wasted 500 mios, nobody cares xd
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even if all laywers told him his "idea" wont work
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he set up all contracts, and bam, the EU said no to it
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he wanted to tax foreigners on german roads
19:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> companies didn't want to have the deal, because they thought the eu would strike it down
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so the minister promised the money even in case the eu would strike it down
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (AFAIR)
19:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds correct xd
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can someone point me to big affairs that don't come from the CDU/CSU btw?
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Spain
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might be my personal sphere that doesn't make me see these
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you on the top of a country for too long this probs happens to anybody
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are too much connections with interests
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> G√ºrtel is a huge case, code-named after one of its main suspects, construction businessman Francisco Correa. His surname translates to belt in English and to G√ºrtel in German. The case covers bribery, money laundering and tax evasion, and implicates a wide circle of powerful businessmen and top politicians (90 per cent of the whole party) in the People's Party who had gained an absolute majority in the national elections of Spain. 
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The affair was first uncovered by the Spanish newspaper El Pais, whose researchers were awarded prizes for investigative journalism. Initial investigations were conducted in Madrid, Valencia & la Costa del Sol by the notable Spanish National Court Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, an examining magistrate serving the Juzgado Central de Instrucci√≥n No. 5.
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess there's a fair chance that they're not going to be "on top of the country" starting september
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_GaKeyboard:783753784064999514> <a:aPES2_GaKeyboard:783753784064999514> <a:aPES2_GaKeyboard:783753784064999514>
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, corona showed the greed of some politicans, and since they are part of the gouvernment, its kinda a scandal
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> In 2011 it was rated 30th least corrupt country in the world[4]
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound too bad. or just all other countries being really corrupt
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh i think alot of corruptness is hidden under "lobbyism"¬ß
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its 40 now iirc
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Aftee gurtel
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 90 per cent of the whole party
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/01/spain-watergate-corruption-scandal-politics-gurtel-case
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The whole party is a mafis
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mafis
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mafia
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupid mobile
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the fact that wikipedia says spain is more corrupt than qatar makes me wonder how that is even possible
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess i dont understand how far you can interpret corruptness
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> qatar is so corrupt that it probably wrapped around
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or monarchies cant be corrupt, bcs the definition doesnt work there xd
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> is it looking likely that the CDU will lose?
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they loose some percentages bcs of some politicans that made money with masks
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> who is the runner up btw?
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the green party currently i think
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> SPD?
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wow the greens?
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://dawum.de/Bundestag/
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> greens before spd yes
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs SPD was also part of the government and destroyed itself by accepting too muhc shit from CDU
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, if CDU falls below a SPD-Green party govt can be formed
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should read more about german politics, sounds way more interesting when there are some actual contenders to the throne
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> turkish, us and uk politics are soooo boring, extremely disproportional results, duopolies
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> spd and green could form it with Linke(who are kinda the most left party with over 5%) and maybe FDP, but FDP isnt really the party it was 40 years ago
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly some newer parties like "Die Piraten" destroyed theirself, when they got more famous
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> currently the second most loved party among new ellectors is "Die Partei" which is a troll party xD
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When is AfD getting > 50% btw?
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt that will happen, too many of their politcans are too talking like neo nazis
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funny how outside of germany everyone talks about the dangers of AfD when they barely seem to get 5%
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are very split between very conservatives and right extreme
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they lost a bit in corona time
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they were stronger before
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you need more conservative parties disguised as neo-liberals
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sprinkle a little populism in there and it'll shake the political stage right up
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats what FDP is nowadays imo
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk about FDP, I'll read up
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually SPD didnt even want to be part of government, but bcs FDP said no to CDU + Green + FDP, they had to reconsider
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The party chairman looks more like the CEO üòõ
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh one thing I'm interested about, which party do the unions back?
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> CSU CDU
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you mean that with union
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> CSU = Bavaria is best, Bavaria first
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> litteraly xD
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean trade unions, you know like IG Metall
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess most are SPD
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs thats the tradition of that party
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not sure nowadays
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I find whoever the unions back usually have the best policies for the people
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> green are far right, they are pro franco (the dictator who died of old age in spain)
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832673117876781086/unknown.png
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt üòÑ
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hey, I'm also very left leaning nowadays, so who knows üôÇ
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man, in spain the dictatorship ended  cuz the dictator died of old age, can u imagine
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how ridiculous it is
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> our green party is left-mid i'd say
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in germany there is also a right-mid green party
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> √ñDP
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait wait wait, @Ryozuki your greens are right wing? üòÑ
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 like the most right wing possible
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are straight up fascists
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I'm guessing they just randomly assign colors because green parties are so left leaning everywhere else
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/832673707205722152/unknown.png
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)#Ideology>
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should give erdogan a call, he can give them some pointers
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, so this week I'll learn more about the german political landscape and next week I'll do spain üôÇ
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is erdogan islamic?
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it suits him, sure, currently it does
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if so then they hate him then
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He used to support lgbtq+ rights before he was elected
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is seriously the perfect populist
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Right up there with boris and trump
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > arguing that Spain should make no sovereignty concessions to the EU, because they consider Spanish sovereignty to reside in the Spanish nation alone.
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > They propose to eliminate Spain's autonomous communities.[55] In addition, they seek the return of Gibraltar to full Spanish sovereignty.[56]
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nationalismgang
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should become a politician instead of a programmer
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hypernationalist populist neo-liberal conservative policies
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dont think its that easy to become one of these elites
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are backed by a family of politicians
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usually
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so many buzzwords no one can understand what I really am
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 here, and in most places certainly you dont get to appear in TV unless you had previous seats in the previous goverment
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this only makes status quo more prevalent
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if it'd work in europe but in turkey they used mosques to get around this
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I could use churches for passing my messages around?
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 here they tried twitter to get around this
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they got 0.6% votes
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no seat
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> noo, twitter is full of liberals
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't do populism well there unless it's the US
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno it feels like all internet is pretty mixed
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw here u can see the first party has socialist in the name, well as you can imagine its only a facade
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they pander to the ibex-35 companies all the time
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ppl tend to say their opinion much more easily
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (even if its an insult) xd
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twitter actually enables one to circle-jerk so easily its fearsome
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure but the crowd on twitter and reddit are overly liberal. You cant spend dozens of hours on internet and still think nationalism makes sense
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> reddit maybe more üòÑ
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but twitter not sure üòÑ
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to look for a better mix of people it's facebook
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt feel like it the few times i read there

19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Facebook has all the way from 70yos to 15yos. Extreme right to extreme left
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is facebook not dead in your country yet?
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> here nobody uses it anymore xd

20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can the superpowers just relax until I die?
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then they can have their WW3
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone using FTP?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "FTP is 50 years old"
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno where, but i saw somewhere that even a War between indian countries(or countries around it) could already kill the whole world, bcs of massive dust spreading over the world, just like the meteorite that killed the dinos
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Susge:
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use sftp sometimes, but not ftp
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hear most web hosters still use ftp
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we should invade both pakistan and india to make sure they don't
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (jk)
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 usa sure thinks that way
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are the world "peace makers" but unironically they make wars to do that
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES_SusThink:
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> those are not wars, those are express peace deliveries
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "proxy wars"
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usa loves these
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wars that are really far away from their country
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its like nothing happens
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but whe someone bombs their city the panick like crazy
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they never even felt they could be attacked
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> they had one right below our border, usa vs russia, usa left then told everyone turkey was doing a genocide
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm very familiar with usa proxy wars üòõ
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw the US army has a twitch channel and they rly try hard to take gamers in
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hilarious
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait, really?
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they sponsor esports
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a lot
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> imagine ww3 with helicopters busting fortnite music and american soldiers doing the L on top of the people they kill
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twitch chat trolled them

20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we probably should talk about this somewhere else, this is waay too far from #developer üòÑ
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #lear
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it all started bcs of the luca app xD
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we shoudl rename offtopic to food and developer to politics
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should make a channel for my random rants about random subjects
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> #learath2
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would join
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this sounds very bad btw, especially with a state funded well developed alternative
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> Can you compile tw with visual studio 2019?
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> i'll ask on tw discord
22:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 that the green party got so many votes is a recent development
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might have something to do with fridays for future, the hot summers we had recently and the spd falling out of favor
22:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and our forests die
22:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats acutally something even old ppl dislike xd
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> haven't seen the forests thing widely discussed
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not only climate change but industry
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> meat production and export to china for example costs alot of land
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i often met older ppl saying "in this forest i played as child, now its gone"
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it seems like we would really benefit from a #developer-chill chat lol
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally meat is intensive in land consumption xd
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only says development discussion, not ddnet development XD
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahhh we're talking about land development :D
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> totally xD
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> makes sense to me
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk if this is a weird question, but im interested in learning about different aspects of ddnet server and im wondering if anyone could do a short walkthrough of different parts of the code with me (or if that's too complicated maybe just specific topics)
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> in vc or not
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess its easier to ask specific questions, tw code isnt really hard but mostly undocumented and sometimes a bit weird
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe i should yeah. i mean its mostly logistical questions not issues with the code
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can identify some components
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like where is x, what does y do
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first, we have src/base/system.c
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that handles most of the operating system interfaces
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> üçø
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we have src/engine/shared/network*.cpp that handles the low-level network code
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it is used to establish a connection over UDP (usually non-connection-oriented, unreliable)
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> higher level code can request a connection (with setup and teardown) or send connectionless packets
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> within a connection, you can send "chunks", small packets. these can either be reliable or unreliable
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the chunks are combined into UDP packets and send over the network
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im assuming reliable means still UDP but with certain protocol to ensure you get an ack
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reliable chunks are repeated if a packet gets lost
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what are some examples of reliable chunks?
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i imagine finishes are
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything except game world updates
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and player input from the client)
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> game world update? like switching on/off?
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> game world update? like switches on/off?
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean actually ingame finishes?
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the teeworlds server calculates all movements by itself
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ohhh wait i understand
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the server "should" never be in a invalid state like the client can be
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there is no networking for the game state from client to server
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> only the reverse
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> including finishes
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only inputs go from client to server
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> makes sense ok
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so on top of this is src/engine/server/
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and at what point after system.c and network*.c does it become more involved with ddrace
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and at what point after system.c and network*.cpp does it become more involved with ddrace
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this handles most of the stuff that every game has, but isn't specific to teeworlds/ddnet
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so state machine, coordinates, angles
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, not game world yet
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rcon, registering the server with the master servers, handling server info, etc.
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i see
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it also has a mechanism of synchronizing generic "snapshots" of game worlds
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in src/engine/shared/snapshot.cpp
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when is this mechanism used?
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's used by the uppermost layer to synchronise position of tees, weapon projectiles, game info, etc.
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the uppermost layer provides these snapshots
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the engine layer diffs it against the last snapshot the client has acknowledged
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and only sends the differnece, lowering bandwidth consumption
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these differences are the only packets sent by the server that use the unreliable transmission
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (because they implement reliability themselves)
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so the purpose is keeping updates concise
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> to client
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> got it
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, in 0.6/ddnet also player infos (name, clan, skin, points, ping) are synchronized via these snapshots
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i am putting the first message ID in your discord notes so i can read this later xD
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in 0.7 name, clan, skin are instead transmitted in reliable messages
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now comes the uppermost layer
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/game/server
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it handles all the teeworlds/ddnet-specific stuff
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/game/gamecore.cpp has the shared stuff used for predicting the local tee based on the input the server hasn't seen yet
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp is the meta stuff of the game, i.e. chat, votes, chat commands, etc.
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp src/game/server/gameworld.cpp is stuff concerning the actual game
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then in src/game/server/entities/ we find different stuff that can exist in the world
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> projectiles, laser, tees, dragger, doors
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> one thing i have been wondering about (and you might end up answering this)
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is an optimistic view btw
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> now connect every single one of these pieces with random pieces of code we added in the last decade of ddrace
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what learath2 says
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in src/game/server/score.cpp high-level interaction with the database is handles
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in src/game/server/score.cpp high-level interaction with the database is handled
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's called score because it was originally just the race scores üòÑ
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is that there could be a dependency issue if there are entities game/server/* needs
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but we assume game/server/entities does not change at all right?
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interdepending source files aren't a problem in C++
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is that a problem?
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do we need to assume that?
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> right, well i was wondering if you were to make modifications, what entities are specifically relied on to make sure you dont break the server xd
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i am interested in learning about ddnet server for making game modes, like teeware or fng
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> define breaking the server
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can modify code in entities as well, especially if you just add effects
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like what relationships are mission-critical? if the finish entity logic only runs if a tee actually finishes a map, you could technically not have the entity there or modify it to do something different
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you modify how projectiles fly, that is not going to display correctly in the client
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mostly want to wrap ddrace's existing structure in a safe way
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so that my code is a sort of sandbox from the normal stuff
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or if you modify how tees move, that's not going to be predicted correctly for the local tee/in antiping for other tees
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if it only happens infrequently, that's fine (see e.g. teleporters in DDNet, those aren't predicted)
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so i would need to have people use a specific client if i ever did that
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> which would ofc be not ideal
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> other than that, just do whatever you want
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the client doens't interpret any tiles that don't affect physics
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so it will just wait for the server in any case
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not wait, but not show the correct state
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have noticed that things like /points dont work locally (i would expect them to still be available in the local db)
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is it a pretty simple step to get that working?
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pf, one day we really should get a stripped down version of ddnet so people can mod easily
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like one where all the entities have no behavior, and there's no race logic?
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well, maybe some do, like solid tiles and freeze
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn points only work if you manually insert maps into the points table in the db
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i see
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so just using a db client
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or is there a tool you use?
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> `add_map Kobra 4` or something like that
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we have a tool
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-django
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> cool, assuming not open source but would you share? i doubt the cmd is hard
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh thank you
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have most if not all the parts of our infrastructure open source
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn open it with sqlite3 or the mysql client, whichever db you use
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> good to know
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so even if i think it's like ddnet hq stuff it's probably out there xd
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe "hq" is disingenous :P
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is only one piece of code that's not open source and that's the antibot
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe "hq" is disingenuous :P
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hq? headquarters? üòõ
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ya
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah that makes sense
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is it too much to ask if the antibot uses some sort of heuristics or if it is pretty deterministic
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> c) all of the above
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xD alright
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, it's only in part our antibot, the most part is written by noby
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly it's noby's antibot that we just hooked into ddnet and added a couple small things to
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that was more what i was wondering, how similar it was lol
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not that i know his code either
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im assuming ddnet-web and ddnet-django and connected somehow?
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no they aren't
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im assuming ddnet-web and ddnet-django are connected somehow?
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well there is one part, a custom script somewhere that generates thumbnails for the map
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly wouldn't even know where to find it but it should be in ddnet-scripts repo
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean my thumbnail tool?
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so ddnet-web is the whole site? im just trying to figure out what the django server is for
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or do you mean the map screenshots (those are done by hand I think)
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> other than the points stuff
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> lynn gonna catfish us to get the inside out of the antibot code! :P
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> listen, noby loves me but not THAT much
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> uwu
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> but i do agree, a breakdown of the code would be nice. however, just going through the files you can kinda work out what is where etc. just a matter of trying it out rather than just look at a file on github lmao, only way you gonna learn.
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i was just looking at random files before and it was intimidating...
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but now i feel like i can have a more pointed approach
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have more questions, be sure to ask here üòâ
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah thank you so much for your help actually, i did not expect that and i rly appreciatei t
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah thank you so much for your help actually, i did not expect that and i rly appreciate it
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> fairly similar, ddnet has almost all of the parts related to hook bot+hammer bot + aim bot detection but not the other half that has to do with laser bots specifically
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that would make sense
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> assuming angles is a large part of that
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> math everywheree
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yes angles are one of the pieces of info it uses
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> dem triangles ;)
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> some parts of it use rotating lists of the last x inputs/hooks/etc that matched a given pattern or met certain conditions
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> im sure this is possible, but what would be cool is analyse player movement, pipe that into a ml pipeline and let it work out what is a bot or not
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> it would be cool yeah
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> giving it samples of known bots and known real players and having it decide the best way to detect bots in realtime
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> pretty much the same with a spam engine when you get these toxic players using vpns.
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i used a very simple equivalent to this when generating some of the antibot checks
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it seems sort of simple in theory? but ofc the setup is the hard part
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like fine-tuning what things are more/less bot-like
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and giving a bot score
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah ofc and need alot of samples really.
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yes and providing a good amount of data; tests generated this way are generally very good at detecting specific types of bots but if the way the bot works is changed then it can be less effective
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ML is not magic pixie dust üòâ
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> also things like custom mouse distance can throw it off as well
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> doesnt the only the angle matter?
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> the samples would need to cover many different types of playstyle/settings and also types of bots
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> no
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wait i think i understand
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> angle, cursor position, tee positions, various delays etc
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> different mouse distance can produce more/less precise angles
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> think of angle as 1 data point, the more data points you have, the more you are able to formulate a deeper dimension of your data.
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> well the ones that are only based on angles arent affected by mouse distance
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> but some of them use cursor position too
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> noby giving away the special sauce
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ohhh goti t
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> its hot sauce we getting here
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> well im not going to actually say what its checking for
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean anyone could come up with these concepts i feel like
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but coding it is the hard part
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> also saying the obvious is 1 thing but actual coding it is another
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> everything i said probably applies to pretty much any type of anti bot system
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you could assume an antibot would analyze all input
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> keyword `etc`
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't talk about my parts of the antibot though üòâ @noby
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> well, as much as you think would be useful to your decision making process
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yeah i wont
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> +not giving specifics on mine either
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> just rough idea
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> if (bot) { ban(); }
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> if (louis) { :nooooouis_alt1::nooooouis_3::nooooouis_alt2:; }
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if (name === Syltoox) ban();
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> are there any plans to allow evaluation of setting values in exec
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> totally not to store metadata or anything...
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> think of it like a calculator. i may want to store a value and use it later in a different bind
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not yet, I'm planning to add one to make deepfly binds possible again
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a PR by ChillerDragon that does that, I didn't like the idea
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it might allow players to make very helpful binds, possibly intrusive
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> @noby u got a github page i can look at?
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ye but i use private gitlab repos for all tw stuff
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah ik that, idc about teeworlds stuff
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> just wanna see the things you been working on publicly etc
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> https://github.com/nobody-mb
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> also good u put ur teeworlds stuff on gitlab ;)
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> not github
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> why good
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i did because github wasnt offering free private rpos at the time
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> ah yeah i remember that
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> soon in next update
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add feeling pain in DDraceNetwor‚úåÔ∏è
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when open-source fng mod @noby?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> its the fng server i had before i rewrote it on ddnet base
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but when are you going to open source the new fng?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> why would i
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> honestly idc between gitlab/hub anymore
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> to give back to the community, allow others to contribute
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> gitlab quintupled their pricing
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> +1 to open-sourcing whatever fng most people use
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> besides antibot ofc
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and make sure it won't get lost, so others won't have to reimplement in the future
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> having better cfg scripting would be awesome
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but it would probably introduce more gamebreaking binds
23:47  * bridge_ [ddnet] <SPYRES> noby goes silent :P
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yup my thoughts exactly
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like we cant just have if/else or events despite wanting them, they would break the game wide open
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> but then more people would host fng without antibot
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why should they
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fng2 is open source
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> they will naturally use the best service, and if you continue to provide the best service, why would they switch
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you need to be confident
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u cant expect anticheat to be on every server tho lol
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> if fng2 is already open source then why does mine need to be
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> didnt u make a lot of changes?
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u use other code
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe i see a compromise
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> not sure if the changes are things anyone else is interested in
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> source by invitation
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you trust people not to host without antibot, and they purely want to contribute to the mode / learn how it works
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just invite them
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> if fng is noby's legacy on ddnet, i can understand why he may not want to share.
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well also antibot for ddnet too
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> but i dont have the full picture here so dont take what i say for certain
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> maybe thats part of it idk
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i would personally want to see the code, not for hosting it but just to learn more about ways people approach game modes
23:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you have it in a private gitlab repo i would like to see :D
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> i get u bro, we dont want noby to be lost when things go open source. i think every coder who has code private would feel the same way especially if they worked hard on it.
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i mean its basically fng but with mdump
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> so even kf its not open source it dont matter much since big part is antibot which cant be
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet code base, 0.6+0.7 compatibility,stats,whois,netcode fixes etc
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah that part too
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there may be important information to glean from that though
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> are there specific netcode fixes that would benefit ddnet?
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> i already suggested the most important one
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> and they already added a better version of it
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh cool
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> the caching serverinfo replies
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont be a kog and go open source, u in the ddnet tab after all xd
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> haha
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> make a pvp tab then
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> at least partially.. like maybe you can separate all the code you dont want to share
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and put all the public code somewhere
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yes replace kog with pvp tab
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i agree with that 100%
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or just name it other
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> put ALL modes in there
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Internet tab?
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> teeware included
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> pvp tab for trusted pvp servers/pvp servers hosted by ddnet
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> actually the 0.7+0.6 fng is pretty good
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well i guess teeware is pvp
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, atleast we have fng2
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> pvp tab for all pvp modes i think, but maybe a symbol for antibot protection
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> not just trusted
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried to help you strip fng from the antibot stuff a couple times now, but I guess there is more
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wowow good ideas
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but how would you detect antibot protection? you must be able to verify the admin
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> lots of goodies in the bag @Learath2 :P
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and not every antibot is created equal, might spark debates on who gets the symbol
