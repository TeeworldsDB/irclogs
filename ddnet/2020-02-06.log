09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When you have the problems, provide us your ip address and a "traceroute ger.ddnet.tw", then we do the same from GER server and forward it to our hoster

18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> idk
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we have a setting that hides servers that havent sent serverinfo yet?
