00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can we please get event binding for connect/disconnect
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be really useful to bind things like showall on connect for players that always use it, or /ninjajetpack
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i feel like this was discussed before but people said no
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Bind showall or ninjajet on other key
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Like many players have binds for team
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Or dummy
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> U have a lot of keys on keyboard
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why dont u use them
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> looks like there is no issue for this in github, ill make one
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i can think of so many useful things for this xd
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im writing a bunch of examples
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thoughts?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it could used to chat spam but i think the features outweigh the potential abuse
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would also support the same thing for disconnect if it makes some of those binds cleaner
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> That sounds good
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> Especially the last one, I dislike it when I forgot that I have the pistol out
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> Instead pf the hammer
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what does `ed_` stand for in `ed_showkeys` ?
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> editor is not correct
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> Instead pf the hammer
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> edit demo?
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> I don't know
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TilmeedhB> Sorry
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think this convention is restricting a good name for editor commands lol
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> @lynn map editor
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that took way too long than im willing to admit
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that took way longer than im willing to admit
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt there already keyboard shortcuts for some of those
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hardcoded, yes
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the idea is to allow them to be bindable/configurable like everything else in the game lol
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i love how user-focused this game is, and i just wanna increase the coverage of that
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could also do this for demos? but not sure how useful that would be
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe but who would actually rebind the editor controls
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait oh
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nobody would bind file menu but the other stuff would be nice yeah
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also consider that i added commands for things that are not already bound to anything
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it drives me crazy that there's no command to focus the tele/switch button
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for ctrl-f
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ed_ is already used for map editor so just use that instead of edt_
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ed\_ is already used for map editor so just use that instead of edt_
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm, support for uploading a map to a server in game
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ed_ is for demos i thought
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what is showkeys then
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> show the keys you press when you are in map editor
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> w a t
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nvm then
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> updated
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also let me use the consoles in the editor ffs
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :(
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> seriously guys make points clan
06:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> would be great and would be there meaning from use same clan+i guess ppl will stop play with same name
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be cooll
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be cool
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> should be make issue right?:tee_thinking:
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Needs accounts
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darkness_> Hi friend, today I am leaving this fucking game with a bunch of cheaters and an aggressive community. I want to cheer you up and give you some skins. Here is my trade: https://stermcomunniity.ru/tradeoffer=partner=?0753842
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> Why does the afk emote disappear after getting killed (or changing map) ? Was it simply forgotten or is it not easy to implement that it stays?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> changing map is not possible to determine since it's technically a reconnection
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think the reason getting killed resets afk is because it resets your entire player object and afk must be a part of it, probably better that way
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> otherwise afk status would have to be decoupled from player and moved to some connection level class with references to your tees (maybe that makes more sense actually?)
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> alright
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> client can send packet on connection that specifies if he will be afk
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> or just add argument to netmsg_info packet
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i like this solution
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @murpi let me know if i should amend it with anything or if that seems reasonable
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like a maximum number of pings to track
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably 10
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> looks good
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk how long lag spikes can last though
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it should be resilient to favor previous ping storage over current higher ping
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mm maybe you can just keep using disconnect ping, and compare against the last disconnect ping. if the new value is higher, take the average and store that. otherwise, store the new value
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dumber system but much easier to reason with + nice automatic behavior
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I dont get it
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> plus if you connected during 999 ping, well your average would be like 500 ping so it doesn't do anything
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> fixing the issue of storing lag spikes in server browser ping
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for people who use sort/filter by ping
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> But u just see EUR AFR etc
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not when you connect
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well actually im using old version so i see actual ping
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> new version still shows ping. it just does it based on last piong
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> new version still shows ping. it just does it based on last ping
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you dont connect to a server it will show the region
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> So what is ur issue
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> let's say someone disconnects because of ddos
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> then in the browser, it shows the ddos ping
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if someone has a max ping filter of 200
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they will not see the server anymore
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> yes
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is not ideal
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ping storage should be more resilient
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> to discrepancies in ping
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think taking the average is fine
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, thats the problem of that region ping update:monkaS:
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe it pushes it down the list but not off your filter
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but if you somehow had 999 ping when you disconnect it's still a terrible average
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i agree, but there must be a workaround
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe you do need a more sophisticated system like i mentioned
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> eh, actually this problem can be solved by having an option for clients to "trust" servers
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and they always ask for ping even when not connecting
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you can also have an option for auto-trusting servers when you disconnect once
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I dont rly get the point of region pings cuz who will track every server ping and ddos ever ip he sees, like he dont even get nickname or smth:pepeH:
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you can also have an option for auto-trusting servers when you connect once
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't matter, anyone in internet tab would get every single ip and that's so easy to ddos with
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> But thats only ip
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> U just get thousands of ips every second
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Minute*
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> players are constantly querying the master server
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont know the specifics on how the ddos works but i know it's because of how many ips there are + consistent connections
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ddos = a lot of packets from a lot of ips at same time
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> player ips
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, smbd can just ddos masterbrowser and nobody would see any server
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Like it was a year ago
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Constant clear browser
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Constantly clear browser
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my point was that any registered server could see all player ips, and those ips could be used for ddos
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> registred server sends self info to master server and players parse that info and with old ping system - pings every server directly, if someone who have server could look up recent pings and look for ips
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> registred server sends self info to master server and players parse that info and with old ping system - pings every server directly,  someone who have server could look up recent pings and look for ips
