00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why do entities like door, dragger or gun not have their own ENTTYPE? They use ENTTYPE_LASER. Is it okay to replace them with custom Enttypes, or will it fuck up something?
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I use custom enttypes for my own entities too, so this shouldnt be a problem I guess? (i need them seperated because at some point I need to check only for doors, not the rest)
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably okay

15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you can add a radius argument, and if the search goes out of the radius it just returns nothing
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So like, if distance(teepos, checkpos) > radius return?
