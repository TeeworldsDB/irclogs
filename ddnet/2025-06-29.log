00:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Uhoh
00:31 < bridge> <Assa> is my clang format too new?
00:31 < bridge> <Assa> `clang-format.exe --version
00:31 < bridge> <Assa> clang-format version 12.0.0`
00:33 < bridge> <Assa> and if I use it, my results will get complained by the CI pipeline ðŸ¤”
00:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The readme for the workspace would have explained it xd
00:37 < bridge> <Assa> so I hopefully just need to download to 10

03:03 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> nope we've only ever hosted in vps that are friendly to mainland china
03:04 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> Previously tencent's Hong Kong nodes. Now Los Angeles with a CN2(china telecom built) link
03:05 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> We've tried to find a way to host them with in china, but anything with a 2tb traffic within china is unoptainium cost wise

03:41 < bridge> <totar> how do any games provide services in china then?
05:34 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> commercial game or just regular steam gamesï¼Ÿ
05:34 < bridge> <totar> idk a lot of games have a Chinese game server region
05:35 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> We also have Chinese sevrers
05:35 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> Master server is just too expensive and 80/443 ports are blocked if you don't register them with gov
05:36 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> If we can eat 2000usd/month and allow a citizen to register ddnet.org or use teeworlds.cn then we can also do it
05:37 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> Both the cost and registration are unrealistic so we just don't do it
05:38 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> And for commercial games they are either have Chinese company publishing them or they are using circumventions
05:39 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> I'm pretty sure Heinrich is against circumventions. Technically it is possible to host on a non standard port and roll a custom SSL so Chinese cloud holsters don't block us for not registering
05:40 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> I'm pretty sure Heinrich is against circumventions. Technically it is possible to host on a non standard port and roll a custom SSL so Chinese cloud hosters don't block us for not registering
05:43 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> ~~Also it would be fun to know what commercial games are hosting official Chinese servers, I might get rewarded to report them~~

08:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was no rename
08:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i registered brand new account
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> worth the effort for little trol
08:46 < bridge> <melon> this maneuver is gonna cost us 1/39238 fake-emails

09:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So what was the problem now? Did you really manually edit is os release?
09:18 < bridge> <melon> just curious why it was called bookworm instead of trixie really :kek:
09:18 < bridge> <melon> i assume because trixie not yet released
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So you really have no dist upgrade left?
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But yeah maybe that is the reason xd

10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar how do you rate 800 fps for empty black screen? xd
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melon where is that josspit comment screenshot from?
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's from assas physics change issue
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I dunno, what r u coding to have 800fps
10:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> empty blank screen
10:21 < bridge> <learath2> You are the only person I know running sid
10:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> empty black screen
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I doesn't have the religious ppl advertising it like arch does xD
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think it's pretty solid.
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ofc any linux destop distro can sometimes feel like u a beta tester xd
10:24 < bridge> <melon> @jupeyy_keks the reason i'm on debian is because the rolling distro aspect of nixos-unstable/arch broke my shit like 20 times now
10:24 < bridge> <melon> and it pissed me off, so i'm sort of unstable still with pixie, but still stable enough to just do shit
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> understandable, but if smth is broken on debian, it's broken for like at least 3 months xdd
10:25 < bridge> <melon> yeah :D
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So it's always a trade
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> Get gentooooooo
11:12 < bridge> <melon> i'm scared of gentoo!
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> It rolls, but only if you want it to roll
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> It's a cute penguin why scared?

11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª i tried to craft a new game with SDL3 and i feel like its slow before it even has content
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i need to know vulkan or shits to make a proper game? -.-
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ofc not
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet also has 10k fps with OpenGL 3.3
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U either have some expensive stuff going on, use SDL3 incorrectly or it's buggy
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> skill issues
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Do you use SDL_PollEvent
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Or WaitEvent
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good?
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So option 3
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Which is?
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> download more ram?
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No, but pls say which SDL event function u use
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i know xd
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Global search
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> SDL_PollEvent
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no hits
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> search SDL_WaitEvent
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no hits
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i use the fancy sdl 3 game loop thingy
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> SDL_WaitEventTimeout
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Oh ok
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I dunno, does it have like a setter for it?
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> SDL_AppEvent
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> SDL_AppIterate
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats wat i use
11:42 < bridge> <melon> `Apps implement this function when using SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS. If using a standard "main" function, you should not supply this.`
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i got no main
11:42 < bridge> <melon> :dTeuMonkaW:
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is the source public?
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc
11:42 < bridge> <melon> link

11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dis the sdl stuff
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm oh i forgot i added ``SDL_DelayNS`` <:trollchungus:1010641652920098887>
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now i got 1k fps
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still bad imo
11:45 < bridge> <melon> wait am i dense? you locked your fps
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea looks like it xd
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that was last year what do i know
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDDDDDD
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but shouldnt i have like 5k fps?
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least
11:45 < bridge> <melon> YOU LOCKED IT TO 1K
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not even full hd
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just uncommented the delay thing
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Did u remove the delay now or what
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it upgraded me from like 700 to 1000 fps
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still meh
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok, ko I want to play this game anyway
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I install
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait no
11:46 < bridge> <melon> nothing to play, i compiled it
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no gameplay yet!
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i removed all gameplay when adding multiplayer xd

11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But why does it always clone SDL when i remove build dir
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its batteries included

11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Your GPU is better btw
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But my CPU runs undervolted too
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Undervolting is the real overclocking, trust me
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No risk, and the newer ryzens will choose an optimized frequency curve
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Automatically
12:01 < bridge> <melon> actually true lmao
12:01 < bridge> <melon> 0 issues with undervolting
12:01 < bridge> <melon> tho tbf, we're both not really doing any GPU heavy tasks
12:01 < bridge> <melon> should try to render a 16K video at some point
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah, I used -80mv in bg3 for a while but it crashed, but -60mv was stable yet since like 3-4 months
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> For CPU -20mv is stable for me
12:05 < bridge> <melon> I didn't Untervolt CPU but it also never made problems
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I mean you won't get much more than 5-10%
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But it's nice to see all cores hold their max frequency more stable ðŸ˜„

17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Bcs that's how the client detects it xD
17:13 < bridge> <melon> it took us so long to realize, we banned people thinking they were using scripts/macros to rejoin when we kicked them for being afk.
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Same for password protection btw
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If the msg contains "password" it assumes the server wants a password
17:15 < bridge> <melon> :pepepuke:
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vibe programming in 2007
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hehe
17:16 < bridge> <drafakiller> I'm surprised that it has been kept that way for so long. Kick messages like "AFK, Server Full" or "Don't AFK on a full server" break it completely.
17:17 < bridge> <melon> i will find you east...

17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "Afk, server is fuII"
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that should work
17:17 < bridge> <drafakiller> It contains the word "full".
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No it contains fuII
17:18 < bridge> <melon> 2025-06-29 15:17:59 I chat/server: *** 'modless tee' has left the game (Kicked (Afk, server is full))
17:18 < bridge> <melon> 2025-06-29 15:18:05 I chat/server: *** 'modless tee' entered and joined the game
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‚
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with two capital i
17:18 < bridge> <melon> oh brother you're such a troll
17:18 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> fuII
17:18 < bridge> <drafakiller> "Hopefully, you won't reconnect" makes them reconnect because of "HopeFULLy".
17:20 < bridge> <drafakiller> Oh, I didn't even realize it's with 2 i. It might actually work, lmao.
17:20 < bridge> <drafakiller> @jupeyy_keks Have you scammed anyone with urls the in past, by any chance? xd
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No, but in teeworlds capital i looks even closer to l, than in discord
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And there was this french guy called lIl or smth, and we all faked him
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Back when confusables were not as good as today at least
17:23 < bridge> <drafakiller> I really hope someone would be able to find a quick fix for that. At the very least make it a fixed length match for whatever messages the current system needs to send.
17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> Upgrade the build machine ðŸ™‚
17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> C++20 is pretty old
17:52 < bridge> <melon> isnt our build machine just.. deen
17:52 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> deen is a machine
17:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen the machine
17:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you turn the deen on and it scales right up
19:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: do ddnet servers support not only ddnet clients but both 0.6.4 and 0.7 teeworlds clients?
19:40 < bridge> <manikoo> of course
19:40 < bridge> <manikoo> ddnet servers based on 0.6.4
19:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes im aware of that
19:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> hmm
19:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> im just wondering if that is even worth supporting
19:41 < bridge> <manikoo> there is rather 0.6.4 support ddnet client connections
19:41 < bridge> <manikoo> if im sure :kek:
19:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah ddnet clients can connect to 0.6.4 servers
19:42 < bridge> <manikoo> there is many players who play through teeworlds
19:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> but they talk another protocol
19:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> really?
19:42 < bridge> <manikoo> sure
19:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> more than 1%?
19:42 < bridge> <manikoo> maybe
19:42 < bridge> <filoqcus> https://tenor.com/view/pipotam-baby-hippo-hippo-wash-shower-gif-3406421565683572068
19:43 < bridge> <manikoo> cosgerms pipotam
19:45 < bridge> <manikoo> teeworlds have own "modes" like fclient or chiller's or allthehx, i believe soneone play through it
20:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato yes ddnet servers support vanilla 0.6 clients but its not very well tested anymore since there are basically no users. All vanilla enjoyers updated to 0.7 at this point
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not that much work to support it tho. Its not like ddnet is much different. you can basically send any ddnet traffic to a vanilla client and it will handle it properly. Just ignoring everything it does not know
20:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh right, it can just ignore the messages lmao
20:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> thanks teeworlds guru
20:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> but without the proper support, things like frozen tees cant be normally interpreted by the client right
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> i know that with 0.7 protocol ddnet server sends frozen tees as ninja
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> i know that with 0.7 protocol clients ddnet server sends frozen tees as ninja
20:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> i know that with 0.7 protocol clients ddnet server sends frozen tees as ninjas
21:30 < bridge> <Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeero> i should write a solver that takes in a run of one or more players and then places speeders to match the run as closely as possible without the tees doing anything
21:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: yes you should send ninja skin. But depending on what you work on you donâ€™t need much more. DDNet severs also use the armor amount as freeze count down (freeze bar) but I would say thatâ€™s more a nice to have
21:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> damn you really think i could get this far with the server development
21:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> well i kind of rewrote the entire library since the last time
21:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> i was messing around with twgame for a bit but ended up nowhere
22:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> one would call it a leap ðŸ˜¬

22:11 < bridge> <melon> More like a full on dive
22:11 < bridge> <melon> Gawd dayum
23:04 < bridge> <Assa> if a server advertises, that it's in 19.4, would it be listed by the masterserver and would clients be able to join?
23:04 < bridge> <Assa> well, it'll have to ðŸ¤” works in dev as well
23:04 < bridge> <Assa> guess my question is stupid
