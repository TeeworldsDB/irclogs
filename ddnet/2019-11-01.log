00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Festour> Hey, can someone update ddnet on ubuntu repo?
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Festour> Right now its 11.7.2, not 11.7.3
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it normal that you are calling `RecordDeadPlayer` for each player for each tick?
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lea, it doesnt need to have a fatter hitbox, it needs to have better interaction between the killtile and the tee
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know, we already have a way of handling tiles that aren't supposed to be skipped
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem is that at very high speeds the tee can move more then one tile in one tick
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In which case we just check all the tiles inbetween aswell
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news, an empty ddnet server is fairly well optimized
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> does it waste like 30 ish ping depth of rendering time?
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> rendering time? all that happens on the server
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like just imagine having to tall fast enough to skip through but when you cant, it feels like you lagged a little
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats my theory
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like just imagine having to fall fast enough to skip through but when you cant, it feels like you lagged a little
00:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like it needs to be instantanious no matter where this technice is planned on
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is instantaneous
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> otherwise servers will have just more stress handling all the kills counted for nonskipping
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't have much of a performance impact at all, dw
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides it can't happen until we give ranks a reset, and people don't really want that, so don't expect it anytime soon ðŸ˜„
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i expected deleting the maps that arent ideal for that :kek:
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bye bye ddmax
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :troll:
01:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but tbh it can be done without deleting the ranks. you guys need to research the maps that has more interaction with killtiles and test it again
01:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> probably 50 maps maximum has interaction
01:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk how many maps we have now, but it's more then one can sort by hand nowadays
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ddmax doesnt count for this?
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> there are one or two maps that are still unfinishable
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but cant remember
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh actually, we can run it through teehistorian
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Find maps where killtile skips actually happened
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but anyways i wish that new interactive way set it out good
01:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but these are quite old maps, might not be able to find all the skips
01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> some of them arent even related to kill tiles but still unfinishable
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if i would have my computer with me, i would have sacrificed my sleeping time just to find related problems on every map possible
01:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :feelsbadman:
03:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZimE> is there a problem with "connect dummy"? somehow i can't connect my dummy
05:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nexusrf> @ZimE dont know if that has anything to do with the channel topic. servers slow atm try a couple times
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> hi , how can i show my own server information on my website ( players , ports , etc ) do you have any api for this ?
15:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you request info to the sv using udp packets
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> basically there is no api u just ask as if ur a client
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur using nodejs i got this lib https://www.npmjs.com/package/teeworlds-server-status
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we use it on uniqueclan.net
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Dont ask too many times since you would ddos your own server:kek:
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Just to throw this here, maybe it would be good to lower the amount of servers. So its easier to win the players on server lottery.
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> also would save cpu
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Hehe
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes, that's intentional
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teehistorian gets the information of each player each tick
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's called quite a lot of times as a result, not much of a cost though so doesnt really matter
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should pause empty servers worlds
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, it appeared in the benchmarks?
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you do, make sure it'll stay teehistorian compatible
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if you have kcachegrind you can take a look at the callgrind log i have on ger
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its at servers/callgrind.out.somepididontremember
