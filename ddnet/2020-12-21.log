02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i saw this by coincidence when i was moving  in google 👨‍💻
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://vimeo.com/32636199
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this amazing and weird because   this video before 9 years ago
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk why we still not have something like this
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :giftee_red: 
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and i remember i did suggest something like this but for hats and clothes
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 has something like this
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/790412095631392778/unknown.png
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we are still running 0.6
05:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> really?!
05:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis: 0.7 was bad for while and nobody moved to the new protocol.
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh yeah i remember
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we have now just beginning like 0.7 but we still 0.6 right?
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it still lacks some of the protocol events (like changing names) but they are "supposedly" working on it.
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have a compatibility layer for 0.7 on the serverside
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we have now just starting page like 0.7 but we still 0.6 right?
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ddnet client is 0.6 only
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this looks hard i not understand anything XD
05:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> basically you can't change names mid-game in 0.7
05:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so we can't still some things than teeworld 0.6 and puting in ddnet?
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so we can't steal some things than teeworld 0.6 and puting in ddnet?
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can, with some patch work, but at that point it would be better off just move to 0.7.
05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so what we wait?
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk what everybody thinks.
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I think we can wait.
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is perfectly playable. and we have skins downloads which is somewhat an alternative to 0.7's skin system.
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> other than that we miss nothing from 0.7 that would benefit ddrace.
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want hats and clothes
05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can't have those in 0.7 as well.
05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this looks easier than make hat santa for everyskin
05:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's true
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> still if we really want hat we can add a hat sprite and apply it to every skins. you don't need 0.7 protocol for that
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but everybody hated the mapres change before. i doubt we can pull the off without some outrage lol.
05:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but everybody hated the mapres change before. i doubt we can pull this off without some outrage lol.
05:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~also why am i here spitting opinions.~~
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 👍  don't stop your opinions make you looks pro
05:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why ?
05:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maps 0.6 not work in 0.7?
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> or what you mean
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want make like million a hat
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so add in every skin this like forever
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and we still need group for skins if we will make a lot more skins
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Some people doesn't like the forced Halloween themed map for a while.
05:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I'm still making some preparations to add possibility to choose hat that will be displayed on top of your tee. With restrictions to use some hats only if you have enough points for it
05:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> There is a problem btw, that's not all skins allows you to draw hat on them which will look normal
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yeah of course because some skins not normal(circle/tee) but this problem for makers this skins not for we if it is work with most skins this would be perfect
06:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @hussainx3 we have a ddnet database with skins. And we will also have such one for hats. So all the supported skins should be compatible with hats, otherwise some players would have to switch skin or play without a hat...
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i think anyone can copy paste for hat and get it free
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so for me this looks not work
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i was think about just putting million hats there (anyone make hat and putting it in ddnet like skins)
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Boring
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 🙂
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this will so tirdy for you and you not sure if this will be work or not and if the players will be use hats?
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and maybe example players see  hat 100 points more pretty than hat for 5000
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it is not boring
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i guess if you finish than this  will  be a lot players would be start make hats
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i guess if you finish than this  will  be there  a lot players would be start make hats
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and if this succeeded you can go for next level to clothes:heartw:
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> useless
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> fun
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and a lot people if he have more choices to choice player for himself (in all games) he is can take hour and more
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so if we can leave players take more time in game this, points for we  and not useless
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so if we can leave players take more time in game this, points for we  so not useless
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so if we can leave players take more time in game this point for we  so not useless
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> global leaderboard. barely ^^
09:31 <+ChillerDragon> @hussainx3 pls edit your messages a bit less in this channel. they get resend to the bridge and it gets a bit hard to follow the conversation :/
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikey.> i really like this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikey.> Talk about it MOOOORE
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> hmm on the server side i can do a m_Input.m_Direction = 1; but i cant do GetInput().m_Direction = 1;
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> CNetObj_PlayerInput GetInput() { return m_Input; };
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> it says error: using rvalue as lvalue
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> i dont get what is going on here
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it even tells you what's wrong 😛
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you are using an rvalue as an lvalue
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The call to GetInput returns m_Input by value, an rvalue to be specific. The LHS of the assignment operator needs to be an lvalue, thus your assignment is invalid
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀  if you return a "class" like that, does it just copy the class data into the stack.
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> many factors play into this. C++ really wants you to use value returns so it has many optimizations here
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it will avoid a copy (copy-elision) at all costs if possible 😄
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you don't store it at all, it shouldn't create a copy at all
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but like if you change it's member after return, it can't do anything but make a copy right?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can't change a member through an lvalue reference to an object 😛
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 i kinda get it but probably don't
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (strictly speaking I used the word "reference" wrongly there, it's more like a "label" I guess is the term the standard would refer to it)
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> does lvalue/rvalue thing has to do with whether CNetObj_PlayerInput is a class or a struct
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compiler can do copy elision even if copy has side effects 👀
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> doesn't seem like it
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> me brain dead
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think a value returned by a function is an rvalue
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A non reference return by a function is a prvalue
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> so i have to return a refrence when i want to change it?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is an rvalue type, thus can't appear on the left side of an assignment
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u also have to hold the reference in a variable probs
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok i think i get it now
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i see
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A function call whose return type is an lvalue reference can appear on the left side of an assignment as it's an lvalue
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> CNetObj_PlayerInput Input = GetInput(); Input.m_Direction = 1;
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> this way you put the rvalue into the stack but you don't change m_Input at all
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> but then this is a new object right?
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> ye
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rvalue lvalue glvalue xvalue prvalue
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would create a new `CNetObj_PlayerInput` (probably on the stack)
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :dankHug:
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so you need either a pointer or reference
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Input is an lvalue at that point
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 how the hell have I never run into this before
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> so i have to edit character.h to add an ``CNetObj_PlayerInput *GetInput();``
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This whole value type system allows a lot of optimizations
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Although i would probably never do GetInput().m_Direction because that sounds dumb with a Get in front of it
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon you might aswell return a reference not a pointer
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, something like `Input().m_Direction = 1` looks more sane
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> hmk
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> i never understood references thats why i stay away
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or even just SetInput(CNetObj_PlayerInput input)
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> make a copy and pass it back lol.
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> thats sounds hacky but i also thought about it actually xd
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 i would never pass a C++ interview like this
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie making a copy and setting it proooobably optimizes fine, but it sounds so wasteful 😛
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yeah, but although it does kinda make sense coming from high level oop lol
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but although, what is english
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but although furthermore moreover however, I don't like oop to begin with so it makes sense that sounds bad to me 🙂
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I'm still a typescript guy mind you.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't even know what kind of language ts is
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> typescript is the only acceptable form of javascript, good for you
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> js sucks so bad
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ts saved it
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> languages without type systems are just so goofy
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> every single one of them try to bolt on type systems now that they see it's an insane proposition to pass references to "thing" around and praying they are of the correct type
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well you can still "any" through the entire typescript
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust 🦀
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> rust and go seems cool.
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> never used em tho
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go can be learned in 1 day
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's why i haven't done it
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learnt*
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I need to get out of bed and have breakfast, I can stay here all day chatting about static typing but that's not very good for me 😛
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> good morning
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Ryozuki but Go has a garbage collector 😄
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love making cmd binaries with https://github.com/clap-rs/clap
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so packed
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> GC bad gang is here
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Comrade yeah xd
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my rust website after 5 days running, 15.5 mb only
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/790542582388097044/unknown.png
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no leaks :POGGIES:
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: tbh i really wish there's a typescript runtime that can optimize based on type. don't know if it is a factor tho.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I actually learnt typescript via lua. Because lua gave me a headache when i was making dota2 custom games.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> then i found this https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but Lua is so simple
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> everything is a table there
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 1 based index always threw me off. tstl does index +1 and -1 for you.
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is nutella and bread a healthy breakfast?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> no
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: am i allowed to ask what does deen do for daytime job.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he works at SAP  iirc
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> http://hookrace.net/blog
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making in memory databases
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> http://hookrace.net/blog/hana-cpp-development/
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cool
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> teeworlds always distract me from doing anything productive
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I lie to myself and say teeworlds is productive
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It lets me keep my sanity
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even code much in tw anymore
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i kinda does that too but sometimes it is a bit too much.
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I felt like teeworlds was a waste of time I might aswell just give up on doing anything at all since it's like the last thing that motivates me a bit
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 that sounds bad tbh
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, so I keep pretending it's productive
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> why should it be a waste of time
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I sometime have thoughts of taking advantage of chinese teeworlds community to have monetary gain. Tom always talks me out of it.
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> which give me better reasons to do something else. but i keep come back to teeworlds for the past few months.
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon no monetary gain, no education value. Thus no value, thus a waste of time
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its fun
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> so ur meanin of life is education and money?
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> mine is fun
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fun has value
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> so tw is literally the meaning of my life xd
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> fun doesn't put food on the table tho.👀
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't have fun if you make 8 euros an hour at a supermarket
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for that you work
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 well if i have a job i wouldn't blame myself for being unproductive lol
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> make ddnet pay2win then
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LCSG47 was trying to convince me to add microtransactions yesterday
12:51 <+ChillerDragon> or ask for donations to fund some food for Learath while he builds nice tw stuff
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i have other projects that i'm legally not allowed to monetize as well. it's like giving away your time for nothing.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 although teeworlds is the only one i still care about
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teeworlds has an odd charm to it
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The code just feels so familiar, I feel at home while coding tw
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we deserved it
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/790548077337509908/unknown.png
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPESXMas_Hacker:786228585975119875>
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> teeworlds also gave me a illusion of me being capable of making a game and selling it. which obviously isn't happening any time soon.
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i think the hats issue opened by the russian guy is a rly bad thing
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet shouldnt have locked content
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly good its so open
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: like why bother when ppl can just make a one-liner patch to bypass it
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hats I'm not sure about either, but a way to display your achiebement would be cute
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well achievements are not locked content
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> steam achiebement when
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> achievements can be tricky
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't read his issue. Is it hats 4 money?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't think tho
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so*
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> x points unlocks hats
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a nono
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, points are free
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> achievements require account system, right?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we are doing points without account just fine
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My red line is asking money for cosmetics
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a no no :P
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is no that bad considering it will just be a server feature like how you get points in mmotee or something
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but ddnet itself is more free than other mods maybe
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean like city mods or something
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> what about selling ddnet clients
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> add a pricetag on steam
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what about we kidnap ChillerDragon and sell for server cost.
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what's funny? This game is completely open source. If we actually get it popular a company can just take it, bolt on cosmetics and make bank :P
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie i offered multiple times to host servers ... 
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless they have experienced ddnet devs its hard to compete against ddnet itself imho
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be lot of resources and money
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that just for a community of 1k active players
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already have more than enough for servers thanks to generous donations from people including ChillerDragon :P
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> seems like outplayed my self there
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> xd
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean a freaking company would have resources and money to burn if they have vision for net gain.
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 thats why ddnet should be AGPL-3
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:hippo:788814558553964578>
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's peanuts to hire 2-3 devs and host servers
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> like companys bother
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They already have the infrastructure
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> blame teeworlds for not being GPL
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AGPL*
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> nobody would notice if some big ass company uses tw networking code to build a new game with different physics and graphics
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The purpose of the GNU Affero GPL is to prevent a problem that affects developers of free programs that are often used on servers.
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use AGPL for server stuff
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> who enforces these licenses tho @Ryozuki
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think big ass company would just take the idea and use their own netcode
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur lawyer
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> mine?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ this exactly
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> companies often fail due to greed vs open source projects
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like restrictive licenses just scare smol hobby devs
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chiller has a point there, most of these licenses have never been tried in court
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like nobody can stop me from making a simplified mobile ddnet game with rooms, accounts and stuff
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in my day life, open source projects tend to be higher quality
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> but nobody has a chance to fight big company
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> although i don't think it would be very popular tho
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would take a buttload of money even against a normal entity to litigate this, let alone a megacorp
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "restrictive" it ensures ur freedom and ur users freedom
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> restrictive for a random company to yoink it and use it
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wihtout giving back
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> if i dont want to publish the code of my first crappy mod it is restrictive
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open source is just a tool for companies to use without giving back
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think only gpl has been tested in courts before once
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> but i feel like they can still do that
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> if nobody finds out nobody can even go to court in the first place
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 @Learath2 have you finished your bread
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And that's only US courts, god knows how it would go in the EU
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u atleast have grounds to file a lawsuit
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bred gone
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/790550917765922826/20201221_130647.jpg
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> imagine fighting a open-source case in china.
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can always contact the https://www.eff.org/ to defend your rights
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or the FSF
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be trivial to fight it in china. Whoever donates more to the CCP wins
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we automatically lose, case over
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's sell ddnet to tencent actually
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so successful in china
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
13:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon "smol hobby devs"
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually we'll know immediately when some company decided to copy ddnet
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Open source projects are so odd. Like who even owns the source code to ddnet?
13:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u know that smoll hobby devs are actually retarded for using MIT thinking a company will use their software
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> even before they ever announce it
13:09 <+Ryozuki> and somehow they will get something
13:09 <+Ryozuki> they couldnt be more wrong
13:09 <+Ryozuki> smoll hobby devs should be the most interested in using gpl
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ddnet will for sure be blocked by the wall, if a company decided to make one themselves
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki that's a misconception. MIT or BSD literally says you want nothing in return
13:10 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 probs whoever represents ddnet, my bet is whoever owns ddnet.tw rn
13:10 <+Ryozuki> so deen
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah? China has laws protecting local companies too?
13:10 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 yeah but i read lot of forums and they use MIT for what i said
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Never going to sell, end of story
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nah, companies can report with much larger impact
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey proposed this a couple times, never got it past the supreme court
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like anyone needs us to sell, they can just make their own :P
13:11 <+Ryozuki> deen will u trademark ddracenetwork? is that even useful? xd
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDRaceNetwork Inc.
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its good to protect
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> against something
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hire me plz
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should get one of those evil looking skyscrapers
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and learath will be at the top
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with heinrich in the shadows
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CTO Learath2
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CEO deen
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be so nice to be at the top of an evil megacorp
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine having so much money the world feels communist. All the resources are at your disposal
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> communist lol
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bezos
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ_DyimkS54
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would laugh like this guy
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> truly evil
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no trademark required I think
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I owned a megacorp I think I would want to pay my employees a living wage. Which is one of the many reasons I would never own a megacorp :P
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the top CEOs always lack empathy
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and thats why they are ceos
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazon warehouses literally look like slave workshops. People pissing in bottles to avoid taking breaks is an insane proposition to me
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Our food delivery service have very strict policy for drivers too i think.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Recent research reveals CEOs are not very useful on the average. Ofc there are a couple very bright ones but most are apparently not very beneficial, especially given the salaries they get
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like anything less than a 5 star means a fine for them iirc.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China cranking things up to 11 again
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think the idea is that people won't rate unless it is bad. but it is kinda weird that your wages are ties to random ass factors
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and I definitely know people that nitpicking everything online.
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, gtg. I have 95 kanji to review and thermodynamics to read up on
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> gl
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe even finish up computer networking if the sudden extreme sleepiness leaves me alone today
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :gg:
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foWISJIoCSo&t
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Would it be possible to have a rank Command like $points
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> But for the rank

15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Ops
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why when i vote rnadom unfinished map i sometimes get harvest map which i already finished
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i havent finished all novice maps
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> nub
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby can't reproduce
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it depend on client version
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, server-side query
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the sql is really simple, so hard to see how it could go wrong
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it just hapened ask @Skeith
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> did, yea
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> SELECT Map FROM %s_maps AS maps WHERE Server = ? AND Map != ? AND Map NOT IN (SELECT Map FROM %s_race as race WHERE Name = ? ORDER BY %s LIMIT 1;
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you maybe call the vote with dummy? @noby
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that could be
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dnt remember
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> noboy
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Nooby is too high to vote correctly
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> did you try sleeping first before voting @noby xd
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Or not smoking em grass
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DarkOort> Ddnet crashes when I press keys shift + backspace when I rename a file name in the game
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DarkOort> Ddnet's Version : 15.2.4
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DarkOort> Window 10
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DarkOort> (Sorry if it's the wrong place to report bugs)
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> good place
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @DarkOort how to rename a file
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> With demos I can't reproduce
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I tried threading in rust for the first time and I have a question about channels. It seems like a common pattern to me to clone a mpsc::Sender in a loop and move each clone into it's own thread. But after the loop the original Sender that was returned by mpsc::channel() will still be alive in the main thread. I could drop() it explicitly or put it in a scope. But is there a more elegant solution?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 @Learath2
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess that's the way to do it. Found a reddit thread about that here https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/iavolt/okay_to_drop_original_mpscsender_when_creating/
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Explicitly calling drop() is much better than a opening a scope because the scope could look unnecessary to someone reading the code
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro explicit `mem::drop` is fine
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Do you know a rust lib to distribute tasks to a bunch of threads? If you know openmp I'm looking for something like the [guided](http://jakascorner.com/blog/2016/06/omp-for-scheduling.html#guided) scheduling strategy
