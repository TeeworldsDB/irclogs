01:35 < o_be_one> V3R
01:35 < o_be_one> that was funny to play with them ^^
01:36 <@deen> vali: hey, you're going?
01:36 < vali> sure
01:36 <@deen> vali: I'll stop saying it's you who's attacking. ok?

01:38 <@deen> vali: just calm down. i won't say anything and we all live in peace instead (or sth like that)
01:38 < vali> haha
01:38 < o_be_one> vali, racism, awesome.
01:38 < vali> ye o_be_one 
01:39 < o_be_one> but i dont know, tell me who is annoying other ? oh yeah its you ! ^^ :)
01:39 < o_be_one> vortunatly, you are not representative ov your country vlag.
01:40 < o_be_one> (hope youll understand)
01:51 <@deen> eeeee: for what time did you pay for the aws ec2 server?
01:51 < vali> bb my boyvriend o_be_one
01:51 <@deen> good night, vali
01:51 <@deen> just think about my words
01:52 < vali> deen not really, i will stalk u !!!!!!
01:52 <@deen> no need to stalk me, my info is all public
01:52 < vali> xD
01:52 <@deen> and i'm not planning to hide it
01:53 < eeeee> deen: there is no fixed time, i'm just paying per minute
01:53 <@deen> eeeee: maybe we should shut it down?
01:53 <@deen> thanks for offering it
01:53 <@deen> but it didn't really seem to help much
01:53 <@deen> it lagged a lot during attacks as well
01:53 <@deen> and ping 150 for many european players
01:54 < eeeee> ping 150 like always or during the attacks?
01:54 <@deen> good question
01:54 <@deen> i think it went up at some point, but not sure if it was during the attack
01:54  * vali slaps Virus2k around a bit with a large fishbot
01:55  * vali slaps Virus2k around a bit with a large fishbot
01:55  * vali slaps Virus2k around a bit with a large fishbot
01:55 < Virus2k> ?
01:55 < vali> nur ma so, haste verdient
01:55 < Virus2k> xD
01:55  * Virus2k slaps vali around a bit with a large fishbot
01:55 < eeeee> if server is playable when not under an attack then we could still try some things
01:55 < eeeee> i'd rather not discuss it here though
01:55 < Forris> please speak english
01:55 < eeeee> and yeah for now i can suspend it
01:55 < vali> Virus2k:  willst du mit mir ein vechtel duell machen?
01:56 < vali> Virus2k:  ich würds nich drauv anlegen
01:56 <@deen> eeeee: ping is always pretty high
01:56 < vali> Virus2k:  valls du weist was ich meine
01:56 <@deen> and I'm mainly looking for a server that can withstand ddos attacks =/
01:56 < Welf> Firus2k
01:56 < eeeee> yeah nothing can be done about ping
01:56 < Virus2k> bitte was xd
01:56 < vali> Welf:  der witz is unlustig
01:56 < eeeee> but we could figure sth against the attacks
01:56 < Welf> nein das ist ein laufender Witz
01:58 <@deen> eeeee: i wish we could figure sth out agains the attacks on a server located in germany
01:58 < vali> so
01:58 <@deen> i don't even want to run FRA, it's just backup for GER
01:58 < vali> fick dich
01:58 < vali> Welf: 
01:58 < Welf> yes?
01:58 < vali> besser?
01:58 < eeeee> yeah understandable
01:58 < Welf> yes
01:58 < vali> hab jetzt meine andere Tastatur geholt#
01:58 < vali> damit ihr alle zufrieden seid
01:59 < Ama> vali also hast du ein f kopiert ?
01:59 < eeeee> deen: so should i turn off the server now?
01:59 <@deen> eeeee: yes
01:59 < vali> nope
01:59 < vali> externe tastatur angeschlossen
01:59 < Nimda> DDNet IRL went down!
02:00 < vali> ich mag die aber nich so weil das ne osu tastatur ist
02:02 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
02:03 < Nimda> Server was removed : DDNet IRL!
02:04 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
02:35 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
02:37 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
02:43 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
02:44 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
03:25 < o_be_one> i was true !
03:26 < o_be_one> xrothx servers got ddosed :)
03:26 < o_be_one> now it could not be vali i think :/
03:39 < o_be_one> well guys
05:01 <@deen> if teeworlds used tcp we could easily protect with sth like this: https://www.vpsflare.com/proxy.php
05:02 <@deen> vpsflare looks interesting
05:02 <@deen> part of the cloudflare network
05:02 <@deen> just don't know how well they work for udp games
05:03 <@deen> 25 $ thing here: https://www.vpsflare.com/linuxvps.php
05:04 <@deen> the website seems to be pretty disfunctional thouh
05:11 < o_be_one> its maybe ovh host :/
05:11 <@deen> no, cloudflare host
05:11 <@deen> but they seem to advertise that they have good protection for tcp stuff
05:12 <@deen> i'm a bit worried that htey would just think all udp traffic is part of the ddos
05:21 < eeeee> we can email them and ask i guess
05:21 < eeeee> want me to do that?
05:21 <@deen> sure, would be nice
05:21 < eeeee> k
05:28 < eeeee> asked them how to make udp service available when botnet spams same port, let's see what they can offer
05:28 <@deen> great
05:28 <@deen> thank you
05:29 <@deen> and good night/morning
08:17 <@EastByte> deen: if tw used tcp :)
08:24  * EastByte is going to school
10:10 < ochristi> I just tried to compile the latest client w/ mingw, any ideas why the new json stuff might error out? (for example: in function 'json_object_get' ... json.h:192: multiple definition of 'json_object_get')
10:10 < ochristi> that happens while linking the client btw
11:12 <@deen> that's weird
11:12 <@deen> no idea
11:20 <@EastByte> hm this problem again
11:21 <@deen> good morning, EastByte_school 
11:21 <@EastByte_school> morning
11:22 < pause> EastByte_school: hello
11:23 <@EastByte_school> afk
12:17 < _KinG> hi all
12:17 <@deen> hi
12:18 < _KinG> deen:  attacks stopped or going on?!
12:19 <@deen> so far stopped, but it's early in germany
12:19 <@deen> we will see if we stay all day without attacks
12:19 < _KinG> ho
12:19 < _KinG> oh
12:20 <@deen> you don't pay for traffic, right?
12:20 <@deen> because i remember traffic is pretty expensive in iran
12:20 < _KinG> no it's unlimited
12:20 <@deen> great
12:21 <@deen> i don't know what else dot is running on the server, i hope it wasn't too bad that it was unreachable yesterday =/
12:22 < _KinG> dot were nearly crying he couldn't totaly understand how do they attack 20Gb
12:22 <@deen> the guy has access to a botnet with 100 gbit/s i heard
12:22 <@deen> but now i think we scared him a bit, so we should just leave him alone for now and see if he stops
12:23 < _KinG> well
12:23 < _KinG> dot was scared too :)) the other servers went down for some secs :))
12:26 < _KinG> deen:  do you have some free time to run a server with password for me to test my maps?
12:26 <@deen> xxlddrace?
12:26 < _KinG> no
12:26 <@deen> PM me the pw
12:26 < _KinG> ddrace
12:58 < Nimda> Black & Red by Kenji just released on brutal at 2014-10-08 12:56
13:13 <@EastByte_school> deen: maybe we should remove all the cpp stuff from json-parser
13:13 <@EastByte_school> it also uses extern "C" {}
13:15 <@deen> EastByte_school: hm, you can try. i dont't know if that's it
13:15 <@deen> i just checked and on GER about half the players use ddnet client
13:15 <@deen> even fewer use most recent version^^
13:15 <@EastByte_school> hmm....
13:15 <@EastByte_school> afk
13:16 <@deen> well, just asked someone to update his client
13:16 <@deen> he has mac, no autoupdater for that^^
13:18 < Java_> Yo
13:20 <@deen> hi
13:22 < laxadedi> Java_: auth so I invite you
13:23 < laxadedi> deen: you are already invited, but I think you didn't noticed
13:24 < Java_> Java_, auth where? I told you guys yesterday that I am very rarely on irc. 
13:24 <@deen> Java_: the private investigators' channel
13:24 < Java_> Can someone explain to me how this works?
13:25 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
13:26 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
13:31 < laxadedi> heinrich5991: doesn't work, invite please :p
13:31 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: you need to reauth
13:31 < laxadedi> wtf
13:32 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: or you can ask q to invite yourself
13:32 < laxadedi> I am already authed, ok
13:32 <@heinrich5991> ./msg q invite <chan>
13:38 <@deen> 13:31 <@deen> eeeee had a funny idea for how to survive ddos attacks
13:38 <@deen> 13:33 <@deen> we could get 1 proper dedicated server without ddos protection
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> and then get 5 cheap virtual servers with real ddos protection
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> the client needs to be modified to send packets to all 5 servers
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> and they forward to the real server
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> whichever goes through first is used by the real server
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> so we're lag resistant
13:38 <@deen> 13:34 <@deen> and all 5 servers have to be downed by ddos
13:38 <@deen> 13:35 <@deen> the real, dedicated server, needs to be special, because it needs 
13:38 <@deen>               to spoof ips
13:38 <@deen> 13:35 <@laxadedi> so, if I understand correctly, you'll use the vps as reverse 
13:38 <@deen>                   proxy right ?
13:38 <@deen> 13:35 <@deen> it sends the packets back from spoofed ips of the 5 servers
13:38 <@deen> 13:35 <@deen> well, a bit more complicated as you see
13:38 <@deen> 13:35 <@deen> if the real server responds back directly via spoofed ip we don't 
13:38 <@deen>               have so much ping penalty for doing this
13:38 <@deen> 13:36 <@deen> i don't think we should do this, but it's a really clever solution
13:38 <@deen> 13:36 <@laxadedi> I think things are going to resolve themself soon, or I least 
13:38 <@deen>                   I hope so
13:38 <@deen> 13:36 <@deen> could get a ddos protected vps @ ovh, vpsflare and so on and use 
13:38 <@deen>               them all together
13:38 <@deen> 13:37 <@deen> laxadedi: i don't know, we've had big ddos problems for nearly 3 
13:38 <@deen>               months now
13:38 <@deen> 13:37 <@deen> since the birthday tournaments
13:38 <@deen> 13:37 <@deen> when we gave out money to the winners and had our first livestream
13:40 <@deen> 13:39 <@o_be_one> really deen ?
13:40 <@deen> 13:40 <@o_be_one> its like link all servers togethers
13:40 <@deen> 13:40 <@o_be_one> thats seems to be like irc, a little
13:40 <@deen> I don't think it's like irc
13:40 <@deen> the servers would all be used at the same time
13:41 <@deen> as backups in case one gets downed
13:42 < _KinG> deen:  i extracted the map there but there is no map when i do map_change in server
13:43 < o_be_one> i want to see this :) !
13:44 < o_be_one> eeeee, you are crazy x)
13:49 < _KinG> deen:  helloooo
13:56 <@EastByte_school> deen: that was exactly my idea all the time
13:57 <@EastByte_school> btw. vanilla support is possible
14:01 <@EastByte_school> will be a little bit different though
14:07 < pause> (copied from #ddnet) deen: This solution is clever, but it'll require some engineering, and will increase the traffic on the final server
14:07 < pause> Also, latency
14:13 <@deen> yes
14:13 < laxadedi> Yeah, increased latency sux, unless all servers are in same data center
14:14 <@EastByte_school> same datacenter is a must I guess
14:15 <@deen> but then they can just ddos enough to get the datacenter down
14:15 <@deen> i think if you stay in germany you can keep the additional latency around 2ms
14:15 <@EastByte_school> you don't want to take down a datacenter just for teeworlds :D
14:15 <@EastByte_school> (except vali)
14:15 < BeaR> \o/
14:28 <@deen> well, he could down GER datacenter
14:28 <@deen> and i think chile and persian datacenters really suffered because of him
14:36 <@EastByte_school> I wonder how big the available bandwidth to chile is
14:36 <@deen> to europe, very low
14:36 <@deen> maybe you can find out on rackeo.cl
14:37 <@EastByte_school> so vali might even cause internet providers to stop peering
14:38  * EastByte_school is driving home
14:50 < o_be_one> im back :)
14:51 < o_be_one> i hate to see akk server getting played.
14:51 < o_be_one> stollen and edited map (author name changed), ddosing other servers to get players, etc. tsss
14:54 < BeaR> deen: I'm currently playing with idea of adding ingame sound support (map) for ddnet. You would be interested ?
14:54 <@deen> BeaR: interested personally or for ddnet?
14:54 < BeaR> for ddnet
14:54 <@deen> because personally i don't use sound in teeworlds
14:54 < BeaR> oh :D
14:55 <@deen> I'm not sure
14:55 <@deen> most people can't make good sounds so we would get lots of annoying sounds in maps
14:55 <@deen> and only people with ddnet client hear them
14:55 <@deen> but for a scary halloween map it might be nice :P
14:56 < BeaR> true, hard to get good sound artists ^^
14:59 <@heinrich5991> it might also be dangerous to give mappers access to sound
14:59 <@heinrich5991> think shock maps etc.
15:00 <@deen> well, we have shock graphics already
15:00 <@heinrich5991> so it doesn't matter anymore for sound?
15:00 <@deen> like Cavings I where it gets darker all the time until at the end, everything is suddenly white and your eyes die
15:01 < o_be_one> BeaR, serious :D ?
15:01 <@deen> nono, still matters
15:01 < o_be_one> you here :o
15:01 < BeaR> as ddnet has some sort of QA, it shouldn't be such a big problem :d
15:02 <@heinrich5991> [15:00:39] <@deen> like Cavings I where it gets darker all the time until at the end, everything is suddenly white and your eyes die
15:02 < BeaR> o_be_one: official repository developement goes so slow :D
15:02 < o_be_one> ^
15:02 < o_be_one> ^^
15:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #55: Editor: Add feature to zoom to mouse position (DDRace64...pr_smooth_line) http://git.io/DEDkhQ

15:05 < BeaR> Deactivated it, so people doesn't get confused :D
15:06 <@deen> Hmmm
15:06 < BeaR> but prefer this mode
15:06 <@deen> but it's useful
15:06 < BeaR> yes
15:06 <@deen> i'll just set it to 1
15:06 < BeaR> should be notification at the next release on the website
15:06 <@deen> yes, i always have to write up release logs

15:35 <@deen> hi CookieMichal 
15:35 < CookieMichal> Hey! 
15:36 < o_be_one> some players seems to doesnt want to play on akk :/ they are on my serv oO
15:36 < CookieMichal> I need help with teeworlds gfx
15:36 <@deen> dilate
15:36 < BeaR> xd
15:36 < CookieMichal> How can I set color depth to 32? 
15:36 < CookieMichal> There's only way to set 16 or 24
15:36 <@deen> no idea
15:37 < CookieMichal> Also... Can I set refresh rate? like 1440x900 60Hz or 72Hz etc.
15:37 <@deen> that should be done by your graphics driver
15:37 <@deen> there is gfx_refresh_rate but i don't think it does anythign
15:38 < CookieMichal> Ok, I'll try
15:41 < BeaR> CookieMichal: 24bit == true color
15:42 <@deen> ah yeah
15:42 <@deen> 32bit is for transparency
15:44 < CookieMichal> : /
15:45 < BeaR> ?
15:45 < CookieMichal> my gpu driver has only settings for 32 bit ;-;
15:45 < BeaR> 24bit for rgb and 8bit for the alpha channel, it's fine
15:48 < BeaR> well, teeworlds doesn't care about it anyway as far as i can see xd
15:48 < CookieMichal> I can 
15:49 < CookieMichal> I need to find proper settings for my uber-pnp monitor ;-;
15:49 < BeaR> Teeworlds uses the color depth of the display no matter which value you set
15:53 < o_be_one> Java_, ?
15:53 < Java_> o_be_one, yes?
15:54 < o_be_one> come Java_ on priv channel
15:54 < o_be_one> just invited you
15:57 < CookieMichal> my monitor used to work with refresh rate set to 72Hz, now it needs 75Hz o.0
16:32 < Savander> Hi
16:32 <@deen> hi Savander 
16:36 < pause> Hello
16:40 <@EastByte_school> deen: ger serverlist refresh is really slow
16:40 <@EastByte_school> \
16:40 <@deen> not for me

17:58 <@deen> normal player numbers again!
18:01 < o_be_one> yeah B)
18:01 < o_be_one> so vali stops ?
18:01 < o_be_one> he doesnt come today :o
18:01 <@deen> so far no attacks
18:01 <@heinrich5991> for now
18:01 <@heinrich5991> advice: don't be too hapy
18:01 < o_be_one> sure
18:03 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: haha too late
18:03 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: ?
18:04 <@EastByte> I already catched me thinking about it's over now :P
18:05 <@heinrich5991> to reduce your happiness even further, let me tell you it's "caught" :P
18:06 <@EastByte> thanks for correcting me, makes me even more happy =)
18:06 <@EastByte> eeeee: I wanna talk about the multiple ips per server idea
18:07 <@EastByte> we could horribly abuse the tw masters
18:07 <@deen> EastByte: planning to get us banned from the masterservers?
18:09 <@EastByte> maybe, depends on how minus sees it
18:10 <@EastByte> following example:
18:10 <@EastByte> forwarding multiple ips+port to a single tw server
18:10 <@EastByte> register all ips at the tw master server
18:10 <@EastByte> and let only one responde at each time a client requests
18:10 <@EastByte> depending on the client's src ip
18:11 <@EastByte> so every client connects over a different ip
18:11 <@deen> that's a problem when one of them gets ddosed, no?
18:12 <@EastByte> if it forwards the attack aswell, yes?
18:12 <@EastByte> otherwise no
18:12 <@deen> i mean because then the packets from one of the servers don't go through anymore
18:13 <@deen> so some ips won't see the server
18:13 <@EastByte> yea sure
18:13 <@EastByte> the ips, the less the possibility to make the server unplayable
18:13 <@EastByte> the more ips*, 
18:14 < laxa> Anyone knows what's the use of reverse proxy in webhosting ?
18:15 <@EastByte> laxa: hide ip and prevend dos
18:15 < laxa> you don't prevent anything if the proxy dies
18:15 <@EastByte> yes
18:15 <@EastByte> but theree can be multiple reverse proxies
18:15 < laxa> hum
18:15 < laxa> k
18:16 < laxa> cause today I did that
18:16 < laxa> nginx on a master server to reverse proxy 2 websites
18:16 <@EastByte> deen: it was just my idea to make eeeee's idea working in vanilla
18:16 <@deen> EastByte: ah
18:17 <@EastByte> and ddnet client users can use the ddnet tab for that
18:17 <@EastByte> we can assign multiple ips to a server in it
18:17 <@deen> EastByte: i think the proxy servers should just forward the request and the main server responds with a spoofed ip of one proxy that currently works (fastest one probably)
18:18 <@EastByte> I don't see how you can affect the delay there
18:18 <@EastByte> oh wait
18:18 <@EastByte> okay then I misunderstoof his idea
18:19 <@EastByte> misunderstood*
18:19 <@EastByte> but why would any hoster allow ip spoofing like that?
18:19 <@heinrich5991> some hosters don't work against it
18:19 <@EastByte> unfortunatly
18:19 <@EastByte> but isn't it illegal in some way?
18:20 <@deen> not if you own the other ips i guess
18:20 <@EastByte> hmm
18:20 <@deen> or if you just use it for testing on your own servers
18:20 <@deen> and illegal in what country anyway?
18:21 <@EastByte> so the packets from proxy to server might be slower then vice versa?
18:21 <@EastByte> in his idea
18:22 <@deen> don't understand
18:22 <@EastByte> client > proxy -> server
18:22 <@EastByte> server > client
18:22 <@deen> i don't know, just a possibility
18:23 <@EastByte> you can spoof the ip of the proxy but you can't receive his packets directly
18:23 <@deen> would be faster if the proxy isn't ideally located
18:23 <@EastByte> just forward from proxy
18:23 <@deen> yeah
18:25 <@EastByte> hm I think I will ask proplay whether I'm allowed to spoof ip of vps1 from vps2
18:25 <@EastByte> might be interesting
18:26 <@deen> i know i could do that at datafabrik^^
18:26 <@deen> i accidentally did once
18:26 <@EastByte> haha
18:26 <@deen> afk
19:34 < eeeee> EastByte: i don't think masters would mind your solution, however the problem is that the attackers can down each vps for like ten seconds in concession and so pretty much empty the server in one minute
19:35 < eeeee> also do you really feel comfortable discussing even hypothetical countermeasures in such a public channel?
19:36 < eeeee> security through obscurity might not be the most effective but we're not really in position to be picky here
19:37 <@EastByte> so you think trying to hide countermeasures is a good idea?
19:37 <@EastByte> "they" will find out anyway
19:37 < eeeee> well at least we shouldn't hand over the blueprints on a silver plate to the attackers who might happen to linger here
19:38 <@EastByte> the solution has to be strong enough so the affort for taking it down is not worth it
19:38 < eeeee> yeah but you're reducing the 
19:38 < eeeee> yeah but you're reducing the "worth" component
19:38 < eeeee> by removing the "figuring out what is this even" part
19:41 <@EastByte> you sound like those guys trying to keep security algorythms closed source being sure about it no one will crack it^^
19:41 <@EastByte> I rather would publish my work so other can hack on it
19:42 < eeeee> well but this is different from encryption
19:42 <@EastByte> okay
19:42 < eeeee> unlike encryption algo designers we already know our solution is flawed
19:42 <@EastByte> it depends on what servers we use
19:43 < eeeee> it just makes it a little bit harder to ddos
19:43 <@EastByte> it's much more efficient two have a hundred of small servers instead of a single strong one
19:43 <@EastByte> yep
19:43 < eeeee> yeah sure, but know what's even more efficient?
19:43 <@EastByte> fight distrbuted attacks with distributed servers
19:44 < eeeee> having a hundred small servers and a clueless attacker who has no idea what's going on
19:45 <@EastByte> I think that's like a pre state which won't last long
19:45 <@EastByte> but it's better yes
19:45 < eeeee> imo it would make them waste a lot of effort and make more likely to just give up
19:46 < eeeee> in any case if they find a way to defeat our system eventually, this would delay that moment
19:47 < eeeee> and don't get me wrong, i'm not saying we should design a less resilient system because we rely on obscurity
19:47 < eeeee> we should just do our best on all fronts
19:48 <@EastByte> sure
19:51 < laxa> !en-de beautifull
19:51 < Nimda> Translation: beautifull
19:51 <@deen> -l
19:51 < laxa> !fr-de belle
19:51 < Nimda> Translation: Schöne
19:51 <@EastByte> laxa: srsly
19:51 < laxa> EastByte: ?
19:52 <@EastByte> nvm :D
20:11 <@deen> and here we go, GER getting ddosed
20:12 <@EastByte> hm
20:12 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
20:13 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
20:15 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
20:17 < diinss> hi
20:18 <@deen> hi
20:18 < diinss> schmeckt der ddos?
20:18 <@deen> nope. are you attacking?
20:18 < diinss> why would you ask
20:18 <@deen> because you just come here and ask about how we like the attack
20:19 < diinss> hmm
20:19 < diinss> i think... it tastes good, that ddos
20:19 < Ama> you are nothing special really
20:20 < Ama> we have enough ddosers 
20:20 < Ama> you are just 1 more
20:20 <@EastByte> I don't think he wants to imply he is ddosing
20:21 < Ama> he wouldnt come and say something like that probably 
20:21 < diinss> lol
20:21 < diinss> okay
20:21 < Ama> with the question does the ddos taste good ? XD
20:21 < diinss> deen
20:21 < diinss> someday
20:22 < diinss> you will close and stop hosting ddnet servers :) i wont give up until you stop it 
20:22 <@deen> diinss: why?
20:22 <@deen> hey
20:22 <@deen> i actually wanted to know the reason
20:22 < Ama> it was some troll 
20:22 < Ama> nobody is that retardd
20:24 < bye_ddnet> stop banning me brah
20:24 <@EastByte> here we go
20:24 <@deen> His ingame name is BlackLine
20:25 <@deen> bye_ddnet: for what reason?
20:25 < bye_ddnet> u rlly think im ddosing? :D
20:25 <@deen> and since when are you ddosing?
20:25 < bye_ddnet> im a 15 years old kid how should i?
20:26 < Ama> i told you he is retarded
20:26 < bye_ddnet> :o
20:31 <+o_be_one> i dont understand why someone want to stop ddnet
20:31 <+o_be_one> its like if ddnet was a very bad thing, like candis was ...
20:31 <@deen> he just looks like a novice player who's probably trolling now: http://ddnet.tw/players/BlackLine/
20:31 <@heinrich5991> because they have a server that they want to see fuller maybe?
20:31 <@EastByte> but he switched his ip to a different provider
20:32 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
20:32 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
20:33 <+Ama> ddos save blocker server ?
20:33 <+Ama> someone called his server htat
20:33 <@deen> whose server?
20:33 <+Ama> dont know
20:33 <@deen> ah yeah, i've seen them too
20:33 <+o_be_one> lol you need to dev somethign to detect ddos and save position of tees before timeout x)
20:34 <+o_be_one> like last position before timeout, and restore when the tee is back :D
20:34 <+o_be_one> would be AWESOME, sure ^^
20:35 <@deen> y
20:35 <@deen> we have something for that
20:35 <@deen> timeout protection
20:35 <@deen> but it doesn't know when a ddos is happening
20:35 <@deen> and only works for 15 minutes
20:36 <@deen> but could be set to more
20:36 <+o_be_one> :(
20:39 <@heinrich5991> Bailey: Chrotac: you can talk now
20:39 <+Chrotac> thank you
20:39 <+Chrotac> are the servers still getting ddosed?
20:40 <@heinrich5991> not sure
20:40 <@heinrich5991> if you experience problems on one server, try one from a different region
20:40 <@deen> Chrotac: yes
20:41 <@deen> Chrotac: GER is down for now, FRA still under attack, but should be playable
20:41 <+Chrotac> please
20:41 <+Chrotac> dont stop with ddnetwork
20:41 <+Chrotac> just because of the ddos
20:41 <@heinrich5991> deen will try his best
20:41 <@deen> we're trying, Chrotac 
20:43 <+o_be_one> ahah we cant stop anything cause of ddos
20:43 <+o_be_one> never give up against stupid guys !
20:45 <+Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
20:47 <+laxa> !lockdown
20:47 <+Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !lockdown.
20:47 <+laxa> !help lockdown
20:47 <+Nimda> Locks down the channel by setting the moderated flag and voicing all known users. New users are asked to reply with a text to get voice. Type the command again to revert channel lockdown. Useful for bot invasions.
20:48 <+laxa> heinrich5991: op Nimda and use it next time :)
20:48 <@heinrich5991> this isn't a bot invasion though
20:48 <+laxa> but it does the same thing as you
20:48 <+laxa> except the bot can voice anyone that come if he answers a question
20:49 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't give an arbitrary waiting period between joining and talking
20:49 <+laxa> Hum yeah :(.
20:49 <@heinrich5991> yes. but I don't want the annoying guys to come back too often
20:49 <@heinrich5991> so I don't voice everyone immediately
