11:15 <@deen> Either someone's client broke or they were bored. 1 guy downloaded a map 50.000 times 2 days ago
11:17 <@EastByte> maybe some broken map dl bot
11:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: what was their name?
11:34 <@heinrich5991> if it was "downloader", then my map downloader is broken
11:35 <@heinrich5991> ok, not my map downloader, there was no run two days ago
12:59 <@deen> heinrich5991: name? i mean on our https map download server
13:38 <@deen> I got a few emails about server getting unusual network load and when I checked today I saw Divided.map downloaded 50.000 times
18:44 <+o_be_one> on ger 92.151:8341 when 100% yes vote (or more than 50%) the map wont change
18:44 <+o_be_one> ive checked the sv_vote_yes_percentage its 50 :/
18:44 <+o_be_one> any idea EastByte ?
18:46 <@EastByte> does it say vote passed?
18:48 <+o_be_one> no, failed
18:49 <@EastByte> maybe someone used his veto to cancel the vote
18:49 <@EastByte> or a moderator did it
18:51 <@EastByte> as long as there are players actively playing on that map, you'll have to change the server in order to play a different map
18:52 <+o_be_one> its didnt told about veto
18:52 <+o_be_one> we were all at the end, finished map :/
19:00 <@EastByte> That's weird
19:01 <+o_be_one> yes maybe an other config
