05:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why i can't access TuningList() in my DDrace.cpp ? i added this line but still not working 
05:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
05:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> #include <game/server/entity.h>
05:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
05:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why there is 3 TuningList()  ? :justatest:
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CTuningParams *m_pTuningList;
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CTuningParams *TuningList() { return m_pTuningList; }
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CTuningParams *TuningList() { return &m_aTuningList[0]; }
06:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
06:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think i better of accessing the Core()
06:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is deen write the tuning ?
06:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tuning is quite old, from teeworlds
06:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> really, is it from teeworlds ?
06:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> really, is it from teeworlds ?
06:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> maybe cus im new in programing thinking this way, but the tuning system feels so chaotic
06:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> never mind i forgot to access it with GameServer()

11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna go for the llvm talks
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can convince my company :d but i doubt
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> Ya
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> innit
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> weird we dont have any brit here
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah chiller is right.
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddcon must be in spain with good weather
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> germany sucks
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> in catalonia
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> when ddcon tho
12:24 < bridge> <zwelf2> if you come to FOSDEM in brussels, we can have a small ddcon there ^^
12:26 < bridge> <zwelf2> The phone number is reachable from outside during the conference from +494057308308303 😄
12:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> we don't have christmas here
12:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but how can i make the hook to the players longer without messing the prediction ?
12:31 < bridge> <avolicious> I was in brussels recently 😦
12:42 < bridge> <zwelf2> Happy to meet you too in Brussels ^^ if you can come. I might give a lightning talk about DDNet/twgame there depending on it getting approved.
13:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my best guess is to make a bunch of "tune_zone" on my map and constantly change m_tunezone in character.h
13:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the whole purpose of it is to making upgrade system for player's hook
13:16 < ChillerDragon> can i call +494057308308303 and ask for my ddnet points from my alt account Cans to be merged into my main name ChillerDragon? :)
13:17 < ChillerDragon> "ello ddnet customer support here! How can I help you?"
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> alo
13:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can i call if someone block me on multeasymap :justatest:
13:30 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki lez go play simpledown till finish in team today then do /save and load it on tourney and make ez 100 bucks ok?
13:31 < ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yes u can
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks today is thursday vulkan
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> or was it for c++
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
15:19 < bridge> <cipy29> money glitch 😮
15:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i set a character to a specific tunezone ?
15:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i set the m_TuneZone in character.cpp but nothing happened
15:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> help
16:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> for example ```cpp
16:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pChar->m_TuneZone = 23;
16:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```

17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > What's in 1.75.0 stable
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > async fn and return-position impl Trait in traits
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > As announced last week, Rust 1.75 supports use of async fn and -> impl Trait in traits. However, this initial release comes with some limitations that are described in the announcement post.
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It's expected that these limitations will be lifted in future releases.
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Pointer byte offset APIs
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Raw pointers (*const T and *mut T) used to primarily support operations operating in units of T. For example, <*const T>::add(1) would add size_of::<T>() bytes to the pointer's address. In some cases, working with byte offsets is more convenient, and these new APIs avoid requiring callers to cast to *const u8/*mut u8 first.

17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The Rust compiler continues to get faster, with this release including the application of BOLT to our binary releases, bringing a 2% mean wall time improvements on our benchmarks. This tool optimizes the layout of the librustc_driver.so library containing most of the rustc code, allowing for better cache utilization.
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > We are also now building rustc with -Ccodegen-units=1, which provides more opportunity for optimizations in LLVM. This optimization brought a separate 1.5% wall time mean win to our benchmarks.
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In this release these optimizations are limited to x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu compilers, but we expect to expand that over time to include more platforms.

20:03 < ChillerDragon> sos english
20:03 < ChillerDragon> is it "a javascript error" or "an javascript error" ?
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is why go looks so bad
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but best is probs user pointer
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and when the user is null fill the error ofc
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its awesome cuz u have 0 type safety here!
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> talking about rust is not using it
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but true
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can use rust playground
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> would that count
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hard to say xd

21:33 < bridge> <paradise> is it possible to recover demo file if it says error scanning demo file
21:34 < bridge> <paradise> is it possible to recover demo file if it says error scanning demo file, it seems to be fine but doesnt work for some reason
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> At most you could cut the demo until the point where it's broken, using an older client version that didn't have so strict demo checks yet.
21:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Assuming the demo is playable and doesn't crash the old client
21:38 < bridge> <paradise> i heard newer client demos doesnt work on older ones
21:39 < bridge> <robyt3> The demo format hasn't changed recently so that shouldn't be an issue
21:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Try playing the demo with 17.3
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> How did you create the broken demo (manual, auto, race, replay)? Did you finish recording normally or did your client crash or did anything else happen that could explain why it broke?
21:42 < bridge> <paradise> its just finish race and I don't think anything happened, but it was back to back demos
21:42 < bridge> <paradise> its just finish race and I don't think anything happened, but it was back to back demos on same day

23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i want to bring my croc
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i would like to go to ccc but there are a few big things standing in the way
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> :owo:
23:47 < bridge> <zwelf2> yeah, pretty hard to get a croc on the plane
23:47 < bridge> <Ewan> true
23:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if i could bring my dog
23:52 < bridge> <zwelf2> I think travelling with pets is rather troublesome most of the times, but might be possible.
23:52 < bridge> <zwelf2> I did't see any dogs on the conference, so maybe they aren't allowed. Not sure.
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> unfortunately i am joking
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the croc is the smallest of my problems
