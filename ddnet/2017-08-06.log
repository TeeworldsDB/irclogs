00:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no one should have monopoly in that subject
00:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's stupid. Steam shouldn't be the only platform
00:01 <+Edible> it isnt
00:01 <+Edible> and it wont be if you have to pay to distribute
00:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because, they can dictate the prcies
00:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know
00:04 <+Edible> at the end of the day, steam is just a really pretty package manager with belts and whistles
00:04 <+eeeee> 100 usd is more of just a spam filter though. it's just a one time payment, right?
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for every single title
00:05 <+Edible> yeah, but what about open source and free games? who's gonna cash that dough for em?
00:05 <+Edible> especially games that need that money for development
00:05 <+eeeee> not that i'm using steam but i think those bells and whistles have their value too, there seems to be a lot of social activity around gaming on steam
00:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but if I understand, they will return it after you reach 1000$
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it doesn't matter if it is open source, or free i guess
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> They did it, because of all of that crap which were for a long time.
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, bad games. Not finished games, etc
00:07 <+Edible> how can they return money for free games?
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> WHy you asking me?
00:07 <+Edible> idk
