00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make a pr so we don't forget? not at computer atm
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder tho if it can break stuff, bcs assets reload and skin reload also change the actual pointers
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Fireball u want to fix? or should i
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> > @Fireball u want to fix? or should i
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> @Jupstar ✪ sorry, I don't have context on this - I've only worked on the maplayers.cpp today.
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> np, u found that annoying bug, thats already nice 😄
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro i always see the git integration but i dont use it, i use the bash
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can we screenshot into clipboard?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie 🌈 not yet. sounds like you want to add it 😄
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i do
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but.

10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i've been sitting here for 12 hours lol
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no, long layover?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no. just long transit
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> time to install c++ development environment on ur mobile
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is a 17hr in between two flights
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the only ticket that i can buy to fly home tho.
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the shop here doesnt even open. i'm starving lol
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok my laptop battery is dead
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> when from 97% to 4% in a minutes
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> went from 97% to 4% in a minute
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wtf
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762231039636406272/MVIMG_20201004_113350.jpg
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> dell is a liar
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> accurate battery numbers are hard, always need to recalibrate
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but 97 to 4% sonuds weird 😄
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i dont have a cable for europe plug either
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> didnt realize it is different from uk's
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 😩
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, which airport are you in now?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> helsinki
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could ask other travellers to lend you one maybe. I guess airport shops will be quite expensive
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yeah, UK *really* likes to do their own thing compared to Europe
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there are no one here
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:

10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will you have to quarantine back in china?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> so you are completely alone on airport and you need to wait 17 hours?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> for 14 days
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and yes
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> im alone. there are a few ppl here. but im alone

10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> quite empty. hotel for quarantine is probably expensive?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> never thought to ask about it
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://photos.app.goo.gl/2fSkYvaYXatsyBQJ6
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> its good i can spinning around taking these photos without ppl watching me being like a idiot

11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > the shop here doesnt even open. i'm starving lol
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie 🌈 do u have water tho
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there is a water despenser. i dont have a bottle tho
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh right there is a vending machine
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Transits are awful with the very reduced airline schedules of today
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Usually I get a 3 hour layover in frankfurt if I want to get to torino inatead of milan. This time the shortest layover was 11 hours
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 398rmb/night @deen
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> about 40 pounds
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you leave the airport maybe? Does the EU aoply travel restrictions to the UK?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i dont have a visa
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:chubbs_music:685338991419064341>
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> plus there is no one there at the passport check
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's 1123 how is there no one? So confusing
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> didnt check just now
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but there wasnt anyone at 9am
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you don't have a visa anyway :(
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think they just go home once arrivals are handles. i havent seen any arrivals the entire night tho. might be at a different terminal
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think they just go home once arrivals are handled. i havent seen any arrivals the entire night tho. might be at a different terminal
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and that
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 4 hours to go
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Binge watch something on youtube I guess
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That passes time real quick for me
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently I have very noisy new french neighbours
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: ive watching reactions to steve in smash for some reason
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: ive been watching reactions to steve in smash for some reason
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i found another issue with the binds @deen 
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i hold d (first) then hold ctrl shift, then release d, after that release ctrl shift, it will walk to the right non stop
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 15.0.x it didnt
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the key up is getting lost I guess
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, we ignore the key up then
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh, not sure how to best fix these things
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ideally it would do the +xxx until ctrl shift is pressed, so ctrl shift is like a key up
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do we want that ctrl-shift behaviour?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, then check prev, next
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> prev bind was +xxx
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now its a new bind so +xxx is released
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ctrl-shift +d could then also just be a bind
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't want to make it just a bind
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because people could unbind it
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or make it a bind and disallow unbinding it
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and don't save it
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have ported https://info2.ddnet.tw/info to Python 3 and that was much more annoying than expected, so many places where the encoding can go wrong silently
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i think that would be good enough, if u dont want the other behaviour
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never figured out how it should behave, neither did Dune. So it's really not trivial. I guess I'd take a look at how other programs do it/behave
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd personally do the prev, next approach
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but probs that has negative sides too
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this feels a bit like physics changes, gotta keep it as minimal as possible
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how tho
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what behaviour would it change
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> why does it show it unfinished
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762262945623048202/screenshot_2020-10-04_12-40-09.png
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Like the old inputs getting stuck when you open chat/f1, people use that as a feature
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even though it might be considered a bug by others
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @lola thanks, another problem of my python3 port
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> wasnt it added for purpose xd in vanilla u dont have that
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the umlaut isn't converted properly
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think you had that in vanilla and then it was removed there and we didn't remove it intentionally because some used it
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> would be pretty hard to play if u cant write while hooking or something
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno the details, but if f1 is a bind now, i dont see how it would change something.
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> You press d, then f1, release d, then f1
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the order stays the same
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is relase d ignored by the bind handler?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or by the callback function
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  maybe make settings like this for  choice of 
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> entities (walls ,kill block, block (hook through ) ....etc
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762264493811302410/dd.png
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u want to change every entity tile seperatelly?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> standard entities best
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why did u photoshop the themes into it tho xD
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> for know what i mean easier way @Jupstar ✪
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @hussainx3 so, u want to modify every single tile?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm single tile seems better but not necessary together all tiles still good
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we have an option to change all tiles
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> !!
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762265791173099560/screenshot_2020-10-04_12-51-58.png
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u mean this
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but i want for entities
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it is for entities
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> some option to change just basic tiles would be good
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> like hook,kill,unhook
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats wrong with loading a different entities.png tho?
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @lola should work now
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> wow so fast
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> Yes works
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh this really  written ( entities) @Jupstar ✪
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk why not saw before
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @hussainx3 bcs its new
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> someone remember starttiles were purple and finish green? :justatest:
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only in the rc client
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-15.1-rc3-win64.zip
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i have it
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> do you put some this in future? like skin or should be download solo
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its in 15.1 which will release soon
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> thank for work hard
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> what i need and how for make assets entities?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> click on assets directory, add the entities.png
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> press refresh in the client
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can also ask ppl to share they entities, maybe someone is willing to give you some high quality stuff
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh no i mean
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want plant
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u want plants in ur entities?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u have to copy the ddnet.png from /data/editor/entities_clear into the assets directory
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> open gimp or photoshop or what ever
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and add plants
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want paint*
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> paint**
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want paint assets entities
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then do what i said
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> copy the ddnet.png from /data/editor/entities_clear into the assets directory
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> open gimp or photoshop or what ever
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u can paint whatever u want
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm so  just take it default and paint above?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :poggers: wow this seems so easy
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> there 6  photo change all or what?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> (sorry never i do it some thing like this )
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> first try
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet.png for ddnet
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> C:\games\DDNet-12.5-win64\data\editor\entities_clear
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u want to also change fng and so, u need to create a directory in the asset directory
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. add
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my_entites
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and add ddnet.png, fng.png and so on there
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also just copy the whole entities_clear directory and rename it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is easier probably 😄
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmmm i give up
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> copy entities_clear, into the assets directory
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i have just default in entities
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but in folder 6 photo
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so u copied ddnet.png etc into assets directory?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets do it step by step
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> select entites_clear, press CTRL + C
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then go into the client
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> press assets directory
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then press CTRL + V
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then go into client and press refresh
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should show 2 pics now
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yes i see two
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> what now
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no in assets directory
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> edit ddnet.png
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with gimp or photoshop
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but NOT paint
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs paint cant handle .png
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> paint.NET works too i guess
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now in assets directory
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i mean if i have 6 photo
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> should be change both?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u should change ddnet.png for ddnet mod
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fng.png for fng mod
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> blockworlds.png for blockworlds
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most likely u want to change ddnet.png
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so how do it this XD
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "with gimp or photoshop
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but NOT paint
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs paint cant handle .png
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> paint.NET works too i guess"
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i won't give u a tutorial on how to use these tools xD
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> search the internet
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yeah
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i it soon finish how paint with photoshop
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with NOT paint, i mean microsoft paint btw
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> change the formula still unknown for me
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762277495126753280/unknown.png
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> look thats how it looks like in gimp
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the left u have the paint tools
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can just draw on the picture
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i later trying
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> thanky for your time
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ddnet no have anyvidow for how make skin or this?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> wow everyone use gimp its easier or what?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if there is a tutorial for this
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gimp is pretty hard to use, but once u get into it, its really nice
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably paint.net is easier
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> personally i'd use inkscape for almost anything

14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i played **without** dummy
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gimp, paint.net or inkscape
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc what u want to learn xD
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> learn all
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if you open chat or clikc esc this too happend
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 🤥 cya @Jupstar ✪
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i didnt press esc or open chat
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i know how it works XD
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> not even pause
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> just randomly button starts to kinda lock
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so you just move normally? and its not stop
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Souly best is u create an issue or ping deen directly
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else he wont see by all the spam xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> there is some shift bug, right?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i saw some issues about it
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i just found out that when i press shift and d/a at the same time then it happens
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> it might be 15.1 bug
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 15.1 beta?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> or what
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> how know what i have?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye it is 15.1 bug
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3006
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> shit is lock key in 15.1
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye someone made pull for it
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> me too with this bug
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> you can bind your emotes if you still use shift
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why not happend for me
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <scdnh33> on 15.1 ?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why steam beta still 15.5
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 15.05
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u probably on nightly?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not release candidate
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nightly builts every night
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rc is built manually by deen
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but nightly is often newer
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except deen created the RC just today
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :saddo:
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> updated to rc3, works fine now
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :p
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok 😄
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> It's impossible to open player's stats, which nickname contains russian characters. For example: <https://ddnet.tw/players/Ty-1096-kaN-1095-uk/>
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Also it tries to encode russian chars weirdly. Doesn't it supposed to be `Ty%D1%88kaN%D1%87uk`?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, that looks like a bug
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `TyшkaNчuk` is the player name in question
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> global rank 7 for points
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Also ɌʘϚКỤṨ is bugged so i guess all special characters and russian oneshttps://ddnet.tw/players/-588--664--986--1050--7908--7784-/
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We use this other kind of escaping because of uwsgi limitations iirc
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it used to work, I wonder what happened
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> yes, it used to work, at least some years ago as I remember
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ddnet localization system is used for the client only isn't it?
16:16 <@deen> correct
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx-  @Дядя Женя sorry, I'll fix this now. guess I can't share some code for Python2 and Python3...
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Update: Should work again
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, ROCKUS still doesn't
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ye
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, now he works too
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hi, I removed a bug from the winter_main rules and improved them by using the NoLayerCopy option. Now you only have to automapp it once instead of spamming the rules.

17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Maybe let's delete Vanilla's 0.7 themes, and add own ones from most popular / prettiest maps?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or do both
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ya the themes rn are meh
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or, but ppl already complain the vanilla ones are bugged
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we are trying to fix them
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but if you have better ones, sure
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> anything is better xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295908390956433410/761947971835002920/unknown.png
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but I'm not a mapper, so can't really help
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762328929671053312/screenshot_2020-10-04_10-02-46.png
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762328931520348230/screenshot_2020-10-04_10-02-49.png
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> these are nice too
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> most ppl including me just "stole" bgs from the maps they found with prettiest bg
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> uhh @louis I want the last one
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, that won't work
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can't distribute from random maps, you'll need license from mapper
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> do we have licenses for any map?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> except for kobra maybe
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we don't have for kobra, thus it was removed from client
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh right
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only the ones that we ship in client
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> didn't silex gave licenses?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i can give license with oblique for the last one
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> thanfully we don't even have to play around with adding timeCPs, since default ones are used if none is present
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh wait what
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it's panned based on timeCPs?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, you can use them
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to overwrite default locations
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> neat
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @deen  forgot to set another starting condition to map a nicer bottom design pattern.
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762359560735293470/winter_main.rules
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen isnt timeout protection kinda short?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> people got kicked quite early
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for servers getting attacked you mean?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's 1000 seconds, so 16 minutes
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh, I kinda felt short
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise we end up with more dead tees lying around the server
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh, it kinda felt short
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I see, all good then haha
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki could you do something when rule name is way longer than its displaybox? xd like either scale the text size or make the box longer?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762392245185282048/unknown.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also I can't select the top option of "none" xD
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762393413635014706/unknown.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nothing happens when I click on it
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make a issue
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not coding rn
22:16 <+MalwareTele14> hi
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hi MalwareTele14
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu i can't reproduce clicking on None not working
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just figured I have this only on mind's amazing_freeze
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> maybe because the list of options is so damn long
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762413961936109578/amazing_freeze.zip
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ mapres + rules
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu works for me too with this one. Maybe we fixed it already by chance? Did you try in 15.1-rc3?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I am in 15.1-rc3 ^^'
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Can't select none either once I have clicked on another rule without closing the rules window.
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> any way to know which version is the most recent one?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762417637258559518/unknown.png
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it's pretty random
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762417955232415785/unknown.png
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> why so weird names
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> wow it's not even the same order in editor and windows xd
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We had to use longer hashes because the short hashes were easy to intentionally make collide, and so you could have a wrong map already
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the only way is to check the date in browser and then search for the same hash ingame
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or what I do: delete everything in downloadedmaps and just join server again 😄
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> your windows is sorted by date maybe, editor by name
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could also show the file date in editor, similar to demo
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but i don't feel like implementing it
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I sorted by name
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then windows is doing something wrong, that doesn't look like a sorting by date 😄
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by name*
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yea
