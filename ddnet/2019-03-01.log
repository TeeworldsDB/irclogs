09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yea I think i got that but how should I give it and why only gores?
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Arian8j2 did you try the ddnet script?
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arian8j2> Not actually
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arian8j2> I ask from deen and he said ddnet scripts are just for official ddnet server ðŸ˜•
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arian8j2> @ChillerDragon i want all mtod not just gores and i want gores point too.
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arian8j2> You want fng mod?

09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Well and I donâ€™t know how that script should be special for ddnet only
