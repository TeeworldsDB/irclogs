10:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> good morning

10:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hope he push all code before he leaves
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> `Richard Stallman has cancer. Fortunately it is slow-growing and manageable follicular lymphona, so he will probably live many more years nonetheless. But he now has to be even more careful not to catch Covid-19.`
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is already 70y old btw

12:22 < bridge> <teero777> :twintri:
12:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> discord mostly down via app? website still works for me
12:49 < bridge> <teero777> App works for me
12:49 < bridge> <teero777> At least on android
12:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might only be desktop(?)
12:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://old.reddit.com/r/discordapp/
12:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> almost only posts about discord not working
12:57 < bridge> <murpi> Both website and the app didn't work for me. Had to connect to a VPN first before I could access Discord.
14:07 < bridge> <ar1gin> its not a discord prpblem, its a misconfigured cloudflare problem
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> source?
14:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Whats automapper used for?
14:11 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> What automapper is used for?
14:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> just look at full image, it says that user triggered security something
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> from that image it might be anything from discord's fault to cloudflare's fault IMO. it only affects discord for me though
14:18 < bridge> <ar1gin> ye it might be discord's fault, i thought you meant that the servers are down
15:04 < bridge> <patiga> automatically generate a tiles layers tilemap depending from physics layers tiles
15:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Sounds fun :pepeW:, thanks
15:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> works for me again
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki do you know a rustfmt that doesn't shy away from sorting derives, adding trailing commas in macros?
15:37 < bridge> <ar1gin> its just a temporary block, ive got blocked 7 times today :justatest:
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh
15:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> you probably just have to configure it?
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, explicitly out of scope for rustfmt
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it might (in a very theoretical way) break code
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm idk, but as u say i seen rustfmt not touch much macro code
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> my only grip with rustfmt is big arrays how it formats them in a column
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise it would be perfect
15:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> when ddnet 18
15:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet no longer underage
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm. the US is marked as 18, yet you can only drink from 21 onwards
15:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 18 is age of consent
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i consent
15:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't look like it in the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> it might have something to do with their driving age üòÑ
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doubt it, I once heard‚Ñ¢ that you can drive with 14 in parts of the US
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > In some jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, drivers can be as young as 14 (with parental supervision).[citation needed]
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_licenses_in_the_United_States
16:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Restricted_license_age_requirements_by_US_State.svg
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> so the older they start drinking at the better üòÑ
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> aah
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny it states the height and weight
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and eyes
17:03 < bridge> <steinchen99> I wonder what they write to people with heterochromia
17:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > **Heterochromia is a variation in coloration most often used to describe color differences of the iris**, but can also be applied to color variation of hair[1] or skin.
17:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @patiga  how does this work? :pepeW:  https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/master/twmap/src/map/parse.rs?ref_type=heads#L211
17:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> permalink: https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/fb8f8a4371bf405d1f45a9513a8f678089ad4688/twmap/src/map/parse.rs#L211
17:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (press y to generate it)
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-diff
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> here u can see simple usage
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> of the lib
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want to make a map like the default in editor, this is my best effort: https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-gen/blob/83dc864d3a25e1c3e7d57524ef65beacc44c7f5e/src/generators/mod.rs#L46
17:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> im trying to understand 500iq rust  code
17:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> my grug brain rejects it
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> `impl<T: ItemParseErrorTrait + Default> ItemParseErrorTraitSingle for T {}`
18:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> thanks, its my 2nd time being on getlab
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> u want to understand this
18:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yea
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> this implements a trait for a generic type T
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> it implements this trait for any type T that implements ItemParseErrorTrait + Default
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ItemParseErrorTrait and Default are traits to
18:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
18:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> thanks
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> so if a struct implements
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ItemParseErrorTrait
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and implements Default
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will implement ItemParseErrorTraitSingle
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and since this trait has no body as you can see
18:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> its used as a marker trait
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless it has a impl somewhere else
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Marker traits are used to mark types as having some property. They usually don't have any associated types and methods and are used to tell the compiler about some property of a type. Note that some of those traits are auto traits, which means that the compiler will automatically implement them for types, if it reasons it is safe to do so (you can still implement them manually, but it may require unsafe keyword).
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Currently (rustc 1.70.0) there are 5 stable traits in std::marker module. They have the following meaning. If type T implements:
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Copy it means that it can be Cloned by using bitwise copy
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Send it means that value of type T can be send across thread boundary
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Sync it means that value of type T can be shared between threads (that is &T is Send)
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Sized means that size of type T is known at compile time
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> >     Unpin means that value of type T can be moved after it was pinned
18:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> do i have to install anything else except rust-analyzer to make it work
18:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> its kinda broken now
18:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and idk why :pepeW:
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> u shouldnt need anything else than rust
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> how are u using rust analyzeR?
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> what editor are u using
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont use rust-analyzer directly
18:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> mf is clueless

18:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> neovim
18:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and mason
18:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> it worked before
18:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> but doesnt now :pepeW:
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
18:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> :pepeW:
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm odd
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats ur rust version btw
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend u use rustup regardless of gentoo rust
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and use rust-analyzer from rustup
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is more up to date too
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> `let mut map_old: TwMap // size = 224 (0xE0), align = 0x8`
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> my RA tells me this
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it works for me
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ` let mut map_old = TwMap::parse_file(map_old)?;`
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> for this line
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat ah
18:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i use mason plugin and it uses this version
18:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1157347390089596938/image.png?ex=65184740&is=6516f5c0&hm=7a164d3650a74fdff59598c89d133e804126e15d27bf93612e973c72bc46be5f&
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it compile
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> with rust?
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚ùØ rust-analyzer --version
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust-analyzer 1.72.1 (d5c2e9c 2023-09-13)
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> Why does the version of rust-analyzer matter? Something this simple has been deduced properly since rust-analyzer was first created üòÑ
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye idk
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> just wondering maybe he had ancient ra
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> aren't there logs or sth with neovim?
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :LspLog or smth
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> let me check
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> with vscode I'd check the extension logs, they usually tell you what went wrong

18:16 < bridge> <learath2> Should have used a language that doesn't require an entire IDE to code
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> I suggest C :Gigachad:
18:17 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> im checking twmap like this for 2 days
18:18 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> at least it shows me structs

18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its called indexdb or smth
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> it supports sqlite like queries iirc

18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> not sure if existed in 2011
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are libs built on top of thos

18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz this is fairly low lvl

20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> indeed unrelated, you can drive with a permit if accompanied by someone 21 or older with a license. a federal minimum time of 1 year with the permit is required before you can take your driving test & actually get your license. sometimes you can get the permit earlier (still can't get the license until 16) if there's driving school involved
20:54 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i have to fix this error somehow. any ideas? :owo: `[ERROR rust_analyzer::main_loop] flycheck 0: File with cargo diagnostic not found in VFS: file not found: /rustc/eb26296b556cef10fb713a38f3d16b9886080f26/library/std/src/panic.rs\n`
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why do  you need to fix this error?
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems harmless from first glance
20:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> coz my rust-analyzer doesnt work
20:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :D
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems unrelated to this error
20:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> hm
20:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> theres nothing else in logs
20:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
20:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> akshually i always knew i wouldnt use rust. go is the way to go
20:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> akshually i always knew i wouldnt use rust. golang is the way to go
20:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both are interesting languages üôÇ
21:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> better than js on servers :pepeW:
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can try intellij+rust plugin for rust btw
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what I use when I want to have an IDE
21:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> they are making a rust ide
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yep, that too
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat look at date of the log
21:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> im pretty happy with neovim
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> its unrelated
21:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> it is. i just have wrong time xD
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and i dont want to read 40 horus manual how to set it correctly
21:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> but one day i will
21:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and i need different keyboard layouts :pepeW:
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what intellij+rust plugin gives you; no 40 hours manual
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can even have somewhat accurate vim keys inside, there's an extension
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and here u are using gentoo
21:02 < bridge> <sedonya> How do I change the name and icon of the exe being compiled?
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> change the project name in cmake
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> iifc
21:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> easy way aint fun :pepeW:
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> or target name
21:03 < bridge> <sedonya> Thx <3
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not? üôÇ
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> things being hard is not good in itself
21:04 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i was talking about time btw
21:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> rust ide?
21:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yes?
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/
21:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/
21:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> fock
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> first
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ez
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> :ez:
21:06 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> so is that thing related to rust-analyzer being dumb?
21:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh yea i forgot jetbrains was a thing LOL
21:08 < bridge> <sedonya> line number pls :justatest:
21:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `set(CLIENT_EXECUTABLE ‚Ä¶)`
21:14 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> no its not, i opened another project and it doesnt show that message. and still doesnt work
22:30 < bridge> <solayer> chillerdragon: hi
