09:47 <@deen> heinrich5991: want to implement your solution?
10:06 <@deen> I guess the only realistic solutions are banning ";" in names and /allowsemicolons, even though I would maybe call it /multiplecommands; instead
10:08 <@deen> 272 names containing ;, top ones being:
10:08 <@deen> | {;-_Pa!n_-;}    |    243 |
10:08 <@deen> | ;Ganja!`        |    274 |
10:08 <@deen> | ;C              |    543 |
10:08 <@deen> | ;)              |    868 |
10:08 <@deen> | ȻαЯЪθИ ;)       |    960 |
10:08 <@deen> | ;D              |   3128 |
10:15 <@Nimda> SkipIt by xPeke just released on Solo at 2017-01-03 10:10
10:16 <+Learath2> deen: do we have to keep it long? 
10:22 <@deen> Learath2: not sure, depends on how you implement it
10:22 <@deen> could also be safe with /mc;
10:22 <+Learath2> yeah if there is no security concern the shorter the better
10:23 <@deen> the concern is that people can use it as their name
10:23 <@deen> but since / is forbidden at start already and ; doesn't work until after the "mc" command, that would work fine

15:06 <+DawnDN> hey, someone who can help me with some commands? 
15:20 <+o_be_one> all is on the website, but ask how we can help DawnDN
15:21 <+DawnDN> So, I've two Servers. Do DDNet have a command where you can change the time of screened broadcast? Or maybe unlimited time, so it won't dissapear?
15:28 <+o_be_one> yes i think
15:28 <+o_be_one> and you can use a feature as well to broadcast whatever you want x times
15:28 <+o_be_one> im checking about the perm bc
15:30 <+o_be_one> check at sv_announcement
15:30 <+o_be_one> or maybe its in chat, not as bc
15:32 <+DawnDN> uff, can you explain me pls? I've found the commands, what now?
15:32 <+o_be_one> sv_announcement is for chat announce if think, not broadcast show
15:32 <+o_be_one> im surprised that there's no something like on other ddrace bin to broadcast all long
15:33 <+o_be_one> can you try sv_motd ?
15:33 <+DawnDN> yea
15:33 <+o_be_one> (motd is for Message Of The Day)
15:33 <+DawnDN> message of today is not broadcast
15:34 <+DawnDN> it's the screen in the infos
15:34 <+o_be_one> oh yes, right
15:35 <+o_be_one> mmh, maybe try announcement cause the description for sv_announcement_interface talk about how long you show a message
15:35 <+o_be_one> i think they use this for tournament announce
15:36 <+o_be_one> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/servers
15:36 <+o_be_one> all server config and other scripts are here btw
15:36 <+o_be_one> from officiel ddnet
15:37 <+o_be_one> as you can see theres an announcement.txt
15:37 <+o_be_one> these messages are in chat, not in broadcast, btw
15:37 <+o_be_one> so from announcement way its not possible i think
15:40 <+DawnDN> yea, I tried
15:42 <@EastByte> ddnet generally uses input fifo for broadcast announcements
15:43 <+DawnDN> okay
15:47 <+o_be_one> fifo is a nice feature
15:49 <+DawnDN> okay :D I will try it
