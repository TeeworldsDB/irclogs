02:53 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki i think teesmash is bugged xD
02:53 < bridge> <teero777> i don't remember playing it for 3705 hours in 1 session

02:56 < bridge> <totar> interesting that the client will make that demo
07:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea itâ€™s a client issue not a teesmash issue
07:58 < bridge> <teero777> why dont i have demos like that from other gamemodes then? i have maybe 10hrs on teesmash vs. multiple thousands on other gamemodes
07:59 < bridge> <teero777> sounds like teesmash is sending data the recorder cant handle. server and clientside issue
08:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sure maybe
08:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i somehow doubt that tho teemash doesn't send anything custom does it?
08:44 < bridge> <teero777> Idk its a very old mod it might send some fucked up time data and round starts or smth
08:45 < bridge> <teero777> Sometimes you even just get stuck on the map in spec without being able to move your cursor
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> u should add prediction

11:16 < bridge> <melon> A small price for O(n) physics imo
11:17 < bridge> <robyt3> The demo length is simply calculated based on the first tick and last tick, so the game mode probably skipped a lot of ticks at some point
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Bitcoin mining is only O(n^256)

12:22 < bridge> <melon> PR Monday :poggers2:
12:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Any CMake experts? How to specify that I want a system library called `uuid` with `list(APPEND PLATFORM_LIBS uuid)` and not the separate executable target `uuid` for the tool of the same name? Renaming the tool would fix it. I otherwise get error
12:58 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
12:59 < bridge> <robyt3> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3064 (target_link_libraries):
12:59 < bridge> <robyt3>   Target "uuid" of type EXECUTABLE may not be linked into another target.

12:59 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> you could try "-luuid" or "uuid.lib" for target_link_library, but I can't confirm without testing
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> you could try "-luuid" or "uuid.lib" for target_link_library, but I can't confirm without testing and I don't know how os-independend this is
13:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks, using `uuid.lib` works (locally). Should probably do that for all libraries on Windows to distinguish them from other targets.

17:49 < bridge> <learath2> Rustwizards, I want to skip serializing some fields of a struct sometimes, but not depending on the value of the field.
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> struct Foo {
17:49 < bridge> <learath2>   field_a: String,
17:49 < bridge> <learath2>   field_b: String,
17:49 < bridge> <learath2>   field_c: String,
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> }
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> I don't want to serialize `field_c` depending on an external condition, is this possible or do I need to move `field_a` and `field_b` to their own struct and flatten it into another struct that has `field_c`?
17:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** stap rost and merge some prs
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> I can merge one while I wait for a Rust wizard
17:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
17:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can i suggest which one u merge?
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> Sure
17:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** #9274
17:53 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9274
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> Waay too complicated
17:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nob
17:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you want easy ones and are picky you have to merge 2!
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Please review #10493, we are leaking stack memory to 0.7 servers :monkaS:
17:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10493
18:01 < bridge> <melon> use serde
18:02 < bridge> <melon> https://serde.rs/attr-skip-serializing.html
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> I need the context to be external, I could use a skip_serializing_if accessing a global but that'd be nasty. I'm looking for something like
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> serde_json::to_string(serialization_context)
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> don't think it exists tho
18:06 < bridge> <louis> true but maybe wait for 2nd pr just cause i dont wanna add toooo many things at once
18:07 < bridge> <louis> im also gonna make them work with the blue arrow things
18:07 < bridge> <melon> you could hack in your own serialize impl for that
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> IOW it's not the value of the field that warrants it not being serialized, it's the current context
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'll just wrap it rather than implement a custom serialize
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> struct Foo {
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> ...
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> }
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> 
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> struct FooWithC {
18:08 < bridge> <learath2>   #[serde(flatten)]
18:08 < bridge> <learath2>   foo: Foo,
18:08 < bridge> <learath2>   field_c: String,
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> }
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> Or maybe an enum I guess
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> Though I don't think rust enums get common initial sequence optimization
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh look a memory safety issue
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Serialize)]
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> struct Resource {
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Always serialized.
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki>     name: String,
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Never serialized.
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki>     #[serde(skip_serializing)]
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki>     hash: String,
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Use a method to decide whether the field should be skipped.
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki>     #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Map::is_empty")]
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki>     metadata: Map<String, String>,
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
18:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I don't want it conditional on the value of the field, that's the issue
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> efunction can be anything
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> I could access global state for it, but I think that's nasty
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> I basically have a json object that has an optional field, if it has the optional field I want it to have a different type
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think u can with a enum
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and some tag attribute
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'll do something like
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> enum Foo{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   Base{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_a: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_b: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   },
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   Extended{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_a: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_b: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_c: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> }
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> enums can have tag in field
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> in serde
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'll do something like
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```rust
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> enum Foo{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   Base{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_a: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_b: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   },
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   Extended{
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_a: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_b: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>     field_c: String,
18:48 < bridge> <learath2>   }
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> }
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> look it up
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> im in a raid
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> I can't have a tag, it's not my type I'm parsing something predefined
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :d
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean u control the struct?
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust side
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> I was planning on using `#[serde(untagged)]` and a custom deserializer to use `field_c` as the tag somehow ðŸ˜„
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah thats it
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> check this
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[serde(tag = "type")]
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[serde(tag = "field_c")]
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[serde(tag = "t", content = "c")]
18:51 < bridge> <melon> rude, i told him the exact same thing :c
18:52 < bridge> <melon> happy raiding!
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what is wrong with me today, I end up disliking everything I code
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe the `#[serde(flatten)]` version was the nicest, but then I need to deserialize twice, that's nasty
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> Ah I have it, `field_c: Option<String>`, then I can just match on `field_c` and return the correct type, and move everything over so there is no cloning
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> That's also nasty because I have to repeat all the fields, but at least it's not double parsing
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> If youâ€™re not using a DeserializeOwned object avoiding clones might be futile
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> webservers with streaming structs for bytes will just use the lifetime-specified version
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah i love serde
20:12 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone actually try eserde? i havenâ€™t been able to convince my team to switch
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> webservers with streaming wrappers for bodies will just use the lifetime-specified version

21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 my console sometimes keeps scrolling and there is no way for me to stop it. It is  rare and i can not reproduce so not sure if it is also in ddnet because i dont actively play with pure ddnet.
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not sure what i should do but its driving me nuts
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my client did not edit input or console code
21:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it says locked in the top but it keeps scrolling in new messages

22:03 < bridge> <kebscs> this happens when console reaches lines limit
22:04 < bridge> <kebscs> make a dbg log that prints every frame and after a while it wont be able to lock
22:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I get it before the limit too
22:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think, quite sure. The limit is high right? I still saw the lines number increasing it was line at 400 or something
22:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i was able to reproduce this again on ddnet master, but again i had no clue how i activated it
