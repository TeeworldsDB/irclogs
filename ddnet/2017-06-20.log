02:36 < ddnet-discord> <Lexin> Whenever im playing, any time of the day, i get random connection problems . Only for a rly short amout of time like 1-2 seconds, but its basically unplayable since they always hit randomly and sometimes within seconds, sometimes in a few minutes. Can you help me, devs?
08:09 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @Lexin Stop all other programs, disconnect all other computers, keep network monitor open and see what is causing it
09:02 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I know this problem, for me works often to restart the router
10:26 < ddnet-discord> <deen> Oh, and connect by LAN cable, no wifi
10:27 < ddnet-discord> <deen> Basically make everything simpler until the problem disappears
10:28 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Ye i use LAN too, its way better
10:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I tried adding a wiki on github, turns out I'm quite horrible at writing wiki text.
11:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #790: Add toggling for string options (master...dd_pr_togglestr) https://git.io/vQf1O

12:49 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i'm bored so im making a ddnet api xD
12:49 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://api.teeland.ovh/ddnet/users/Ryozuki/
12:57 < laxa> Bad gateway with wrong nickname :)
13:12 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> need to fix lot of things :P
13:13 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (fixed that already btw)
13:14 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Dont forget the flags :feelsgoodman:
13:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ture
13:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> true*
13:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also need to add the points
15:20 < ddnet-discord> <deen> If anyone else is bored, want to fix ddnet website on internet explorer? svgs are too big and in /status/ the grey looks wrong
15:26 < ddnet-discord> <jao> is it possible to allow kickvotes only if you on server like 5 mins? this "votebots" are annoying
15:27 < ddnet-discord> <jao> I mean that you can participate on the vote
19:26 < ddnet-discord> <Lexin> @deen i formatted my pc and it fixed the cps.. but now mousesens feels different with the same windows settings / dpi / ingame sens, do u have any idea why? And thanks for your help ðŸ˜ƒ
19:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> old mouse mode
19:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> in settings, try
19:29 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> inp_mouseold ^
19:29 <@deen> and also cpu throttling
19:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
19:29 <@deen> cl_refresh_rate 0 fixes it for some people
19:29 <@deen> but puts your CPU at 100%, while other people don't notice the difference to cl_refresh_rate 400
19:30 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> While questions are being answered, I also have a quick one
19:30 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> to make the game have a playable fps on this machine, I always lower the resolution to the lowest it can go
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> however, it also changes the resolution for my whole pc while the game is open, which is pretty annoying
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> any way to prevent that?
19:31 < ddnet-discord> <Lexin> Im using old mouse mode, doesnt work
19:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> vsync enabled?
19:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it cause mouse smoothing
19:32 < ddnet-discord> <Lexin> Or dear god, that should be the first thing to disable. thanks, i disabled it
19:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
19:33 < ddnet-discord> <Lexin> Thanks works now ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ˜ƒ
19:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
19:41 <@deen> I think that's a Windows thing btw
19:41 <@deen> On Windows I can't play with Vsync, everything feels delays
19:41 <@deen> delayed*
19:42 <@deen> never had a problem like that on Linux with open source radeon and intel drivers
19:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's right. With vsync i feel big delays
19:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's why i always disabling it
19:43 <@deen> nvidia gpu?
19:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> radeon
19:44 <@deen> windows, linux?
19:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> windows ðŸ˜ƒ
19:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> windows 10 actually
20:46 < o_be_one> ddnet as a Discord oO ?

20:52 < o_be_one> nicei ll join later thanks
20:57 < eeeee> have heard games are slower in windows 10 because it's constantly recording your screen in case you decide to upload the video to the Cloud
20:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> XBOX App
20:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have disabled it
21:00 <@deen> eeeee: haha, that sounds like a hilarious feature
21:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nope, that'ss sounds like replay mode
21:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> which should be disbaled by default, but it's microsoft
21:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/mame/quine-relay
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "This is a Ruby program that generates Scala program that generates Scheme program that generates ...(through 100 languages in total)... REXX program that generates the original Ruby code again."
