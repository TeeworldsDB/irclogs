01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/statboard.cpp#L93
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this is unsafe code
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> pls fix
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby lol what is that even?
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it tries to access array[strlen(array)-9] and stuff like this
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> without first checking that the index isnt negative
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it's a mess
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll fix it
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> It was insecure, i compiled with address sanitizer and it crashed there
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well fixed it, needed more then i first though :/
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> names can apparently have quotes in them
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and need to make sure a malicious server cant send a message to crash the client
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Why is there no crosshair when u do /pause in newer clients? Its extremely annoying especially when youre testing and want to tele 0 0 to a special Position...
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I mean on my DDNet 9 ive got a crosshair when i enabled showall and i always did
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what is that debug message doing there
02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lets pretend that never happened through the magic of force pushing
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ᶰ°Konͧsti its been removed since ages lol
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/aad18ebb868d8afd2e5adc0df64ee6bae1d76dc3/src/game/server/ddracecommands.cpp#L426-L427
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what's the point behind having such stuff over 2 lines
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that doesn't make it more readable imo
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its about the line being not too long. but you can just move it up, especially this doesnt make sense
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao agree it looks weird but you should also try to avoid getting over 80 chars per line. code where you have to scroll sideways is very annoying to read. And I am not talking about zoozed 8k iMac screens. It should be readable on a full hd splitscreen
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Imo a function would solve that you pass in secs and get the timestamp back
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @fokkonaut but its annoying af?XD gib crosshair back
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stick something on your screen @ᶰ°Konͧsti
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no U
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> thats botting would snail say
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cheating on test server is fine
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YairBenDavid> Ye i like cheating
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> botting is never okay
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what chillerdragon described isn’t botting
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ask snail
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it is
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> a coin stucking in the keyboard is also botting in his opinion
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then snail sadly doesnt know what a bot is, which leads to he doesnt know what botting is lol
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I got a coin on f3 while i am in activily moderate mode.:troll:
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @fokkonaut he thinks anything what is making an action for you is botting like afk fishing in minecraft by stuck a coin in your keyboard to keep a key pressed
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its totally nonsense because the same input all the time is like no input a the time
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> A bot gives automatically different inputs, but he doesnt understand that
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> input = no input? lol
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I always used Logitech Gaming Software for my mouse and Keyboard to create macros so i can afk fish in minecraft (with that farm, maybe you still remember xd)
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so an autoclicker wouldn't be a bot either because it doesn't do different inputs? 😛
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Autoklicker is a bot because it does different inputs
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it spread them very fast
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it only clicks
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ws
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> yes
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> thats different inputs
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> releasing a key isn’t input
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> What i am talking about is like hanging at wall and hold the hook
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's too early after breakfast to decipher your logic 😛
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Autoclicker clicks like 500times in a minute
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can have it click at any pace you want
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I talk about click only one time and hold that
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, a coin stuck in your keyboard isn't botting imho
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wouldnt call it botting but cheating
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is a more harmless and less agressive cheat than hookcoll which is implemented in official ddnet client
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 How would we go about reproducing a full demo from teehistorian? Is anything prepared already? Would I get out the raw inputs from the teehistorian file and feed them to the DDNet server at the exact ticks as they were recorded?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why server not client?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> server sounds like building an replay bot o.O
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> teehistorian is the same as replay bot
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> even vanilla teeworlds demo system is base for replaybot
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think there are some complications involving teleports not being deterministic
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes, especially through demo replays
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so annoying to cut out the frames it sux to look at
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like when u spec and the scoreboard shows up for 2 frames or so
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> konsti spreading his bullshit fake news yet again lol
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> there are quotes on this server of u proving urself wrong and actually admitting ur coin is cheating but w/e
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u said urself a wooden construction click for u is botting
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but a coin holding a key is legit? seems very logical
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u said urself a wooden construction clicking k for u is botting
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u said urself a wooden construction clicking for u is botting
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> stop pressing the key and press it again in a special Interval is botting
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> hold it 24/7 is not
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its not BOTTING
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its just not legit
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> stop being a smartass
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and stop imagining ur own rules everywhere that only fit ur limits
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its totally legit
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I could sleep before my pc and keep my Finger on the key
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its a macro...
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u keep arguing with this retard
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> aka forbidden in every single online game
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> unless the game explicitly states otherwise
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> because hes spreading his fake news
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and yes u could also sit in front of ur pc 24/7
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i could also not miss my hooks, therefore aimbot wouldnt be botting
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> nice logic once again
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its not a macro to hold a key?????
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> macro =/= bot
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but both are forbidden
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes it is
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> learn what a macro is
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> A macro is not holding a key
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> pressing a key and holding it forever is the definition of a macro
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ur clueless
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Macro is an Instruction i give to my computer
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u gonna say playing with my hands is a macro then?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ur examples are retarded
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> « aimbot isnt cheating because i could just not miss my hooks »
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ur doing something that presses and holds the key for u
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> thats a macro
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Not missing your hooks is something you cant change
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> whether u want it or not
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ure totally dumb lol
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and u are blinded
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> by ur pride
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its sad
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I bet you say TNT duping is cheating too
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ?? XD
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> Exploiting a glitch has nothing to do with actual hacking
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wowowiw
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> F10ed
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> gonna show u when u delete my next rank
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> that doesnt mean its legit
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u so stupid
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its just not hacking
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> oh wait
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 🐌 :banhammer: 🤖
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Your 10000 minutes time on Care for your time was made by Pressing a for hours (also you abused ur powers by locking the server and deleting better ranks on your name)
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> So it was made by a """macro""" and your a hacker confirmed
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :poggers: :poggers: :poggers: :poggers:
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ive already answered that..
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ddnet client allows it
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i didnt use anything else than ddnet client
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> yes and DDNet is a cheat client
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> not vanilla
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its not possible on vanila
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ddnet is ddrace vanilla client
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so what
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> we are playing ddnet mod
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ´not vanilla
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u can play DDRace with vanilla client
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the rules are set by us
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> You're a hacker
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes so what
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Confirmed
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> w/e
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u cant use dummy on vanilla client either
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :danAmazing:
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hax f3
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> jump on the trolling wagon
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> coz u ran out of argument
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> keep being blind
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what even is the argument here
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> idk
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just trolling
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> when ilmango says its not hacking that means its legit
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> lmfao
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ilmango make minecraft rules
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> u ok snail?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> did he hurt ur feelings or smw?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ?Xd
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes im crying rn
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> me too
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> why u crying
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> #off-topic
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> @ᶰ°Konͧsti oh captain obvious
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq is going on in #dev today xxD
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk i didnt do anything
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yet
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 even if teleports are not deterministic, then just have a bad prediction for one frame and on we go, better than nothing
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be nice to finally have full demos from teehistorian
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I want to offer demos of top runs straight on ddnet.tw
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wowo i doubt speedrunners like their tricks being leaked
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Thats what i predicted when teehistorian was made, that one day it wont be only for detecting botters and cheaters but for make peoples tricks public.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Speedrunners for example on Solo Lexin, gdin, N9mkoik are looking for hours and tryhard even more hours to do find and realize special moves and its kinda unfair to leak their Tricks
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it only makes the game more competitive
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> everyone has the same chances already
16:27 <+Munto> Hello !
16:27 <+Munto> Is it possible to show constantly my ping in the hud?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cl_showpred 1
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How can I generate another `WEAPON_*` in the generated protocol.h above `NUM_WEAPONS`?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ᶰ°Konͧsti Not everyone knows the same tricks and people don't necessarily figure them out themselves but learn from friends
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut datasrc/content.py I guess
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, but I can't get it to compile
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe I am missing something
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ᶰ°Konͧsti its better to have top speedruns on a webpage and public
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this ensures that the top will be rly top
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen, so far I've added this:
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> class Weapon_Plasma_Rifle(Struct):
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     def __init__(self):
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         Struct.__init__(self, "CDataWeaponspecPlasma_Rifle")
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.base = Pointer(WeaponSpec, WeaponSpec())
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> class Weapons(Struct):
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     def __init__(self):
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         Struct.__init__(self, "CDataWeaponspecs")
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.hammer = Weapon_Hammer()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.gun = Weapon_Gun()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.shotgun = Weapon_Shotgun()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.grenade = Weapon_Grenade()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.rifle = Weapon_Rifle()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.ninja = Weapon_Ninja()
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.plasma_rifle = Weapon_Plasma_Rifle()   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>         self.id = Array(WeaponSpec())
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weapon = WeaponSpec(container, "plasma_rifle")
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weapon.firedelay.Set(500)

16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> container.weapons.id.Add(weapon)
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip irc
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof sory
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> when people want to make their runs public it should be on their decision
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Your skill rises by playing as your knowledge does also
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And its good when a player with less skill can get a better rank with any Tricks than the super pro who never misses a hook
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> always forget about that @Ryozuki
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no it shouldnt be their decision
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur playing on the server
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its server decision
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when we talk about top runs
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "skill rising and learning"
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its another topic
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u cant beat another people using the same tricks
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u shouldnt be top1
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you could also argue that you shouldn't be top 1 if you can't figure those tricks out yourself
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on most racing games top runs are public
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trackmania stadium 2 which is all about ms
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they got the runs public
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen or can I add it in another way? I just need the entry above NUM_WEAPONS, nothing more
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut no idea
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We only have top ranks for 517 / 1786 maps btw 😄
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (in teehistorian)
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What does this line do?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `EmitEnum(["WEAPON_%s"%i.name.value.upper() for i in content.container.weapons.id.items], "NUM_WEAPONS")`
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> generates a enum
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and 11 maps haven't been finished at all since we added teehistorian 😄
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> which ones?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut ddnet uses python to create code xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that probs make WEAPON_GRENADE and all those
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Ryozuki ye in the end making runs public or not are both viable
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki can you help me? :D
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut just add "WEAPON_FOOBAR", before "NUM_WEAPONS" in that line
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and is just up to whoever is in charge
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it adds it to the enum
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen just tried, also somehow does work
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, let me recompile everything
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @jao i disagree there tho, u can be mechanically ultra skilled but lacking game knowledge about 1 bug or sth and then u will never get rznk 1
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> making runs public favors mechanical skill over knowledge imo
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao actually a few maps that we removed already
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut i didnt reaqd ur code idk what u doing, and im currently doing some webdev xd
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maps that still exist but haven't been finished since teehistorian: Adrenaline 4, Heartcore II, Lunar Base, Memento mori, Stereotype 4
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also it will make botting harder
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lunar base :GWjiangoOmegaLUL:
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> I WONDER WHY :thonkery:
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yea
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> botters will hate it
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye basically anybody can investigate ur runs
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @snail you can be mechanically skilled and still might be able to do some trick
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s the same
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> wat
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @snail you can be mechanically skilled and still might not be able to do some trick
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if u cant do the trick then u wont beat the rank
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> wut
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tricks require mechanical skill
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or wathever that is
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `EmitEnum(["WEAPON_%s"%i.name.value.upper() for i in content.container.weapons.id.items], "WEAPON_PLASMA_RIFLE", "NUM_WEAPONS")`
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also its rly goood for newer players and whoever wants to get into speedrunning
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it wont compile, i dont know python 😄
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea it will just increase the quality of top runs
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> konsti complains about everything we do no matterwhat so
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and if u can’t understand the bug then you won’t be r1 either
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt take it into account
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> tryharding a map for 2 hours just to realize the guy above u exploited a bug u didnt know about is lame af
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @jao with the demo ucan reproduce it (or try to) or ask somebody to explain
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u cant ask somebody to explain if u dont even know theres a trick
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and then u learn it and ur overall skill rises
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s the same with skills
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> what
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u can’t ask someone to explain you a skill if u don’t know it exist
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i dont get what ur trying to say tbh
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hiding things is never good unless its a security thing
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki lol, what about privacy? 😄
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well yeah
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but a top1 run on a game
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that privacy
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ryozuki lives naked
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in a glass house
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @snail come see me
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know u will love it
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> on my way bb
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> snail you can apply the same logic to both things, either you know it or you don’t
17:17 <+Munto> awesome Ryozuki, it works :) (for the ping)
17:17 <+Munto> but what does it mean when the ping is negativ?
17:18 <+Munto> -900 something like that
17:19 <+Munto> very bad connection i guess...
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> anyone has connexion problems only with his dummy?
17:21 <+Ryozuki> Munto: yes very bad
17:23 <+Munto> What a pain...
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `EmitEnum(["WEAPON_%s"%i.name.value.upper() for i in content.container.weapons.id.items]+["WEAPON_%s"%o.enum_name for o in XYZ], "NUM_WEAPONS")
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How can I now add all new names from an enum in another file to that XYZ?
17:24 <+Ryozuki> someone might be ddosing
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hi, this is the original line in compile.py to create the weapons enum in generated/protocol.h:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `EmitEnum(["WEAPON_%s"%i.name.value.upper() for i in content.container.weapons.id.items], "NUM_WEAPONS")`
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now, I have a file `weapons_ex.h` including an enum in engine/shared and I would like to take all entries of that enum and add them between the normal weapons and the entry `NUM_WEAPONS`, so basically like this, but I dont know how to grab all the information from that specific file:
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `EmitEnum(["WEAPON_%s"%i.name.value.upper() for i in content.container.weapons.id.items]+["WEAPON_%s"%o.enum_name for o in XYZ], "NUM_WEAPONS")`
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @snail im not even talking about bugs in the physics more like movement tricks and maybe little cuts in the map itself
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen Lunar Base lmfaoooo :GWjiangoOmegaLUL: probably worst solo map
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And why are my 1239 minutes on Stereotype 4 not on teehistorian :GWaobaPePeCry: 
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Actually ive got a full demo of it
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @deen Lunar Base lmfaoooo :GWjiangoOmegaLUL: probably worst solo map
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And why are my 1329 minutes on Stereotype 4 not on teehistorian :GWaobaPePeCry: 
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Actually ive got a full demo of it
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ᶰ°Konͧsti but the ultimate goals of speedrunning is the get the closest-to-perfect time on a map
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and its way easier to achieve if 10 players contributed to the runs optimization
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> rather than one guy hiding his trick
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it is like that on literaly every other game that has speedruns
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Everyone has a brain and can use it
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also people like snail can watch rank1 but we dont. which kinda makes it unfair if he wants to speed that map.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> xD
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean im sure he dint abuse it but its still possible
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i always said that its unfair that people like snail can watch teehistorian
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's also possible that I add a 0s time on every map in the databse
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so what are you saying
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i dont run anymore and i would obviously not abuse it xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's also possible that I add a 0s time for me on every map in the databse
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye what jao said too lol
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's also possible that I add a 0s time for me on every map in the database
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its unfair that admins have access to everything ?_?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #general
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you COULD make it look like you just had the idea too. i only say it could possibily happen and that fact would give every rank1 from snail a bitter taste.   again, i dont think you would do it
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the only downside i see is that it makes rank1 videos useless
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its unfair that U have access to anything because youre like a troll, insulting people for their opinion and borderline abuse your powers
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen yes. it would involve replaying the inputs to the server and saving the demo. I haven't coded a single bit in that direction. problems are random hook teleport and random teleport, both the results are not recorded
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen it would be best if it interacted with the current code as little as possible, because that way, we could also apply it to old server versions more easily
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddos
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teeson> what is teehistorian concretely ?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teeson> Is it something similar to ghosts ?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Teeson its DDNet spyware
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it records every server 24/7
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and is saved forever
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teeson> what is recorded ?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> everything
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> they can completely rewatch ur run
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> also they claim to not record the chat but Its fake news
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stop your bullshit konsti
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Teeson> it can be useful to confirm abuses
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesn't contain chat
