00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :thonk: using this for teeworlds developement
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Can someone port the map Editor to Android App? ðŸ˜‚
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Doesn't sound usefu
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> For break at work xD
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> H Client did I think
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> By unsigned char
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wanted to port it to the browser and allow multiple people at same time but im 2 lazy
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe now its easier with patiga's library since rust has excellent wasm support
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> undo function in map editor please
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Browser Port sounds good, but even the map viewer on ddnet.tw doesnt run on mobile for me
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> He had a neat video on yt I canâ€™t find it
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what phone and os?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just get a Linux phone
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> My Pine phone runs the editor
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ddnet has that I think you have to turn it on tho
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@cheeser0613)
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Samsung A71 Firefox and Chrome doesnt work
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/908316238466416660/Screenshot_20211111-122353_Settings.jpg
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that should definitely work, weird
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:Beer\: \:de\:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How does it look like?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/908316514938159184/Screenshot_2021-11-11-12-25-19-688_org.mozilla.firefox.jpg
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works for me
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> redmi 9
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> how
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe update ur apps or smth
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Ok it works, I've checked it yesterday and it didn't work. Don't ask me why x)
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if teewebs could be used. We already can do an emscripten build of the client
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the client editor itself sucks
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it's not the greatest
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reworking it as an external tool is the best imho
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Editor2 in 0.7 is looking much better imo
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where is necropotame
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think he started a external editor
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he is gone
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeuniverse?
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He just disappeared
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I fear it might be because I wasn't very optimistic about teeuniverse stuff
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some maps might be too large to load on phone
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho heinrich was mostly okay with merging his stuff. Idk why he left
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe some drama in infclass?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly his greatest legacy is broken syncing in envelopes :P
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Remind me never to let Learath2 write a eulogy ðŸ˜„
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :P
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL the word eulogy
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jore> Lately my fps keep randomly dropping to around 144ish and tabbing out and back in again seems to fix it for a short period of time until it happens again. Any ideas why this might be happening and how to fix it permanently?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, any pattern to it? I know you said randomly but try to think about the times it happens
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had this happen with windows 10 trying to index my harddrive while I'm playing
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the issue is common enough and it didnt use to happen before you can also try an older version like 15.5 or 15.4 to see if it disappears
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> I've a Suggestion: Please add tune enter on and tune enter off tile. So u can stand next to each other but with different tuning.
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> Would open many many new possibilities for parts
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then you can't predict tuning
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in client
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you'd have to send current tuning info for each player to each player
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> on win10 those menus that appear when changing brightness or volume take mouse priority over the game and can be clicked despite being invisible in fullscreen mode
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/908360250661433344/unknown.png
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jore> ill try to observe it for a bit longer but tbh it really doesnt seem to have a pattern as for now and ill make sure to check out the old versions as well thanks!
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing more fun than compiling using 100% cpu and having 5 fans on ur case
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like i have race car in my room
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :poggers: minecraft performance
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> it looks very very strange when this input bar is down
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @CÃ¸ke lol its the best
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know for 1 handed purposes
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur reach the bottom easier
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> fap king speaks
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt chrome have it at bottom too?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> fap king :monkalaugh:
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> idk
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Omagawd Next Time paste meaning
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a speech or writing in praise of a person or thing, especially a set oration in honor of a deceased person.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i somehow have the feeling its a server issue, that its not shown in master sometimes. sometimes only a restart seems to fix it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weird, but i have the same register code as ddnet basically, logic wise
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But it doenst make sense if its a normal request xd becasuse they work
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a normal request, I have a feeling it is an error in masterserver logic
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Httpmasterserver that is
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it'd be great if you can get us a tcpdump when your server isn't visible. That'd be the most useful
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what command
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe script it so it's easier? It shouldnt be too hard to wget the serverlist, jq to filter for your server, tcpdump if it's not there
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you mean xd
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> server isnt visible right now, i could do it just now
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if you are there when it happens you can just do `tcpdump -c 10000 -w out port <the port for your gameserver>`
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it will record sensitive data
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well yes, ofc. If you don't trust us with that I guess just record it and heinrich can give you a further filter so you can create a dump with only data relevant to debugging
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just record it now in any case
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> have one
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol my ddnet lcient just crashed?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 15.6.x is so unstable
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gosh :/
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i know whether there even was a request in that dump?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was just 3 sec or so
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm that's too short. Maybe remove the -c 10000 and just record like 20 seconds
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will be massive so @heinrich5991 will need to provide a filter
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will just record like 100k packets
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just use a watch?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> XD
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> bruh moment
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i thought there was an argument for seconds instead of packet amount
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> understandable xd

18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> discord fuck u
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 server is back in list without restart
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> Nub
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I got the dump fokko?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> U got the dump fokko?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> U can add the master server ips to the tcpdump filter then it wonâ€™t be too big and wonâ€™t contain sensitive data
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut\:run this as root and then press ctrl+c after 20 secs```
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tcpdump -w master.pcap port 8303 and host master1.teeworlds.com or host master2.teeworlds.com or host master3.teeworlds.com
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have it already as i said
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice to know
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh i didnt see the message
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait does the bridge swallow messages? \:c
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah nvm its there
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If you got the filter captured already and want to share the censored version you can also apply the filter on your capture file
