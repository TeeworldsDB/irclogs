00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: I donâ€™t have any windows near by .\_.
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need your help here
00:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or can I run a debugger in the CI so it prints a trace there? Isnt windows all gui? Or does it support gdb?
00:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Troll
00:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Indeed
00:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I asked robyte twice to run the debugger on his machine and he replied with run the exe in a debugger
00:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wine?
00:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Wine has a debugger too yes
00:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I think our vscode workspace even has run targets for it
00:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t even have the exe to begin with
07:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> #9512 is ready to be reviewd! I had to scrap a major update, because I really don't know how to properly do it. But as of right now, I hope people have fun with this!

08:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks booked my flight 210â‚¬ so ill be there hehe
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> waiting made me save 100â‚¬
09:04 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @ryozuki when the automap pr gets merged i'll go through the entirety of editor_props.cpp and make it all consistant
09:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
09:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> the lines u changed should be changed now
09:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> its how it works
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can make also another pr after to fix it all
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh u made it const in this pr
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i thought u didnt want to do it now xD
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know how to squash it all
09:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like, i'm saying i want to go through EVERY instance of `int r = PopupSelect[...]Result();` and make it consistant with the new code format you're having me do
09:07 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea i've been squashing
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, nice
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> all variables that arent meant to be changed should be made const
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++ made the bad decision to make stuff non const by default
09:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> it prevents optimizations
09:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> right
09:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im just sad i didnt get guides to work out like i wanted it to
09:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> but oh well
09:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> feels like another "only me" update
09:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> plus too hard
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> what do u mean by only me? xD
09:09 < bridge> <hectavoxel> like, i do not see anyone except for me and maybe souly to use the automapper guides feature
09:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i did save the progress tho, it's in here: https://github.com/VoxelDoesCode/ddnet/tree/automap_guides
09:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i **will** figure it out. someday
09:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh yea when this gets merged i'll try and handle the wiki update too
09:21 < bridge> <hectavoxel> So far, no merge conflicts with #8644
09:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8644
09:21 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i hope
11:31 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: You can run `gdb` on Windows with MSYS2, but I didn't get any crash to begin with. I can try later if it crashes when compiling with MSVC.
11:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> living in a basement, huh?
11:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
12:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> good one xd
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank you @robyt3 
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki what is your opinion on keeping pre as small as possible? Imo #9651 could at least be two prs. This reduces discussion per pr and merges it faster. Reduces the git conflicts with other pre. And makes reviewing easier.
12:34 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9651
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not possible with these kind of changes
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont wanna
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I see
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I wonder if I am alone with that idea
12:36 < bridge> <pioooooo> is anyone working on accounts right now?
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i held back a bit, that pr could be 5k lines
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you don't have to hold back
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just split it
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for example all the ``const`` adds could be one pr that can be merged instantly without any discussion. Now its a bunch of lines that might conflict because the other more controversial changes require discussions.
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess ur right
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im lazy now
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe ill do it sometime
12:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> I wish to know what I can do to make it closer to accounts
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea dw I just wanted to make sure that me splitting up prs is not upsetting anyone
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pioooooo there are a bunch of issues about accounts maybe there are some tasks to pick up
12:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> i saw there is one by juppey under the ddnet-account repo but that's like general stuff
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can for example help by testing this @pioooooo   https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-accounts/issues/1
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes try to get it running and test the official instance
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it is polished enough you could even start already implementing it in ddnet c++
12:43 < bridge> <pioooooo> yeah i just want to know if someone is already doing this
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think the only one working on it is jupstar and he is quite busy with other stuff. I doubt he will start to write c++ any time soon or ever
12:45 < bridge> <pioooooo> thx i might try to read ddnet-rs impl first
13:28 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> @chillerdragon yo ! Do you have a mechanism to ban a player with something else than IP address ? By username or idk ?
13:30 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> On the machine itself or within your teeworlds servers*
13:33 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Hwid ban maybe ?
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I don't see any need in it as long as we don't have the technical solution for server-client encryption
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you can easily execute bans save after banning someone, then ping the other servers on the network to re-read the bans file
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or using fifo
13:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> might be easier
13:40 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> I see, but, is ban save a rcon command or is it at lower level ?
13:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think it's a rcon command. at least in F-DDrace I made one then
13:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but I dont have bans syncing
13:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just fifo would be ideal
13:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> exec the bans file using fifo after another server has saved the bans after a new ban has been added
13:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/28a17566a0dcf9b4ca62a648f7919f8146c599e9/src/engine/shared/netban.cpp#L290
13:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You can trigger the function by calling ExecuteLine() anywhere you want with the bans_save cmd
13:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/8db0aa0adba4d791f84deda8e0c226c8c321ab35/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4537
13:45 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Could be interesting yes
13:48 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Cool ! But is it implemented on the save fng servers ðŸ˜„ ?
13:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah
13:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nop
13:49 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Ah, knew it xd
13:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ohh i see you wanted to have it on ddnetinsta
13:49 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Yep
13:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do a pr
13:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chiller will approve
13:49 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> But, ban save does not seem to solve my original problem xd
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea needs script setups to actually call fifo
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon:
13:50 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> The problem is simple : banned players by ip that spoof their ip
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ahhhhhh
13:50 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> The problem is simple : banned players by ip address that spoof their ip address
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ddnet has a name ban system
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> so has ddnet insta then, cuz based on ddnet
13:51 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Thats why i asked this xd 1336676136960397442

13:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Only by name ? This players dont care about usernames and saved points :justatest:
13:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Dm me
13:52 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> K thanks
14:42 < bridge> <meloÆž> Set up dnsbl, namebans and IP range bans
14:44 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> I dont see how dnsbl fix the problem xd, ip range doesnt make sens wtf. Or am i missing something ?
14:45 < bridge> <meloÆž> If someone restarts his router to dodge a ban, it absolutely can help :p
14:46 < bridge> <meloÆž> People can easily bypass with dynamic IP, but they most of the time don't exceed ~2K ips
14:46 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Yes but, in 2025,everybody uses proxies
14:46 < bridge> <meloÆž> Which can be handled with proper range bans
14:46 < bridge> <meloÆž> Just blacklist
14:46 < bridge> <meloÆž> :monkalaugh:
14:47 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Even if we assume this, or do i know a range per player xd ?
14:47 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> I have to ask internet provider :justatest: ?
14:48 < bridge> <meloÆž> You just ban the range from 0-255 really
14:48 < bridge> <meloÆž> 1.1.1.0 - 1.1.1.255
14:48 < bridge> <meloÆž> You could look up the IP range of the ISP, but banning that may have a lot of backlash
15:23 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Mhmhm yes
15:24 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> I had another solution but it requires client and server modification
15:24 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> For now ill just ban by name and ips i guess
15:25 < bridge> <smaragt> where can i change the size of the gameskin
15:25 < bridge> <smaragt> where the pistol is and stuff
15:33 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> $configdir
15:34 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> And in this folder you should find a data folder if i remember good
15:34 < bridge> <smaragt> wait so i dont have to look in the source code?
15:34 < bridge> <broso56> They want to change how big its actually rendered as xd
15:34 < bridge> <smaragt> yes this right here
15:35 < bridge> <broso56> Cause I don't think you can increase pistol size much in the image
15:36 < bridge> <smaragt> thats sadly true
15:36 < bridge> <smaragt> ive noticed that i (probably placebo idc tho lol) play better with a bigger weapon
15:37 < bridge> <smaragt> thast why i want to change the actual size of the pistol image to be bigger just to see how it feels
15:38 < bridge> <broso56> I mean you can maybe increase the size a bit, but it doesn't sound like it's enough for what you want xd
15:39 < bridge> <smaragt> if you mean by making the pistol image bigger then no its no enough haha
16:35 < bridge> <meloÆž> just the pistol or all weapons?
16:35 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336721890940555284/like_dis.mp4?ex=67a4d6c5&is=67a38545&hm=81f106427da7cfed45bd9f59752c9e9d6b56c3432f8d99c4b6ec1e30952c4a23&
16:36 < bridge> <mirfay123> :greenthing:
16:36 < bridge> <teero777> crazy skill
16:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> look for `Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_WeaponEmoteQuadContainerIndex, QuadOffset, WeaponPosition.x, WeaponPosition.y);`
16:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
16:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> and change it to something like this:
16:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
16:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> `Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_WeaponEmoteQuadContainerIndex, QuadOffset, WeaponPosition.x, WeaponPosition.y, 2.0f, 2.0f);`
16:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> my weapon was scaled up to 50.0f, 50.0f - as a reference point
16:41 < bridge> <meloÆž> btw dont blame the gun design, i still suck at inkscape :PepeCringe:
17:51 < bridge> <broso56> its beautiful
17:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi developas
18:54 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes, but if you have a proper dnsbl you can catch most of the proxies tho
18:55 < bridge> <Nagi01 {LAN}> True true
19:16 < bridge> <smaragt> wtf hahahaha
19:17 < bridge> <smaragt> i mean if you can make the hammer a bit bigger as well sure!
19:19 < bridge> <smaragt> also thanks
19:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is no such thing.
20:09 < bridge> <meloÆž> sure thing
20:09 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336775743891570779/asd.mp4?ex=67a508ed&is=67a3b76d&hm=caabb905b903de118926de8e3f8bda58eb5316f274d20b3755553ad38dfed35c&
20:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hammer time
20:12 < bridge> <meloÆž> chiller, imagine ddnet-rs where the server can just tell the client to render the hammer in this size, and you walk over and banhammer someone
20:12 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336776529056759990/image.png?ex=67a509a8&is=67a3b828&hm=114094bef75ed22cd964bba54dd27b35d06ec27bc6029b04f1c2a5cae0820ec7&
20:12 < bridge> <meloÆž> just imagine
20:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ban hammer is epic
20:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I wrote a mod once where all players have ban hammer
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @blaiszephyr: does ddnet-rs feel like ddnet to you? Can you play it without it feeling annoyingly off?
20:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> funny thing is that ddnet isnt fully implemented yet
20:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> but i can say that playing ctf feels exactly the way you want it to feel like
20:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> fluent
20:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> i had a lot of fun playing ctf against @gerdoe in ddnet-rs
20:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> like - vanilla is just great
20:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this the type of shit terraria calamity is on
20:39 < bridge> <louis> i rememebr that mode
20:39 < bridge> <louis> rly frustrating
20:49 < bridge> <smaragt> double u tee ef
20:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> extra range when
20:50 < bridge> <smaragt> @blaiszephyr btw i cannot find the line of code you sent in here on the source code thing website idk im not really a coding god
20:50 < bridge> <meloÆž> dont worry - i might just make it a variable you can change in t-client
20:50 < bridge> <meloÆž> its funny after all
20:51 < bridge> <smaragt> i want it now tho ðŸ˜­
20:51 < bridge> <smaragt> isnt it just like 1 or 2 line of code where i put in a different number
20:51 < bridge> <meloÆž> its 1 line of code per weapon you need to change yes xD
20:51 < bridge> <meloÆž> as mentioned, there are 5 occurances of this code: `Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_WeaponEmoteQuadContainerIndex, QuadOffset, WeaponPosition.x, WeaponPosition.y, 2.0f, 2.0f);` for each weapon
20:52 < bridge> <meloÆž> as mentioned, there are 5 occurances of this code: `Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_WeaponEmoteQuadContainerIndex, QuadOffset, WeaponPosition.x, WeaponPosition.y` for each weapon
20:52 < bridge> <smaragt> i copy pasted the exact line and tried to find it with ctrl + f
20:52 < bridge> <meloÆž> and all you need to do is add 2 float values
20:52 < bridge> <smaragt> but it didnt find it
20:52 < bridge> <meloÆž> where did you look?
20:52 < bridge> <meloÆž> like source code thingie website, wdym?
20:53 < bridge> <smaragt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336786695403601931/image.png?ex=67a51320&is=67a3c1a0&hm=f6d3d20f7f6deb3e7c1214a60d06dde9c2d0ca8b77687faf3968ca9137062b3f&
20:53 < bridge> <smaragt> yes
20:53 < bridge> <smaragt> the github
20:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you gotta compile after that yea?
20:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> yes - you need to do it yourself if you want it immediatly
20:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> now does that change the entire ddnet folder or just the exe
20:56 < bridge> <smaragt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1336787474080464896/image.png?ex=67a513da&is=67a3c25a&hm=82c4a37aca37cd3e5d8db18084c1356a6e3b3f5f51c9a65d63af47cf234f65f5&
20:56 < bridge> <meloÆž> i dont think that greps (looks through each file) - but rather just searches for.. files
20:57 < bridge> <meloÆž> src/game/client/components/players.cpp at line ~670
20:57 < bridge> <meloÆž> src/game/client/components/players.cpp at around ~670
20:57 < bridge> <smaragt> maybe but ive probably looked into every file that i at least think it would be in
20:57 < bridge> <meloÆž> src/game/client/components/players.cpp at around ~675
20:57 < bridge> <smaragt> and it never popped up
20:58 < bridge> <smaragt> bruh ofc the 1 file i didnt look into ðŸ’€
20:59 < bridge> <mirfay123> bros still trying to make a client and he just wants to make the pistol bigger
20:59 < bridge> <smaragt> so do i just download that client and change the number?
20:59 < bridge> <mirfay123> i remember this guy from like 7 hrs ago
20:59 < bridge> <smaragt> hahahahaha
20:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> :nouis:  it sadly doesnt work like that - you need to compile it yourself
20:59 < bridge> <mirfay123> give up your dreams if you are not a dev sadly ðŸ˜”
20:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> i'm eepy so idont want to go through this step
21:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> its quite a bit of setup for just a small change like this - i'll add it to T-Client maybe today/tomorrow
21:00 < bridge> <smaragt> water fak
21:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> its quite a bit of setup for just a small change like this - i'll PR it to T-Client maybe today/tomorrow
21:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> water fak
21:04 < bridge> <mirfay123> water fuck:nouis:
21:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> :wtf:
22:01 < bridge> <oxyzo.> make it bigger, like i dont even see the hammer
22:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lucky you. For me itâ€™s unplayable .\_.
23:35 < bridge> <louis> so the problem seemed to be with sv_register somehow
23:36 < bridge> <louis> got some error about curl version being too low to both register in ipv4 and ipv6
23:36 < bridge> <louis> not sure how that even happened
