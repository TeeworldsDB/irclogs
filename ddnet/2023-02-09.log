10:42 < bridge> <Patiga> the edits make it hard to read, maybe just send more messages :)
10:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe don't use better discord :)
10:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> jk
10:42 < bridge> <Patiga> I use the normal discord client
10:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but how would the edits make it unreadable
10:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> i thought you used the bd plugin that shows you all edits made
10:42 < bridge> <Patiga> the way that the sg interacts with the tee is explained on the shotgun page, maybe you can have a look
10:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> which indeed decreases readability
10:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> i thought you used the bd plugin that shows you all edits made (history)
10:43 < bridge> <Patiga> nah its just that it gets reformatted and I have to seach for any changes in the text I already read
10:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea I just appended to the end
10:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> so if you continue to read where you stopped, it continues normally
10:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> guess that is hard if the horizontal word position changes as well (which it shouldn't do?)
10:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> but that is a good suggestion
10:46 < bridge> <Patiga> ah it isn't described in as much detail as I thought, the last paragraph here is important https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Shotgun#Advanced_Behaviour
10:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but isn't it the same
10:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> pulling you to the direction it came from -> getting you to its origin/reflection points
10:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> pulling you to the direction it came from -> getting you to its origin/reflection point
10:48 < bridge> <Patiga> there is a slight difference, which gets more important the close you are to the origin
10:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> strength?
10:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> just a factor
10:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> doesn't change the definition
10:49 < bridge> <Patiga> that is the reason why you can gain speed while walking by shooting the sg to the bottom-right
10:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> ah that
10:50 < bridge> <Patiga> the amount of speed that the sg gives you is constant, buf it the pull-direction points into a wall some of that momentum is lost of course
10:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> would be easier to just read the code
10:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> but that stuff is coded nested af
10:52 < bridge> <Patiga> not sure how much it effects sg fly, it might make you slow done less depending on how you aim
10:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://youtu.be/oLr6rbyNC2A?t=168
10:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> i mean you can watch it in slowmotion
10:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> timestamp is set
10:52 < bridge> <Patiga> what do you want to figure out in the code?
10:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> calculation of the pull
10:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> then I could put that into the sg page as well technically

10:53 < bridge> <antonio_michelle> https://t.me/+BQlhudqWXGk1MWY0
10:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> but it is more important for the understanding
10:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> but it is more important for the understanding (for myself)
10:54 < bridge> <Patiga> ah, I thought that the direction would be enough
10:54 < bridge> <Patiga> the strength would also fit into the sg article, that would be nice :)
10:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah key factor here is that the dummy bumps you
10:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> otherwise you can't stay with the shotgun in the air by yourself
10:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah key factor here is that the dummy bumps you (and the shotgun accelerates your velocity created by that bump)
10:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah key factor here is that the dummy bumps you (and the shotgun accelerates your velocity created by that bump, i want to know the formula for that acceleration)
10:55 < bridge> <Patiga> calculating how much speed the bump gives you will be hard to calculate
10:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's not the goal
10:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> you couldn't calculate it because it won't be constant
10:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> you couldn't calculate it because it won't be constant
10:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I could at least then explain why it works
10:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> you couldn't calculate it because it won't be constant
10:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I could at least then explain why it works based on facts
10:57 < bridge> <Patiga> sounds nice, good luck :)
10:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> "good luck". I expected the dev here to help! xd
10:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> i don't know where to find the code for that
10:58 < bridge> <Patiga> well hard to help if you don't give questions, you seemed satisfied ^^
10:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> based on the code I found it creates a negative explosion, questionmark

11:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> what's the formula the game or server uses to change the position of the tee shot by a shotgun beam
11:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> based on the code I found it creates a negative explosion, questionmark. ah nevermind that is an OR:

11:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> got it. prediction. entities. laser.cpp.
11:04 < bridge> <Patiga> ah, then you were faster than me, I also haven't seen or touched that part of the code yet
11:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea see. it is pure acceleration.

11:08 < bridge> <Patiga> nice, as expected
11:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> sorry for hijacking your question that could be solved using google. bump.
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> default be like https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1675937661.png
11:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> :PepeLaugh:
11:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> you'd think I would get banned for spamming
11:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> if you didnt know you can solve everything with internet
11:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but if you are too tired to ask the proper questions, try out ChatGPT
11:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> but oh well, you said your country isn't supported
11:17 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> oh wow
11:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but if you are too tired to ask *google* the proper questions, try out ChatGPT
11:17 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> imagine crying about this and not helping
11:17 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> just ignore it then
11:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> you picked it up as toxic
11:18 < bridge> <DefaultO> i just advertise that ai because it is hilariously useful
11:18 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> why would people even ask here anything if everything can be solved with google and ai
11:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> to ask questions like I did
11:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> because that stuff isn't documented anywhere but hidden in the code
11:19 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> oh well, fuck me then
11:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> wait I help you out
11:19 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> next time i will ask before asking
11:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I don't understand your question
11:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> don't ask to ask
11:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://dontasktoask.com/
11:21 < bridge> <Patiga> I think you didn't pick up on @MilkeeyCat's sarcasm there
11:21 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> but i wont know will it be a good enough question to ask here
11:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> if it was sarcasm he probably wouldn't have deleted the question
11:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> if it is sarcasm, I am impressed by your acting
11:22 < bridge> <Patiga> @MilkeeyCat I don't think there is any problem with your questions here. figuring stuff out on your own is also important ofc, but using the shortcut of a chat is very much okay when you feel like it
11:23 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> bro i just even didnt know how to google it
11:23 < bridge> <Patiga> well then asking here is the best thing you can do :)
11:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> i didn't understand your question either
11:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> you gave us an image
11:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> and a cryptig prompt
11:23 < bridge> <DefaultO> and a cryptic prompt
11:23 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> anyways that was too bad question im so sorry, i will never happen again
11:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> better be!
11:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> did you show us the whole table
11:24 < bridge> <Patiga> @DefaultO I assumed they deleted that message because you (probably accidentally) made them feel bad with "sorry for hijacking your question that could be solved using google"
11:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> you had 4 rows of permission flags @MilkeeyCat
11:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> you had 4 rows of permission flags (4 columns) @MilkeeyCat
11:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> and you said you wanted only one row
11:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> how do we know which row you want
11:25 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> just forget it dude i will google it
11:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's what I didn't get
11:26 < bridge> <DefaultO> guess we will never know which row you wanted
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can someone explain how snap items work \:) im trying to manually create a character snap item with no data (mem zerod) and then debug dump the snap to verify id and type are set correctly but i do not get the expected type back
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```c
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   CSnapshotBuilder Builder;
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 	Builder.Init();
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   const int ObjCharSize = 88;
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   const int CharID = 0;
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   void *pObj = Builder.NewItem(NETOBJTYPE_CHARACTER, CharID, ObjCharSize);
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   mem_zero(pObj, ObjCharSize);
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   CSnapshot SnapDestPlaceHolder;

11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> the id 0 worked and the mem zero on the data
11:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> but the type is 0
11:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> so i wondered where its looking up the type and printed a bunch of memory addresses and it seems to lookup the type in the data memory
11:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> in `NewItem` i printed the items memory address when its being added `2023-02-09 11:31:00 I new_item: pObj=0x7ffcddb38410 set type and id to (9 << 16) | 0 == 589824`
11:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> in the `CSnapshotItem::ID()` getter i printed where its looking up the id `[item] &m_TypeAndID = 0x7ffcddb38414`
11:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> the way i understand this is that the actual item starts at 0x7ffcddb38410 and in the first 4 bytes m\_TypeAndID is located. But later when dumping the items and asking for its id it somehow seems to look at 0x7ffcddb38414 which is 4 bytes off
11:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> what did i not understand?
11:37 < bridge> <0108ben> How do u type as a bot?
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea nvm i mean type and id share the 4 bytes so id doesnt work either i tested with another id than 0
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> not that it makes much more sense now
11:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```C
11:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   protocol7::CNetObj_Character Char;

11:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon>   mem_copy(pObj, &Char, ObjCharSize);
11:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```setting data works wonderfully
11:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> oh wait now it set type and id too?! xd
11:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wait is the mem zero bad?
11:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sorry for rubber ducking on a whole channel
11:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ok this works```C

11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> mem_copy(pObj, &Char, ObjCharSize);
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```where this also zeros the  type and id?```C
11:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> mem_zero(pObj, ObjCharSize);

11:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> oh but this also works? xd```C

11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf u even doin
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use Char = {}
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That initializes it
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Copying structs works with normal assignment

12:05 <+ChillerDragon> in what
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Adding more 0.7 bloat
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> the value is being able to join 0.7 servers with ddnet client
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds completely useless
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And bloat
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> does not sound useless to me
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then please don't pr it to ddnet
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> and as suggested by lerato and heinrich i try to keep the bloat minimal by keeping most 0.6 code untouched
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> thats the whole point
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's a regression to have 0.7 dependencies
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> if you want to make it cleaner than me pls go ahead
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> because of two protocols?
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Better work on next gen networking packet stuff
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> sounds useless to me
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Firstly that and secondly because it basically has the same problems as 0.6
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It fixed 2-3 issues that's it
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No value
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> the value is compability
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vanilla is also dead
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Compatibility to what?
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> to teeworlds
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To windows 1995?
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> windows 1995 is 0.6
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> :p
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Teeworlds is dead bro
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oy is afk since one year
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He wasn't convinced dropping maintenance
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> makes it even more sad ddnet cant catch up with it
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He clearly is not interested in tw survival
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> he is not
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> he publicly stated that
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> See. So let this die. It hurts my feelings
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That an evil person like Oy exists
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> im not doing it for oy
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> im doing it for my self
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U are a necromancer
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> >  The practice of supposedly communicating with the spirits of the dead in order to predict the future.
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder how people wrote c/c++ code without ubsan/asan its literally impossible to debug and none of the things make sense
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> *insert ryo rust comment here*
12:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> debug using brain > ubsan/asan
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> ok mr brain
12:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🧠
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U could say the same about logic errors. You can break down the bug until u find the reason
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yup
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also in cpp stop using stuff like mem zero. U really rarely need it
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe if u want to fill a buffer of data or smth
12:17  * bridge <fokkonaut> insert angry noby here
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Noby is next level coder
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He is allowed
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> how do you break down things if it breaks in random places :D
12:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> he's just allowed cuz his brain has all the synapses to comprehend what he is writing there
12:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wonder where they all come from 🥦
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In single threaded programs it should not be"random"
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But since u work on network related stuff. Maybe print the packets, when they arrive and what it current state was
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> oh trust me i did
12:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what exactly is breaking
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> show me any binary dump and i see tee positions
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then u see which state was updated and get a feeling for the program flow
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> notin is breaking rn suprisigly cuz asan catched all random bugs
12:21  * bridge <fokkonaut> slaps chillerdragon
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> but they were in such unexpected places in code i wrote like months ago
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> u
12:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> question
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> wot
12:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> how can asan catch random bugs if it runs on a computer which doesnt know about randomness
12:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🧌
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :troll:
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> it detects randomness using blockchain and AI
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> discord troll
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> blockchain? where is eirk
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> erik
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chiller btw ddnet++ gametype is DDraceNetwork not DDNet++
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just that one guy hosting ddpp fixed it i believe
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> after i told him how :D
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> rofl
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> i dont remeber why i didnt change it
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> i think because it doesnt cut off well
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lazyness
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> better than DDraceNetwork
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> iirc it becomes ddnet+
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and F-DDrace becomes F-DDrac
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> could name it DDraceNetwork++
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> we should really make the gametype field a little bigger
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 1 character :troll-1:
12:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :troll:
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> lul
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ok 2
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I hate Java
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> xXxiDDRace128++xXx
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> C++ so much better
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> omg
12:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u forgot the underscores between the x's and text
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> sori
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> np
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> uwu
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wuw
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> ok i go bak to snaps
12:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> snapchat user
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 okay given a 0.7 ``CSnapshot`` i should be able to generate a new 0.6 ``CSnapshot`` not sure tho where to store it and who allocates memory for it and who frees it the whole snapshot storage prev/current/alt is not making much sense to me
12:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the snapshots are not changed
12:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just the data gets sorted in 0.7
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> yea that much i got 
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> you mean not changed by the client after receive right?
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> but on receive they are stored in some CHolder
12:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No, there is no difference
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> and then freed in the Purge
12:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The altsnap is the one the client uses
12:37 <+ChillerDragon> i was thinking about adding a new ``CSnapshot *m_pTransSnap`` here that holds the snap that was translated from 0.7 to 0.6 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/911bd0e69a8fee9b02f0cea26d50ecc2f000bc3c/src/engine/shared/snapshot.h#L123
12:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> cant you put the translated data into the altsnap and use it like that
12:38 <+ChillerDragon> yea maybe but then i still do not know how to manage memory allocation
12:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I wouldnt put extra stuff in it, just translate everything on the layer before
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> but keeping the raw 0.7 snap is nice for diffing new deltas
12:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the server also doesnt keep the untranslated 0.7 packets.
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> the server also doesnt have to unpack snaps ._.
12:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> shouldnt be a problem
12:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> if you always translate everything u should get a diff aswell
12:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats what i thought too in the beginning but i like heinrichs idea better now of going over a full snap and translating it
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> seems less intrusive
12:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
13:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Just trying to learn opengl to help develop deeworlds https://github.com/gotroyb127/deeworlds
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> okay i think i got the memory stuff worked out at least asan is not bitching 
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=translated_07_snap.mp4&u=chiller
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> first proof of concept of a full snap translation
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> this was recorded with a ddnet client on a 0.7 server
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> all translation of the character snap item happens in snapshot.cpp the gameclient.cpp is untouched and thinks its on a 0.6 server
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
13:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's only zogtib's work atm but he's occupied with making a text editor :kek:. Previously he was occupied with implementing a build system :kek:. In the feature he might be occupied with something else :kek:
13:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> `It is under development so don't expect anything yet.` :kek: more like `It's not`

16:58 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> ddrac
17:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Elo
17:21 < bridge> <deen> I would say so. I never understood why bors needed to be a separate tool, that is basic functionality
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yea

20:25 < bridge> <Александр Язов> hi what speed should internet be for ddnet server
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ~50kbps
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be enough xd
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u have problems, then its most probably your ping is unstable
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and not the internet speed
