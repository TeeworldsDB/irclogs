11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> @scrumplex the gentoo ebuild is outdated on 7.2
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> for prism
11:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> on https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-action/prismlauncher it says that it's "testing"
11:21 < bridge> <scrumplex> i dont know what that means
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its masked
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> oka ill unmask
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> on gentoo they actually test packages unlike arch so they make them masked if they arent tested yet

20:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1225517485697007666/image.png?ex=66216b19&is=660ef619&hm=d2571ac586715f8178505aa79eaf41505490cd665d28c78356ffe8433325ebb7&
20:49 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> XDDD
20:49 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> thanks it was fast
20:50 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> me dumb
20:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> idea add this as overlay to client
21:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use exclude field instead of that thing xD
21:01 < bridge> <headshotnoby> not enough arrows
21:01 < bridge> <peter0x44> Gcc 14 has -finline-stringops which might help
21:02 < bridge> <peter0x44> It still doesn't seem that reliable though
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm?
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i missed what happens now
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 3
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem here is that gcc recognizes the code inside their own memcpy as a memcpy like code and replaces it tona memcpy call
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah too bad
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem here is that gcc recognizes the code inside their own memcpy as a memcpy like code and replaces it to a memcpy call
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> which doesnt exist because that itself is the implementation
21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok by their i mean the user who submitted the bug
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's defs a funny bug, 200 iq optimization xdd
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> this opt works fine in normal environments but here they making their own std so they like in standalone mode
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> will edlang also do clever optimizations like that?
21:10 < bridge> <f4babaphantom> İ need developer
21:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i need job
21:12 < bridge> <f4babaphantom> No no
21:12 < bridge> <f4babaphantom> İ need developer Man to ask something

21:15 < bridge> <f4babaphantom> İ can't finish
21:15 < bridge> <f4babaphantom> Theres 4 non [a] map 300ms
21:17 < bridge> <archimede67> @f4babaphantom This isn't KoG, this is DDNet. You can ask them on their discord at https://discord.kog.tw
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> it depends on llvm
21:28 < bridge> <archimede67> @murpi you should make the bot send the kog message whenever someone mentions kog or login or account
22:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> when accounts
22:40 < bridge> <chairn> damn, nice 10 years old bug
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the horrible part is that 2013 doesnt sound like 10 years for me :lol:
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time moves so fast lately
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i would say this is why Linus torvals says its unsafe to use -O3 on the kernel
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> the bug doesnt happen with O2
23:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1225550931181961267/GKTfGBaaAAADRZL.png?ex=66218a3f&is=660f153f&hm=28919394ed11b1c06768a015312ddade561b0342e333837a13ff1082d664be32&
