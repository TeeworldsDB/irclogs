07:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > You can use this to install your own custom Trashmap instance. I'm not running one on the official DDNet RUS server since it's already pretty weak resource wise. If you have specific questions timakro and I could help since we both set it up at least once I guess. From my memory:
07:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > 
07:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > Create a user "trashmap" with home direct ory /srv/trashmap. Clone the git repo into that directory directly. Put the nginx config into your /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/. Put a DDNet-Server executable in /srv/trashmap/srv directory. Probably I forgot a few steps.
07:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or maybe i could just sponsor a usa trashmap for ddnet
08:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, it's possible to run it, but not so easy
08:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some small server for 5 â‚¬ / month from Linode would probably be ok for it. Not sure where to reach timakro if you want him to run it

20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it always looks so awful
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the content behind the link is nice though ðŸ™‚
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found lot of rly good old tech are in blogspot
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i cant bring myself to read that
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try reader mode, it'll probably fuck up the code blocks

20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the code blocks were optional though, can read w/o

22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I've been using the alpha for the past 2 weeks, and I'm blown away. Copilot guesses the exact code I want to write about one in ten times, and the rest of the time it suggests something rather good, or completely off. But when it guesses right, it feels like it's reading my mind.

22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It's really like pair programming, even though I'm coding alone. I have a better understanding of my own code, and I tend to give better names and descriptions to my methods. I write better code, documentation, and tests.

22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> many skeptical comments are there as well
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> > Automation has always produced an increase in jobs so far, although sometimes in a disruptive way. I consider this like the switch from instruction-level programming to compiled languages, a level of abstraction added that buys a large increase in productivity and makes projects affordable that werenâ€™t affordable before. If anything this will probably lead to a boom in development work. But thereâ€™s a bunch of low skill programmers who
