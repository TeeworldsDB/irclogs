00:11 < bridge> <Voxel> ddnet update when
00:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Jupeyy_Keks ig ur sleeping now but on the fng2 repo (0.6 source idk about 0.7) it doesn't want to compile. I added `#include <cstdint>` in src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp and then it compiled ;)

05:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How can I test this
05:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Make pr 😉
07:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Compiling 0.6 in 2023 you also still use python2 axaxaxa
08:00 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> I know few people who still make mods on 0.6 base

08:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fddr is very based indeed

09:31 < bridge> <Matodor> \🥺
10:06 < bridge> <Robyt3> There is a `restart` client command now, so you can restart with that. Restarting doesn't work for me with Windowed and Windowed Fullscreen mode with Vulkan. Maybe it only happens on Windows though.
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I saw the issue and didn't find the command back then in the client. Is it only available in non steam? Or did I simply check the same day when it was merged ^^
10:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, I found the bug when I made the PR to add the command, it should be in every version now
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Alright will test later on Linux first
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is the client process actually killed? Or how exactly do we restart
10:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> We perform as much cleanup in the running client as possible, then we launch the client again, then the already running client exits
10:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> Really, the `shell_execute` to start the client should be the last code we run (except on android)
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see, weird weird
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it's a new process it should work anyway
10:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe something is happening in an automatically invoked destructor after the new process is launched
10:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> Or it's a special bug with Vulkan because it can't create a window or something
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In opengl it works?
10:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah
10:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> And also in the other Fullscreen modes
10:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> Only Vulkan and Windowed/Windowed Fullscreen have the bug
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe anti virus thinks u want to Bitcoin😂
10:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's Windows Defender so it shouldn't be smart enough 😄

12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Disaster planning → Every byte of source-code history for SQLite is cryptographically protected and is automatically replicated to multiple geographically separated servers, in datacenters owned by different companies. Thousands of additional clones exist on private servers around the world. The primary developers of SQLite live in different regions of the world. SQLite can survive a continental catastrophe.
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can we survive a continental catastrophe?
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs yes
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://sqlite.org/lts.html
12:23 < bridge> <jao> if catalonia survive
12:24 < bridge> <Robyt3> I set the override while in the respective build directory. `rustup show` also shows that the override appears to be active in that folder
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe the override should be in the base dir?
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not the build dir
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They are such weirdos no joke xd
12:27 < bridge> <Robyt3> override in base dir would defeat the purpose of the override though
12:27 < bridge> <Robyt3> I have one build dir for msvc and one for gnu
12:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Continental catastrophe yes, bicontinental catastrophe maybe. If only the americas remain we might be fucked 😛
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well ddnet is in the github artic vault
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'd need to figure out the working directory of the build, I guess
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's likely not the build dir
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe that could be fixed
12:35 < bridge> <Robyt3> the override should work for every sub-directory according to the documentation
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it only depends on the working directory of cargo, I think
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that means that if the build process call cargo from the source directory, only that will appl
12:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> y
12:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> I don't know when and how cargo is called in MSVC, but I assume MSVC's working directory is not the build folder
12:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> But I just run make from the command line when building with GNU, so I assume that the override should at least work there
12:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can look into the makefile to see what the working directory is there
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> WORKING_DIRECTORY
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     Execute the command with the given current working directory. If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like it's the source directory by default

14:54 < bridge> <Learath2> ah, just spotted the `rm core*` 😄 I guess I don't get to debug
14:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Am I insane for thinking it's normal for server to reflect a bit under ddos?
14:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> should be normal, depending on what gets sent
14:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Is 1:1.1 max and 1:0.06 avg absurd?
14:57 < bridge> <Learath2> This dude is talking to me like we are reflecting an insane amount of traffic but we are reflecting like 3kbps under 3mbps
14:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Why dont you just stop ddos?????

15:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let me tell you about TCP SYN
15:42 < bridge> <Voxel> question: which part of ddnet code do you think is the most stale rn?
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> all
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> non rust code
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but by definition, most physics code
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz it cant be touched
15:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> kinda contradictory
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we cant rly optimize the gameworld either
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> paralelizing it would change the order of stuff
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which probs bugs uses
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> old ≠ bad, in case that's the reason for the question
15:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> whats the unicode for that symbol
15:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use python to find out:
15:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i could also use google
15:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but i actually wanted to know whether you use alt+numpad for those
15:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and if you have these in your mind
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I use compose + / + =
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to create that symbol
15:48 < bridge> <Voxel> i was mostly talking about something that DOES need a rehaul
15:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wym
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on linux, you can bind some key to "compose"
15:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ahhh
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I use the mostly useless caps lock key for that
15:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea thats cool
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> u keep holding compose? and press all these letters in a row?
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> ~}~}~}
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> yea idk man
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel the whole 0.6 thing should be removed if you want to get active
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, you first press compose, then you press /, then you press =
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the earlier keys can be released
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> idk what my compose is F

15:53 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 can u bridge #off-topic to irc?
15:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xxxxd
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not even bridged to matrix yet, is it?
15:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i daut it
15:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to resize a hashmap u need to rehash everything right
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 im curious, u guys ever implemented a hashmap
15:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never did before, but it seems quite simple
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't remember implementing one
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> *correct
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a way to do partial rehashing iirc
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108031076305215620/image.png
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> screensot to preserve math
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 no it is not bridged to matrix yet. But irc really needs a channel to goof around a bit. This irc channel is basically all social media i have so i shitpost way to much for a developer channel
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> too*
16:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> antisocial media
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> i need a channel where i can ping jopsti and ask him for legal advice
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes when i am bored i hop on irc and talk out of my ass i feel like it sometimes spams away some useful dev related things
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> can someone send brain and explain ddneto codeinger
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/22df50c9bda271fbef4e2c7c28793384d48e0a80/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L922
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> ```if(m_aNetClient[CONN_MAIN].State() != NET_CONNSTATE_ONLINE && m_aNetClient[CONN_MAIN].State() != NET_CONNSTATE_PENDING)```
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> is calling .State() on da netclient and comparing it against NET_CONNSTATE_..
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/22df50c9bda271fbef4e2c7c28793384d48e0a80/src/engine/shared/network_client.cpp#L147
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> easy?
16:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> CONNSTATE is something different than STATE
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> but CNetClient::State() does return ``return NETSTATE_ONLINE;``
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if ur main is not online return
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> NETSTATE_
16:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> CONNSTATE is used within network_conn
16:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it just maps them
16:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> to the other enm
16:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> to the other enum
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> it maps connstate to netstate right
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> but it compares to the enum it is mapped away from in my head
16:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea this should be cleaned up
16:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its probably about the same tho
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> ::State() maps ``NET_CONNSTATE..`` to ``NETSTATE_..`` and then State() is called and compared to ``NET_CONNSTATE_..``
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> no they are not the same
16:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> then check which values are the "real" values
16:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> so map the connstates back to netstae
16:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> from where u compare it to State()
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm i think they are same
16:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/22df50c9bda271fbef4e2c7c28793384d48e0a80/src/engine/shared/network.h#L46

16:10 <+ChillerDragon> i swear my vscode bugged at me
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> it showed diff value hints
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> i blame electron
16:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> this is false then tho
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> A IT BAK
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> my vs mf says NET_CONNSTATE_ONLINE = 4 and NETSTATE_ONLINE = 2
16:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684246504.png
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> that took longer to make than i would like to admit
16:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> did you try restarting your computer
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> tf is happening to all the people reporting bugs with the scoreboard=
16:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the scoreboard sorting is broken, I guess
16:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> not only that
16:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but why now
16:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1107988430291468388
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> wait no they do differ my vs is right
16:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they do differ, but its off by 1 for you anyways
16:17 < bridge> <Voxel> i COULD but idk how to do backend
16:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> NET_CONNSTATE_ONLINE = 3,
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/22df50c9bda271fbef4e2c7c28793384d48e0a80/src/engine/shared/network.h#L48

16:18 <+ChillerDragon> its 4 in my branch because i messed with it
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> but in master its 3 vs 2
16:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> confusor dregon
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> yeye fakof
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> but its broken isnt it?
16:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> somethings wrong, i can feel it
16:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
16:26 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tas0O586t80
16:26 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I understand now everything I need to know about C
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> it used to work because pending overlaps w online or sms
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> i make pr and let merges fix my bug
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> ez
16:30 < bridge> <Voxel> so wait whats happening now
16:30 < bridge> <Voxel> are we adding MORE or LESS 0.6 support
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon wants to remove 0.6 support
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we don't have consensus on that though
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i am a rare 0.7 activist
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes i glu my self against ddnet headquater
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> as a form of peaceful protest
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want to remove 0.6 and 0.7 support
16:40 < bridge> <Learath2> A couple times. I mostly go for closed addressing ones but when I was learning I also implemented open addressing ones
16:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> confused dragon
16:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :poggers2:
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 xd ubuntu decided to not work
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> all ci failed
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> gh actions* decided to not work
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ur a linked lists fan
16:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> typical c dev
16:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no language stereotypes please
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its banter
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 but its true C devs like a lot linked lists, whereas rust devs hate them for obvious reasons
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I told you "no banter"
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> god..
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok no jokes zone im sorry
16:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot we must be robots
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I will time you out the next time. no jokes is not correct. jokes without disparaging others are fine
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we rly have different ways of thoughts
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at no point i thought i was offensive, and i know learath in this context
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know i will do this again unconsioucly and u will time me out
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its inevitable
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's fine if you write this in DMs
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (as long as Learath2 doesn't complain about you)
16:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why so strict?
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but this is a public room, people other than you and Learath2 read this
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i am talking to learath
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and I think this sets a bad tone for the room
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i disagree
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> you set a bad tone
16:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> where me must be formal robots
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we obviously don't need to be formal
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (or robots, for that matter)
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u know what i mean
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont take everything at face value
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. idk, to me the robots thing looks like a straw man, and I get annoyed every time you mention it
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also get annoyed everytide u do this
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> everytime
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> me: posting snail 9/11 meme
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich: pls fix embed
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> ryo: typical c dev
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich: stop insult c or ban
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no bias
16:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki I sadly noticed, that other communities than DDNet are even less tolerating "our behaviour".
16:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's a trend, but since Teeworlds and it's community is stuck in 2007 anyways, its a little bit better over here.
16:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just heinrich really wants to go with that trend of having 100% clean communities with not even slight jokes that may go 10% "over the top"
16:57 < bridge> <Matodor> pls allow 0.7 to die 🥺
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> *stop insult c devs or ban
16:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am on other servers and this banter is perfectly normal
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> completly unrelated to ddnet
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or tw
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i specially consider this banter normal given our time we spent here
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and how much we chatted in the past
16:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but it seems like we must treat each other here like we met yesterday
16:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
16:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> me too
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're welcome to treat each other differently *in DMs*
16:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but not in a room with a lot of other people
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dms are useless
16:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> can we do that in off-topic?
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont redirect stuff to dms
16:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> there are exactly the same amount of people
16:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i disagree with this rule
16:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not on this discord
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want to vote on this
16:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want other mods involved
16:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what even happened if i may ask
17:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> this time
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^
17:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i said this
17:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> judge for urself
17:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> index sized 'lol'
17:00  * bridge <fokkonaut> index sized 'lol'
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 please say smth
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont want to live in heinrich dictatorship
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i ***know*** i will make banter again
17:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its how i am
17:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i think that really is very harsh
17:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> non-programmers wouldnt understand and programmers would laugh
17:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> smile*
17:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not the first time and it will not be the last time
17:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> so is it also disallowed that noby says fng > gores or that others say fng sux
17:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ?
17:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
17:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bruv
17:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bruh
17:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut dont mention that
17:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he will say no to anything
17:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> *asks if he can say yes*
17:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont say that
17:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u may get timeouted
17:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and me saying you may get timeouted is probs timeout worthy
17:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we live in a society
17:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sarcasm is close to banter after all
17:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hm.
17:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it rly grinds my gears tho
17:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i feel you
17:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just ask
17:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but anyways, i think we cant change it for now
17:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that i get moderated by anyone but heinrich
17:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
17:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😉
17:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea there is a little bit of dictatorship going on here, also when i asked a lot of people if they actually like the freeze bar or want the stars back.
17:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> so many wanted the stars back, and not only after 5 days, no also after weeks.
17:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And when I finally annoyed learath long enough, he said he will work on something similar, which takes the old behaviour and can be made into stars again by modifiying the png.
17:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What did we get after months of people complaining it's never been the same without the stars? nothing :(
17:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> trol
17:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont be rude
17:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dont make me laugh in the office, it's time now, been here for 9.5 hours
17:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i will go now
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> same
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my day is shit
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz this
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mood totally ruined
17:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> smoke a blunt
17:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or just drink a beer
17:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> anyways i will drive home now, see ya
17:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont do that now only on weekends
17:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true, better that
17:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact this somehow makes me wanna not be so motivated to make more prs
17:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill just let robyt take over ddnet
17:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (this is not banter)
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
17:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6594 two more issues with the score PR btw
17:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> first one already fixed
17:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> second one already fixed
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what a good day to not be in the mood to do prs
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and for github ci to fail catastrophicaly
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki maybe it motivates you that hashmaps have overhead and are only worth it after a certain amount of items
17:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the hashmap needs to be done
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u know whats funny?
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often combine a double linked list with a hashmap
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice way to have smth like a queue and still have the speed of a hashmap
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice if u want to remove items from the "queue" without much overhead
17:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have the perfect gif @Jupeyy_Keks
17:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/jos%C3%A9mourinho-big-trouble-if-i-speak-prefer-not-to-speak-interview-gif-16725048
17:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats my answer
17:42 < bridge> <Voxel> ngl i just want ddnet coding to be fun
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then use rust
17:42 < bridge> <Voxel> its why i do graphical stuff
17:42 < bridge> <Voxel> rust is not fun tho
17:42 < bridge> <Voxel> i tried it
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
17:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 😬
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do u dislike about it btw?
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too hard?
17:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> coding is fun, but it can be really annoying, like discord chats
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say not everything is perfect, but if u redesign what you want to code it can be powerful tool
17:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to me 1 thing that makes me hooked is those moments u enter the zen zone
17:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u lose awareness of time and have super efficiency xd
17:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and then someone distracts u
17:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and its over
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cool i never had that
17:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rly?
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, couldnt tell
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the best moments for me is, when i think about smth and it just works out as i planned even tho i didn't 100% believe it myself xd
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and saving 2 milliseonds somewhere for more performance
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs performance is everything
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
17:47 < bridge> <Voxel> afk
17:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which is why i think software should be distributed with x86-v2 and -v3
17:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so users can pick
17:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not just v1
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> -v3 is enough
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> drop support
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108058359921389679/image.png
17:48 < bridge> <Learath2> I will have to disagree with this one, honestly you'll have to accept that some jokes are about a group of people, it's part of normal human communication. I feel this level of moderation will turn this place into just a boring old academic exchange/company slack
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my child deserves to live in a world where only 4090+ exist
17:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when do u think we will no longer ship v1 software
17:49 < bridge> <Learath2> If the jokes aren't grossly offensive (streotyping usually isn't) or hateful about a minority (X language developers aren't an oppressed minority), I would conclude that they are acceptable
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i guess around 15-20 years?
17:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lifespan
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not in 15-20years sry xd
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was unclear
17:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iwas about to make a c joke
17:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my bad
17:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think e.g. "web devs bad" is a bad meme to perpetuate
17:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this seems to fall under the same umbrella to me
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are 2 kinds of webdevs, those who use js and those who use wasm
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/squidward-daring-today-spongebob-spongebob-meme-daring-today-arent-we-gif-23808696
17:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🤣:justatest:
17:52 < bridge> <Learath2> (This is obviously just my subjective opinion on what makes a community enjoyable in the long-term from my own experiences)
17:52 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't, why is that "bad" to perpetuate? Is it a misconception that causes them harm?
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, I think so
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> web devs are among the top earner devs
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more so than cpp devs
17:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you think so, then in how far does it harm?
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by casually treating them as inferior
17:54 < bridge> <Learath2> I can only see it hurting their egos, but in turn they are also allowed to say "look at this C luser commenting on js, come back when you have garbage collection"
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am also a web dev
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a rust dev
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a c dev
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and a ex python dev
17:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Please delete and ban everyone who is using "gay" in a wrong meaning too, please.
17:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's definitely more descrimination than "web devs bad"
17:54 < bridge> <snail> i think it causes more harm to force a community to hold themselves and not being able to joke around rather than allowing a few banter that are not really hurting anyones feelings (past the 10 seconds reading the poke)
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> joking around on the expense of others
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you include that in the post? ^^
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not against jokes
17:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If you want to enforce *everything* then please do so with *everything* and dont leave out a single little bit, heinrich
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is not at the expense of others
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think only u treat it that way
17:56 < bridge> <snail> i mean this is not kindergarten
17:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Appearently it is
17:56 < bridge> <snail> it wasnt very rude or anything
17:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> welcome
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am laughing with him, because i know how he will react to this
17:56 < bridge> <snail> its just a poke
17:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that I wasn't claiming that it hurt Learath2
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> U did
17:57 < bridge> <Learath2> It's supposed to be a joke, the point of jokes is that they don't imply anything. I don't think web developers are bad because it's a meme, we are capable of extrapolating from reality
17:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And you didnt elaborate
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what I wanted to say there is not that the intended recipient is getting hurt, but others from the mentioned group
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. I did *not* want to say that Learath2 was hurt by this statement
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as Learath2 incorporated in his statements, but not fokkonaut or snail e.g.
17:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Do you think web devs will read that and cry alone in front of their computer?
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you think you'll cry if I ban you? what kind of standard is this?
17:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I, for example, dont feel offended by "web devs bad" and its my daily business
17:59 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm fairly sure you can drop that meme in irc.libera.chat/#c and no one would really bat an eye. I don't have any bigger community of C developers you can test it on
17:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Just because YOU do
17:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Toxic.
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only as toxic as you were
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I just directed the same thing to you
17:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no offense, this reminds me of the white girls meme on twitter complaining in name of the affected group
17:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Sorry, I dont speak wrong
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which meme?
18:00 < bridge> <Learath2> That we overuse linked lists
18:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not at all, I think you didnt read my message
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact, it would probably spark a interesting debate, if no one complained about in the name of others groups
18:00 < bridge> <Learath2> You'll get a couple laughs, a couple people telling you why that's the case and maybe one person telling you to get out if you don't have a question
18:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ^
18:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Do you think web devs will read that and cry alone in front of their computer?
18:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I want a higher standard than people not crying
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> See my replied msg
18:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you are a web dev, you didn't cry
18:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why do you want to convert this chat to a business setting?
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> then whats your standard if you cant even say in how far it will harm someone?
18:02 < bridge> <Voxel> i grew up on a website where you connects blocks together to make a cat spin and say hello; i have no idea how to approach something as abstract as rust
18:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my standard is that I don't want to be casually insulted "as a meme"
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> with all my respect heinrich, i believe the only one crying about these "pokes" is you
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact, even at my work slack we joke around about java and  java devs (and we got some java devs)
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my standard is that I don't want to be casually insulted "as a meme" (as part of a group)
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> same
18:03 < bridge> <Voxel> besides, rust is the perfect language to rq
18:03 < bridge> <Voxel> imagine you're trying to make something and you have to spend an hour or more trying to obey the compiler only to realize you coded it all wrong
18:03 < bridge> <Learath2> If I made a joke about Rust devs being scared of memory management, do you think that'd be an insult really?
18:03 < bridge> <Learath2> If so we really have very very different measures of what constitutes an insult to begin with
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm, no
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its cuz u have a bias
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if its rust, since its mostly me who talks about it here
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure u wouldnt bat an eye
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if someone made a joke about me/rust
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i will say, go ahead, and joke about it, and about me
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i find it fun
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> even funnier is the debate that comes out of it
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, it's not very easy to come to a conclusion about things of this nature. I know very well jokes can quickly devolve into mean-spirited insulting, but I don't think that bar has been reached here
18:05 < bridge> <Voxel> i often get those when writing those JS extensions
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see your point, it seems the C example was not so bad
18:05 < bridge> <Voxel> this is why i only code at like 12 am LOL
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i used to code rly late
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i cant now
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i go to sleep at 23
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess coding all day does that
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well today i havent been much productive
18:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 different approach, what is the highest bar of joke or whatever, which you would consider "fun" and "non-harmful", and what is the lowest bar for "harmful" or "unfunny" jokes?
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u cant put a bar on subjective things
18:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Right.
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but in this case the bar is whathever heinrich considers
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz he is the man in power
18:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I wanted to hear that from him @Ryozuki
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he probs wont say that
18:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Because I kinda know how heinrich thinks, its similar to my brother, who you can not convince at all either (only with very very much time and good/proven examples)
18:08 < bridge> <Learath2> The web dev example you gave is maybe a little closer to your point. One could argue that these stereotypes cause a bad perception of the group, but even then, I'm not sure what material harm is caused by that. It's not like the accusation of being a bad developer is something that sticks to you
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> lol fokkonaut how did u made the bridge do /me on irc xd
18:08 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wdym?
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well, the easiest way to make jokes that are non-harmful is by not making it about other people ^^
18:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont think the mentioned jokes were about other people specific
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very simple, tryhard 15h per day for 2 months
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez as that
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> *c devs*
18:09 < bridge> <Voxel> i have a job
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's a group of people to me
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then rip to your holidays
18:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (I have about 3 minutes left)
18:10 < bridge> <Voxel> i barely celebrate holidays anyways + i work in retail
18:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> A very large group which if you'd let them vote, you'd probably know the result already :)
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> laughing and making fun of stereotypes is the most common thing to joke about usually
18:10 < bridge> <Learath2> 15h a day?? to learn rust?
18:10 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah i do it all the time to rust devs
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u start at 0, u need that
18:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well u can take it slower
18:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> majority votes is not the way I'd go about finding out whether something causes offense
18:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> majority votes are not the way I'd go about finding out whether something causes offense
18:11 < bridge> <Learath2> 3h a day and you'll be pretty decent in a month, especially if you have prior experience in other languages
18:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> right, you'd like to be a dictator and decide alone.
18:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's precisely what I'd say…
18:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you read minds?
18:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
18:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im a rust dev
18:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> So, what about you let those who are involved decide, and come to you if they felt offended?
18:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a bad strategy
18:12 < bridge> <Learath2> 15h/d * 30d/mo * 2mo= 900h, you'll become an expert in that time, not just a proficient user 😄
18:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is the way in most places
18:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yep xd
18:12 < bridge> <Voxel> thats the thing, i dont find interest in coding things as "practice". whats the fun in making a guessing game? its why i wanted to jump head first into ddnet because there was so much to tinker with
18:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki thats already kinda pathetic at this point.
18:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, in most places, we have societal standards that get you kicked out even before someone tells you that they've been offended
18:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> heinrich comes out and creates a issue out of nowhere, then this happens
18:13 < bridge> <Voxel> idek whats going on. sorry am i interrupting something?
18:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I tried to lead you that way by asking for the bars, which cant be set here entirely.
18:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i made a joke about c devs, replying to learath
18:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and heinrich said thats bad bad
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like your tone
18:13 < bridge> <Voxel> oh
18:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm off
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> wow u guys write so much i can not keep up @fokkonaut i mean this xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684253618.png
18:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Sorry if it sounded too harsh
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bra, 15h or u stay noob
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> under 1000h is nothing
18:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: i edited the msg
18:14 < bridge> <Learath2> In my experience, learning is usually either fun or efficient. It very rarely is both, but there are some great exercises that hit that spot
18:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a good strategy in these types of convos is to go away, and it cools off, so later u can come strong and still pretend u have the reason
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> do again @fokkonaut
18:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> .-.
18:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> wot
18:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> done
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684253692.png
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> no * | bridge
18:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hm xd
18:16 < bridge> <Voxel> thing is i WANT to try rust because i feel like you can do a lot more in it than c++ or java can do
18:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u cant do more with it than other langs
18:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats not the point
18:16 < bridge> <Learath2> You did this one with me a couple months ago too and it is a little mean-spirited. Kinda feels like bullying when you tag other people and talk about me when I'm still here
18:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyways @heinrich5991, I probably dont know each english word perfectly, so it might have sounded too harsh when i said "pathetic".
18:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I just cant express myself as good in english as I can in German.
18:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Please dont discriminate me accordingly.
18:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And all I want is you to realise, that your way of solving the problems is definitely not one, that is enjoyable for the community
18:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if a lang is turing complete u can do anything
18:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I just wanted ryo to see the msg i am referring to
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich bullying foko for being english nob axaxax
18:17 < bridge> <Learath2> They are all turing complete, so you can do everything in all of the above. So you shouldn't bother learning Rust if that is your reason
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> rust is fast and safe
18:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more like heinrich wanting to impose his standards to a whole ass community, part of the most active community members telling him otherwise, and him not minding it
18:18 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess the extremely rich std lib and the cargo ecosystem does make it easier to make more things
18:18 < bridge> <Voxel> I guess.
18:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (its only enjoyable for yourself @heinrich5991)
18:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 
18:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Learath2 see, how I am referring again, its not meant in that way
18:18 < bridge> <Voxel> I feel like rust is built for servers and stuff then
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> its a systems programming language they say
18:18 < bridge> <Learath2> It's built for everyone and everything except web frontends 😄
18:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can do web frontend
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> but its more tedious
18:19 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess it's also not safe enough to replace Erlang
18:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://yew.rs/
18:19 < bridge> <Learath2> Just because you can, doesn't mean you should 😄
18:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> in general you trade development time with runtime speed and safety
18:19 < bridge> <Voxel> What would server code in ddnet look like in rust
18:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and future memory safety bug solving time
18:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imho better and more structured, but also would cpp if we rewrote ddnet enirely
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel if you want safe and fast software then use rust. If you want fast development and fun dev time use scratch
18:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Similar, perhaps more tidy because we have to think about the ownership structure
18:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki I find it a little sad, everytine someone runs out of arguments, its a few mins left until they leave.
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.stemtastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/scratch-1.jpg
18:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a rly good strategy in online convos, just dont speak, specially efficient if u hold the power
18:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And again the problem is not solved and wont be discussed at that same point again in the future
18:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i will probs be timeouted by him
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i wil have no way to argue
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> defending myself
18:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yup
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he straight up timeouts me these days
18:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> without warnings
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> edgy-l
18:21 < bridge> <Learath2> I have been recently thinking about some rust rewrite and it's actually not as easy as I thought, can you really avoid all the `Rc`s and `Arc`s everywhere when some things like `CCharacter` have shared ownership?
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> gotta ask @zwelf how he delt with it in his phsiscs rust code
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i will say, using rc and interior mutability is not that bad if u have no other options
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, by cheating
18:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Same for me, just happened today, when I pinged Learath in General to reply to someone who wanted to know what happened to Turkey servers.
18:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I felt a little uncomfortable and deleted the ping again like a few seconds later without thinking about it.
18:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 20 sec later -> timeout
18:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u want to model shared ownership u use rc and refcell
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 u can easily cheat on the borrow checker.. simply use an index
18:22 < bridge> <Voxel> i DO use scratch !!!!!!!!!!!
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame
18:23 < bridge> <Learath2> It's not THAT bad but it's still kinda wasting performance, since it can be proven by the code-path that the actions are safe even without the presence of an `Rc`
18:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki (referring to immediate timeouts u talked about)
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what shared ownership do we even have
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unsafe then
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or model the program in a way to avoid that design
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel xd
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its often bad to enforce a style that doesnt feel natural on a language
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, u need to pass the characters down from parent
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> think functional xdd
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> i def got my parents character
18:24 < bridge> <Learath2> `CEntity` is one example, who really owns entities? Does `CGameWorld` own all of them? Does the character own the projectiles they send? Does the player own the `CCharacter`? It can technically be avoided by letting `CGameWorld` own all of it and going through it whenever you need to access other things, but there is no guarantee that gets optimized nicely at all
18:25 < bridge> <Voxel> no chiller, unironically ive been using scratch since 2014
18:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust would benefit here if we paralelized ddnet more
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep, but the way would be to only let world own it
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel i never doubted you eventho it is a bit unexpected
18:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but we wouldnt have these segfaults or asan
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the rest has to query it
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> any bugs suck tho, they are just not hidden
18:26 < bridge> <Learath2> But then you need to dig through a list of all entities to find the one you need or the gameworld needs to be aware of all kinds of queries that would be done in advance and create data structures to efficiently return them. Which is imho breaking encapsulation, why should the gameworld need to know that the character might require a list of all his alive projectiles and arrange storage that way?
18:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, I need to shut the fuck up and turn off discord. I really have to study control theory
18:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Cya'll
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bye

20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i say bad things about java devs, i mean it

21:29 <+ChillerDragon> even gnome has better windowing and windows has window in the name ffs
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> windows + windowed mode = tripple buffering

21:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> lumpy approves
21:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> Also tried with SDL 2.26.5, where the issue still persists, but now the window is just black instead of not being rendered at all
21:37 < bridge> <Voxel> wait, is roby3 pronounced Raw-Bite or Raw-Bite-Three, or something else?
21:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> ro-byte
21:39 <+ChillerDragon> roby t3
21:39 < bridge> <Voxel> dang
21:39 < bridge> <Voxel> i was saying raw-byte-three all this time
21:40 <+ChillerDragon> saying to who?
21:40 < bridge> <Voxel> what
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> who do you talk with when you say robys name?
21:42 < bridge> <Voxel> myself
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> so in your head?
21:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its l33t speach
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> a
21:42 < bridge> <Voxel> yes
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> i pronounce roby as robyt3 in my head xxxxxxxxxxxxxD
21:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how do u say ryo
21:42 < bridge> <Voxel> robyt3 seems too formal for l33t speech LOL
21:43 < bridge> <Voxel> Wry-Oh-Zoo-Key
21:43 <+ChillerDragon> roiii zuchini

21:44 < bridge> <Learath2> https://ddnet.org/stats/server/#tur.ddnet.org
21:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Am I reading these graphs wrong:
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> yes
21:44 < bridge> <Learath2> This dude claims we were sending out 350 Mbit
21:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Do you see 350 Mbit there?
21:45 < bridge> <Patiga> oh sick I just ordered it, maybe could've interviewed your opinion on gpus first :bluekitty: 
21:45 < bridge> <Patiga> is your experience with it nice?
21:45 < bridge> <Learath2> That'd be like 43 MB/s, that's insane
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga u replied to jupstis amd gpu i assume?
21:46 < bridge> <Patiga> yap
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> wow one has to install sqlite3 on windows these days to compile ddnet
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> hm
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u could have bought mine xD
21:47 < bridge> <Patiga> xd
21:47 < bridge> <Patiga> good sign
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its good enough for what i need rn, baldurs gate 3 is a bit over 60fps with max settings
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thats already bit of struggle xd
21:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> baldurs gate is badly optimized
21:48 < bridge> <Patiga> so you wanna upgrade rn? :p
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it looks fucking beatiful
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i know someone to sell my gpu to i do it xd
21:49 < bridge> <Patiga> welp, I suppose I should've messaged you first, but for a different reason than I thought
21:51 <+ChillerDragon> wow windows deps are really annoying is there some doc on how to get them?
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git submodule update --init --recusrive
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dont quote me on that
21:51 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt git pull do that
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if submodules changed and were init before
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then usually yes
21:52 <+ChillerDragon> i did git pull in the ddnet folder that used to compile back in the days when i used windows xd
21:52 <+ChillerDragon> but indeed
21:53 <+ChillerDragon> git submodule update fixed it xd
21:53 <+ChillerDragon> weird tho
21:55 <+ChillerDragon> so its roby being able to do the windowing on multiple devices and nobody can reproduce?
21:55 <+ChillerDragon> we all drunk?
21:56 <+ChillerDragon> bruder was SDL2.dll kann nich gefunden werden omg why is that so annoying
22:12 <+ChillerDragon> ok i restarted into updated windows and ran selfcompiled with the nightly dlls and restart in windowed still worked fine
22:13 <+ChillerDragon> last time i was on windows i could just run the client wherever the build spit the exe out now i had to move it into the nightly folder for it to find the correct dlls thats a bit weird
22:15 < bridge> <Chairn> week 14 has some spikes above 100M/s but incoming, not outgoing
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has multihair color support

22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just the cinematic intro
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is a fucking hollywood movie
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder how expensive it was
22:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:20 < bridge> <Voxel> 100gb? bloat
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> worth every GB
22:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my ssd is happy to be used for it
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's honored
22:21 < bridge> <Voxel> how so? so that only the latest nvidea graphics card could run it?
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have amd
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and linux
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and its DRM free
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's anything but bloat
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> i dont think games should be able to be that big
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> in general
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> i dont think games should not* be able to be that big
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aren't you an artist?
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its so big bcs of art
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not bcs the code is so big
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> exactly
22:22 < bridge> <Voxel> its storing like a million useless textures
22:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk about that
22:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a big game
22:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u gotta support 4k
22:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and audio
22:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has lot of speech
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/120GB-Patriot-Burst-2-5Zoll--6-4cm--SATA-3D-NAND-QLC--PBE120GS25SSDR-_1390728.html
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u gotta pay 9€ extra for the game
22:28 < bridge> <marmare_314> Just did 👍
22:30 < bridge> <Voxel> is the game going to be like
22:30 < bridge> <Voxel> $70
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> worth every penny
22:31 < bridge> <Voxel> :justatest:
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bought for 59€ bcs EA
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its drm free, u can share same game with a friend
22:31 < bridge> <Voxel> no thanks, i'd rather stick to my free, lightweight and open source game
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i'd suggest to buy it, bcs best game
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and worth money spent
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hope its actually finished when they release 😂
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else im sad
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hope they dont do the EA & Ubisoft move
22:33 < bridge> <Voxel> i wonder how much crunch these devs are under
22:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> Can you also remove the padding on the right side? I think it looks better with consistent padding on all sides
22:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1108130234122911815/image.png
22:34 < bridge> <Voxel> I think it looks fine. Maybe decreased at least.
22:34 < bridge> <Voxel> Oh right, consistent padding
22:34 < bridge> <Voxel> I misread

23:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like stardew's music better 😄
23:54 < bridge> <louis> sorry for my opinion but stardew valley music was quite a letdown when i heard it
23:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh 😮
23:54 < bridge> <louis> i've heard people praising it but it really just wasn't all that for me
