15:14 < shorefire> deen: I hope you take what I said into consideration, I say it only because I care.
15:32 <@deen> shorefire: I don't consider DDNet a single community and I don't think they should be subject to a single set of rules. There are many subcommunities of people who mainly play with each other. We could forbid insults for example, but some groups insult among each other (jokingly or not, no idea) and everyone in there is fine with that. Some basic rules are implicit though: No blocking, no insulting (only enfor
15:32 <@deen> ced on complaint), no botting. I like that people mostly get along with just voting, otherwise the few mods should be good enough (in Europe at least). For USA mods are needed indeed, but haven'T found any
15:44 < shorefire> I understand that and I can get behind that
15:44 < shorefire> but they are not enforced
15:45 < shorefire> Very very rarely are those few basic ruls ever enforced
15:45 < shorefire> (I'm currently watching Skeith troll for the past 2 hours in ddnet usa, with Broken just watching doing nothing, after multiple complaints :/)
15:46 < shorefire> I suppose finding some more moderators would be a good start
18:37 < eeeee> i've also been watching this shorefire troll for the pas few hours on irc
18:38 < eeeee> messaging #ddnet even though he hates it
18:38 < eeeee> and all the ops in the channel were just doing nothing!
18:48 < shorefire> Real mature
18:49 < shorefire> Can't even have a normal conversasion no?
18:51 < eeeee> i had a normal conversasion once. it was horrible.

19:04 < shorefire> sounds awful
