00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cant rn
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more info here https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Talk:Main_Page
01:03 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> What about letting every language have their own subdomain. If a language has its own independent page it is technically no translation and so the visualeditor problem should not occur. In your link it does not seem like the devs will solve this problem with translations soon.
01:03 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> The structure will be similiar to wikipedia where you mostly don't even have translations but  distinct articles for every language.
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> why do i have no ddnet rich presence in discord?
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> are u on latest version
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and do u have discord game presence enabled
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ye
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i have the steam version tho
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> nvm
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @louis about ur alt tab black screen, ever checked if you screen refresh rate is set correctly?
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs black screen is normally, that it changes the video mode
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I also rebased one pr, that adds desktop fullscreen and windowed fullscreen to the graphic options:
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3577/checks?check_run_id=2216275563
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If you want to try that out, maybe that helps, bcs it uses the desktop video mode directly
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alternativly it could be the color mode
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or HDR settings
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (from a quick research)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à¼ºLeÍ¥geÍ£nÍ«dà¼»á´³áµ’> Helal
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à¼ºLeÍ¥geÍ£nÍ«dà¼»á´³áµ’> Hello
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> When does ddnet get gores section
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (to replace kog finally)
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG is outdated and prevents features
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG makes KoG member only features
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG has less servers globally
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG is not open source, not transparent
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG is outdated and prevents features
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG makes KoG member only advantages
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG has less servers globally
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - KoG is not open source, not transparent
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's nice that we have some other hosters so people cant just ddos the entirety of teeworlds out of existence
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if ddnet gets a gores section then they need to be ddnet quality so u can't really replace kog
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, newer KoG maps have pretty high quality
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the end the gameplay is gores ofc, if u dislike that.. ok ðŸ˜„
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are some high quality gores but most on kog aren't
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in fact, some of the highest quality gores are on ddnet xD
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gameplay related?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or design?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> both
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i cant agree, gameplay is mostly good, design idk, always play entities, the gores maps on ddnet are rather boring
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª not #developer related and I'm against adding gores maps on DDNet. It's good to have some other active server hosters
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> springlobe is kinda gores btw
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it is a development of teeworlds in general
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it could host gores servers that have the same structure as ddnet(without dummy ofc)
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kog doesnt have the ddnet network char support thus they have no good prediction they dont have the spec thing too
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or maybe even with
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen so you are just against it, bcs u want diversity?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just tell me where to discuss it, bcs i am actually serious about this request
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which reset rate? the one in tw vs the one in system settings?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i can just asssume, but maybe the refresh rate is set to 59hz on the desktop, but tw uses 60 or smth similar
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it might be wrong and maybe just HDR setttings or color settings, but the client i posted has windowed and desktop fullscreen, which assuming SDL does its job correct, select the video mode the desktop is currently using
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so i hoped, that might help and is just a config in general
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> @deen the SA servers have been lagging for a few days now. Could a restart help?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think i checked hdr/color, didnt find anything
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and my monitor is set to 120
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill try client later
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok thanks
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac I doubt it. I'll ask hoster
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My fear is that they are just overselling their network bandwidth. Last time I complained about something like that they just put me on another network instantly, so it seems like they expected some people to complain about that
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Too bad the South African Hetzner is not providing virtual servers, otherwise I'd try them: https://xneelo.co.za/dedicated-servers/
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac they're having network problems atm: https://my.hostafrica.co.za/serverstatus.php
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is 0.5 master down?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Thanks for the update... fcking DDoSers
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think same masters as 0.6, but last time there was only 1 server left
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah there was a single FOOT server when we were having fun on ddrace 0.5 with heinrich, tsin and louis I think ðŸ˜›
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cuii.info/ueber-uns/
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rip free internet in germany :D
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/826180916422377532/unknown.png
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny how the community dislikes it xD
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut dns block sounds quite useless, especially since there is dns over https etc
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh, then 0.5 servers are seas finally :feelsbadman:
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh, then 0.5 servers are dead finally :feelsbadman:
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw were you looking for a specific mod?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or just for the flashbacks
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there were many standard servers and ddrace ones where i could spend my time without another players to achieve hard dose of nostalgia
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meh, now i should host them myself, but i don't have collection of 0.5 mods
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> especially maps
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I wonder if we'll ever have these intense feelings for 0.6 in 20 years^^
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I suggested /spec "playername" a thousand times.
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @n000b i dont mean this
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean the empty tee when u spec
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Empty tee is even better indeed
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But mine is ez to implement
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> /spec playername
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Oops sorry for the edit
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But my feature would be ez to implement
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe i made it
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @n000b the thing, to do this u need the ddnet network character
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i told him like 2 times to implement it
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> They diveded since ddnet9.0 something right
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this ddnet char basically transmits ddnet related information about the tee to the client
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the tee can do stuff properly
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> They miss alot of serverstuff
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> waiting for 0.8, even for 1.0 o.0
