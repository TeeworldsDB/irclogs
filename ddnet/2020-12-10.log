00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I quit, I swear
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_WotAlt:
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> nasal spray drug addict
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> its true
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> i was addict to that some time
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's one than two 
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> everyone busy or everyone ignores me
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> consider making issue on github for that
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nothing happens when i click it too
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> how? and where
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> here actually
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> (2nd link)
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and create new
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> should be know anything before this?
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> just write issue and enter?
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> just fill the description and issue name
05:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you can add that screenshot from above
05:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i think that devs rather look at issues than #developer
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok give me minute too make account
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :cagent_heart:
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh this automated come here nice
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> next time  i should be changed name the photo:brownbear:
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway thanks @Souly  and @louis
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :cagent_heart:
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did one of us work on cyberpunk 2077? 😛
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 40% cpu usage 20% gpu usage, 20 fps, like wtf
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> y u no just use more?
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> was this a front?
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> so rude @Learath2
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> limited by single-thread performance?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently it's task manager misreporting gpu utilization
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I'm at 100% gpu usage 😛
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess I'll have to play at low if I want 60fps :/
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786593186050998322/unknown.png
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so recommended specs mean 60 FPS at lowest settings? 😄
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> minimal specs must be 60 FPS in main menu then
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't do better than 34fps on ultra, though that's fairly stable
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I have a gpu bottleneck with a 1080, you'll definitely have one with a 1060 super, so yeah that would only run it at low
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (though I am on 1440p so the requirements probably don't apply)
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why is it so hard to get gpu utilization? On linux I don't even know if there is a way
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 Ryozuki sent me this
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786596795635597333/a9100f2ddf6883c6b78f669063c9fb3f29e8620f.png
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would upgrade my gpu, if anyone had any gpus in stock.......
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'd assume this table means 60 fps
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 i have a spare gtx 760 if u want
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :greenthing:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could probably work at 60fps at 1080p
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have a 2060 so I will play without raytracing xD
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> do u lose fps
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's what you get for buying the cheapest rtx card
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if u turn raytracing on?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't have it installed yet
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I assume there is DLSS support?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That could be a game changer
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc, it's an nvidia title
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can the 10x series do dlss?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but dlss is just cheating
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah you need rt cores to do dlss
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786597875206586408/Cyberpunk-2077-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-Official-PC-Performance-benchmarks-With-Ray-Tracing-DLSS-on-RTX-30.png
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rendering at 1080p and upscaling to 4k is meh, no matter how smart your algorithm is
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786598055666647100/Cyberpunk-2077-NVIDIA-4k.png
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 22 fps at 4k
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest:
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even the 3090 can't do ultra at 4k
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> This upscaling is insanely good, it produces better images than native
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> better than native?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't know at which "scaling ratio" it changes but at reasonable ratios yep
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds like marketing, how could guessing pixels ever be better than calculating what they actually should be?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> For 1080 -> 1440 I have seen the digital foundry video and either you can't tell the difference or the image is just cleaner
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do 50fps at 1080p ultra, so that's nice to see
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's machine learning stuff, they train their algorithm with insanely high supersampled renders
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it can be great at guessing and give you the exactly correct answer most of the time, I don't see how you can do better than correct though
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is dlss?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 upscaling with machine learning
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> A supersampled image always looks better than a native image, they the upscaling algorithm with super sampled images
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's why it *can* look better
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> A supersampled image always looks better than a native image, they train the upscaling algorithm with super sampled images
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think this is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWIKzRhYZm4
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> (Super sampling is rendering at higher resultion and then downscaling)
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But you can't tell any difference in one way or the other without pausing and zooming in and looking for it
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This video doesn't seem to have much comparison to native
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 3 way comparison at 6:06 is exactly what I would expect
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://youtu.be/YWIKzRhYZm4?t=392
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This also is no surprise, don't get me wrong, it's very good at upscaling, much better than most anything I've tried and it's even more impressive that they can get it to not flicker when moving
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's never going to get better than native rendering
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah it has a lot of comparions between 1.9 and 2.0 too which I don't care about
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (that is assuming you have the gpu/cpu power to render at those insane resolutions)
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Native looks better for the text, but 1080 -> 4k might to be pushing it
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Here he makes a point of the dlss looking better https://youtu.be/YWIKzRhYZm4?t=631
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I guess it's AA destroying the detail of the hair there. I wonder if a machine learning aa solution could help more here
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think the text is a especially bad example, overall I'll play everything with dlss, I really believe it's the future. AMD is working on the same thing
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Do AA solutions factor in motion vectors? I think that's the trick though I don't understand it ^^
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really hope it doesn't become a thing, it's bad for improvement
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are already pretty decent with ML now, they will milk this cow for atleast a decade, during which we will get no new hardware improvements
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially since we are oh so close to good performance at 1440p/4k beyond which increasing resolution really doesn't matter (unless you are working with one of those new very-high-dpi displays for VR)
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro on Linux I use intel_gpu_top, but Intel-specific of course
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a generation or two more and we'll have good native rendering at 4k, then they can mess around with whatever gimmick they want
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Will check that out, I have a integrated intel gpu as well
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> WEach nvidia generation gets more expensive and look a the increasing power consumption, the trend of the hardware improvements stagnating will continue
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Each nvidia generation gets more expensive and look a the increasing power consumption, the trend of the hardware improvements stagnating will continue
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 100% GPU usage at 3 W is ok
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/786604479201804308/screenshot-20201210154507.png
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, 50% there, 100% is 6 W actually
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen 100% for your gpu means drawing 3 triangles? xD
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If native 4k was beyond reach, I would agree, but it's like at our fingertips now. Even if the improvements drop exponentially we'd get there
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we get sucked up in this software competition, we'll have thousands of driver updates for 3 decades and same hardware rehashed
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 144hz wet my appetite for more :D
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You mean 4k at 60fps?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep 4k at 60fps, that's all I want before they give up on hardware altogether
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Aren't we already there with RTX 3080 / 3090?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Baaarely, most reasonable games are there, some heavier titles need that little bit more oomph
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I mean at their best qualities ofc, you can run 4k@60fps teeworlds with like gpus from 4 generations ago 😛 )
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't believe there is a stopping point really when "it's enough". Currently I think 1440p 60+fps with raytracing is ideal but there will come the next hot feature
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My rtx 2060 would be trash without dlss :D
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't see anyone ever wanting anything beyond 4k@144fps with raytracing
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> A few years ago you wouldn't have said raytracing because it wasn't a thing
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well raytracing has always been a thing
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Consumer cards with accelerated ray tracing is what's new
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What gpu would you want to buy for cyberpunk if you could get it for the "normal" price?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (iirc I even listened to a talk from carmack from like 10 years ago where he was saying ray-traced graphics would be the holy-grail)
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro Well I like futureproofing, I'd probably get a 3080
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also considered getting an AMD one, but they don't seem to be there yet
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah, it seems like the logical choice for my 1440p 1440hz screen but I'm really unsure because I find 700 is a lot
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Infinity Cache sounded like an excellent idea, some novelty
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If you want raytracing forget amd yep
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure they will get there soon, it's their first attempt at hardware accelerated ray tracing
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I shouldn't have bought a rtx 20 card ^^
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 700 is indeed a lot, though I think about it this way. I don't eat lunch for a week or two and use all my savings and it'll get me there 😛
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh I'd have to skip a lot of lunchs for that haha
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd take me 3 months of not eating at all to get there I think. I'd already saved up quite a bit to get a new cpu
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sounds kinda sick how you said that
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After AMD made like 10 cpus in total and sold all of them off, I was like "maybe I should get a PS5"
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But Sony sold all those off
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with rtx on at 4k on ultra
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw the game runs smooth on a 3080 with rtx ultra
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and a ryzen 5 3600
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have money I've saved to spend, that I would like to use, but everything I want to buy is sold out
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best is to wait till there is stock
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not worth buying a non 3000 nvidia rn tbh
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki if one can even find a 3080, yes it'd probably run smooth 😄
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly amd new gpu is not on par
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I definitely will play cyberpunk at launch to talk about it with my friends, so I already made peace with the fact that I will play on my rtx 2060
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm getting used to playing at 35 fps
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my sister got 1 thanks to me, i saw 1 day a unit in stock, after buying it there were none more
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It feels like I'm back in 2005
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get why they dont have stock tbh
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Probably lock to 30 fps then, right?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it feels unrealistic in this consumer world
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah locked to 30 fps and never looking at mirrors I can play faaairly smooth
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's odd that there is huge demand but no supply, right? 😄
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i play on a rx580 on medium, it still looks pretty dope
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> indeed
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same for ps5
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Who has a variable refresh rate screen? 🙋‍♂️
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are just not used to this, capitalism says there is profit to be made, why are they not making it?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sony gets money from the ps5 games, they probs lose money sellings ps5, scalpers wont buy games
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i cant understand sony
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what they are doing
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i doubt covid makes them not able to produce as much
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes 0 sense
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro I wanted one for a long time, but they are quite expensive
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is it
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a 144hz display
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant live with that
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki one thing that comes to mind is that maybe since in-store sales are bound to be low, they put all stock online where bots can grab them?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I got the AOC Q27G2U/BK Monitor for 340 € in july
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know u could make a lottery system on who can buy them
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not sell them by who got first
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this way normal ppl may be able to get em
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just use a better captcha
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or whathever they use
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless they hire 100 ppl to buy them
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk the extend of this mafia
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro wow that's a steal
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki Variable refresh rate is kinda what it says, the screen can adapt to the refresh rate the gpu can produce
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got 2 Dell U2715H monitors for 400e each, 4 years back
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But explaining variable refresh rate doesn't do it justice, you just need to see it, 55 fps is smooth and looks like 60
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love the monitors but at this price they are a bit lacking in the "gaming" department, no variable refresh rate, not high refresh rate
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great color accuracy though, I can't even use my old monitor as the 3rd monitor because the colors just look off on it next to these 😛
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know what advantage it has, 144hz display should display fine anything lower right
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it multiplicative
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki variable refresh rate almost completely eliminates any stuttering created by fluctuations in fps
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but with 144hz u rarely see them too
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont recall seeing any xd
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I remember playing on my old 1080 60hz monitor which is now my second monitor and I couldn't quite hit 60 fps and it looked worse than the last of us part II on my ps4 with perfect 30 fps frame pacing
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki as long as your system can consistently deliver 144 distinct frames to the screen everything is fine
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if you ever dip below 144 fps, a normal display just has to duplicate a frame
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't even know how it works for 144hz monitors without variable refresh rate. On 60 fps displays you can lock to 60 or 30 and it will look good
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can you lock to 60 on 144hz displays?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u have vsync on and under fps it shows tearing?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro lot of games have options for that
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> With vsync there is no tearing, just duplicate frames
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The point of vsync is to stop tearing
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont play lot of fixed fps games
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most games allow unlimited fps
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> terraria is locked at 60
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see tearing
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get insane tearing on ddnet btw, I don't understand how anyone can play without vsync
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get any
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But I guess when the refresh rate is high enough you can just turn off vsync and you won't see the tearing
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its rly smooth
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i run at 1000 fps (capped)(
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Who did advent of code today?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My code for the 2nd problem works with both test data sets but with the real data it seems to run forever
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i played 10 hours cyberpunk
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today i met keanu reeves
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at this

16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like rolling shutter almost 😛
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If you didn't tell me I'd have thought it's something with the camera xD
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it looks better on the camera btw 😛
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> :D
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If my code runs forever and there are no while loops shouldn't I get a stack overflow at some point?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> (i use recursion)
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i once got a stackoverflow on rust
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how you can eliminate tearing without vsync though, it's in the name, if it's not synced how can it be synced? :thinkW:
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its possible
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u must not be going to deep
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro tail recursion is optimized very well
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah that
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 I think at high enough refresh rates the tearing might be less obvious? Idk just a guess
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i think its that
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the human eye cant see a thing appearing and disappearing in 0.00001s
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but on 30 fps
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My biology teacher used to say the human eye can do 24 hz haha
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Idk where that number comes from
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.00694 vs 0.016 so it is an order of magnitude better than 60hz, maybe that is indeed it
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion.
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can feel smoother motion
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> probs that
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The temporal sensitivity and resolution of human vision varies depending on the type and characteristics of visual stimulus, and it differs between individuals. The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion.[1] Modulated light (such as a computer display) is perceived as stable by the majority of participants in studies when the rate is higher than
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whole quote
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 shouldn't double buffering help for that? Maybe it's something we can enable in opengl/sdl?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's just that at around 20fps motion starts to become fluid for most everyone?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > when the modulated light is non-uniform and contains an image, the flicker fusion threshold can be much higher, in the hundreds of hertz
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this is the key
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen probably, @Jupstar ✪ do you happen to know a knob I can twist? 😛
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw 24 fps can feel completely fluid when you have no outside reference and it's very consistent
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I remember some settings for this in GPU settings a few years ago
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you ever remember feeling like older games from the NES era or even PS2 era were choppy? Or felt that a movie at the theatre was choppy?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Movies at theatre are different because they make it look blurry
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Our brains are really much much better at filling in the gaps than we give them credit for
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and same for old CRTs
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but on LCDs or OLEDs with faster pixel refresh and no blurriness you start noticing each frame
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well yes a little bit of blur goes a long way to making the illusion work
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i specially remember things looking really good, but when i look them now they look rly bad
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An hour of playing cyberpunk at 30 fps and I forgot I was playing at 30fps
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc when I switch to low and get 60fps immediately after, I can tell that it's smoother
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but without reference, I could probably be fooled
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> fn arrangements(ns: &Vec<u32>, n: u32, i_next: usize) -> u32 {
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     if i_next >= ns.len() {
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>         return 1;
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     }
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     let mut arr = 0;
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     for i in i_next..i_next+3 {
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>         if i < ns.len() && ns[i] - n <= 3 {
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>             assert!(i+1 > i_next);
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>             arr += arrangements(ns, ns[i], i+1);
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>         }
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     }
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     arr
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why does this run forever?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I played gta san andreas a while ago, a game stuck with the 24fps especially since physics and game logic are tied to the framerate, didn't feel less fluid 😛
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dontt hink its stuck
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The assert assures that i_next is getting bigger and at big enough i_next it breaks
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro your best bet would be to check the assembly generated?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gta san andreas with mta on a server with 2000 ppl were fun times
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 are you serious? xD
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro oh I thought you were asking why it wasn't overflowing the stack
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe i_next doesn't grow?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You have a >= there
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> look at the assert
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it has to grow, right?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's the edge case tripping you up, not sure completely though
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm a bit too sleepy to think
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Someone help me xD
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmhmhm
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do a debug print to check what happens to i_next and ns.len()
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put prints everywhere
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ns.len() stays constant at 102 like you'd expect and i_next seems to hop randomly around the high values never exceeding 102
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> randomly? huh
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk man

16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 102 102 should return 1
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please don't paste large amounts of data, upload them to a gist or something (irc bridge)
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye rip irc
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ok
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen maybe we could make it so the bot doesnt send rly long messages to irc
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would solve the issue
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It doesn't. The bot stopped at some point in the long message
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean dont send it at all
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> count the number of newlines i guess
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro I'm not very familiar with rust, where is your return for the non terminal case?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Great bridge if we don't send some messages 😄
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 arr
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u see the arr at bottom
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt have a ;
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it means its returned
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Final expression in a function gets returned
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it doesnt have a `;`
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro final expression on any possible path
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the end
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u have a if else on end u dont need to write return
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Then the if else construct is the final expression :P
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yea
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u got me
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro you sure it's infinite? maybe it just takes veeeery long? 😛
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah, possibl
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh yes probably
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you'd expect it to be at high numbers most of the time because it terminates there
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> and then goes down to choose another path
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is your initial call btw?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> o0,0
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 0,0
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Maybe my logic is right but just inefficient then
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Because it passes both test cases
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And advent of code says all puzzles run in 20 seconds on old hardware
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a 2 min solution to 0.07 seconds 1 day
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 you there?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah @Dragere you did todays puzzle as well, right?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> @timakro are you using the smallest example?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> Yes
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Both examples work and give the right answer
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But with the real data it runs forever
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> (not forever probably)
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> Hmm, i think i tried a similar approach like yours, but it ran forever even on the second example
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> There is a way faster method
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Am I missing something, idk how to make it more efficient
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> Its quite a different approach i think, but i cant really read rust
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro btw u are using cargo run right
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cargo run runs in debug mode
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try cargo run --release
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i could try release build, right
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it can speed up 20x
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or more
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds so much like a dynamic programming solution is in order
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that mean
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm not recalculating anything
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't think
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahh
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are not, but I have a feeling it can be framed that way
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh wait
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think it can hit a path it already solved
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah just buffer solutions
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> in a hash map 🥳
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hashmap best
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> When i tried that in python i ran out of memory :pepeH:
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Awwww
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I will still try
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So you are telling me there is a super clever solution to this? But don't spoil me
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh it also obviously has optimal substructure
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> part 2 is definitely dynamic programming 😛
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> More clever than just trying everything at least
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> But took me forever to find
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> got it!
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> caching worked
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a better solution than recursion with memoization btw
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> and thanks to release built i got another fuck up because it overflowed without me noticing xD
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Tell me @Learath2
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well let me try it first, don't want to say something wrong 😛
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I also want to see your solution @Dragere :D
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can I profile memory usage in rust?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I want to see my memory footprint
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Or on linux in general
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Like max memory usage during runtime
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait it can't be bigger than 102 64 bit numbers
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's nothing
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think you had another bug in your code when you got that out of memory thing @Dragere
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> I'll send it when im on my PC
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nice
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But now I also know how to write it without recursion
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Might do that later
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro Yep works: ||notice that the problem has optimal substructure, so the number of routes to get to any joltage is the number of ways to get to the sum of the 3 previous joltages||
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u can use perf
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't there a tracking allocator for rust?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valgrind --tool=massif binary
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use valgrind
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found a reddit thread about this but i dont remember it
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess a tracking allocator would only help you with the heap
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Use-Case%3A-Heap-Profiling
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes u can create a global allocator
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or whathever it is
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jemalloc is rust default allocator used on most platforms
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8z83wc/is_there_any_way_to_benchmark_memory_usage_in_rust/
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> according to this
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> there are 4 servers in the ddnet tab which can't be reached

20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks for checking, fixed
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 since cyberpunk is on gog it means its drm free, so it should be easy to pirate (in fact, u can download it pirate already), and yet its the game that has sold most preorders in history (8 million)
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> says how pointless denuvo and stuff is
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki You don't know how many would've bought it if it couldn't be downloaded easily.
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> PHP today, I'm running out of languages I know well soon 😄 https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day10.php
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :think_bot:
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, you can't expect much better than the most sold preorder in history 😛
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fist fight mechanics are so goofy
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i generally shotgun people in the face and call it a day
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well can't do that in the fights 😛
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen There are also some servers which are ddnet official but not in the ddnet tab
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 191.96.70.202:8317 - Brazil1 Server
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 37.152.185.191:8210 & :8220 - Persian Server
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 176.9.114.238:8203 < GER2 Server dedicated Multimap Less Map (Can be taken down, people use normal multimap anyway...)
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah wait, there are more Brazil1 servers which aren't in the official ddnet tab
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 8 servers
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 191.96.70.202:8319; 8317; 8304; 8320; 8308; 8305; 8314; 8321
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @heinrich5991 there is DDNet Brazil - Main Gores Server #1 & #2 which should be master banned?
