18:09 <+Henningstone> well I guess with this behavior you only justify getting banned, don't you?

18:10 <+Learath2> well
18:10 <+Learath2> that works aswell
18:12 <@EastByte> no, idea why Q did -n
18:13 <+Learath2> i didnt even know that there was a user mode n
18:13 <@EastByte> it's a channelmode preventing external messages I think
18:13 <+Henningstone> EastByte: because it's set as forcemode
18:13 <+Henningstone>  /msg q chanmode #ddnet -n will do it
18:13 <+Henningstone> I meant +n
18:14 <@EastByte> well, the actual question would be why I did +nr although I only typed +r
18:14 <+Henningstone> :D
18:14 <+Learath2> well +b only mutes if someone doesnt have voice
18:14 <@EastByte> okay

18:40 <+o_be_one> hkind of cancer this guy ..
18:42 <+Ryozuki> he has been always like that, no surprise
18:42 <@EastByte> I wonder when he realizes that lame trolling is lame
18:48 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: you can remove Nimda from the op list btw
18:49 <+Ryozuki> btw someone knows how to configure nimda? https://github.com/noother/Nimda3
18:50 <+Ryozuki> I only see how to configure the database
18:50 <@heinrich5991> you configure it via IRC I guess
18:50 <+Ryozuki> but it connects to a channel with a nimda already
18:50 <@heinrich5991> hm
