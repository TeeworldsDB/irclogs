00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes plz can we bring back emojis to ddnet client idk why they were removed
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @deen fastüëç
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis they were incompatible with some other improvement we made at the time and no one was willing to put in the work to get them working again, considering that there was also quite some backlash against them
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @louis u can make your own client with emotes, like formating in discord
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @louis u can make your own client with emotes, with formating from discord
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohh
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @deen I think there should be a new button for that. I mean I would never mute someone bcs of spam emotes ._. I can't even read then anymore his messages
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @deen I think there should be a new button for that. I mean I would never mute someone bcs of spam emotes ._. I can't even read then anymore his/her messages
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, ok
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but then someone needs to create a new graphic
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> except the graphic
06:11 <+Obito634> Sorry guys, i had disconnect, and didnt read the messages that you answered me about my problem, who can repeat again?
06:36 <+Obito634> did you noticed?

10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @deen did u find any broken map with that commit? i can try to fix it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2355
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Obito634: You can read the history of this channel on https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/2020-06-26.log
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @nori the report seemed to be that most stoppers stopped working with this
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I'm really afraid of changing any physics
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> What does it do?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Fixing stoppers so u cant skip them? :monkas:
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> fixing stoppers to not stop
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> so u cant cross through?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> bad fix
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Breaks maps
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> GetSpeed2 is based on that bug
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> so, i'd like to get a fix for this
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726364591373680640/Untitled-1.m4v
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> And other maps
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ugh
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> i'd like a fix for this
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726364940793020416/Untitled-1.mp4
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> also perhaps add this function? 
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2053
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> as of now the only way to reset your dummy/main tee is to either use cl_dummy_resetonswitch 1 (and having to switch back and forth) or use dummy_copy (and not press a single key)
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I need 3 dummies
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you need jesus
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :kek:
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is there a command to vote server types? like `/server solo`
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Call vote and click on solo?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> can the values be shown here?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726395689906470952/unknown.png
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik I'll try
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen and someone messed out the colors :(
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I had bind for feet and body colors
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> now they don't work anymore
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> my body turns white instead of pink
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen it was: bind kp_8 "toggle player_color_body 10519017 15983123"
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 changed the color format I think
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeh?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, there is probably some special handling in toggle I missed
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> uh
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik do the color codes work fine when you use them?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> no @Learath2
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which one of those is supposed to be pink?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> :)))))))))))
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> let me think
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> first one looks blue
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> second one looks pinkish
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> wow yes I see it
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Learath2 I took a screenshot when my body was white and my feet were pink:
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726397700664197120/unknown.png
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> but I see now it's wrong
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the first one seems white though, is it supposed to be white?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess mystery solved?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does the toggle work btw?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I did miss a special case in the toggle
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it looks lighter if you toggle to it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes it worked once and it was washed out pink colr
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes it worked once and it was washed out pink color
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Learath2 but I think the second one on my screenshto is wrong?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it should be lighter pink not that dark..
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it's almost black
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you have a screenshot of the color itself?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726398788792746104/unknown.png

13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean that looks maybe a little darker
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> What colour code is teeworlds using for tees?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Packed HSL with clamping
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Learath2 looks good, it depends on skin too
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> possible to convert to hex?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Learath2 so is something wrong? because I used my binds for so long now and never changed them
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> cant play on local

13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> no errors?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik the toggle is broken, I'll fix it in a minute
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the colors themselves I think are fine
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> ok nice
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh btw, you can now do `toggle white 15983123` if you prefer
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> IT'S NOT WHITE
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> very slightly blue white?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do u display  R: G: B: in console for tw colors

13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> > cant play on local
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> reverted to 13.2.2 it worked
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> at least the latest current version has this bug
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why is it always things that don't happen for me
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby there is a rather large bug with the rgb display there though
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet14 has it fixed
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what bug
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try `player_color_body green`
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then go to settings and set it's lightness to 0
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you check `player_color_body`¬†it'll tell you the rgb color is #000000
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is not right
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> can someone give me gui_icons svg sources?
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o-0
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i didnt know u could type in words there
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cute no?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik ^^
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> <3
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can u use hex codes now too
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, but with $ at the start because # is for comments üòÑ
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also you can use words for red green yellow cyan magenta blue
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh and black gray white
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @gerdoe If there even are any source, they most likely won't be svg
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 Since you're playing with colors, how about looking at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2055 ? :p
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or that also got solved in latest version?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @deen
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726417491236225085/gui_icons.png
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> oh
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> transparent
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu I think that's the correct behaviour though, skins themselves are allowed to be any color, but teeworlds colors have clamped lighting
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then how the feets stay white?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726418142745854002/gui_icons.png
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> oh s
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know this for sure, but I think feet have a different way to calculate the final color
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu I'll take another look, maybe I'll see sth
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> finally
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726418825301721098/gui_icons.png
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Maybe then use the feets calculations for both ^^
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @gerdoe Look at bottom left side of bubble
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> last time I changed how colors are rendered people were really mad üòõ
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it doesn't align with border
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> albeit I did break a little more than acceptable
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 sounds interesting
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @gerdoe also, doesn't fit to the rest icons
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> redesigning all 3, or making the missing one fit would be best
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And I'd honestly be for the first option xd
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh wait, I mistook the beginning of "w" with missing fill... damn lower quality on mobile. Sorry @gerdoe
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> $build_status
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> üü¢
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> $build_status #2396

15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik nice.
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726424601504120882/gui_icons.png
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen you'd mind if all three were just icons without the tee on side?
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @barsik Fix the order: ignore chat - ingore emotes - add to friends ^^ And as deen said, looks nice
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that would be fine too
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> So I started working on my version too :P
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the wrong order is set by me, I can change it in gui_icons
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that makes more sense to have both ignore options next to each other
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but I was too lazy to cut and paste in the image üòÑ
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @Soreu
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726425527350460486/gui_icons_2.png
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @barsik now something messed the tee on right ;D
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> lol hm
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and still, even thouhg the missing icon made by you looks nice, it doesn't fit the style of other two
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i think if i will add tee with that icon it will be look like chat ignore
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> hmm, I'm damn sure I once did redraw of the emotes in PS, but where the hell I lost the file
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it should be this "thinking" cloud maybe, not the chat one
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Lady Saavik For the chat?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie Didn't you maybe redraw emoticons out of boredom? xD
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I actually just made this icon, finishing last touches xD
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726429033637740614/unknown.png
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> You didn't surprise me with that one
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen should it be together with the old icons? if so, do I just add it on the right side?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> > order: ignore chat - ingore emotes - add to friends
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah, rhanks
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah, thanks
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^^
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now everyone is making the icons üòÑ
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I was waiting for the little rivalization though :D
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen nothing interesting, the guy asks me to take a look, but it pissed because I fixed the color issue before I replied to him
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/it/is/
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lol
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @barsik you have to fix alignment now xD same as @Ravie
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just noticed the icons are not aligned on the 128x64 base we all guessed, but by the middle of the tee
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726459488223232140/unknown.png
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or at least almost by the tee
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> ahah, i did it by grid :justatest:
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> we all did üòÖ
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> TW code surprises at all times
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726460850096963714/gui_icons.png
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen lighting has to be clamped for teeworlds colors, if you want to keep the old behaviour
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm actually it could stay like this
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> However 0 lighting on the slider will actually mean 50
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, exactly
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I implemented it as you said and noticed that the slider then becomes disfunctional
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and with how it currently is it works well
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, what becomes dysfunctional?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2394 could have been `/showothers 2`
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2394
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen tried to center the images, but ran into problem with Ravie's and Barsik's versions, as they kept the vanilla tee-with-something ones. In short, it is impossible to center them as the image is weirdly positioned ingame. Would it be possible that via the code you'd "just" slice the `gui_icons.png` to three images with sizes of 128x64 and center them above the buttons?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Currently left icon has to be almost max to the left, while center & right ones have to be moved almost max to the right (on grid 3x 128x64, since the previous image was 256x64 and current one is 384x64)
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2389#issuecomment-650612936
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu maybe I also did something wrong in the code?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did the same problem exist before I changed it to 3 icons?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> honestly I never paid much attention to those icons, so not sure, but I guess it was this weird earlier
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu then do we really need to fix it? Feels like it's easier to just align them in the image file once
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Would be nice for future, but can stay the way it is
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it's not anything necessary
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, it was actually my fault üòÑ
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed now
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> perfectly aligned
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726537224547729458/screenshot-20200627223920.png

22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> welllllllllll
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> could you move it to left, so the icons are centered above buttons instead of starting (?) at same place and going further right?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also, is the first black box bigger than the other two, or its my phone again?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it used to be, because i made a mistake
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now they're same size
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> centered now

23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen this editor bug happened to me :( my cursor is gone
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, it happened to a few people already. If you can find a way to reproduce it, that would be great
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> BannZay also managed to reproduce it once, and he's the last one to make large changes in editor, so there's some hope
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I looked through the code but couldn't find anything suspicious
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i still dont know what "manual" means in languages xd
