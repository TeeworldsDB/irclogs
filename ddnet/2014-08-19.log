00:14 < ochristi> och n√∂ deen kein Visual :s
00:15 <@deen> ochristi: nicht?
00:15 <@deen> ochristi: i thought that would create nicer binaries on windows
00:21 < ochristi> I do not recall my findings, but as far as I remember the strip call did the trick, but I can not reproduce now, as I had to reinstall windows in the meantime -> currently no compilers installed
00:21 <@deen> hm, yeah, i do strip on all the binaries
00:22 <@deen> I don't know, EastBite said Visual would be better!
00:24 <@deen> I have huge trouble with Windows though
00:24 <@deen> installing updates for 2 hours, didn't know updates can take that long
00:25 <@deen> Windows asked me to choose a browser. When I chose IE it said that my OS is too old for IE
00:31 < Savander> good night
00:33 <@deen> good night Savander 
00:40 < laxa> deen: you discover the magic of windows, that's good xD.
00:40 <@deen> laxa: no, it's not good
00:40 < laxa> xD.
00:40 < laxa> I have fucking troubles at work with sharepoint rights with IIS...
00:40 <@deen> laxa: i didn't think i would spend all evening installing this visual thing
00:40 < laxa> That's why I am kidding.
00:41 < laxa> What do you think VS will add to your teeworlds binaries for windows oO ?
00:41 < laxa> debug ?
00:42 <@deen> laxa: less false virus detections, better performance, smaller size
00:42 < laxa> size isn't an argument nowadays
00:42 < laxa> especially with teeworlds
00:44 < laxa> Well good luck with the magic of windows, gotta go sleep, working all week :).
00:45 <@deen> good night
06:58 < EastBite> deen: good luck :)

15:59  * Deathman slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
16:23 <@deen> Deathman: good job
16:23 < EastBite> Savander: I think now you understand why the slap function is bad
16:24 < Savander> yee
16:24 < EastBite> because a large fishbot isn't evil at all
16:25 < EastBite> and I still have no idea what a fishbot is
16:25 < Savander> for nothing
16:27 < Savander> Webchat has one good thing  for me :p
16:27 < EastBite> it's in the web :O
16:27 < Savander> webchat has notice
16:28 < EastBite> hm notice is an irc feature
16:28 < Savander> sry :P :D
16:28 < Savander> Option: Emit HTML5 notifications on activity:
16:28 < Savander> good thing
16:29 < Savander> When you send me a message with my nickname, I see them ;p
16:30 < EastBite> then you should avoid spamers
16:32 < EastBite> deen: I'm working on a nimrod huffman module :D
16:33 < EastBite> (actually a rewrite of matricks version)
16:33 < Savander> here?
16:34 < EastBite> here?
16:34 <@deen> EastBite: oh?
16:34 <@deen> EastBite: interesting
16:34 < EastBite> well, actually obvious because I'll need it for teeworlds networking
16:34 < EastBite> :3
16:35 <@deen> EastBite: you can put it on Rosetta Code then: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
16:35 <@deen> i was too lazy to write one yet
16:35 < EastBite> ah
16:36 < EastBite> it'll take some time until I understood everything
16:36 < EastBite> just read about huffman yesterday
16:37 < EastBite> and I don't know whether the huffman module in tw differs from public ones
16:38 <@deen> teeworlds has its own frequency table, but apart from that it's normal huffman
16:38 <@deen> at least that's how i got it to work in haskell
16:38 < EastBite> okay that's good
17:21 < EastBite> deen: why does nimrod not have a < operator for (uint32, uint32)? :(
17:22 <@deen> EastBite: import unsigned
17:22 < EastBite> oh
17:22 <@deen> EastBite: and if it's still not working, i fixed it in devel branch^^
17:22 <@deen> some operators were missing
17:22 < EastBite> works, great
17:22 <@deen> araq doesn't like unsigned numbers^
17:24 < EastBite> atleast unsigned numbers aren't complicated -.-
17:24 <@deen> what do you mean?
17:25 < EastBite> uint8 0xff > 0x23 true for example
17:26 < EastBite> I mean the sign bit thingie is complicated
