00:21 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> good update
01:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not a problem, the masterserver exposes this information
01:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Does it yet? Do we merge the servers on the master yet based on secret like we do for ipv6?
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ehm
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we only do it for ipv6
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wait
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> on the master they're merged
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> for 0.7/0.6
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and ipv4/ipv6
01:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the client only supports 0.6 though
01:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh, that‚Äôs cool
01:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Didn‚Äôt know we already had that part figured out
01:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think that was in from the beginning
01:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it was just the client that unmerged ipv4/ipv6 for some time
01:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> until I implemented multi addresses for the serverbrowser
01:55 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon: hey
01:55 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon i have
01:55 < bridge_> <solayer> !ping
01:55 < chillerbot3> pong
01:55 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
11:18 < ChillerDragon> @scrumplex prism? not polymc? anyways i downloaded virus binary release and it just worked xd
11:20 < ChillerDragon> @solayer you can slide in my irc dms, mail me at chillerdragon@gmail.com contact me on wire @zillyhuhn or find me on matrix.org @chillerdragon
11:21 < ChillerDragon> @zwelf2 cool thanks i never used torrent in my life but nice i guess :D
11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> torrent is the best p2p protocol ever
11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it beats crypto stuff
11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
11:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a published torrent is hard to eliminate
11:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like publishing on internet
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/android-14-introduces-first-of-its-kind.html
11:50 < bridge_> <scrumplex> huh?
11:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is a troll
11:55 < scrumplex> ChillerDragon: stop trol
17:23 < bridge_> <hus3h> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json for current/latest info
17:23 < bridge_> <hus3h> https://ddnet.org/stats/master/ for previous times (note that some info like player skin weren't present from the beginning, consider this in case you want to make scripts)
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this was shared before
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but upon relooking it
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its such a simple but super effective idea
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its insane
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> most tutorials on ast dont do this
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and use pointers (refs)
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it actually makes it simpler
17:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and is more perfomant
17:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like it makes it difficult to adjust the AST though
17:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> which is probably something you want to do with the AST
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i guess u can have  multiple asts
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for the diferent lowerings or idk
17:57 < bridge_> <APFFF> thx ‚ù§Ô∏è
18:01 < bridge_> <APFFF> is there any order to the servers?
18:06 < bridge_> <APFFF> @hus3h so basically, skin information is only available through server information by pulling information when the player is online, or am i wrong?
18:10 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon you can talk to me?
18:10 < bridge_> <solayer> ChillerDragon: hi
18:11 < bridge_> <solayer> ChillerDragon: gay
18:21 < bridge_> <hus3h> the second link contains an archive of all the logs so you can see what skin a player used at any previous time today or in a different day, so the player doesn't need to be online now for you to get that info and you can check it at a later time
18:21 < bridge_> <hus3h> if you mean if there's another way to get skin info other than these json files, I'm not aware of any other public place to get that (except ddstats.org for current info only)
22:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> good afternoon
22:40 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> lol wtf
22:41 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> does this work in vanilla too?
22:42 < bridge_> <teero777> nop
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> man whenever i go into a fullscreen app (such as ddnet) with 2 monitors on and a 150% scaling on both of them (duped), for some reason it sets it to 300% in-game and goes back to 150% when i tab out. it takes a long time for the graphics to adjust and for the stupid animation to play
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> fwiw 300 is the preferred scale of the second monitor
23:19 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon man
