20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> this maybe is a bit sad news but, i wont host the wiki anymore, this is due to not enough space in my vps, and i also think its worth enough, the wiki doesn't seem of utility since all the info is in tutorial posts on the forum. (reminer, you should remove the wiki link in ddnet.tw main page), tho if there is any way i can help with my vps (that doesnt require much storage) ill be glad to help
