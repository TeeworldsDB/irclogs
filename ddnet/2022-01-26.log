01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Demos constantly swap between main tee and dummy when viewing them, on latest nightly.
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> constantly = even when you didn't swap in the demo?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Correct
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Flickers between the 2 tees, instead of playing the demo normally
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like my fault, thanks for the report
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Great that some people are actually using the nightlies ðŸ™‚
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> This message spams when standing on the starting line, dunno if already reported
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/935701208063148152/spam.png
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe it's time to make the start tile only work once
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Would it break t0 r1? probably for some maps
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> that would absolutely break a bunch of t0 runs, eg. Tangerine which seems as if it's specially designed for the t0 skip strat
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> also would give a minor advantage to older t0 runs in general, since crossing the start line can easily take more than 1 tick, especially on the maps where its more than 1 tile thick
05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> I think adding a per-team cooldown for that message which resets when the number of players in the team changes would be better, since that would cut down the spam even more than forced single-use start line
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> Well, I guess single activation start line would be fine if that only applied to teams, since it acts that way with the timer anyway, and then it wouldnt impact t0

10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait what who catches sigint in the client? SDL ?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oke then i have to code it again in headless -.-
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> should i push it to ddnet too?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not sure where to put it there
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/commit/073c315fff086926f45e9334eabd1de907f46580
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How do i set the zoom further away than 0 via console?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> "zoom -1" does nothing \:c
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fea9eb5be5eeafa1f21345d45e5ad9a92957fff4/src/game/client/components/camera.cpp#L214
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fakin clamp
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do i need to do "zoom--;zoom--;zoom--;" now? xd
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> remove the clamp?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need for explicit signal handling in ddnet client
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> zoom+
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> poggers can i?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or at least increase
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> :monkalaugh:
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> zoom+ and zoom-
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ðŸ˜›
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: remove completly? I think a "zoom -999" might crash most clients instantly
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but then id have to type that a lot
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> -.-
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and count the shit xd
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> i know you won't answer me but i think you should just use binds
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/935835401048948746/image.png
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> at least for my use case max cmdlen still fits
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes a bind that contains 14 times zoom- typed out \:D
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> but you need it only 1x, then you can hold the key
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> or im wrong
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> press the key 14 times xd
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> or hold it
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> cl_smooth_zoom_time 250
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> well in game i zoom on scroll and have no smooth zoom but its not about in game its about setting exact zooms via console
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> I understand, what exactly do you need something like that for?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> if i zoom out 100 times its laggin hard
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> to set my view to distances that i like \:)
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> very special, i think many just zoom in the run as they need it. with a button that brings you to your zoom setting without smooth would burden me very much and lead to fails ðŸ˜„

11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This is a vulnerability in pkexec - a common suid program written in C. This CVE is an out of bounds memory error, and should not have happened if the utility was written in safe Rust
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> smooth zoom makes me puke \:D
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Imagine talking about writing it in safe rust when the language only appeared 1 year after
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they could've guessed rust code tho
12:23 < suo> e
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4639
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> zoom- and zoom+
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: there are limits for zooming out already.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you should clamp to that.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and dont do weird stuff again plis
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im innocent. I donâ€™t do sussy things. Wdym

18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welshi> very true
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they finally changed whatsapp webb
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to not require ur phone to be used
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine being in 2022

18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What about new way to triple fly?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Add two clients cmds: +left_dummy and +right_dummy, so you can control both tees with keyboard.
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Then add dummy_hf_hook command, so that dummy spam and keep hook every 2 sec, instead of spam hammer every 1 sec.
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Et voilÃ , you can triple fly with camera and mouse control on lower tee, new buttons to control upper dummy (or toggle bind to use A/D).
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> It's possible? Or useful?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> No macro, pure skill to triple fly. 
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Only aim needed on dummy hook, but it already exists on dummy hammer, so it's ok
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i'd love a dummy left + dummy right aswell, its kidna annoying that you have to switch siwht resetonswitch off to make dummy hold
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> Why make it more powerful? \:(
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> but idk why its necesarrry to make hammerfly hook as a client command when you can already make a config to  do that
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Config is different, with config you drive upper tee, but hammer will be executed on dummy and hook is copied.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Actually config is easier because you don't need aim to hammer
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> While my proposed mode will let you hook in every direction you want
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> you can hook in any direction with config too
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> except that you cant fly at normal speed
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> you must pseudo to drag someone

19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is merged now
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess we should enable wayland support too ;D
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no, i need to upgrade my debian builds then
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> github discord bot is dead?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like it
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but Robyt3 alerted me of the new PR, no worries ðŸ˜‰
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Robyt3 discord api is dead*
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> not the github bot
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Ryozuki\: wait wat how does whatsapp work without a phone? poggersmaybe its time to have a look at it again
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: without needing an online phone
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you still need to register via phone number
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea that sucks
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but its still progress imo
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not even signal has that right?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk tbh i barley use signal desktop
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> signal desktop works without phone AFAIK
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow ok nvm
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've been using WhatsApp on Desktop without phone for weeks. Lost my phone number, hopefully get it back in 2 days...
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea depending on a phone and sim card and contract rly sucks
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc whatsapp has a beta feature for that, yes
