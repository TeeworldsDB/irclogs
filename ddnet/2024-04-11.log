01:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 what purpose does gtest have? Imo the failing test output is so annoying to read. The assert_eq macros do not look hard to self roll. Why dont we drop that annoying dependency? 
01:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dependencies are always bad and gtest was a bit annoying but it kinda worked. But now that I saw that they reject all patches unless the authors privacy is violated i think we should not depend on it anymore

18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Actually, fucked up take, the whole world resolves around giving away YOUR money, which will be used to give OTHER PEOPLE money, which will be used to give YOU money.
18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A race about who can take others' money with their efforts
18:45 < bridge> <meloÆž> lmao
18:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> capitalism
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I donâ€™t but maybe you can hack together something using the generic `teehistorian_dump` tool
18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And whoever keeps money will essentially create more inflation.
18:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And whoever keeps money will essentially create more inflation, cuz it never goes back to people
