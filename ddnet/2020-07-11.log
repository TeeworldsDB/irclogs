00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bug: switches are broken on 14.2
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> despite being on solo or unsolo, if **anybody** hits a switch that triggers a dragging laser for example, it triggers for all. so if you are on solo, if others hit the switch, it counts as you did hit it. To demonstrate the bug, here's a 10sec ~ long demo about it
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/731269833404186664/Flow_2020-07-11_00-01-142.demo
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Im highly confident, that this is a bug that needs to be fixed, i've never seen in anyway.
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all in same team?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> in t0, and in teams
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then that's expected and has always been this way
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> switches don't respect solo part
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> teams and solo servers are respected
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> really? i swear i didnt saw any mechanic interact with all players by one player triggering a switch on solo
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hmm,
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm pretty sure
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could download an older version of DDNet-Server, run the same map, teleport yourself there and test it
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we changed the behavior, we will definitely provide a fix
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> shit, yeah it's there, but i never saw this happening
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it was always the same triggers for solo'd players
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> was it intentional tho
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, that's how it is implemented
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz if it is, its a kind... of nice mechanic noneless
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or just a thing you could know
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> changing the implementation is hard, and now many maps already exist with switches in solo parts, so changing physics is not so easy
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not the switch you guys need to remake, the dragger laser itself
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i don't think any map uses that mechanic
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for intentional purposes
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you spoke the words that usually summon konsti
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :monkaS: ah shit
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we need an FAQ for stuff like this :D
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> First entry:
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Q: Can we change physics X, Y or Z? I don't think any map uses that mechanic intentionally.
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> A:  No.
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no i think some maps use it afaik
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so if u remove an r1 may be unbeatable
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen are you sure the new showdistance calculation is correct? in theory, zoom 10 should be about 1000/800 then, a bit more propably
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a bit less, I mean
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> does anyone know why i cant see the score hud on fng when i compile ddnet on windows
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> @abcqerty did you try putting dbg_msgs everywhere in the hud.cpp ?
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> or cl_showhud 1 :troll:
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> @Cellegen how is the wallpaper progressing?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i've tried several attempts on the wallpaper, none of them worked out as planned
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> after the ctf tournament, i'll try more
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> thats tomorrow right?
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> can someone send brain and tell me what form that is https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594469377.png ?
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> like what does it look like? do you have a name for it?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hashtag
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or double plus
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the only word i can find for it is "hash-shape"
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ._.
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wtf
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> oh i meant the whole shape not the tile texture
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 3x2 d
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 2x3 d*
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe, i'm not sure if theres even a name for that
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> 2x3 would be 6 but its 5
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no like the letter d in a 2x3
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kek
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> well what does that shape remind u of?
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> oh a d i see
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats better than my "chair" lmao :D
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I would call it 2x2+1
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> where do u know to add the 1
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh well i guess it'd be easier to follow if you didnt already know what it looks like
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> looks like thumb up
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Lady Saavik https://zillyhuhn.com/woods/
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/731535318511124620/unknown.png
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wth
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/731535762104778803/unknown.png
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594489316.png
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> yea da heck browser u oosing miss saavik?
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> @Ekidoxx
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> the right one is ok
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> the left one is broken
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @Soreu
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> > oh i meant the whole shape not the tile texture
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @[quakenet] ChillerDragon#0000 i would call it fat L shape instead
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> since that's the closest thing of that
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Meh.
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> There are actually few more bugs, though this one is surprising
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Lady Saavik Thx for mention. And yea, what browser you using? .-.
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> google chrome
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://media.tenor.com/images/24909d6d51bac74621825aac16657bfc/tenor.gif
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Cursor often disappears after alt tabbing. Same was mentioned a few days earlier here: https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/729070081174274069
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> version 14.2?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> yes
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Seems like it already appeard with 14.1 according to the older post.
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check if the SDL2.dll from 14.0.2 fixes it
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-14.0.2-win64.zip
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> happened to mee too
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it kept zooming out a lot
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its that
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not the zoom itself
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it crashed cuz to much zoom out
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (thats what i mean)
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then yeah, that's expected, maybe we should hard-limit it, what is causing the crash?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i only see it slowing down, but never crash
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk it kept like hanging
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on windows tho
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the typical "program is not responding"
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it was always stupid that you can zoom in/out to infinity
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it was always crashing at some point of unzoom, when the game / PC could no longer handle it all.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Limiting it to the point of seeing whole map at best would be smart imo
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://ddnet.tw/tournaments/7birthday/
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Times look wrong
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i finished at 19:29
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its correct
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh lol
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Thought this should be the ingame time
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tournament is about who finished first not who has the best time
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> fake news
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> There is a kind of tournament where best times win
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but this one not
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we get this comment on every tournament
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> put CEST behind it or smth
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but do most even know CEST?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i guess
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not everyone ofc
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put the day year and month
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> problem solved
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hp560p/linux_kernel_intree_rust_support/
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> anyone else having this crash on arch? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/A7
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> how does zoom-allowing work for now?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> just checking for mod name?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think so
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> maybe make another netmsg with flag only for ddnet client or client that have this netmsg in protocol.h
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> or boolean
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> and add integer with max-min zoom
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> and add integers with max-min zoom
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @barsik we have GAMEINFOEX or so that can tell the client to enable zoom
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so, another modes can use it too
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> nice
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I couldn't see my shotgun in tune zone when shooting left, other directions worked
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/731621718778576976/2020-07-11_23-21-15.mp4
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> but when it hit someone I saw it
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I also couldn't see Meliodafus shotgun when he shot left and he couldn't see mine xd it's weird and complicated
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik Tunezones are weird, shotguns are weird. what is the tune zone doing? Could you send the map to reproduce it?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen it's nugtohS on test server
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I even restarted the client
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nostalgum> Hello, what is this chat forM
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nostalgum> Hello, what is this chat for?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gigi7187> Developers
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gigi7187> @Nostalgum
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nostalgum> Cool
