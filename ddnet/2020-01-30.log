10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laxus> Shit scammer
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fokko = scammer < fokko having shit prices and manages to sell it once lmfao
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no wonder why did you make it offtopic
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cellegen are you retarded? First of all, its just childish of you that you still write anything about this even though you are not involved here. Second thing, the price was his offer, not mine. I didnt want to sell it in the first place and told it multiple times to him. Stop talking bullshit now.
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you guys want to talk about f-ddrace and fokkonaut please do it in private messages or on the f-ddrace discord server. This has nothing to do with ddnet development
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> True. Just said that he shall stop now
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> "i feel offended bout saying anything"  @fokkonaut
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> hey not sure where to ask this but here we go, ddnet has a command to reset dummy on switch called cl_dummy_resetonswitch, would it be possible to get a function to reset dummy without having to switch to said dummy?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Porphi i use hamemrfly
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> Yes thats an option, however upon disabling it will rehook the direction he held before
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uu, drama
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> I'd just like a hotkey to just reset the dummy or main per key press
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Porphi I donâ€™t think there is a good way, but itâ€™s a nice idea, we could add it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want it, create an issue
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> I mean you basically have to just take the cl_dummy_resetonswitch function and change it a little bit no? but then again I have no experience with coding.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> ok will do, thanks
16:29 <+Learath2> Itâ€™d be a couple lines at most, Iâ€™m sure someone can do it in a couple mins
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Porphi did you try a more complex bind? Like activating reset on switch then  switching dummy and switching back?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if it is possible, it'd still be an awkward bind, I'd rather have a proper way to do it
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> Thats exactly what im trying to avoid, having to switch to dummy to reset
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Porphi he meant as in a very quick switch through a bind
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> yeah but at the end you still had to switch no? even if its fast
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like toggle cl_dummy 0 1; toggle cl_dummy 0 1;
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if it'd be too percievable
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just give it a try ðŸ˜›
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt get it working
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> weird because my kill dummy bind works fine
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Porphi> gave it a try aswell, not working
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can you add a little number at the heart on servers to indicate how many of your friends are there
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ that'd be nice
