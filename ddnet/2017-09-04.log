00:12 <+eeeee> deen: that was fast, thanks
00:12 <+eeeee> works great
00:33 <+eeeee> you can check out beta.teewebs.net if you want to help testing
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <nub> I updated from 10.8.3 to 10.8.5 and now I can see only 20 of 66 server from DDNet Ger if "compatible version" is checked.
09:54 <@deen> eeeee: interesting. very small pointer for me in firefox and feels laggy, I see tearing as well
09:55 <@deen> @nub thanks, should be fixed. forgot to update the servers as well
10:43 <+Learath2> eeeee: can't seem to connect to servers
10:58 <@deen> the new info.ddnet.tw seems to work fine: avg time per request: 8 ms, 95th percentile: 70 ms
10:58 <@deen> (and 0 errors so far)
12:09 <+ddnet-discord> <hmcger> hey guys I need a small project done in c++(not in teeworlds) and would pay for it. someone interested ?
12:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> If it Is an easy Project hehe
12:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> I can Build you an helloworld
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, here are some gods of cpp
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> No joke i would help you. But i Need some Details If i can handle The task.
12:54 <@deen> And 47 people are STILL downloading https://hookrace.net/time.gif . I guess some bots don't have a timeout setting
13:49 <@heinrich5991> deen: maybe their hdd will be full eventually ^^
13:49 <@heinrich5991> wait
13:49 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't stop downloading after 24 hours? :)
13:50 <@heinrich5991> I thought it would ^^
14:04 <@deen> nope, never stops
14:04 <@deen> it would be wrong to stop after 24 hours since there are leap seconds sometimes
14:04 <@deen> well, at 300 B/s it takes a while to fill the disk
14:05 <@heinrich5991> :)
14:05 <@deen> Only 9 GB per year
14:05 <@heinrich5991> hm, that's slower than hdds will be added to a machine
14:06 <@heinrich5991> so it can run forever \o/
14:06 <@heinrich5991> I was away the last couple of days
14:06 <@deen> welcome back
14:06 <@heinrich5991> it seems you fixed the mac semaphore hting?
14:06 <@deen> with Learath2 
14:06 <@heinrich5991> so we could close the PR?
14:07 <@deen> but I'm not happy with the way semaphores are implemented in glibc
14:07 <@deen> what pr?
14:07 <@heinrich5991> oh, firefox loaded an old page from cache
14:07 <@heinrich5991> nvm
14:07 <@deen> so i wanted to use condition variables, but their semantics are weird
14:07 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:08 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean, semaphores in glibc?
14:08 <@deen> the implementation of sem_wait in glibc source code
14:08 <@heinrich5991> oh
14:08 <@deen> too much busy waiting, syscalls all the time
14:08 <@heinrich5991> spin lock for a bit and then wait using the os?
14:09 <@deen> keeps syscalling futex() even when nothing happens
14:09 <@heinrich5991> due to a timeout?
14:09 <@deen> no timeouts either
14:09 <@deen> try running strace DDNet and see it yourself
14:09 <@heinrich5991> how can it call futex if there's no timeout?
14:10 <@heinrich5991> futex should wait until it gets signalled, no?
14:10 <@heinrich5991> k, I'll try
14:13 <@deen> (the network can also be improved in the client I think, similar to server)
14:13 <@deen> not to recv all the time
14:14 <@deen> especially if you select over all the sockets we have open
14:14 <@heinrich5991> hm
14:14 <@deen> instead of blocking like in server
14:14 <@heinrich5991> not much point there
14:14 <@deen> probably
14:14 <@heinrich5991> you have to push out a frame every 16ms anyway
14:14 <@deen> font rendering is a lower hanging fruit
14:14 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:14 <@deen> and much slower
14:15 <@deen> for the server it was a great improvement not to busy wait for network packets though
14:15 <@deen> especially when you have 30 servers on 1 core, mostly idling
14:15 <@heinrich5991> yep
14:15 <@heinrich5991> most of them even empty
14:15 <@heinrich5991> literally having nothing to do ^^
14:15 <@deen> so strace ./DDNet-Server is much more reasonable
14:15 <@deen> 3 syscalls per second
14:20 <@deen> no one complained about performance problems on Windows, so I assume the semaphores work there as well
14:21 <@deen> I switched some more code over to semaphores
14:21 <@deen> btw, can we make CFetcher use CJobs instead of reimplementing the same thing?
14:21 <@deen> Or is there a vital difference?
14:25 <@deen> the threaded logger is basically the same as well
14:25 <@heinrich5991> not that I'm aware of
14:26 <@heinrich5991> Learath2 said that you will murder him if he implements CFetcher atop of CJobs though
14:26 <@deen> Only if he breaks the updater during that process :)
14:26 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:26 <@deen> I also removed the versionsrv entirely
14:26 <@heinrich5991> well, doesn't matter
14:26 <@deen> Using https://info.ddnet.tw/info?name=heinrich5991 instead
14:26 <@heinrich5991> don't we run one, though?
14:27 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:27 <@heinrich5991> +1
14:27 <@deen> yeah, we still run it for old versions
14:27 <@deen> most notably, servers is sorted by how often you finished at a location
14:28 <@deen> oh, and I had to use /info because otherwise we will run into problems with letsencrypt
14:29 <@heinrich5991> why?
14:29 <@deen> if I forward everything, then certbot can't put the file into the directory
14:29 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:29 <@heinrich5991> it needs .well_known
14:29 <@deen> so we have no proof that the domain is still under our control
14:29 <@heinrich5991> location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
14:29 <@heinrich5991>             alias /var/www/challenges/;
14:29 <@heinrich5991>             try_files $uri =404;
14:29 <@heinrich5991>         }
14:30 <@deen> oh well, too late :D
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what does "acme" means ?
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i saw it a few times in different situations
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it has special meanings?
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or it just popular author? ðŸ˜„
14:35 <@heinrich5991> acme is the protocol that letsencrypt speaks
14:35 <@heinrich5991> to give you ssl certificates
14:35 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme
14:36 <@heinrich5991> it's not actually in there
14:36 <@deen> I only knew https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)
14:36 <@heinrich5991> :o
14:36 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt
14:36 <@heinrich5991> here's a reference to ACME
14:37 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:37 <@heinrich5991> it actually exists on the page, but I couldn't find it, despite me knowing it
14:37 <@heinrich5991> that's a bad sign :D
14:37 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment
14:41 <@heinrich5991> deen: I think you should use POST instead of GET parameters
14:41 <@heinrich5991> GET parameters show up in server logs
14:42 <@deen> is that a problem?
14:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so acme is over used naming !@
14:43 <@heinrich5991> well, you now have a log of each ddnet player's IP address and nick name in your webserver log
14:43 <@deen> I have the same already
14:44 <@deen> from DDNet-Server
14:44 <@heinrich5991> when they join the server
14:44 <@deen> Yeah
14:44 <@deen> So we should only log the name if there is a problem?
14:45 <@heinrich5991> would you expect that your nick name lands on some server when you click a tab in a server browser
14:45 <@deen> I find it useful to see if some name is especially slow for example
14:45 <@heinrich5991> that would be better, I guess
14:45 <+Learath2> could implement CFetcher on CJob but i'm scared it'll break that one remote ass possiblity that i didn't think about
14:45 <+Learath2> no idea why i didn't make it a cjob at the beginning tho
14:45 <@deen> heinrich5991: when that tab shows you your finished maps, yes
14:46 <@heinrich5991> I don't know, I dislike it
14:47 <@deen> The request or logging it?
14:47 <@heinrich5991> first it was just logging it, but after thinking again, the request
14:48 <+Learath2> class CFetchJob { CJob m_Job; allthestufffromCFetchTask; }; pass CFetchjob as userdata to the job. use CFetchjob as we used CFetchtask in the past
14:48 <@deen> So we can add a setting "Use username to request finished maps and sort servers"
14:48 <+Learath2> sounds sane ^^?
14:48 <@deen> and if it's turned off, then the info is requested without name
14:49 <+Learath2> how can you request that data without a name?
14:49 <@heinrich5991> there's other stuff in there
14:49 <@heinrich5991> more than just your records
14:49 <@deen> yeah, still request it
14:49 <@heinrich5991> it apparently replaces the versionsrv
14:50 <@deen> but you just get empty records back
14:50 <+Learath2> also replaces the servers json we had?
14:50 <@deen> yes
14:51 <@deen> and the news from versionsrv as well
14:51 <+Learath2> well we could have a setting for "Show finished maps"
14:51 <+Learath2> if it's not checked we don't need to request by name afterall
14:52 <@deen> exactly what I just proposed
14:52 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: ^^ reasonable?
14:52 <@heinrich5991> if I added a box with information about this to the ddnet tab, would you consider making this opt-in?
14:52 <@heinrich5991> so people will see the feature and won't request it unknowingly?
14:52 <@deen> Well, people won't find that info
14:53 <@heinrich5991> to the ddnet tab, near the place where the records would be showed otherwise
14:53 <+Learath2> don't really have enough space in the serverbrowser to write an essay either, you'd only fit "Show finished maps"
14:53 <@deen> even if you make it opt-out, they would click it by accident
14:53 <@heinrich5991> see: vlc asks on first launch whether it can access metadata from a remote server for stuff you're currently playing
14:53 <@heinrich5991> firefox also asks on first launch whether it can transmit data
14:54 <@deen> https://info.ddnet.tw/info
14:54 <@deen> there you go, no more name necessary
14:54 <@deen> Ideally make it opt-in, but ask people at the first start
14:55 <+Learath2> make it opt-in noone uses it, make it opt-out it's a privacy concern (a minor one imho)
14:55 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: not if we don't hide it in the options somewhere
14:56 <+Learath2> well i don't see anywhere to put it in the serverbrowser window so it needs to be a on startup thing like the nickname setting etc
14:56 <@heinrich5991> yes, that would be bad
14:56 <@heinrich5991> first launch questions are annoying
14:56 <@heinrich5991> those that you can't skip
14:56 <+Learath2> so POPUP_FIRST_LAUNCH or idk where to put :/
14:58 <@deen> at least you can add it in the dialog at the start where you enter your name
14:58 <@deen> it fits well there
14:59 <@heinrich5991> true, it can be put into the same dialog
15:00 <+Learath2> deen: do you want me to make CFetchTask->CFetchJob
15:00 <@deen> but make an even bigger warning that their ip is broadcasted to every server when they open internet server browser
15:00 <@deen> Learath2: only if it will have 0 bugs
15:00 <@deen> becuase people still get ddosed from that
15:00 <@heinrich5991> and if they deny that, don't show the server browser ^^
15:00 <@heinrich5991> but actually, we could do that
15:01 <@heinrich5991> fetch the servers ourselves and put them into your info.json
15:01 <+Learath2> deen: you can't promise that, i can't promise that, i'm pretty sure even god would think twice before promising that
15:02 <+Learath2> deen: eeeee has the teewebs serverlist available as json, could switch to using that instead of masters, calculating ping is not an exact science in that case but we'd get to upgrade to http masters :P
15:03 <@heinrich5991> nah, we still need all servers
15:03 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: i think eeeee has all the servers
15:03 <@heinrich5991> what use would that be?
15:03 <@heinrich5991> they don't support websockets
15:03 <@heinrich5991> or webrtc
15:03 <@heinrich5991> or whatever the current flavor of the day is
15:03 <+Learath2> ask him wtf
15:04 <@heinrich5991> or he proxies it
15:04 <+Learath2> only supports connecting to ddnet servers but iirc he does keep a json list of all servers
15:06 <+Learath2> deen: serverinfo amplification is still possible?
15:08 <@heinrich5991> yes, modulo rate limiting
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> why
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> on monster
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> there are
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> 2 teamrnaks of NANAMAR
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> and Saro
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> Showing
16:09 <@deen> someone might have played with moving ranks
16:09 <@deen> or deleting ranks
16:09 <@deen> or a bug
16:09 <@deen> or the database link was broken for some time
16:10 <@deen> apparently I didn't manage to fix the libfreetype on mac: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=5654
16:10 <@deen> it links to heinrich5991 directory, haha
16:11 <@deen> heinrich5991: want to look into the mac library problem?
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> <RockuS> so you will fix it?
16:18 <@deen> ok
16:26 <@heinrich5991> I can try
17:17 <@deen> thanks
17:33 <@deen> heinrich5991: should remove the user agent as well as it is leaking information about the users?
17:36 <@heinrich5991> mh no
17:37 <@deen> Actually I didn't introduce an option for the ranks json thing because I noticed that we have way too many settings
17:37 <@deen> and people set stuff by accident
17:37 <@deen> or even another client changes ddnet settings and then we run into problems
17:37 <@deen> like baumalein client allegedly changing the update server to their own
17:37 <@deen> in settings_ddnet.cfg
17:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: too many options is a valid concern
17:42 <@heinrich5991> not for this thing, but: do people also set options accidently that are not exposed through the UI?
17:43 <@deen> rarely
17:43 <@deen> that's also why I removed some stuff from settings
17:44 <@deen> I also thought the next step might be making info.json a log in ;)
17:44 <@heinrich5991> oh so you want an account system? ^^
17:44 <@deen> not sure
17:44 <@deen> has advantages and disadvantages
19:28 <+eeeee> deen: Learath2: wrt teewebs can you provide more details like browser and os version, gpu model
19:30 <+eeeee> also what is "laggy", frame drops or network drops?
19:31 <@deen> current firefox, arch linux x86-64, intel skylake gpu
19:32 <@deen> 3840x2160 resolution, but 1920x1080 window
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> eeeee: spectator mode works weird on beta.teewebs.net
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its always moving, if you move cursor in whatever direction
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
19:33 <@deen> frame drops
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway, does /kill is disabled
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on spawn?
19:33 <@deen> chromium works much better
19:34 <@deen> oh, I have multiple processes enabled in firefox
19:34 <@deen> text loads quite slowly
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway, cursor shouldn't be disabled ?
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> eeeee: vivaldi, gentoo, intel integrated gfx
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> on second thought i should have used a more common browser to test ðŸ˜›
19:50 <@deen> like qutebrowser
19:51 <@heinrich5991> why not elinks?
19:52 <@deen> you can only run DDNet-Server in javascript in elinks
19:52 <@deen> client is a bit problematic
19:53 <@deen> I'm not sure if it was elinks, but I tried editing one of links/lynx/elinks once, and the source code was full of polish comments only
19:53 <@deen> or czech
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®
20:56 <+eeeee> ok yeah i did notice that high resolution is laggy on my broadwell macbook, maybe i'll dig into that
20:57 <+eeeee> will fix the text loading once i settle on a way to get rid of freetype
21:01 <+eeeee> Savander: specactor mode stops moving when you center your cursor. it's hard to make it work the same way as in desktop client because browsers don't let you easily switch between absolute and relative mouse positioning
21:02 <+eeeee> Learath2: can you update your browser to the latest version and then copypaste the contents of developer tools console after it fails to connect to a server?
21:04 <+eeeee> and what's qutebrowser, is that like konqueror?
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What about disabling mouse ?
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in previous teewebs you did it
21:06 <+eeeee> yeah but if you compare the mouse pointer between the old and new teewebs you can notice new one has less latency
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but its pretty hard to control i think
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause, i can click random icon
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no web or close the window ðŸ˜›
