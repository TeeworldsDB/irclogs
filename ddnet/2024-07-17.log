02:48 < bridge> <louis> is jupstar still active
03:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> jupeyy appeared in bridge not long ago. they moved to matrix probably
03:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk how to tag matrix ppl so..
03:12 < bridge> <louis> ah right
03:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> definitely active tho
03:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you really want you could probably do a chillerdragon and tag them on discord with a random issue
03:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lmao
03:16 < bridge> <louis> Jupstar ✪:
03:16 < bridge> <louis> Jupstar:
03:16 < bridge> <louis> are you able to have the SkinDB bot automatically dilate skins before uploading them to the ddnet db?
04:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Hi, so I was trying to do some adjustments to my ddnet compatibility layer and to make it work like ddnet does it currently, by unpacking packets twice for 0.7 clients.
04:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> The logic itself works, it's correctly set whether the client is 0.6/0.7 at all times, but for some reason 0.7 cant connect. It'll fill the slot, but Feed() will return 0 because pPacket->m_Token is 0 and I can find absolutely nothing at all.
04:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 Maybe smth for you? :p
04:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/0077b44d5b555d1bf9ec445d2b11d7b2e376f7d3
07:22 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i'm porting ddnet again ```
07:22 < bridge> <headshotnoby> [24-07-17 05:21:21][engine]: running on sony-ps2-mips
07:22 < bridge> <headshotnoby> [24-07-17 05:21:21][engine]: arch is little endian```
07:56 < bridge> <fr4gues> An addition to the envelopes would be interesting, like being able to move and adjust the colors of the Quads' red dots, thus being able to create more complex animations, I don't know if it's difficult, but it would be cool
08:17 < bridge> <egyt> What? Arch is little Debian? Woah...

11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://docs.scale-lang.com/
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> What is SCALE?#
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> SCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows CUDA applications to be natively compiled for AMD GPUs.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> SCALE does not require the CUDA program or its build system to be modified.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> Support for more GPU vendors and CUDA APIs is in development.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> SCALE has several key innovations compared to other cross-platform GPGPU solutions:
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>     SCALE accepts CUDA programs as-is. No need to port them to another language. This is true even if your program uses inline PTX asm.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>     The SCALE compiler accepts the same command-line options and CUDA dialect as nvcc, serving as a drop-in replacement.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki>     "Impersonates" an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, so existing build tools and scripts like cmake just work.
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
11:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try looking at it in wireshark. that usually helps me spot where the problem lies
11:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> god coder be like this
11:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8605#issuecomment-2232789359 is it a clang-format of old code thing that the diff is that wild
12:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i removed the while statement around that code and it shows the change of indentation

14:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> @jupeyy_keks This is how DDNet looks when running in Wine on macOS btw (`MoltenVK version 1.2.7, supporting Vulkan version 1.2.275`)
14:47 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1263114861307756594/Screenshot_2024-07-17_at_14.45.49.png?ex=66990ee2&is=6697bd62&hm=81e4d437388d46010a234ed199f64fe9bd69a43285f248927878601bc50c5ffd&
14:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> So maybe our Vulkan usage is actually wrong if it fails on some AMD cards and on Apple now?
14:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Does it look similarly broken on other settings pages?
14:53 < bridge> <robyt3> It looks like rendering stopped precisely at the `Graphics()->ResizeToScreen();` in `menus_settings.cpp`
15:05 < bridge> <teero777> Is it planned to switch to a 0.7like skin system? for accessories and stuff. For example I want some already made skin wear a hat.
15:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a pending pr with 0.7 skin support @teero777
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> yea I've seen that
15:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But only for 0.7 connections. Not sure if anything for 0.6 is planned
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> I hope you don't port the weird feet pffset
15:08 < bridge> <teero777> I hope you don't port the weird feet offset
15:09 < bridge> <teero777> Yea I was asking for some general skin system changes
15:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> so both formats would work?
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Unlikely unless both are supported, we'd lose thousands of skins
15:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ddnet also already has hat support
15:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but its weird
15:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> you are talking about that prefix thing?
15:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.7 skins for 0.7 connections and 0.6 skins for 0.6 connections
15:27 < bridge> <therealdock> Is this documentation the most up to date for the teeworlds protocol? https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html

16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1gb l3 cache
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> ryo wanna host 65536 tee server there, am i right?
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> is insane
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> cpus have 64mb for reference
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> it could host more imho
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> for reference my laptop had 1gb ram by default
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 192 threads, with a good ghz, i think each thread could host 5 full servers
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 5 * 64 * 192
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> 61440
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> full 65536 servers?
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok good estimate lmao
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> if a single core at 3.4ghz can host 5 full servers i mean
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can host 65k players yes
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but maybe it can host more
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but you are probs limited by network here xd
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ger2 for reference is at 2% cpu now
16:27 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes
16:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> I doubt it, you can easily connect 25 Gbit/s fiber network to CPUs such as this
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> alright, lets do it
16:37 < bridge> <zhn> i meant 1 tee server with shared world for all the 65k players kekw
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> I would like to see how
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> 
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> ```
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> [Spectators]
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> %d others…
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> ```
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> 
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> looks like ingame
16:44 < bridge> <egyt> Because, well, there are a few ways to translate it
16:45 < bridge> <egyt> Because, well, there are a few ways to translate it, and not all of them make sence (or sound great) in all siituations
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's after listing the names of other spectators
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e.
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> egyt, heinrich5991, 10 others
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> egyt, heinrich5991, 10 others…
16:52 < bridge> <.kurosio> It looks nice, pretty neat. Is it a multi-level layered list of votes? How is this list in the screenshot implemented in code?
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> Okay, how about
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> 
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> ```
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> [Team and size]
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> %d\n(%d/%d)
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> ```
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> 
16:53 < bridge> <egyt> and `Team %d (%d/%d)`?
16:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Shown in the scoreboard, the short text if there are more than 8 players
16:56 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume you should translate the first one as is, unless in Ukrainian the total and current amount are swapped
16:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 8 players in total on the server?
16:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yes, exactly
16:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm in a hurry rn, cant explain, but basically it's just sending other votes to different clients
16:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Btw, there's one issue, when the numvoteoptions > 47, and the list get's resent, it will set the scrollheight to around 50ish %
16:57 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, 8 or less per scoreboard panel but we don't split 16 players over 2 panels
16:58 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, 8 or less per scoreboard panel (to show the short text) but we don't split 16 players over 2 panels
16:59 < bridge> <egyt> Well, I'll replace "/" with "of", makes more sence to us
17:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Makes sense, though if you make it much longer you have to check on a full server to make sure it doesn't overlap with the finish time
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if that makes sense, since it's also 13/32 in the serverbrowser, right?
17:05 < bridge> <egyt> No
17:05 < bridge> <egyt> In serverbrowser it's `x of y servers` both in Ukrainian and English
17:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not 13/32 in the serverbrowser in the ukrainian translation?
17:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, in the table, I mean
17:05 < bridge> <egyt> Nope
17:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where you can select the servers
17:06 < bridge> <egyt> Table??

17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the screen area where you can click on individual servers
17:07 < bridge> <egyt> Oh, well
17:07 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think that's currently localizable
17:07 < bridge> <egyt> Then make it localisable :-)
17:08 < bridge> <egyt> Okay, gonna change it back then
17:10 < bridge> <egyt> Although I already translated `Round %d/%d` as `Round %d of %d`... yeah, will leave it now
17:10 < bridge> <robyt3> The wiki link should be "translated" to the language specific wiki page if available: https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Mapping/uk

17:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yo, Id like to do #7559 and I have a question. Can I define my command and write a callback which will be called when the command will be used or do I have to add a new config variable and handle it's value ?
17:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7559
17:54 < bridge> <egyt> Also, serbian and serbian\_cyrilic have different percentages? How‽
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> @archimede67 already started working on this with #7556. I haven't gotten around to reviewing it, I'll try once the first Android version is done.
18:01 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7556
18:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah ok
18:08 < bridge> <egyt> Like, AFAIK they are almost the same except for the script, so you can copy the file and replace latin characters with cyrilic ones
18:09 < bridge> <egyt> Like, AFAIK the only difference between them is script, so you can copy the file and replace latin characters with cyrilic ones
19:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon you alive?

21:58 < bridge> <learath2> Probably the last one died with 0.5 😄
22:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Last question, did these old ahh servers use `Sv_TeamsStateLegacy` net message(if this question makes no sense, just ignore it)?
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think anyone remembers anything about these servers anymore 😄
22:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are "ahh" servers?
22:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Nvm, just old xd
22:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> legacy usually means it's not used anymore
22:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> "ahh" is a tiktok and/or instagram meme, where the normal word `ass` is written `ahh` for some reason :P, you can just read it as that and it makes sense 85% of the time within the used sentence
22:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/18bq2lk/this_doesnt_purely_apply_to_genz_but_whats_with/
22:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> :P
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> "Some reason" is probably some "smart" algorithm
22:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> are you using instagram? their translation would constantly translate `ooga booga` to the n word
22:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> this was fixed end of 2023 iirc
22:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 wireshark didnt help me. it didnt give me more information than i already had. The token is still 0 and i dont know why.
22:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This is the working example:

22:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> This is the broken version:

22:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> due to the m_Token of the Packet being 0 after the control messages, it will return in CNetConnection::Feed
22:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> been trying to work on this a few more times already and i always failed at this point
22:47 < bridge> <peter0x44> > There are no C compilers out there that don't use yacc and lex
22:47 < bridge> <peter0x44> this is definitely not true anymore
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check the token values on the network
22:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if they don't agree with the token values in your code, check where the discrepancy arises
22:54 < bridge> <uran_12> where do i login
22:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm very exhausted, will not do that today anymore :(
22:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> But I'll try it tomorrow *again*... :D
22:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> F1: `connect fokkonaut.de` -> /login
22:55 < bridge> <uran_12> thanks pookie

23:15 < bridge> <chairn> > Currently supported languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Kotlin, Jupyter Notebook and Python
23:15 < bridge> <chairn> well, that's kinda useless
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, it's for evaluating web developers it seems
23:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> Sure, just act on my behalf!

23:22 < bridge> <chairn> mid-level AI/ML developer ?
23:27 < bridge> <totar> I wonder if it scans private repos
23:38 < bridge> <reitw> by default seems like not
23:38 < bridge> <reitw> you have to give it permissions
