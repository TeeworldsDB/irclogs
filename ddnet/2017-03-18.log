01:24 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: try make clean, or just delete the build folder you created
01:25 <@heinrich5991> (cmake has out-of-source builds, you can `mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..` then you can delete the build folder later on to clean everything. you can use git clean to clean a git repository of ignored files)

01:34 < Ryozuki> yeah i noticed that later, anyway i deleted build folder, compiled again, and still same error
01:41 <@heinrich5991> can you compare what bam and cmake are doing?
01:41 <@heinrich5991> make VERBOSE=1 displays the commands for cmake
01:41 <@heinrich5991> bam -v for bam

10:29 <@heinrich5991> Learath2 has expressed wishes for a more linear history. should we switch to rebasing in the github interface?
10:30 <@EastByte> what's the difference between local and via github rebasing?
10:31 <@heinrich5991> there should be none, except that you only need to click a button on github
10:33 <@EastByte> so that means we just enforce to do a rebase instead of a merge?
10:33 <@heinrich5991> "enforce". we just do a rebase instead of a merge if we can agree on that
10:33 <@EastByte> okay
10:34 <@EastByte> well, I would agree on that
11:19 < Ryozuki> bam -> http://pastebin.com/5UHaNDWB
11:20 < Ryozuki> cmake -> http://pastebin.com/8BqWMR5Q
11:20 < Ryozuki> cmake one is cutted, otherwise pastebin says its to big

11:42 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: can you try this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/692
11:51 < Ryozuki> looks like it works
11:52 < Ryozuki> mm server works but client not
11:52 < Ryozuki> looks like it doesnt find sdl
11:52 < Ryozuki> CMakeFiles\DDNet.dir/objects.a(backend_sdl.cpp.obj):backend_sdl.cpp:(.text+0xca): undefined reference to `SDL_MinimizeWindow'
11:52 < Ryozuki> heinrich5991, 
11:53 <@heinrich5991> okay, but that's a separate issue. let's check

11:57 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: can you pastebin the output of the initial cmake call?
11:57 <@heinrich5991> (delete the cache directory or so)
11:58 < Ryozuki> http://pastebin.com/anC8JBrd
11:58 < Ryozuki> ah maybe its my fault
11:59 < Ryozuki> its using a sdl version i installed i think
12:00 < Ryozuki> but i think it should work anyway
12:00 < Ryozuki> "-- Found SDL2: C:/MinGW/lib/libSDL2.dll.a"
12:11 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: are there more errors like that? (undefined reference to `SDL_MinimizeWindow`)
12:12 < Ryozuki> yes
12:18 <@heinrich5991> can you post the link line of make VERBOSE=1?

15:38 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/691 is not actually incomplete :) the failing check is only there because there was a branch named like my PR branch in the main repo which failed the build
15:38 <@heinrich5991> should be fine to merge
17:07 < necropotame> Ok :)
18:01 < grenadepro> how i can get "versionsrv.exe" ? bam conf_release ?
18:08 <@heinrich5991> bam versionsrv.exe
18:13 <@heinrich5991> deen: does this help? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/688
18:41 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I will shortly test the server info extension locally and accept the PR then
18:41 <@heinrich5991> cool, thank you :)
