06:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @Voxel would be cool if the title is in team color aswell tho :)
06:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and if there is only 1 player in the team I would simply write the name of that player instead of Team x
06:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If thats not the case yet
06:47 < bridge> <Welshi> If the whole team is in the same clan it could show the clan name that might also be cool. But up to you idk how the clan name is stored in the code.
06:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And its probably good if you call it SvKillMsgEx
06:47 < bridge> <Welshi> If the whole team is in the same clan it could show the clan name instead of the team number that might also be cool. But up to you idk how the clan name is stored in the code.
06:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> clientside, would work easily. but i think that should maybe be an optional parameter, cuz  the clans are not really interesting for ddnet, but on modded servers it could be cool
07:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Epic
09:26 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Just make toggle in menu like "old kill messages style"
10:24 < bridge> <0108ben> Omggg I need this xddd
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1679133444.png
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> drunk coding ai coding buddy in tw chat
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> good stuff @XaRTeCK :) also @swarfey nice to see your js lib in action to empower such fun projects
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> its amazing that gpt knows teeworlds likes port 8303 and uses udp eventho the actual packet payload is complete garbage
11:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Everyone. You ruined the game single handedly and you are literally worse than the devil himself
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> lerato this is a reply to which message?
11:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Voxel had asked how many people will hate his new feature yesterday at 2301CET
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> thanks babe
11:38 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> looks perfect but pls add team color and add a condition to render >4p teams one-by-one
11:39 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> animations are still more annoying than anything you have done xd
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Ryozuki?
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yo
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u got bad in tagging ppl chillerdragores
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> watfk
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you need a space before the question mark
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> ?
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> ty pro

14:29 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar  âœª you cant fool me jopsta i pro pinga
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wadup
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im not home im skiing
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rich people sport
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> lol
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> i wanted to ask if i can rip out your unlicensed python code but then i thought i dont want it anyway im not sure now
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> i kinda got sidetracked writing a C repl in bash xd
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sure
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if it doesnt have a license the i give it agpl
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> this repo has no license i originally wanted to copy it in my bsd 2 codebase https://github.com/edg-l/TeeAI/blob/master/engine/variable_int.py
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> assume its agpl
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> but ye i think ill just write it my self once again :D 
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bro
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u want var int
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use ny rust
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> repo
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> ye ik
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> but im buildin a pure python thingy rn
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's also docs on it
14:46 <+ChillerDragon> on the int packer? ye i also wrote some docs on it my self :D
14:46 <+ChillerDragon> i just wanted to safe a bit of time and not repeat code
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you write docs, feel free to add them to libtw2 btw ðŸ™‚
14:48 <+ChillerDragon> sure i mean i do when ever i feel like it makes sense
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/fundamentals.html#int_packing
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> this didnt seem like it would fit in libtw2
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my rust implementation of huffman is missing on that page ðŸ˜¢
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> ah i think i intentionally left it out
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> because there is already ryos implementation in rust and it has docs
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> its kinda linked here https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html
15:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mine is a bit broken iirc
15:57 <+ChillerDragon> amazing
16:10 < bridge> <Voxel> troll
16:11 < bridge> <Voxel> I just had the killfeed team color thing off
16:12 < bridge> <Voxel> omg literally cry about it
16:14 < bridge> <Voxel> do people not understand the toggle thing is determined by heinrich
16:41 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Need make "NoVoxel Client" :troll:
16:45 < bridge> <Voxel> :greenthing:
16:45 < bridge> <Voxel> wait wtf that thing is sittinh
16:45 < bridge> <Voxel> voxel reference? @/keb
16:45 < bridge> <Voxel> wait wtf that thing is sitting
16:57 < bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel when someone criticizes his animations

16:59 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> the only non optional thing in tw comes in:
17:01 < bridge> <Learath2> Freeze prediction is also not optional. I want my shitty freeze with rubberbanding now rn
17:02 < bridge> <Ravie> non optional things are ok if they're an actual improvement on something that was lacking or improvised back in 2011
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cl_predict 0
17:03 < bridge> <Learath2> No, I specifically want my prediction to be the exact same as it was in 2013
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> invent a time machine
17:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Ur asking for too much
17:04 < bridge> <Ravie> compile client from 2013
17:05 < bridge> <Learath2> Noo, I could never. The developers of this game should think again about not adding options to everything. I don't see any problem with having more options
17:06 < bridge> <Learath2> That jupstar guy is the worst. He keeps adding these non-optional rendering improvements. I prefer my non ascii text lagging like it used to. (It helped me time hammefly with dummy)
17:07 < bridge> <Ravie> when actually add `cl_take_me_back_to_2015`
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸˆš ðŸˆ¶
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no idea what i just wrote
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://jisho.org/search/muu
17:10 < bridge> <Learath2> The second character is the kanji for right
17:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Idk the first one
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> first one is nothing, second is have, I think
17:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or exist (the second one)
17:12 < bridge> <Ravie> nothing exists, how deep
17:19 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah true
17:28 < bridge> <Chairn> git checkout <...>
17:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh yeah I may have had a brainfart there. That is definitely have/posses/exist
17:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I was writing "The kanji on the right" then I rephrased and ended up with that ðŸ˜›
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nah, better invent a time machine
17:33 < bridge> <Chairn> ask Linus
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Linus pls
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> lerato ranting xd
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> lmao my bank gave me a countdown to bruteforce which characters they banned from pws before my first time password expires xd 10/10 ux
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @marmare_314 are u the oldschool player marmare?
18:23 < bridge> <marmare_314> Not oldschool enough for oldschool
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ~6 years
18:23 < bridge> <marmare_314> Yes
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gores and ddrace
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok

18:39 < bridge> <Redha> lol
18:42 < bridge> <Redha> @bencie i dont understand can u come privet
18:55 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> Open 8303 port in your router (Google: how to open port)
18:55 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> And put in server_config.cfg:
18:55 < bridge> <MÊŽÉ¹ ã‚·> sv_register 1
18:56 < bridge> <bencie> why private? others can also use this info if they have the same problem, its good to discuss it here. you can use these resources for extra info
