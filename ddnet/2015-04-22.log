08:37 <@EastByte> laxa: the browser?
08:39 <@EastByte> aaaaaand another brutal dummy map
09:25 < laxadedi> EastByte: yes, the browser xD
09:53 <@EastByte> haha, is it a proper way to call a x32/x64 compatible software "x96" ?
10:02 < laxadedi> makes me think of a quote from 2 and half men
10:02 < laxadedi> when they say 24/24 7/7 is 31/31
10:02 < laxadedi> well, they say it's 31 :)
10:21 <@deen> EastByte: haven't heard of x96
10:21 <@deen> and yeah, another brutal dummy map =/
10:21 <@deen> not like we have much choice with the tournament maps

17:16 < TeeIRC> DoNe@54.93.70.244:8328: test
17:16 < DoNe_> TeeIRC: test
17:17 <@EastByte> oh yea
17:18 < DoNe_> xD
17:18 <@EastByte> TeeIRC: hello?
17:18 < TeeIRC> east@54.93.70.244:8328: hi
17:19 < TeeIRC> east@54.93.70.244:8328: deen look, we need this :D
17:19 < DoNe_> but there is a graphical client running at my side i made the screen resolution as small as possible and turned off sound and graphic preferences
17:20 <@EastByte> well that's kind of primitive
17:20 <@EastByte> you should make the client headless so it runs without desktop window
17:20 < DoNe_> and i wrote a small irc client myself. well you cant call it client it knows 4 commands
17:21 < DoNe_> i dont know how
17:21 <@EastByte> you need to remove a lot of code and keep the engine :P
17:21 < DoNe_> teeworlds network communication is so hard to read
17:21 < DoNe_> tried this
17:21 < DoNe_> its a pain
17:22 <@EastByte> not if you get used to it
17:22 < DoNe_> its not the way to do it i think, i knew some1 who managed to connect to a tw server by sniffing the packets
17:22 < DoNe_> and saving them
17:22 <@EastByte> yea that's easy, interacting though is hard
17:23 < DoNe_> ye it wasnt readable
17:25 <@EastByte> I made a "bouncer" like software for teeworlds which simulates server and client sessions in one process
17:25 < DoNe_> whats bouncer
17:25 <@EastByte> I just call it like that, do you know about irc bouncers?
17:25 < DoNe_> no
17:25 <@EastByte> it's just a middle ware between server and client
17:26 <@EastByte> it allows me to add multiple clients to a server and switch between them
17:26 < DoNe_> are you able to chat?
17:27 < DoNe_> or move
17:27 < DoNe_> or give any input
17:27 <@EastByte> yes, sure
17:27 < DoNe_> well if i had this i could make my script use it
17:27 <@EastByte> it's a fully teeworlds server and client engine in one program
17:27 < DoNe_> what language?
17:28 <@EastByte> C++, I copied the server and client part of teeworlds and merged them together :D
17:28 < DoNe_> i dont understand why both
17:28 <@EastByte> and yes, it's headless
17:28 < DoNe_> you only use server or client normally
17:29 <@EastByte> because back then I wanted to let this software let tees idle in some servers
17:29 < DoNe_> :D
17:29 <@EastByte> and I can connect to them when I want
17:29 < DoNe_> ah okay
17:29 <@EastByte> but now I'm just using it for connecting dummys and chat stuff
17:31 < DoNe_> thats awesome could i use your client?
17:32 <@EastByte> nah, I don't want to share it, it also is really uncomplete and unstructured
17:32 <@EastByte> contains a lot of unreadable+not used code
17:33 < DoNe_> okay
17:33 <@EastByte> btw. there was this teeworlds quiz software
17:33 <@EastByte> from Botox
17:33 < DoNe_> ye
17:33 <@EastByte> did you check that?
17:33 < DoNe_> no didnt knew it was open source
17:33 <@EastByte> https://github.com/BotoX/teeworlds/tree/triviabot
17:34 <@EastByte> ah it's called trivia
17:34 <@EastByte> should be exactly what you need
17:35 < DoNe_> wow thanks ill try that
