00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo can i happily use thread_init() in tw code and it finishes and cleans up it self? or do i have to do some cleanup and memory management?
00:18 <+Learath2> I would use CJob's instead
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he is on ddnet 9.0.2
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we dont have that stuff there
00:32 <+Learath2> CJob's are teeworlds stuff
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> can I figure out is CGameClient initialized or not ?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> from where?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> internally
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> from inside of it
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc no function in `CGameClient` is called before `CGameClient::OnInit()` anyways
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Im trying to make register a chain for console. So executing autoexec will call this code
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Is it clear? What am I trying to say? 
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Probably Im doing something in a wrong way
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't think we keep track of whether OnInit has been called
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can either keep track of it yourself, or maybe you could tell me what you intend to do with CGameClient in the chain, then i can try to offer up a better solution
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> My purpose is to make overlay text entities size configurable. So I made command for it  what should update CMapImages.m_OverlayBottomTexture, CMapImages.m_OverlayTopTexture, etc
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also where do you register your chain?
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> CGameClient::OnConsoleInit()
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why do you need CGameClient to be initialized?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as it requires Map Images to initialize its textures (it uses graphics and other stuff)
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as it requires CMapImages to initialize its textures (it uses graphics and other stuff)
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> maybe it not trully requiress it but Im not that familiar with code as you may be
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> me neither, I haven't looked at much of the client codee
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but from what it seems, m_OverlayBottomTexture seems to be initialized to -1 on construction, then at OnInit it gets populated
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so if it is not already initialized it's not trivial to update, if it is initialized it is trivial
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the dragging laser doesnt work anymore
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao u fixed smth related to that?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Im 'corneum you need to give more details
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no dragging laser works neither from game layer nor from switch layer
14:16 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: yes, familiar with relational algebra
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have over 9000 commits!
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1559
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> indeed not investigated yet, sorry
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why is it closed
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he reverted the change
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Prediction kills me if one has hook off, hook u with endless and ure moving around with hook on
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen 
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Revert "Remove unmaintained Android code (fixes ddnet#1575)"
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt it mean u reverted it?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it means the commit is somewhere
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki you could check the actual code on master or the commit log on master whether the code is in there or not
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see sorry
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki i accidentally pushed it to one of my pr branches, and then immediately force-pushed to remove it
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> github is a bit pedantic in still linking to it but not telling you that it was deleted from every branc
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo esc keys are so hard to reach :c
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why do i have to press it all the time in vim for example -.-
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its so easy to aim for
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it isnt
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also differs on different keyboards
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> there are no ther buttons around it
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> usually
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea but sometimes there is a space row
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you have ""two"" most outher top left keys
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also far away
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you think about using mouse right and left klick to exit tw chat additionally to esc
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so you can react better if something happens
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it might be annoying on chat ppl who use 4 windowed tw clients and click around and copy paste etc xd
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> why would u have ur hand on ur mouse while chatting
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> it's a bad solution aswell
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because i react to situtation
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont u know it when u type a dadadadad instead of walking left and right
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because you were faster in tw movement position with hands than on esc
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> no i don't know it
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i always react kinda good when i gotta close my chat and play
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> in hh maps for example
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> same because i got used to it but i still think the other one is faster
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because you can go staright to mouse instead of esc and then mouse
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> are u left-handed @ChillerDragon ?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> cause
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> with my left hand i go straight to esc and with my right one i go straight to my mouse
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> so i'm fine
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah im not
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i do the same
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still then hand goes to esc instead to wasd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I go for the enter button:GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan:
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> u must be a nobo keyboard user
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yes
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @ChillerDragon do u know how many word per minutes u have ?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I type faster than i can read. Lol
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it not about words per minut elol
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and how do you measure that and what counts as word?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you play typeracer vs me i will losse af because i cant hit stuff like ' , and i misspeall every 2nd word. But i can mostly type everything out i want while playing tw
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ppl understand me
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> well idk how u could not have time to press esc and then get back to wasd
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> it's like 0.5 sec
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes thats the pint
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.5 too much
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i have time
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it would be an optimization imo
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also if u forgot that chat is open and you just want to react
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon just bind esc to another key on vim
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/16963/remap-esc-key-in-vim
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye thought about that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon alt to esc is
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c-[
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i already got used to esc xd
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> control [ i think
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i might remap esc in general on my keyboard xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> os site
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon dont remap esc if u are used to
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remap c-[
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i need this usb thingy
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for foot
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u got 2 ways
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like piano
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.coolstuff.com/autogen/preset/aspectThumb/1200x900/1831ad5d728153f817860d5c0bd5c29a.jpg
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> something like this
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> id like to connect the pedals from my usb wheel to my pc to use them as extra keys but its some special port that only goes in the wheel(((
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> My brother bought this enter button for his friend because he always rages very hard and punches his keyboard when playing LoL
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hello, idk since which client version it is like that but i dont like that your health bar disappears when you go /Pause
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It was always a good reminder when u were in freeze and someone unfreezes you (in a hammerhit part for example) while you are watching somewhere and you could very fast go back Because you could see that your health is "full"
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doesnt the health and armor show the ones from the guy ur watching?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> If u r in free watching it shows nothing now
