20:55 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: shouldn't there be a discord bot running?
20:56 < Learath2> the only bot i found seems a little prone to crashing when it feels like it
20:56 < Learath2> i might have to write one meself
22:39 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> why on this server kill protection won't work? Optik accidentally killed himself near finish and after finish we tried to test kill protection and we killed yourself with bind
22:39 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/326098581721448448/unknown.png
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Seems like you were fast, killprotection works after 20 minutes
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> nope, there were more then 100 mins
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> :wtf:
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe he bound kill; say /kill
22:40 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> killprotection should be like 5 minutes
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's configurable
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> ; doesnt work without extra command
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> where
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i meant. Configurable via server_config
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but okay, maybe should be configurable for each player
22:41 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or smth
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> it really should
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> idk what he bind but it worked for me then there is always kill protextion with my bind after 20 mins
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> especially in locked teams
22:42 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I love slipping off to my kill key
22:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you tested it now?
22:43 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> he told that he tried to chat smth, but we didn't see chat cloud above him, so  I think he accidentally push kill bind button
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> idk, some people boud say kill and kill
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> idk why, but
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> its not the bind, I told you I tested it with my bind, and my bind never let me kill myself after 20 mins
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but you understand what im saying?
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you say /kill; on chat
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it doesn't amtter if its 20 minutes
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Tezcan> yes he gets you
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or 5 minutes
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you wil die anyway
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> he didn't type /kill and problem is not with what he did, my bind killed me then it shouldn't
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so you tested it yea?
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> which port
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> yeah
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :ZULUL:
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :happy:
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nvm i got
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> All like?
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :prxGasm: :NotLikeNico: :nicoWink: :NicoSmug: :NicoEhehe: :TooLewd: :tomaNico: :nicoBomb: :nepSmug: :hubLewd:
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :p
22:48 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> @1110010hacker1101011  its developer chanell, pls don't go offtopic
22:48 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> ok
22:49 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :music:
22:49 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> question, did you finish?
22:49 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> +
22:50 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> -
22:50 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> but on other servers even after finish it won't let me kill with bind
22:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nope
22:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> after finish, your time is set to server-time
22:50 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then you can kill yourself
22:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it only works, when you are while racing
22:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> after finish nope
22:51 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> True
22:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> because then it doesn't matter if you will die or no. :PP you finished anyway so
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> is it smth new? coz if I remember correctly I couldn't kill myself with bind after finish
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :Emoticon_Smile_Face:
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nope
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it works like that since
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i wrote it
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :p
22:52 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> hm
22:53 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you need to "bind k kill" not "bind k say /kill"
22:53 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> ok, I'm testing it right now with u 😄 15 mins to go
22:53 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> saying /kill always kills you
22:53 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> I have bind f9 "kill"
22:53 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which actually is a weird way of doing this, maybe we should ask for confirmation in any case after 20 mins
22:54 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> could also maybe get x% of the average finish time
22:54 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> for what? /kill is extra command anyway
22:54 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> Savander |KoG| this /kill
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I've seen a lot of people suggest "bind k say /kill"
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which is stupid
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it is, right
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it will work only on ddnet
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so, if poeple are stupid
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it isn't right
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it bypasses kill protection
22:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> they can do
22:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> /kil /confirm in bind. but
22:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe we can add something like
22:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> "Confirm kill command by saying /kill again"
22:56 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we should just require two kill inputs of any kind
22:57 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so if a flag is set kill the guy on any kill input if not set the flag
22:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or maybe, we should just switch the name of command
22:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> to something more. . .
22:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ehm,
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> switch the name of which one?
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ./kill
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> to maybe
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ./confirm_kill
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe poeple just think that
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> /kill is the only way to suicide/restart game
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so they binding it
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well if it's going to be ./confirm_kill it shouldn't kill you at all
22:59 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well it effectively is the only way to kill oneself after 20 mins
23:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i propose we make /kill and kill analogous and make them check a common flag
23:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so even if people bind the wrong one they still get kill protection \o/
23:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so if you want to commit suicide, you need to kill yourself twice?
23:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, send flag
23:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> after 20 mins yeah i guess
23:02 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> what if you accidentialy press kill twice? D:
23:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you could always get a bind like say /allowsemicolon;/kill;/kill to nuke yourself 😛
23:02 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, i know that
23:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well if you are spamming kill you prolly want to die
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't think so, sometimes you wwant to start chating
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are writing someone, then OH cmon
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i didn't press "T"
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> buum, you are dead
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> because you said twice "A " XD
23:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or somehitng
23:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Idea
23:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you want to kill yourself, then you have to type random string, which will be generated by server
23:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, nobody will kill accidentialy 😄
23:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or something like PIN, 4 numbers
23:05 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> that's just ridiculous amount of work just to kill yourself 😛
23:05 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> don't think we get that many accidental kills either
23:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but look at it from another side.
23:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are playing a insane map
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then you are accidentialy press twice kill command, OH CMON i died
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but now, you have to type 4 numbers, random numbers
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you really want to die
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> everyone are happy
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> @Learath2 not so many with 20 min protection, but then it won't work its kinda bad
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause it will be neccessary only afeter 20 mib
23:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ;D
23:07 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well i'm not sure
23:08 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we could poll for it i guess
23:08 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i have a proposal, let the people who don't think when doing their binds recieve it's consequence :D
23:08 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i for one wouldn't want to type a PIN just to reset a run
23:08 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> pin sounds overkill
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was just a stupid idea, don't take it serious
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> /kill -y
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> make it the unix way
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> /kill --yes -r='because yes"
23:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with -R
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it will kill everyone, recursive
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> V
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :V
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> /kill --force --verbose --reason="I hate my life"
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> rm -rf / --reason="suicide is the only option"
23:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> once
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i did chmod 000 -R
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> in .
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> no it was
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> chmod 666 -R
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander type all in one sentence please xD
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry, im old. It works like that 15 yeas ago
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol
23:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i pressed enter every word :3
23:12 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no one liked  that ever, they were just being polite
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i didn't say
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyone likes that
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i said, it was LIKE THAT then xD
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> was it?
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup
23:13 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> It felt like a dynamic conversation, you know
23:13 < Learath2> MSN, AOL?
23:14 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?: O
23:14 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> set protection time to the (average finish time)/2
23:14 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> maybe would be a good idea
23:14 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> Being able to set your own protection time might be nice
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> http://z0r.de/7898
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> 😄
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it wouldnt save accross servers nor accross disconnects connects i think
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so my idea is better imo
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <jao> Ryozuki that would be bad on super long or super short maps
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> easy to fix
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> set a min and max
23:15 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can add to client
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <jao> So basicly like it is right now
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> kill protection time
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mm
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that would be it
23:16 < Learath2> ooh an account system would work nicely with that :P
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander :D xD
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath2, yea!
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 you went to the dark side (irc)
23:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> anotherer advantage !
23:16 < Ryozuki> :o
23:16 < Learath2> much much easier to use irc
23:17 < Ryozuki> much lightweight and faster
23:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> fuck lightweighting
23:17 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xd
23:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i likes dark theme, future
23:17 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :/
23:17 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i have dark theme in irc
23:18 < Learath2> my irc theme is completely dark
23:18 < Learath2> much darker then the discord theme too
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with, fireworks
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and effects
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/326108362557358080/Screenshot_1.png
23:18 < ddnet-discord> Command sent from Discord by Savander:
23:18 < ddnet-discord> !! !
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> im web designer k?
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> not C
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:18 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> lvl :c
23:19 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @1110010hacker1101011 int 0x80
23:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 404php
23:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/lVT2DjUD50155
23:20 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> The "int" instruction calls an interrupt. An interrupt is basically a signal to the CPU which stops it, and calls a special handler function (declared in the IDT, or Interrupt Descriptor Table).  On many UNIX-based OSes, interrupt 80h, or 128, triggers a system call (with the call number in EAX, and its arguments in EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, and EBP). This is highly implementation specific, and could do anything in different
23:20 < ddnet-discord> OSes. #bored
23:20 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> @RyO's What 0x80?
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> int 0x80 its an assembly instruction
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> https://learath2.info/sc.png
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> explained in the big text i sent
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> ah
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 true dark side xD
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> :\
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> look like a, 80s star wars
23:21 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it could be worse
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> system to destroy the planets
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like @deen is mother-planet or smoething
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <RyO's> For a second i thought i have a Friend ;__;
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i had greyer colors then that
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> zwel is an moon
23:22 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but i noticed it looks much better likes this
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://www.vivaolinux.com.br/imagens/artigos/comunidade/bitchx.jpg despite the name, looks cool ascii
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> meh, i don't like console look
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander I didn't either
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i like the style of the ubuntu terminal
23:23 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its beutiful
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but then you notice how much quicker you can work on a terminal
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Could you show me?
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FoJ3EnWEhvtB7foVgXmNHu9Fa-j93mSVPMnV0hjLb4Qv8ZDAg9ZSJF3sZyk_7I6zF6WovRaPxUC--kGF5Al0QnCu-ffIWliTF2Xk8l_PV5q-LBySREg
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe, but i don't need to be quick as possible
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> with oh my zsh u can do this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakaziko99/agnosterzak-ohmyzsh-theme/master/images/agnosterzak-01.png
23:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :O, lookss/ pretty
23:25 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> see when you take out the pain of working through a (most of the time badly designed) ui and add all the gained time to doing things that you actually enjoy it's worth it
23:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe, but im not using linux muhc time.
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> rather, photoshop/adobe_premier_pro/after_effects
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and phpstorm to code in PHP and HTMl/CSS + JS
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well in your case it's different, I do a lot of C and most of the time windows gets in the way
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> console is only ran, when im using pug with sass
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> with it's ugly ass unresizable 1960's console and half ass'd support for C99
23:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea i klnow, web development is much different
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> than c programming
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> visual studio + c# works so well
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh yea, using C# with unity
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i don't need to use conosle then, Unity do it for me
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i've done some web development on linux for the last couple of days, I must say i'm quite impressed with how much the tooling improved, but still nowhere near the adobe CS
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> vim is still best
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> as a editor yes
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its not an ide
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm learning  Sublime Text 3
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> there is vim mode
23:28 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> loved working with Unreal, not so much with Unity, Unity seems to have contradicting information everywhere even in its documentation
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Sublime Text 3 is brilliant
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://spacemacs.org/
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> contradicting information?
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> fkin emacs
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hate emacs b/c emacs tries to become a bloody OS
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats the spaceemacs desc
23:29 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> spacemacs = vim + emacs
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> there is a goddamn teledildonics plugin for emacs
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://spacemacs.org/img/screenshots/ss5.png
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats how it looks
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it looks cool
23:30 < ddnet-discord> <gdin> vim all the way
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> @Ryozuki good photo
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <1110010hacker1101011> cool +
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> vim ftw!
23:31 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> gdin + manjaro
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> https://learath2.info/scc.png
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> c has foreach?
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> nice
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> my vim used to look all cool, then i lost my vimrc, then i didn't want to bother creating a new one, then i found sublime
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/JOr2jfmi50244
23:33 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ZimE that is python, was trying to serialize the entire gamestate with generated code
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> LARAVEL :V
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> .h python
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> wut
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> Omg get theme for sublime text @Learath2  https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> ;-;
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ZimE if you pay attention i'm most certainly on the tab of genser.py
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i tired
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> sry
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> looks cool
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Oblikumquat \
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander never quite enjoyed using frameworks in PHP, they usually do one thing wrong which gets me mad then i end up rewriting the entire thing
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> im using laravel , cause i need to find a job
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> laravel is most common framework used in web development
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> @Savander actually yours looks pretty neat as well is that the material theme?
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> symfony?
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, material + Jeffery Way
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Oblikumquat used to use Cobalt 2
23:35 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> laravel is most popular
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't want to split myself
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i really love the background color in monokai
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> I can't stand the white sidebar on the default theme on sublime
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> get atom
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> ❤
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> using atom for pug and sass xD
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> (y)
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander obv, it's just that I have issues 😛
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> atom takes 300years to load up
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> ^
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> now ay
23:36 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ye atom is so slow
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i used atom
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> takes 5 times the hdd space
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and it was faster than sublime
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i replaced atom with vs code
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe my computer is too good (yt)
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> even after i load it up it's slow in editing files
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> For some reason I always so "Ryozuki is playing Visual Studio Code" on discord
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause, Ryozuki is pro codder. Anyway
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander i have 16gb ram and 4core 3.2ghz computer with a 350€ gpu and its still slow
23:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> how about your game? 😄
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> im not pro xD
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are!~
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander working on it, its a long way
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> ryozuki u forgot to tick "fast mode"
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :). anyway. Sublime is good for a projet, where you know every class, function and code
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> when you are working with framework
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's better to use some ide
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like phpstorm, for PHP
23:38 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i even tried some bleeding edge optimized build that cut down on loading times by 80% and it was still slower then sublime and vim :/
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> u cant be faster than vim
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> lul
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nope
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sublime ends up being faster for huge files actually
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> rly?
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> didnt know
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> b/c sublime doesn't load the entire file at once while vim won't render it until it's all in memory
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> and i thought atom > sublime... i uninstall atom now, thx guys
23:39 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ZimE by all means use what you enjoy
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i love the atom trailer
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's about productivity not about following the bandwagon
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i like to join ur bandwagon
23:40 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i love the atom git integration while the one in sublime sucks bull testicles
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> I'm annoyed that sublime text constantly nags me to pay for it Also you probably can't beat the git integration on atom considering that github made it
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> reason why i don't use sublime
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> crack it urself
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> lul
23:41 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nah
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i like more vs code
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'd gladly pay for it if the guy wasn't smoking crack with that 70$ price
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> like WTF
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> XDD
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> ikr, $70 wtf
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> crack lul
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'd pay 20-30$ easily
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> it's a great editor tbh
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 poor guy, he needs his daily coffee
23:42 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if he sold it for 30$ i'd bet a lot more people would buy it
23:43 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sure he'd need to triple his sales
23:43 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> We need an economist
23:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> he should be like putin, decrease taxes
23:43 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> more people will buy it
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like more pople now pay taxes
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> IDEs are all doing it wrong too
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> instead of making things lightweight they pile on feature after feature
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Facebook shows me that: https://teamsql.io/
23:44 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> looks perfect 😮 dark design 😮
23:45 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> dark ftw
23:45 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> light themes shouldn't exist
23:45 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they are eye killers
23:45 < ddnet-discord> <ZimE> dont jump o nthe dark bandwagon guys!
23:45 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> had the "pleasure" of using Visual Studio a couple of days ago, took me 5 hours to rebuild the stupid index, 2 hours for VAX to rebuild it's index and when i unloaded a project from the solution it did it all again
23:46 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i havent got a problem with vs studi
23:46 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it works better with c 3
23:46 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> c#
23:46 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> *
23:46 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> than c++ tho
23:47 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i used it for both and you are quite right about that, C# seems to work better, but both crap out at the huge scale of projects that VS claims to cater for
23:47 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> just try loading the UE4 engine code on a computer that is less then the latest
23:47 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its true vs eats lot of ram
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> lucky i have lot :P
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> don't get me started  on MSVC which has no business calling itself a compiler
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I had 16gb on the pc here back in turkey and it quickly hit the ceiling and slowed down considerably, b/c oom you know
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> m$ made c# and vs so obviusly they focused their ide to be perfect with c#
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol, it's windows
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's normal, it eats
23:48 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 16gb ram
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander it eats <2gb
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> depends what im doing
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki m$ was working on MSVC and C++ looong before C# was even a thing
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> msvc sucks
23:49 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki try loading a huge project like UE4 or some other recent engine
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> What c++ ide does everybody use when they don't use visual studio
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> UE4 looks like a too big engine
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i prefer unity xD
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no IDE at all seems to work amazingly for C++ 😛
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yea
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> never found a perfect one
23:51 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 you tried qtcreator?
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it also encourages better programming practices then spamming autocomplete 😛
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> I tried modding some TW code with eclipse, but it crashed a lot
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2  http://www.codeblocks.org/
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah i used eclipse the first time around too
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i dont like eclipse
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> You tried CLion ?
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> vs is better
23:52 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nice IDE so sad that they bloated it to crap with features and it's written in Java(eugh)
23:53 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> Doesn't Jetbrains stuff cost a ton
23:53 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> depends
23:53 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> not that much if u are student etc
23:53 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> CLion was cute, QtCreator meh, DevC++ horrible, VS sluggish
23:54 < ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> Oh thx @Ryozuki I didn't notice that
23:54 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i guess im to used to vs ¯_(ツ)_/¯
23:54 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> never got around to using code::blocks b/c when i learned about it i was already enjoying my split screen of text editor and terminal
23:54 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki VS works fine for the small stuff and the lag becomes less and less noticable the smaller your project is
23:54 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> What about, Dev-C++?
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Devcpp5110.png
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how much ram you have?
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but then you try sublime on the same project and it skips around code like its butter
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki 32G
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> lol
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's not about the ram
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why so much?
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you render or smth?
23:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> he stroe data in ram
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> modern games and shitty browser coding sucks my ram dry
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 32gb is overkill still i think xD
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> neither of them give 2 shits about memory management b/c modern languages teach them to just leave it to the GC
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like a php programmers
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and working with big data
23:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> (y)
23:57 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well brb playing lol
23:57 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you trigger a manual GC cycle in Rust (Unity) it takes down ram usage by 6G after an hour of play
23:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> select * from big_table with milion records
23:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, to ram
23:57 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> google chrome and firefox both love just taking all available ram
23:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> right, but imo. firefox is slower
23:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and generally, i don't like it
23:58 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and i like playing inbetween working in unreal so that also takes a crapton of ram
23:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> are you working on some kind of game?
23:58 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I used to love firefox, then they added garbage after garbage, making it slower and slower every patch
23:59 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so now i have to use chromium which also leaks as much but atleast it works fast
