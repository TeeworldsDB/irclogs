00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @Learath2 my aunt called me like barsik for a month
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xopowo is my fav
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @Learath2 my aunt called me barsik for a month
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a couple friends from the easternmost regions of turkey and the more north you go the more the language becomes slav
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen the bug is just launch the game, ctrl+shift+E to open editor, alt+tab to change windows, alt+tab to go back to tw AND IT'S BROKEN
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> in the 80s, the girls moved to Turkey, where they actually started a relationships
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> during this period, there was a stereotype that girls of the Soviet Union are easily accessible
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> and i think that stereotype is still alive
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd wager the bug is specific to the way windows does alt-tabbing so @deen probably cant reproduce it in wine
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> and there are weird values then:
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726563920554491964/unknown.png
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> X changes between -44 and 44 when I move the mouse
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had an idea for a second, then it went away
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> sdl's problem maybe
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd have happened in old versions too
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lady Saavik do you know when it changed? ddnet14?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yea probably in last updates, I was doing it all the time for sure while testing
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> and it never happened before
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> new DDNet has so many bugs :(((
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> it all started when I broke it with /spec + super!!!
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> now there is a curse
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üò¶
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do our best to fix stuff before releasing
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik I checked for SDL bugs and couldn't find a related one
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik if you can reproduce it reliably could you grab an old DDNet version (something like DDNet 12) and put the SDL2.dll from that into the new directory. Does that fix it?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 C√∏ke said someone also had it in DDNet 13
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > now there is a curse
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we've just been developing more and that's why we have more bugs.
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> This editor bug is driving me crazy as well
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen I took SDL2 file from DDNet 12.5 and it's fixed
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> xd
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik thanks, so this seems to be yet another SDL bug. I suggest we downgrade SDL2 yet again...
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen @TortiLeq there are so many typos in polish translation, I will fix it
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik thanks, but wait a second
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please take this file as the basis: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet/ddnet/73e1d0c72d34cfa5aa28ef08051090d4ad07cf10/data/languages/polish.txt
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so, before this pr server sended objects in constant distance for all players?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so now players won't disappear even before reaching edge of any screen since I was playing on zoom 7? üéâ
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> of my screen*
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen next bug :(((
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> when I join test server and kill while 'super' is enabled, then I get this msg when trying to go through start: "You can't start while loading/saving of team is in progress"
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, easy to fix
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> > yes
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen omg that's awesome but I HOPE IT WORKS WITH DYN CAM TOO! becayse the distance you can see it's bigger then?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> omg finally i dont need showall bind anymore
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> deen Ehrenmann
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the distance chosen should be far enough to still see everyone with dyncam
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @deen so @noby can ban me if i zooz on fng? :feelsbadman: :banhammer: :zoozer:
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :feelsbadman: :feelsbadman:
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can and will
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> his server will get a message about that, yes üòÑ
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I'll use older client :feelsamazingman:
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> time to make the feature where i can set a certain ip range to be forced to play with updated client
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> FV
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> pls dont force poor french people to use latest client
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> oh wait i can just change version number too :troll:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i hope u do
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> nvm i dont zooz anymore :feelsbadman:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :kek:
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, I wonder what was wrong in SDL2.0.12
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen don't hate me but another bug xd
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> idk what causes it, I can record a video
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> shields didn't work on test srv and I wasn't super
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I could keep my weapons
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I rejoined and can't do that anymore, idk
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> *x-files theme plays*
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> seems like its fixed then
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep fixed
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we should find a way to report issues in a better way
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it'd be cute if we could serialize some of the state quickly when something is reported
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> has this been reported yet?
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726772438158934066/Untitled-1.mp4
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> has been a thing since forever
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oof
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The bullets belong to the gameworld, so they only have meh masking
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it only effects one person at a time
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> any ddnet rewrite should probably include separate gameworlds for each team
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> who fixed stoppers that Didnt work when turned with n/m?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nori fixed them for a second, @deen unfixed them when we noticed people actually did rely on the behaviour
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Nah i didnt mean the stopper physics
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> I mean the old bug Where stoppers didnt work if u didnt use CCW button to turn them
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> In editor
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> heinrich fixed it
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :O
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Why
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because its a bug
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> i wanted to use it :feelsbadman:
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Is it serverside fixed or clientside
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> serverside
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> sad
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 with the new version patch a couple clients started to show up as version -1, shouldn't they show up as version 0 after the server didn't get neither the old nor the new version message?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> encountered this weird little bug, not sure how it happened (grenades are flashing)
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726818465062584369/gif.gif
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> do you... shoot hamburgers?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> hmm, looks like a showothersalpha thing. does it go away if you change showothersalpha (0 or 100), or type showothers?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I didn't do anything to showothers, I was just in a team and finished the map
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's on a test server btw, if that matters
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh ok. if its a different server version maybe, but not sure
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like a ddnet test server?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut was testing a weird projectile hack that was sending projectiles only every couple ticks iirc
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> hm its strange but when i type /save 1 and then writing /load 1 server says "No such gamesave for that map"
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 context?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> and if i type /save r1 and /load r1 then it writing like u must wait some time
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> strange
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The rocket disappearing on certain ticks looked like it was like what you were trying @fokkonaut
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik can't repro
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @barsik well the saving does take a little time, how fast were you trying
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mysql replication also can take a bit
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> no no
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i typed "/save 1" and had killed
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> then i typed "/load 1"and server said "No such gamesave for that map"
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> then i typed "/load" and server said that i havent loads
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> then i typed "/load" and server said that i havent saves
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik can you tell me the ip, port and time
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> also that bug have guys on RUS Solo Server
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/726830650220347502/unknown.png
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> time?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> 18:52 utc+3
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```

18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 yes
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wtf i hadnt typed it before
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone else had?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it seems to be one of the most popular passwords
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> also i got killed :/
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i thought that those codes are bind with playername
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the save-code exists it should have reloaded your team, I think
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I just verified that it seems to work
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik on the server it looks like you killed yourself
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wtf no
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2020-06-28 17:52:05][debug]: line='/save 1'

18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @deen come to this server
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but there is no `3 used /kill`
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh shit
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so rather looks like it didn't reload his team
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it actually kills you on solo server
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> stopped at killin
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xD
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's very unfortunate
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xD
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i only tested on non-solo server
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> huh
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What I have to do if my srv says the port is already used but I have no srv open with that port?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Might aswell be something else that uses the port
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> simply change it in config
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is probably unhelpful but i found out today that the way the tokens are calculated must be exactly the same as it is in default teeworlds for 0.7 registration to work
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I had few minutes before a srv with that port open
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this isnt the case for 0.6 registration, or other tw connections
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but if uve modified that part of the code, thats the problem
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Trafalgar Law then maybe just restart pc
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ? xD
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Its on my VPS
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> well then
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is there a way to check if a port is using rn?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Seems like 0.7 players can't see votes
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> mysql server ded xd
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dead how?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> ded
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubbacio> jej
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> > dead how?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> dead like my sense of humor
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @barsik sorry, i don't get it. servers seem to be up to me and ranks are synced
