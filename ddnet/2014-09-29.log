14:29 <@deen> GER ddosed
14:29 < EastByte> not good
14:29 <@deen> people still prefer to play there even if they know it gets ddosed
14:29 <@deen> over FRA
14:30 <@deen> afk
14:30 < EastByte> deen: fake some fra servers as ger and let's see what happens
14:30 <@deen> EastByte: i did
14:30 < EastByte> oh
14:30 <@deen> i called them FRA/GER initially :P
14:31 < EastByte> meh
14:31 <@deen> but players on there always complain about lags
14:31 <@deen> ping from egypt +60, lags for some people in Germany and so on
14:32 < laxa_work> pause: Hello nub.
14:32 <@deen> i can even understand them
14:32 <@deen> i'm so used to GER ping that +20 makes brutal maps a lot harder
14:32 < pause> laxa_work: Did you understand my code eventually ? xD
14:32 < laxa_work> Yeah I understand it.
14:33 < laxa_work> But I would not be able to reproduce it.
14:33 < pause> laxa_work: Kinda dirty, it's between C and C++
14:34 < pause> Would have been way better with <algorithm>
14:34 < laxa_work> anyway, it's fixed, let's talk about something else
14:34 < laxa_work> I am going to smoke, brb
14:43 < o_be_one> hellow :)

14:45 < pause> I do C/C++/ruby/javascript mainly
14:46 < pause> I'm also a big fan of laxa's sister as some here noticed
14:46 < laxa_work> you forgot to mention your love of PHP
14:49 < pause> Oh yes, for me PHP is the best language ever
14:49 < pause> Because i believe it gives cancer to those using it
14:50 < pause> Best kind of problems are those that solve themselves =)
14:50 < EastByte> good one

15:06 < pause> laxa_work: Yeah =D
15:07 < laxa_work> I'll contact them to know if they do the 60euros/menu that day.
15:07 < laxa_work> Will redpist come?
15:07 < laxa_work> Cause if they do, I'll need to reserve.
15:07 < pause> I hope the surprise guest will be here =D
15:08 < laxa_work> surprise guest?
15:08 < EastByte> kobra is fucking shit
15:08 < laxa_work> EastByte: don't be mad.
15:08 < EastByte> I am
15:08 < pause> laxa_work: Yes, the surprise guest =)
15:08 < laxa_work> pause: who are you talking about?!
15:08 < laxa_work> My sister or what?
15:09 < pause> assert(guest->hasBoobies())
15:09 < EastByte> the world just segfaulted
15:09 < EastByte> oh wait, no segfault
15:10 < laxa_work> So, I reserver for 2.
15:10 < pause> Hey, a little respect for assertions
15:11 < pause> laxa_work: Redpist doesnt know if he comes
15:12 < laxa_work> First we need to know if we can get the menu a ferier day
15:12 < laxa_work> Here is the menu btw: http://www.alaindutournier.com/wp/carredesfeuillants/files/2012/11/view_menu_dej_tentation-FR29.pdf
15:14 < pause> laxa_work: Redpist said yes when he saw the menu =D
15:15 < laxa_work> lol
15:15 < laxa_work> He knows that it's 60 euros without drinks and 95 with drinks right?
15:16 < laxa_work> And I think it would be better to go there well dressed.
15:16 < laxa_work> !fr-en costard
15:16 < Nimda> Translation: pants
15:16 < laxa_work> !fr-en costume
15:16 < Nimda> Translation: costume
15:16 < laxa_work> With a costume!
15:19 < pause> Well i've got none so that'll be without
15:19 < laxa_work> Sure, I already saw you wearing one on a picture!
15:21 < pause> laxa_work: Well i don't have it anymore
15:22 < laxa_work> So bad. I guess we will do without. But I am wondering how you are dressed on job interview.
15:22 < pause> Well, jeans tshirt or shirt when i feel like it
15:22 < pause> I'm not a fcuking banker
15:23 < laxa_work> xD
15:23 < pause> And if they require me to wear a costume, well it means i don't belong there
15:23 < pause> Easy filter
15:31 < laxa_work> A shirt will do fine I hope.

20:29 < heinrich5991> I said I'm a lot younger than you
20:30 < heinrich5991> (I'm 19)

20:30 < laxa> No offense heinrich5991, but I don't get people adding their birthday or even region number in their nickname
20:30 <@deen> region number?
20:30 < laxa> dunno how it works in germany
20:30 < heinrich5991> laxa: that was 12 year old me.
20:30 < heinrich5991> just haven't changed it

20:31 < laxa> yeah
20:31 < heinrich5991> what's that supposed to mean?
20:32 < laxa> it was inspired by an old cs 1.3 player
20:32 < laxa> he was called lat0r

20:33 < heinrich5991> !wtf deen
20:33 < Nimda> Arabic word for religion, faith. There are several meanings of Deen. One meaning is honour, government, empire, monarchy and rulership. The second meaning is quite opposite to it, i.e. subordination, obedience, slavery, servitude and subjection. Third meaning is to account, to give judgment, and dispense reward and punishment of actions. The word Deen has been used in the Qur9an in all these three meanings.
20:33 < Nimda> Example: "Deen with Allah is al-Islam" and | "And whoso seeketh as Deen other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him."
20:33 <@deen> haha

20:43 < EastByte> oh it's not a tag
20:44 < EastByte> it's a tag
20:44 <@deen> Maybe I should just rename it on the website from Network to DDNet
20:44 <@deen> then you can leave out the [DDNet]
20:44 < laxa> I'll update the bot accordingly to what you do anyway.
