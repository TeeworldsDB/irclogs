05:15 < eeeee> updated http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html , resizing should be fixed now (no longer results in broken fonts)
05:15 < eeeee> also got rid of pointer lock, it was too annoying to use
05:16 < eeeee> implemented a quick hack for spectating instead, it kind of works now
05:18 < eeeee> pullreq almost ready, all the new code is cleaned up and put inside #ifdefs , except for client.cpp where i had to extract the main loop
05:18 < eeeee> gotta figure out how to #ifdef that and we're gtg
05:19 < eeeee> Learath2: any progress on serverlist? i think other than serverlist it works fine, looks like we can release soon!
05:28 <@deen> eeeee: awesome!
05:30 <@deen> hm, it's difficult to play without pointer lock
05:30 <@deen> when my mouse leaves the window i lose focus
07:04 < eeeee> deen: is that a problem?
07:04 < eeeee> i didn't really feel uncomfortable like that
07:05 < eeeee> you think we can adjust some mouse settings (like dynamic camera distances and stuff) to make it playable or the pointer lock is the only option?
11:59 < Micro> hi
12:29 <@deen> eeeee: I can't imagine how anything other than pointer lock would work =/ Could you make it optional? I agree that it's annoying if you switch a lot, but when playing it's good to have
12:29 <@deen> Micro: hi
16:14 < Nimda> SorGores 1 by Soreu just released on Solo at 2015-03-01 16:13
19:14 < Muttley> ddnet ger mayor lags
19:16 <@deen> dumdum: ddos incoming
21:38 < eeeee> hmm. in that case i guess i'll try to keep the current absolute pointer positioning but use pointer lock just to keep the pointer inside the window
21:38 < eeeee> that way would at least be possible to toggle it
21:41 < eeeee> can also release it when user presses esc, and then re-grab it several seconds after user has finished interacting with the menu
