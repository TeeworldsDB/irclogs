01:19 <+bridge_> [00:27:33] [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 circle 1 is getting nuked soon
01:19 <+bridge_> [00:27:53] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
01:19 <+bridge_> [00:28:10] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you mean?
01:19 <+bridge_> [00:28:33] [ddnet] <Learath2> CircleCI is phasing out the old api
01:19 <+bridge_> [00:28:39] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
01:19 <+bridge_> [01:14:19] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 by old API you mean old container?
01:19 <+bridge_> [01:14:22] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?

01:19 < ***> Playback Complete.
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is client 10083 bot?
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <worstwish> yes
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> version number is easy to fake + pretty much useless for detecting bots with a few exceptions (16,502,602,605,708)
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> 10083 is a real version if thats what ur asking
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby pro bot regoniser
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991  are there plans for regonising bots and ban them automatically?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bots are forbidden on ddnet
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> automatic banning isn't implemented as it would be kind of useless, unless you want to start an arms race
16:58 <+Learath2> recognising bots automatically is not really possible with deterministically
16:59 <+Learath2> s/with//
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well how does noby do it on his server then?
16:59 <+Learath2> his code makes very educated guesses
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> So it is not 100%?
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 100% is basically impossible
17:00 <+Learath2> as long as noone knows noby's criterion for bots it works, as soon as I learn the criteria I can write a bot that can work around it
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well let's say it bans half of all bots out there it would be something already.
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> right
17:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see how the most popular games suffer from bots even though they have millions of dollars
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 not really true, people even work around these detections without having access to the code
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> people just havent bothered to do this yet for only one server
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> but on something larger like ddnet they probably would
17:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Most bot users are not smart enough to build one. The builder don't like to spread a working client. Then it is already kicking 80% of all bot isers
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "The builder don't like to spread a working client."
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by adding protections we do create a market for these bots
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently no one is interested in this because there's no reason to be interested
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And ddnet is also open source
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we don't have the element of obsecurity
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ^ plus i cant think of a good way to detect replay bots which seem like more of a problem than aimbots
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should put funny hats on botters heads :P harmless and fun
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> then people will start botting to have a hat
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Public shaming
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can write "I'm retarded" on the hat
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> u could just bot on other peoples names and theyd get the hat? xd
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No it's per session obv
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you could do smth like adding [BOT] before botter‚Äòs names
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby this is detectable if they compare movement from old races to new ones.
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And replace their chat messages transparently with sentences like "I am a shameful human being for botting", "Please do not interact or play with me" " I do not deserve to have any friends" "Block me pls"
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Haha
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <N9mkOik> üëçüèø
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 sounds good, and easy
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëå
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: I have a folder named `providers` I'm going to add a file that defines a class of the name `iconProvider` in it. What would you name the file? `iconProvider.js` || `icon.js`?
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `icon.js`
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Sounds promising...
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Sounds promissing...
18:22 <+Learath2> one s in promising was correct :P
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Sounds promising...
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Lolmao
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can demos actually start at the startline and not one second after it?
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ask @redix if he ever comes back around
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @n000b just find out an algorithm to detect bots
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> if you're (really * 10^99) crazy
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> why not creating a machine learning that will learn how to find out bots xD
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on a block chain
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @ReiTW | Blizzard Team well noby already knows how to detect aim bots.
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> you mean something bypassable?
19:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> xD
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> everything is bypassable
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Does a trained ape count as a bot?
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> just like, ur lock generally only needs to be more secure than ur neighbor's lock to be effective
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Or your house less worthy of breaking in
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Or your house less worthy of being broked in
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @noby depends what exactly
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> not rly everything is bypassable
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> its literally impossible to make 100% accurate bot detection for an open source game, either itll get false positives or its possible to bypass
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it is literally impossible to make 100% accurate bot detection for a game
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> that said its possible to write code that detects all existing bots, until someone makes a better one
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ye
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> telepathy
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i was kicked from nobys server for using the aimbind once
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> the aimbind?xd
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> the detector used to have lots of problems
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> im not sure when this happened but lol
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aimbind already sounds illegitemate üòÑ
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the one which makes you aim at a perfect angle.
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> that sounds like an aimbot
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> lol
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye its hacky bu possible with vanilla
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> do u remember when this happened
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound wrong that you were kicked by @noby's detection
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its just a bind that sets the cursor really close to you so you can only aim at certain angles
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im not aiming at players with it
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> did u play like that for a while or did it detect as soon as u changed it
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> if the latter then it was probably a while ago
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i held down the button and tried to play with it.  its actually retarded to turn it on normally if youre not doing a double grenade.
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ahh
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye it was a while ago
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> ive fixed alot of false positive bugs since then, but i can see why using such short distance might eventually trigger it lol
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> would be interesting if u tried again now that ive updated it
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oke wait
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> worked üëç
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @noby I talk about global things
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> its an analogy
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> not only game bots x)
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> sure it is impossible to deploy a protection for that
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i mean, a perfect one
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> > i was kicked from nobys server for using the aimbind once
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> everyone who uses it is a cheater anyway
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> same with autohammer
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> what is autohammer? and i dont think fixed angle aim bind is a cheat in fng just useless
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> binding hammer on mousewheel so that u can spam it fullspeed whole time
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> but its more of a problem in vnailla i guess
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> binding hammer to mousewheel so that u can spam it fullspeed whole time
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <snail> :magnet:
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <dIeD> and yea it may be useless in fng but i see alot of people use it in ddr
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> why is dummy hammerfly allowed when its also an aimbot
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/418506811604336640/Screen_Shot_2018-02-28_at_2.35.19_PM.png
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby because it's an official feature of the ddnet client, I guess
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> omfg apple is gay
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> just wanna say
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> ‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞û‚Äå‡∞æ
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> haha
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> ‚ù§ @noby
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> gay is okay
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> na
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> i just laugh when i see that fcking CVE
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> CVE-2018-4124
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> When you understand than google > apple
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> & than even an intel pentium 4 shitty pc running xfce debian > mac
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> aha
