01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> is the website down?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> apparently yep
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> :'v
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet.tw? Should be up
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, server got attacked around the time you wrote
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hey deen
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> there is any way to translate for the map editor?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz i cant find the way for it
11:02 <@deen> Nope
11:02 <@deen> The editor buttons are hard-coded in English
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ah shit
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could change it, but not sure it's worth it
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lez translate the whole ddnet src code to hindi first in the hindi branch
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Cellegen i mean srsly what button of the editor is so confusing for u ? xd
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well that would be a lot nicer
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like on my first 3 years i didnt even know what "expand" really needed
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like on my first 3 years i didnt even know what "expand" really meant
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxd
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so ye
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for begginers that would be super helpful
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats how you learn english
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fuk u
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> xd
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no u :p
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :c
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but lets face it, i want to change all of the english sentences for good
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but its just complicated shit all over
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and the back point will be the translation itself
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like a lot of languages will be missing that section
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:baka:398262714897793029>
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> People asked me if ddcat is removed on purpose or by accident in the latest version
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> hey about the fps jerks
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> seems like I'm not the only one?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> but it's not just fps... gametime margin and prediction margin also dip
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> every like... 10 seconds everything dips. happens everywhere, including map editor.

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Element Finland try older ddnet versions like 10.8.6. that can solve this problem.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it would be more useful to get the problem sorted out
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah i know, but i dont have knowledge about that.
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i can't monitor that
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and the other devs don't care
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so rip
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but @Element Finland you could defenitely look what client version is the first that has these laggs, then it will already make the number of possibilities much smaller
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> hey it's me
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> starts happening between DDNet-11.4.4-win64 and DDNet-11.4.6-win64
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> well in human words doesn't happen in 11.4.4
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok thanks
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it happent to me when i was using 32 bit cpu
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Element Finland you're using ATH right
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> on the picture it looks so far like ATH
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Element Finland> ATH?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> allthehaxx
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b sigh, it's the christmas special, so you get hats instead!
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen ah thnx i already said that.
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But alexander up here was also complaining about it with his bad english
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nobody understood it tho
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Thnx:GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan:
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nobody is worse, than danilbest tho :troll:
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> jk
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :heartw:
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tyurderi> wow
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tyurderi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1413
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> with 'cl_reset_wanted_weapon_on_death 1', is it normal that although you can only select the wanted weapon using the key, if you change weapon using mousewheel the wanted weapon is gone
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's normal
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> alright ðŸ˜ƒ
