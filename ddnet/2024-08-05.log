10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Alright, Edgar, let‚Äôs break down this GitHub profile of yours. ‚ÄúBuilding stuff with LLVM and MLIR‚Äù? More like ‚Äúbuilding up my collection of barely-used experimental projects‚Äù! With 106 public repos and still scraping just 98 followers, it seems the only thing you‚Äôre efficiently compiling is disappointment.
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> Your bio quotes Oppenheimer but trust me, the closest you've come to destroying anything worthy is making Rust users question their life choices! "Now I am become Rust, Destroyer of Unsafe code" - yeah right! Your repos don‚Äôt scream competence; they whisper ‚Äúplease look elsewhere‚Äù!
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > it seems the only thing you‚Äôre efficiently compiling is disappointment.
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> haha thats a nice ryo roast
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc ngl
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its so personal
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > ‚ÄúTeeAI project that you‚Äôll probably never finish‚Äù is the most honest thing on your profile
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> facts
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Emir Marincic, your GitHub profile is like a ghost town‚Äî40 followers? Even my granddad has more friends than that. With 43 public repositories, you'd think you'd have at least one decent project, but no, it's a graveyard of zero-stargazed nightmares. You‚Äôve managed to fork more projects than you've created, and the only thing more barren than your bio is the interest in your repos. Let‚Äôs be real: you‚Äôre just one ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù project 
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> Learath2
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich is same
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess it needs stuff to work with xd
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Heinrich5991, huh? A real ghost on GitHub with a bio and name more missing than a decent joke at a hacker convention. With 48 repos, it seems you're more into quantity than quality, and judging by those stargazer counts, your work is less "wow" and more "who?" If your coding skills were a Teeworld, they would definitely be in the land of the forgotten. The only thing more useless than your ‚Äúuselessness‚Äù repo is the amount of effort you put in
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Oh, Dennis Felsing, or should we call you "Deficient"? With a bio that's as empty as your social life, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre trying to hide from the world‚Äîor maybe you just can't think of anything interesting to say. 334 followers? Sounds impressive until you realize you‚Äôre following just 1 poor soul, clearly not too invested in their own growth.
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Your repositories range from "Nim unsorted" code (which must be the code equivalent of your love life) to a ‚ÄúGIF that always shows the current time in UTC‚Äù ‚Äì because clearly, watching the clock tick down is the only excitement you can muster.
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 145 public repos, and most of them don‚Äôt seem to sparkle‚Äîare you secretly trying to flood GitHub with mediocrity? Has it ever occurred to you that quantity doesn‚Äôt substitute for quality? You‚Äôve got a few decent projects, like that NES emulator, but they‚Äôre shadowed by the rest of your uninspired digital clutter.
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> > And what's with the personal pull requests on a clone of ddnet? Even your open-source work comes with a side of vulnerability. Maybe it‚Äôs time to step back and give the repositories a good, hard look. You‚Äôve got potential, Dennis, but you‚Äôre not living up to it. Let‚Äôs hope your coding is more exciting than your GitHub account suggests!
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xDDD
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Your most impressive accomplishment is a maze generator, which is fitting because navigating your repos might just be the hardest puzzle anyone has to solve. And what‚Äôs with the C++ obsession? Does it make your code feel more ‚Äòmature‚Äô when it only garners love from the crickets chirping on your projects? Perhaps next time, try making something that doesn‚Äôt feel like it crawled out of a 2003 flash game.
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > You‚Äôve got two stargazers on a maze project ‚Äì congratulations, you've almost convinced two people you aren't just talking to yourself! Being a part of the ‚ÄúDDNet‚Äù family, are you trying to create the ultimate gaming experience or just a collection of lonely forks?
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In summary, Robert, you‚Äôre a master in the fine art of 'almost'. Keep at it, and who knows? You might actually get one of those repos to be worth mentioning in the GitHub hall of shame fame!

11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
11:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway it was just for fun dont worry
11:16 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ye
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @headshotnoby too late
11:16 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :feelsbadman:
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I didn't see the fun, the roasts weren't even good
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> most of it was just repetition of the same stuff
11:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> boring
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> fun is subjective
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Delete that embarrassment
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway discussing this is pointless u didnt like it, thats fine, moving on
11:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Frustrating but the truth
11:18 < bridge> <learath2> Do any of you do agile at work?
11:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> luckily not
11:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
11:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> we just do github issues
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> but our company splits teams in like 2-15 devs
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> the project i am we are like 5
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> here's the opposite btw: https://praise-me.fly.dev/
11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but please post the long-form stuff to #off-topic
11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (haven't tried it, but saw it on HN)
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u feel agile is useful were u work
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> @reitw https://sh4dy.com/2024/08/03/beetracer/
11:21 < bridge> <learath2> The estimation part, not so much. The kanban is pretty nice
11:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> currently doing estimation
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> neat thing is if all ur devs in ur team are performers its nice to work in
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i would bet in a agile thing not all are
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> my company claims to fire 40% of ppl who enter during the first year to avoid having bad hires, even if it costs money
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> The idea of story points is a nice abstraction but it ends up making things worse. I overestimate, person X underestimates, I get a ticket with lower story points but it takes me as long as I estimated initially. Now I'm the slow developer that took 5 days for 3 story points
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> (rly often its more costly to fire than to maintain someone, specially in europe i think)
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its "ok" to track time a bit, but its rly not ok to track developer perfomance
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> If I ever lead a team, I'd have a kanban and I'd estimate with actual human hours
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u want to lead?¬ø
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if i want, i want to code
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> Why not both?
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the upwards stair in career in software dev is to manage
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> u almost always cant code cuz u wont have time
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> Well if it's my company I can set it up in a way where I can have time
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its ur company u will have even less time
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> I'd definitely hire some business people to do the business things though
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> as the ceo xd
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u do anything useful that is
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> the ceo of where i work is always flying and talking to clients, and he loves to code too
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess, but itsh ard to trust others, and others may not be as competent as you for that
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> specially when lot of money on the line
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> I have written some godawful code today, but doing it any cleaner requires me to rework this dudes entire structure and there aren't enough story points in here for that :pepeW:
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> I'm no good at business and client relationships and stuff. Pretty much anyone is better at that than me
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> when we consider a refactor we dont think about story points, only if its worth it or not
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Eh whatever, above my paygrade. I'm the intern ctodude can decide how he wants his codebase to look like
11:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 just curious, if i may ask, do you do any sports as a hobby?
11:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, climbing and dancing
11:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wow
11:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats cool, do you do like bouldering?
11:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or free climbing
11:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also do bouldering from time to time, but I prefer belayed climbing
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, apparently the english word for that is free climbing
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> TIL
11:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
11:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Cool tho
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> I always wanted to do climbing, but I went to a climbing gym, stared at it from the outside, then decided I'm not socially well adjusted enough to be part of a climbing gym üôÉ
11:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And dancing? more like solo/hip hop/whatever? Or partner dances like latino american
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> more partner dances
11:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye I enjoy that more too, but I havent really danced in years
11:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut where do you roughly live in germany, wanna go climbing together at some point?
11:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol, that was unexpected
11:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'll tell you in dm
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> climbing sounds fun, also a nice way to get strong for real
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> you do develop some muscles that are hard to develop in a normal gym, cuz they are involuntary iirc
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe im saying bs
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i cant dance, i dont have the feeling xd
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it develops. when I began, I couldn't hear the beat of the music

16:28 < bridge> <stormaxd> deam
16:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> too bad a lot of CHN player still can't access the list
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> huh, I thought we had a master2.ddnet.org in china, but apparently not
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> I thought you set one up quite recently, no?
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> Let's implement a QQ or WeChat based serverbrowser
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> its summer
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> so many rus servers full
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> where the eu guys
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna play again
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> EU player numbers have been meh, but RUS and CHN always popping off
16:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> GER has 500 players
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye sadge
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> why no eu ppl join?
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> We need a new marketing campaign
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> do russia and china have influencers
16:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can play normally on RUS servers
16:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if it's also okay from spain
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> There was a RUS tiktok dude that made it pop off
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> CHN idk
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 100 ping to rus2
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> 87 to rus1
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> should be playable
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (if you have antiping)
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 53 to ger
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ger10
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I failed 2 days in the back yesterday
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on RUS servers
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> üòÑ
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> is that a new map?
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent played much lately
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> well maybe its not prime time for eu now
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> rus is 1h ahead
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> It's just a gimmick map back in the days 2 but unhookable and hookable swapped
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> really easy, but the gores part suddenly becomes hard
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> LOL I forgot about that long gores in there
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> So you have to do a long mazy hh part
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's where we died, too
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> >25 players team ^^
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u be a good player nowadays without dummy magic?
16:46 < bridge> <louis> yes
16:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, why not?
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk now but back then the trend in team 0 hadf lot of players doing shit with dummies
16:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> #
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> we doomed anyway cuz dummies are no different than a player and old clients will always exist
16:52 < bridge> <louis> its super easy to detect dummy hammerfly though
16:53 < bridge> <louis> tbf thats not the problem, its the dummy copy
16:53 < bridge> <louis> not even sure why that had to be added xd
16:54 < bridge> <louis> and the deepfly when one dummy isn't frozen*
17:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can influence teeworlds players
17:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> am i a influencer
17:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fredflunencer
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> acme > certbot
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Shell > pyson
17:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> acme is the protocol name
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okok
17:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> acme.sh\*
17:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny
17:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i like this author's pfp.
17:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> seems like a wholesome cool dude
17:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> acme-tiny is a couple of hundred lines long
17:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can actually understand it üôÇ
17:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Below 200 lines is nice
17:58 < bridge> <0xdeen> @heinrich5991 and anyone else wanting to review, I still want to get 128 player support in and enable soon: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8542
17:59 < bridge> <learath2> I also use acme.sh for my server
18:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't like our new intern
18:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he always just send me a screenshot with no actual question and i have to guess what he wants to ask
18:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and he sent me this last week
18:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1270049277728788490/b10921e63678e70c6c80b1b201797e7f.png?ex=66b24910&is=66b0f790&hm=cc2c829237d48f1388c578e95df25c131cd1985635880aee8e0aa40bb0bff671&
18:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> just read what's in his noodle
18:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ez
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why does `this.currentFurnitureModel` not exist when I declared it at the top?
18:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: he forgot `this.` and typescript language server told him that already
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fuck, I didn't read
18:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe I expected too much from him if heinrich out of all people misread
18:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> `Did you mean the instance member...` dam ts language server smort
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I would have read the error properly if it was my own. I hope so
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust can also do that :p
18:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if only these guys actually read english
18:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I actually see this a lot since we move between C# and TS so much
18:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> I feel like an old man seeing dev language servers and fancy IDEs. I stopped using anything in vim except syntax highlighting because it was too much of a hassle to keep it working üòÑ
18:12 < bridge> <0xdeen> (even that is sometimes annoying in large files so disable it then)
18:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :GIGACHAD:
18:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i honestly wouldn't call vscode fancy IDE after being jetbrainwashed
18:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: i'm still waiting on rider 2024.2 for the full gdscript support so i can finally stop switching editors in godot.
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think u should tell ur intern to try to find what happens for 10 mins and then ask you
18:18 < bridge> <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> Where is ban DB located physically for local servers?
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz this looks rly newby thing
18:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think they do do that
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> increase the time
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and tell them to do it for real lol xd
18:19 < bridge> <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> Where is ban DB located physically for local servers?
18:19 < bridge> <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> I doesn't found anything in ddnet-server.sqlite related to bans
18:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoDrink:
18:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly it's better they ask me than trying to figure a mind-block out
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> they wont learn and wont be better
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> try to not give the answer straight out
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell them a hint
18:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the guy said he don't know typescript and explictly said he does not want to learn
18:20 < bridge> <hazain_kabana> –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∏—Ç–µ
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> then why tf u hired someone who says this
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> fire him
18:20 < bridge> <hazain_kabana> —É –º–µ–Ω—è —á—Ç–æ —Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ç–∞–∫ —Å —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç—É—Ä–∞–º–∏
18:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but we are short staffed so he has to write typescript alongwith C#
18:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz we hired C# devs
18:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also he cheap
18:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's the main reason
18:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> our HR usually hire the cheapest option
18:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
18:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also i'm leaving
18:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I told them not to hire any of the guys i've interviewed. but they just randomly picked one instead of looking for more
18:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so i don't care
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IDEs can be helpful in navigating code
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try rustrover for rust, e.g.
18:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, IDEs for C#/java are really good
18:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mostly code my rust in vim, but for navigating large rust codebases, rustrover is quite nice
18:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> C# on vscode is really bad three years ago iirc
18:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> C# on vscode was really bad three years ago iirc
18:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i had to google rustrover then i feel like i should've guessed
18:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> why are jetbrains java and rust IDEs free
18:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust only for noncommercial use
18:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh
18:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still rider is not free for noncommercial either
18:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
18:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is kinda funny that rider is not a C# IDE anymore
18:27 < bridge> <murpi> DataGrip is also not free :(
18:28 < bridge> <animepdf> Cool being student with all products for free :greenthing:
18:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like they had webstrom for typescript. then rider added typescript too, then C++ for unreal, then gdscript for godot.
18:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> imagine being a student forever
18:29 < bridge> <animepdf> You could flex with like 5 phds then
18:42 < bridge> <aegisub> fzf.vim üôÇ
18:43 < bridge> <aegisub> + nvim-lspfuzzy
18:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't look rust-specific. what I need is to find out where `datastructure.len()` is defined. string search doesn't really help me with that
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I usually use `rg` for string search, but that's where it falls short. identifiers that aren't unique
18:46 < bridge> <aegisub> in that case you just want regular lsp integration
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup
21:04 < bridge> <stormaxd> may i ask what's this types and why do they even exist?
