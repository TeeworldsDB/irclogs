01:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> all the issues in github look like lot of work or to lazy :/
01:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> btw if u gonna delete emojis u can close this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/986 , altho sad for that feature removal :(
04:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> eeeee: ping from ger to ger2 is 4ms, from both directions
09:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @deen https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/index.php#L136 & https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/feed/index.atom#L9 - is there any reason why only homepage links to posts and feed URLs are prepended with `{{ site.url }}` & `{{ site.baseurl }}`?
09:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> or maybe anyone else knows
09:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i think its not necessary, with a / at start of the link it already works i think
10:54 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vNM8G
10:54 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4377c5d def: comma
11:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @Ryozuki Yes it works, indeed. That's why I'm wondering if maybe there's anything more behind of it
11:41 <@deen> eeeee: 4 ms. not so great considering I have 7 ms from home to ger
12:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> deen, why are ger saves not cross compatible with ger2?
12:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ddos on ger1 and now we cant load on ger2 :(
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Matodor> client send 'NETMSG_ENTERGAME' when received 2 snapshots, but server not send snapshots before receive 'NETMSG_ENTERGAME' message :thonkery: :thonkery: :thonkery:
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki because they're different servers
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I believe you can save for a different server, but that's probably not compatible with servers having 4 letters as the name
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Syltoox> ./save GER2 savecode
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> this map crashes my client
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/406818687115591690/Restless.map
15:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro what do you do with the map to let the client crash?
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> aio?
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> i join a server running the map
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> when i pull a new ddnet version cmake always rebuilds everything, is there a way around that?
15:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> bam didnt do that
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> mm
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i think it does that when cmake changed
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> is it that the cmake config still changes frequently
15:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> on 10.8.6 there is no crash with the map i sent
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro when some config parameter changes, it will rebuild everything
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I think we recently enabled `--ffloat-store` for all systems, and then disabled `-ffloat-store` everywhere but on x86
15:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro if you compile that stuff, could you give us a stacktrace?
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> sure
15:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> sadly i cant reproduce the crash anymore
15:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> when i get it again ill send the traceback
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> which OS are you on? 32 or 64 bit?
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> 64 linux debian
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> client crashed while saving a map
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> lul
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> now i cant open that map
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> wow
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> this is rly buggy
16:20 < pinkieval> Hi
16:21 <+pinkieval> I'm merging the 64-players code from ddnet, and it uses an attribute named "m_ShowOthers" of the CPlayer class
16:21 <+pinkieval> what is that attribute for?
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ddnet specific
16:22 <+pinkieval> so I can safely replace it with "true"?
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yes
16:22 <+pinkieval> thanks
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> in ddnet you can join "teams" which don't affect each other â€“ with `show_others` you can either view them or not
16:23 <+pinkieval> okay
16:26 <+pinkieval> and I can replace calls to "TeamsCore::CanCollide()" with "false", right?
16:26 <@heinrich5991> with `true`
16:26 <+pinkieval> oh right, indee
16:26 <+pinkieval> d
16:35 <@Nimda> Sky Stone by Tropo just released on Moderate at 2018-01-27 16:30
16:44 <+pinkieval> hmm
16:44 <+pinkieval> how do I test it with more than 16 players?
16:45 <@heinrich5991> dbg_dummies 1 or so
16:47 <+pinkieval> woah great
16:52 <+pinkieval> [5a6ca03a][assert]: src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp(448): errornous client id
16:52 <+pinkieval> Segmentation fault
16:52 <+pinkieval> oopsie
20:53 <+eeeee> deen: but with 4ms you can proxy ger through ger2 for users like Syltoox for 25+4 ms ping instead of 80ms he's getting to ger
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> sure, but our servers get ddosed all day anyway, so that just doubles your risk
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @snail btw, the helper rank is ready imo, there is a new vote_no command that only allows forcing vote no, the helper auth rank is already there, so you only have to give it the permissiosn to use this command and i guess also the mute, and then u can recruit helpers
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> huh
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> travis mac builds are fast right now
22:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] closed pull request #947: Add support for extra chunks in teehistorian (master...pr_ddnet_teehistorian_ex) https://git.io/vF90p
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what was the other bug affecting logout?
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> oh forgot that
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> if you logout CPlayer::m_Authed isn't updated
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> which means even if you logout you can't be voted out
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> if you logout `CPlayer::m_Authed` isn't updated
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `access_level logout 2`
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> wat? ðŸ˜„
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> isnâ€™t that intended?
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> oh, 2 means "everyone"
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @jao no
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 `m_Authed` seems to be updated
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> line 2588
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> that's `CServer::CClient::m_Authed
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> that's `CServer::CClient::m_Authed`
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ah
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> needs something like `CGameContext::OnAuthChange` instead of `OnSetAuthed`
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> why not `OnSetAuthed`?
22:32 <+Learath2> I guess you can keep the old name if you won't change the interface
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I guess we can remove bam now (?)
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> yes
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> at least I don't use bam anymore for anything
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> :O
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> will be today the bam funeral?
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> dunno, I want @Learath2 to remove it, he's been looking forward to it for quite some time ^^
23:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1006:  Remove `CPlayer::m_Authed`  (master...pr_ddnet_rm_game_auth) https://git.io/vNDep
