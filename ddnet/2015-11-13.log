09:59 < Java> Hey, everyone^^
09:59 <@EastByte> hello
10:29 < Shiki> hi, could someone take a look at #366?
10:29 < Shiki> it's a rather simple patch that solves quite a messy bug that got reported on forum
10:29 < Shiki> I'm ready to discuss the details here
10:50 <@heinrich5991> Shiki: what's the statboard? :)
11:02 < Shiki> heinrich5991: that's what you see when you press '~' in game with less than 16 players
11:03 < Shiki> like the scoreboard, but with stats related to killing-based mods
11:03 <@heinrich5991> ah ok
11:04 < Shiki> there are some details: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/209
11:05 < Shiki> in short -- the complaint on forum was about the statboard not resetting stats after a game restart
11:06 < Shiki> on *ctf mods new games are usually started by restart
14:43 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame closed pull request #368: added sv_deepfly (default 1) to disable deepfly (master...pr_disable_deepfly) http://git.io/v8h6H
15:59 <+o_be_two> hello
16:04 < Java> Hey
16:40 <@EastByte> hellow
17:50 < minus> so someone asked me to ban that illuminati server (31.186.250.190) 'cause they DDoS other servers. I don't have quite enough information to do so though; so if you have info, let me know. My primary source of information was the relevant thread on the teeworlds forums
18:00 <@EastByte> minus: it's pretty unclear who is behind the attacks but banning that server will probably drive the culprits mad
18:01 <@EastByte> which is bad for teeworlds
18:01 < minus> i don't see how it would
18:01 < minus> unless the operators are the culprits
18:02 <@EastByte> well it's obvious that the attacks are "somehow" related to that server
18:03 < minus> are they? or is it just protected well enough
18:03 <@EastByte> they are at the same host as ger.ddnet.tw
18:03 < minus> but given that vali is involved with that server (?) it's not far fetched
18:04 <@deen> Personally I'm pretty convinced that they are the main ddosers, but don't have enough proof to go to the police
18:04 <@deen> partially have their real names, addresses etc, so if someone can deliver proof, that would help
18:06 <@deen> at least whenever I acted against their interests ddnet was ddosed
18:17 < Java> They are responsible for this.
18:18 < Java> We've done the same before.
18:18 < Java> And the attacks stopped, afterwards.
18:18 < Java> It was around September 2014.
18:18 <@EastByte> Java: so it's not coincidence that you are back
18:19 < Java> No.
18:19 < Java> I'm always here when vali and teemo start wreaking havoc, again.
18:20 <@EastByte> well, actually it's just the thread pushing things
18:20 < Java> Yeah, but I did my research independently from the Thread.
18:21 < Java> I also have some new information on vali and teemo, some of which I shared with deen already.
18:24 <@EastByte> oh ddnet.tw on ddos?
18:24 < Java> what?
18:25 <@EastByte> I had 50% packet loss, seems better now
18:27 <@deen> EastByte: that's clearly all the people who see http://imgur.com/a/i5k23 and go to hookrace.net :P
18:27 <@EastByte> heh
18:28 <@EastByte> atleast the images are not embedded
18:28 <@EastByte> (directly)
20:09 <@deen> yeah, better to upload that stuff on imgur
22:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] user578 opened pull request #369: Fix wrong calculation of weapon Angle in demo player (master...master) http://git.io/v4IYA
22:55 <@deen> ok, was a good idea to upload on imgur, this photo alone caused 307 GB of traffic in 6 hours: http://imgur.com/VvACSn1
23:22 <@heinrich5991> cloudflare would have worked as well I guess
23:22 <@heinrich5991> if you have that
23:22 <@heinrich5991> deen: your journey looks absolutely amazing. how did you find out where you wanted to stay?
23:24 <@deen> heinrich5991: what do you mean?
23:24 <@deen> the countries to fly to? the hostels?
23:24 <@deen> or which city/nature park to visit?
23:24 <@heinrich5991> I wanted to know 1)
23:24 <@heinrich5991> (what countries/cities to go to)
23:25 <@deen> ryanair has a surpringly nice tool
23:25 <@deen> and I knew I wanted to visit countries I've never been to
23:25 <@deen> https://www.ryanair.com/de/guenstige-fluege/
23:25 <@deen> I just checked a nice place I could fly to cheaply, then the next place to fly to from there and so on
23:25 <@deen> when I got stuck somewhere, I backtracked
23:25 <@deen> took a few hours and I had the route
23:28 <@deen> meh, ddnet.tw restarted
23:28 <@heinrich5991> was it so ad-hoc? :o
23:28 <@deen> huh?
23:28 <@heinrich5991> that you just decided where to travel to?
23:29 <@heinrich5991> i.e. from one place to the next
23:29 <@deen> yes
23:29 <@deen> had no list or anything beforehand
23:29 <@deen> just the cheapest flights to interesting-sounding places
23:30 <@heinrich5991> cool
23:30 <@heinrich5991> the other questions sounded interesting too. which city/nature park/places to visit (in the cities)?
23:31 <@deen> I planned that very immediately before
23:31 <@deen> mostly in the plane I looked up what there is to know about the country, city, language
23:32 <@deen> thanks to a downloaded version of wikivoyage
23:32 <@deen> i feel like i read the entire wiki
23:33 <@heinrich5991> haha nice
23:33 <@deen> or in Copenhagen I was bored, sat down in a church and looked for new places to go and found the cycling highway. 30 minutes later I was on it
23:33 <@deen> The couch surfing hosts were very helpful with telling me where to find nice nature
23:33 <@heinrich5991> with a rented bike I suppose?
23:33 <@deen> yeah, the rented bike for a day is more expensive than public transportation for a day, but also more fun
23:34 <@deen> I even made a video of the crazy cycling in Copenhagen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSX7vpWtoyo
23:35 <@heinrich5991> that's how I'd like my city to look like :)
23:36 <@deen> and afterwards I was in Lithuania, where they try to emulate that with huge cycling ways in the city center. didn't see a single cyclist on them though, haha
23:45 <@deen> but about cheap RyanAir flights: They're often to small airports which have expensive transportation to the city, so you end up paying more for the bus than the flight
23:46 <@heinrich5991> oh lol
23:46 <@heinrich5991> that sounds so wrong
23:47 <@deen> it is. i don't think ryanair makes money with the flight costs, they try to make you take luggage for 100 € a piece and buy shit on the plane (5 € for a bottle of water iirc)
23:48 <@deen> and on every single flight someone ends up getting drunk on the plane, so I guess it works
