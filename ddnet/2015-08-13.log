00:32 < Savander> Thanks for help ! :)
12:15 <@deen> Looks like compilation in VS is broken again: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/3f4ed266fb8c42ed6b78b3d62de37f60cdc7363c#commitcomment-12685345
12:25 < Tobii> removing the inlines in json.c fixes compilation
12:26 < Tobii> maybe other compilers optimize them
12:26 <@deen> that will hurt performance, but shouldn't matter anyway with what we're doing^^
12:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3wpl
12:27 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 23b6b02 def: Remove inlines in json.c to fix VS compilation
12:27 < Tobii> but mingw compiles fine for me even without Savanders fix
14:28 <@EastByte> anti spoof testserver online
14:29 <@EastByte> !twp
14:29 < Nimda> Usage: !twp <player>
14:29 <@EastByte> !twp east
14:29 < Nimda> east is currently playing dm1 on server : Antispoof test.
14:59 <@deen> !twp deen
14:59 < Nimda> deen is currently playing Kobra 4 on server : DDNet GER - Novice [DDraceNetwork].
14:59 <@deen> nearly full server
14:59 <@deen> have a 15 player group here^^
14:59 < Savander> nice ^>^
15:10 <@EastByte> hi o_be_one 
15:16 <@deen> i noticed that the ddnet servers had a few open ports that maybe don't need to be open
15:16 <@deen> should all be closed now
15:19 <@EastByte> opened by program or not filtered by firewall?
15:19 <@deen> opened by program
15:19 <@deen> and not filtered by firewall
15:20 <@deen> smtp and mysql open
15:20 <@EastByte> ah
15:20 <@EastByte> isn't mysql localhost by default?
15:20 <@deen> well, but i need mysql replication
15:20 <@EastByte> oh
15:26 <@deen> now mysql is only open to the exact servers that need it, rest filtered
15:26 <@deen> and smtp, i just closed the program
15:27 < Sadale> I've read some files in ddnet-scripts. It's interesting. You guys allow replication by hardcoding the IPs.
15:28 <@deen> yeah
15:28 <@deen> it's not ideal
15:39 < o_be_one> hellow :)
15:40 < Chairn> hi
15:50 < Savander> hi
15:58 <@deen> hi
15:59 < o_be_one> hi
16:27 < Nimda> Hyper 2 by Knight :3 just released on Moderate at 2015-08-13 16:22
17:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #283: Improvements for demoplayer (pause/unpause demo is bindable) + you can hide scoreboard after death (master...DDRace64) http://git.io/v3ECI
17:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- force-pushed master from 895f3de to 37256d6: http://git.io/v3KT0
17:53 <@deen> Anyone have comments about this? https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/270
17:56 <@deen> i thought i could fix it myself quickly, but not sure how best to get a bunch of headers in a nice way
17:57 < o_be_one> not sure to understand this
17:57 < o_be_one> thats why i cant participate, seem to be more a dev talk than a public talk
18:01 < Learath2> deen: i still dont get why we dont include them in the repository
18:16 <@deen> Learath2: they are HUGE
18:16 <@deen> Learath2: and when I update them the repo grows even more
18:17 <@deen> and by huge I mean 100 MB vs 10 MB for everything else combined
18:18 <@deen> and of course you download all these binary libraries you mostly don't even need
18:18 <@deen> at most you need them for 1 platform, not all 10 or so
18:22 <@deen> the source code should be in a separate repo from binary data like that
18:22 <@deen> or even dependencies like the headers
18:22 <@deen> ideally you have them installed on your system anyway if you compile it
20:21 < Savander> http://uptee.net/documentation/index.html
20:26 < Chairn> is there an uml diagram?
20:28 < Savander> nope
20:28 < o_be_one> what is UpTee ?
20:28 < o_be_one> is it opensource and free to use & host ?
20:29 <@deen> i think it costs money to run a server with uptee
20:29 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11490
20:29 <@deen> hm, and they call one of their servers DDNet EUR, that's a bit weird^^
20:30 < Savander> i dont see :D
20:30 < Savander> [DDNet Maps] upTee.net DDRace [0/64]
20:30 <@deen> DDNet EUR - DALEK BLOCKER Server [upTee.net]
20:31 < Savander> uptee doesn't host servers for others?
20:31 < Savander> it not seems like his official server
20:32 <@deen> dunno, i just searched for uptee in server browser
20:32 < solala> http://uptee.net/forum/ddrace/7-server
20:36 <@deen> Persian server getting DDoSed
20:36 <@deen> I don't think we'll ever have a stable server there =/
20:37 < o_be_one> in persian ?
20:37 < Chairn> great new this documentation, because teeworlds(& ddnet) code lacks of commentary...
20:38 < o_be_one> if there is "DDNet" in title it gos to the DDNet tab in client ?
20:38 <@deen> o_be_one: nope
20:38 <@deen> o_be_one: DDNet tab is a list of the official DDNet servers
20:38 < Chairn> oh i found the uml
20:38 < o_be_one> ok
20:39 <@deen> ping rus.ddnet.tw: Time to live exceeded
20:40 < Chairn> oh man, so many relations http://uptee.net/documentation/dd/daf/classCLayer__coll__graph.png
23:16 < Chairn> Can someone try my fps limiter?
23:16 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/693ed237e6a6f46dca6b9db16cc3bc1f9e04c9b4
23:16 < Chairn> it feels weird in game
23:16 < Chairn> kinda shaky
23:17 < Savander> i did thge same
23:17 < Savander> ^^.
23:17 < Savander> (almost)
23:19 < Chairn> and its not really precise
23:19 < Chairn> ask 250, got 235 ^^
23:19 < Savander> i set limiter to 250
23:19 < Savander> and i got 250
23:19 < Savander> lo
23:19 < Savander> l:D
23:21 < Chairn> win or linux?
23:21 < Savander> win
23:21 < Chairn> hum, so yours is better ^^
23:22 < Savander> x
23:22 < Savander> d
23:22 < Savander> xD
23:23 < Chairn> where did you implement it?
23:23 < Savander> in my repo, but probably this isn't there
23:23 < Savander> :/
23:26 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commit/e2e22fecd3380437b9a8a0bc6fd472d4a30d8eca
23:26 < Savander> Chairn, 
23:27 < Chairn> ty
23:30 < Savander> ok nvm
23:31 < Savander> it looks
23:31 < Savander> really different
23:31 < Savander> xd
23:34 < Chairn> fps limitation seems koinda random
23:34 < Chairn> wiht yours, 250 wanted, i got 250
23:34 < Chairn> but 100 wanted, i got 90
23:34 < Chairn> wiht mine
23:34 < Chairn> 100 wanted got 97
23:35 < Chairn> 250 wanted got 235
23:35 < Savander> bad compute
23:36 < Chairn> but it feels awful anyway
23:36 < Savander> i mean
23:37 < Savander> time between rendering of each frames
23:37 < Savander> is bad calculated
23:37 < Savander> in our code ^^>
23:37 < Chairn> can we do better?
23:38 < Chairn> i guess, we can move some part of the code, so that it takes only render time in account(and not all the loop)
23:40 < Savander> maybe we should calculate it
23:40 < Savander> in another place
23:40 < Savander> yup
23:45 < Savander> Chairn,  int64 means
23:45 < Savander> float?
23:45 < Savander> or/
23:45 < Savander> ?
23:46 < Chairn> int64
23:46 < Savander> i know 64 bits
23:46 < Savander> but maybe we should use float instead?
23:46 < Chairn> up 2^63-1
23:46 < Savander> or double
23:46 < Chairn> nah, time is always handled as integer
23:46 < Chairn> this is electronics reason
23:46 < Chairn> faster
23:46 < Savander> but 
23:46 < Savander> division
23:46 < Savander> Freq/g_Config.m_ClMaxFPS
23:47 < Chairn> ah
23:47 < Savander> isn't that accurate
23:47 < Chairn> indeed
23:47 < Chairn> i change it ^^
23:47 < Savander> ^
23:47 < Chairn> yours also is integer
23:47 < Chairn> but
23:47 < Chairn> thread_sleep expect int
23:47 < Chairn> not float
23:48 < Savander> my was a test
23:48 < Savander> only
23:48 < Savander> ^^>
23:48 < Savander> try change yours code to float maybe ^^?
23:49 < Chairn> yeah
23:50 < Chairn> doesnt change anything
23:50 < Savander> hm
23:51 < Savander> <=
23:51 < Savander> while(time_get()-Past < Freq/g_Config.m_ClMaxFPS) => while(time_get()-Past <= Freq/g_Config.m_ClMaxFPS)
23:55 < Chairn> no change
23:55 < Chairn> maybe i should move past at start
23:56 < Savander> last frame time
23:57 < Savander> variable at beginning of loop, second on end of loop -> subtract time
23:57 < Savander> maybe it'll be better computed?
23:59 < Chairn> tthis is even worse
23:59 < Chairn> i lost 30 fps
23:59 < Savander> at beginning?
23:59 < Chairn> by putting past at start
23:59 < Savander> i don't want to put past at start
23:59 < Chairn> so computed time was only render time
23:59 < Savander> ^^.
