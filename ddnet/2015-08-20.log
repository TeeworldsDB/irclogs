00:00 <@deen> and we would've been null-routed immediately if it went through
00:00 <@deen> instead the firewall server blocked them with your rules and got overloaded
00:00 <@EastByte> so, I killed the host by protecting the vps?
00:00 <@EastByte> I'm such a hacker
00:00 <@deen> dunno, just an idea :P
00:00 <@EastByte> hehe
00:00 <@deen> not sure if i should talk to nfoservers now
00:01 <@EastByte> hmmmm
00:01 <@deen> they didn't even tell me that we were nullrouted
00:01 <@deen> or for how long
00:01 <@deen> but hm, i actually think that might have been it
00:02 <@deen> I'll just ask them what's up
00:02 <@EastByte> be kind :p
00:10 <@deen> I feel like nfoservers' explanations are mean to linux users
00:10 <@deen> "If you are still running Linux, you can access your machine with any SSH client."
00:10 <@deen> still?
00:11 <@EastByte> lol
00:12 <@EastByte> already upgraded to Windows 10? No, still running linux
00:13 <@EastByte> any new information?
00:13 <@deen> I don't believe your server was targeted specifically actually, are you able to
00:13 <@deen> connect to your VDS through the VNC tab at all?
00:13 <@deen> ^ that's what they wrote
00:13 <@EastByte> interesting
00:13 <@deen> VNC connection doesn't work for me
00:13 <@deen> can you check?
00:14 <@deen> but the Server control does show "Your virtual machine is running."
00:14 <@EastByte> don't have flash
00:14 <@deen> me neither, i used a standalone vnc client
00:16 <@EastByte> hm can't get it working
00:18 <@deen> i believe Bill of nfoservers support is just confused and doesn't know the attack was against us :P
00:18 <@EastByte> ^ just was thinking the same
00:18 <@EastByte> well is that good or bad?
00:19 <@EastByte> apparently someone can overload there infrastructure
00:20 <@deen> it doesn't help that each time another guy responds to my mails...
00:20 <@EastByte> ^^
00:21 <@deen> ok, rebooted it, now VNC works
00:21 <@deen> but still ip is null-routed
00:21 <@EastByte> they didn't say why?
00:21 <@deen> why what?
00:21 <@EastByte> null-routed
00:21 <@deen> right now they just think I made a mistake with the server and that's why it's unreachable/down
00:21 <@EastByte> ah
00:22 <@EastByte> maybe the ip god null routed from an earlier instance
00:22 <@EastByte> got*
00:22 <@EastByte> like internap
00:25 <@deen> i don't think we were null-routed randomly
00:29 <@EastByte> would be nice to have an ipv6 for such cases
00:31 <@EastByte> oh nfoservers offers additional ips for 2eur each
00:35 <@deen> "It shouldn't be null-routed, as there was no notification of it, but I am checking into it to be sure."
00:35 <@EastByte> here we go
00:36 <@deen> "It was indeed nulled for a 4 hour period. The notification fell through the cracks due to another attack that happened at a different location."
00:36 <@EastByte> hm another attack
00:46 < Savander> good night
03:55 < Chairn> ger servers are back
03:55 < Chairn> but cant connect to them
04:17 <@deen> Chairn: thanks, should be fixed
04:17 <@deen> dunno what happened, recompiled server and restarted them and it works
04:18 < Chairn> recompiled :D?
04:18 < Chairn> what was weird was that i can hear the sound of chat when i joined ger server
04:18 < Chairn> but it was hanging on forever on Connecting to
04:19 < Chairn> okya, i can connect now
04:21 < o_be_one> Lol theres no player on all blockers, thats weird x)
04:43 < Chairn> ger under ddos again i guess
04:45 < Chairn> ger 2 i mena
09:44 < Zwelf> hi, I tried to compile DDNet under Linux. I can compile teeworlds 0.6+0.7, but when I try to compile DDNet I get the error message: 
09:44 < Zwelf> "/usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib32/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): undefined reference to symbol 'dlopen@@GLIBC_2.1'
09:44 < Zwelf> /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
09:44 < Zwelf> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
09:44 < Zwelf> bam: 'link DDNet_d' error 256
09:44 < Zwelf> bam: error: a build step failed"
09:44 < Zwelf> Does someone knows what to do now?
10:42 < EastByte> hm looks like some linking problem
10:44 < EastByte> maybe -ldl and/or -lpthread isn't linked for some reason
10:45 < EastByte> Zwelf: can you run "bam -v client_debug" and put the last line on pastebin.com ?
10:46 < EastByte> there should be a huge line starting with bam: ret=0 g++
11:06 < Zwelf> EastByte: https://gist.github.com/Zwelf/4a3559a86106cac5da73
11:07 < EastByte> hm -ldl is missing
11:14 < EastByte> Zwelf: what happens if you do: LDFLAGS="-ldl" bam client_debug ?
11:18 < Zwelf> EastByte: I had changed bam.lua, I undid it yet and update the gist.
11:20 < EastByte> kk
11:20 < EastByte> well I have no idea
11:20 < Zwelf> When I do LDFLAGS="-ldl" bam client_debug it works.
11:21 < EastByte> hm
11:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #294: Always request 64pl server info (master...req64update) http://git.io/vsn6A
12:30 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what does this commit do?
12:30 <@heinrich5991> always request only 64pl server info?
12:30 <@heinrich5991> always request both?
12:37 < EastByte> heinrich5991: both
12:38 <@heinrich5991> see my comment on the pull request, I think it's not feasible https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/294#issuecomment-132968538
12:38 < EastByte> "I think we should always send it next to the vanilla request"
12:38 <@heinrich5991> ah yea, missed that
12:38 < EastByte> but it would only double the outgoing traffic
12:38 < EastByte> which doesn't reach any bandwidth limit anyways
12:39 <@heinrich5991> it would double the time it takes to refresh
12:39 <@heinrich5991> it's fine to duplicate a lot of things, locally, but over the network it's not that easy
12:39 < EastByte> why would it double the time?
12:40 < EastByte> as long as the bandwidth isn't full
12:40 < EastByte> the requests will probably arrive at the same time
12:41 <@heinrich5991> if you can double the requests and still be within the bandwidth, then why don't you double the maximum number of requests the server browser does?
12:41 <@heinrich5991> then the refresh takes half the time
12:42 < EastByte> do you mean it's half speed due to br_max_requests?
12:42 <@heinrich5991> no, due to network bandwidth
12:43 < EastByte> it's about the ingoing traffic
12:43 <@heinrich5991> you say that it doesn't take all the bandwidth, but then, why don't we make br_max_requests higher so we can use the bandwidth available?
12:43 < EastByte> on most servers there will just be one response like before
12:45 <@heinrich5991> I guess it's the outward bandwidth that matters
12:45 <@heinrich5991> for the empty server, wireshark tells me 59 bytes on wire for the request, 118 byte on wire for the response
12:46 < EastByte> 786 vanilla requests in one second will cause 10mbit/s incoming traffic (if all servers where full)
12:46 <@heinrich5991> that means you usually get 2x as much as you send
12:46 < EastByte> hm
12:46 <@heinrich5991> but most residential lines I know only have 1/10 the speed on the uplink
12:47 <@heinrich5991> that means the limiting factor would be the requests
12:47 < EastByte> I have kbytes send/recv 18.29296875 148.396484375  on one full refresh
12:47 < EastByte> would be ~32 instead of 18 then
12:49 <@heinrich5991> I get roughly 8 as a factor from your data, which sounds similar to the 10 I mentioned
12:49 < EastByte> that's strange
12:49 <@heinrich5991> no, I mean from the data you posted
12:49 <@heinrich5991> 138.39/18.29
12:50 <@heinrich5991> *148.39/18.29
12:50 < EastByte> I'm just counting udp payload
12:51 < EastByte> (user data I mean)
12:51 <@heinrich5991> so if you double the requests, it's receiving 4 times as much as sending
12:51 < EastByte> why?
12:51 < EastByte> before it was: vanilla request , wait for response, 64 request
12:52 <@heinrich5991> because my assumed internet connection has 10x as much download speed as upload speed
12:52 < EastByte> now it is vanilla request & 64 request
12:52 <@heinrich5991> yes
12:52 < EastByte> yes, mine has aswell
12:53 <@heinrich5991> so if you only receive 4x as much as you're sending, then you should try reducing what you send
12:53 <@heinrich5991> because then you'll be faster
12:54 < EastByte> I guess you are right
13:03 < EastByte> man, I wish the vanilla request would have been extendable in the first place
13:03 <@heinrich5991> yea
13:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east closed pull request #294: Always request 64pl server info (master...req64update) http://git.io/vsn6A
13:07 < EastByte> I think instead of making a new type of request I would have used the token number as an indicator for 64pl request
13:07 < EastByte> like token number 0xff, no one would refresh 255 times
13:50 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: then we should perhaps tell oy to reserve a few tokens, as the new version completely randomizes them
14:03 < Savander> Steam told you something, when they want to release game?^^
14:10 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I doubt he will do that
14:16 < o_be_one> hellow
14:17 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: ah I found a different way, the header of connless packets usually is 6 x 0xff, but it's actually enough if the NETSENDFLAG_CONNLESS bit is set in the flags
14:17 <@EastByte> so I could slightly modify the header
14:17 <@EastByte> o_be_one: hi
14:18 < o_be_one> ok now players have understood to go back to r0x.fr
14:18 < o_be_one> i've added V3ROYAL2 too
14:19 < o_be_one> i'll take a better protecter server soon, i've just to find with who to talk to maybe get a lower price
14:19 < o_be_one> and no setup fees
14:19 <@EastByte> you got the connections :p
14:19 < o_be_one> and i've just to get my hand on game filters to enhance TW protection ^^
14:23 <@EastByte> game filters?
14:24 < o_be_one> yes OVH can now ddos protect UDP, so they make "game profile" to adapt on what you host
14:25 < o_be_one> they havent actually TW, but i can work on it cause i'm in this team too, i've just to get formation ^^
14:25 <@EastByte> would be awesome
14:26 <@EastByte> could you keep me/us informed about ovh and game filters? (pretty interesting topic I think)
14:29 < o_be_one> sure that's why i talk about this :p
14:29  * EastByte is afk
14:29 <@EastByte> okay :), will be back in half an hour
14:29 < o_be_one> have fun
14:58 <@EastByte> o_be_one: btw. for what customers are game filters available?
14:59 < o_be_one> all customers, available at OVH and SoYouStart
14:59 < o_be_one> only on game dedicated servers
14:59 < o_be_one> actually they filter all sources games (hl2, tf2, etc) and Minecraft and some other games
14:59 < Savander> http://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/game/
14:59 < Savander> this?
15:00 <@EastByte> okay, not for enterprise servers then
15:07 < o_be_one> yes, cause game servers are with different cisco etc systems
15:07 < o_be_one> its not the same network
15:07 < o_be_one> yes Savander 
15:08 <@EastByte> interesting
15:25 < ssfg> hi all
15:25 < ssfg> >http://ddnet.tw/
15:25 < ssfg> >Download DDraceNetwork Client & Server 8.1.1 for Windows (32bit)
15:26 < ssfg> Page not found
15:26 < ssfg> giving wrong link
15:26 < ssfg> fix it pls
15:26 < Learath2> seems fine for me 
15:26 < ssfg> http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-8.1.1-win33.zip
15:26 < ssfg> link for me
15:26 < ssfg> if downloading from page http://ddnet.tw/downloads/
15:26 < Learath2> oic
15:26 < ssfg> all ok
15:27 < Learath2> deen: 33 bit windows doesnt exist fixpls
15:27 < ssfg> oh lol
15:27 < ssfg> >33
15:30 < Savander> xD
15:32 < o_be_one> 33 bits with Win10, you cant understand.
15:33 < o_be_one> 33 bits is better that 32, cause you got 66 bits instead of 64.
15:33 < o_be_one> and 66 bits is 2 bits longer than 64, so you are much awesome with this ;)
15:35 <@deen> thanks, fixed
15:36 < Learath2> so when are we releasing win33 ?
15:39 < Savander> can't connect
15:39 < Savander> to ger server
15:39 < Savander> with 8319 port
15:40 < Savander> could you try ^^?
15:45 < Learath2> deen: did you rename the DDRace64 branch to master ?
15:49 <@deen> yes
15:49 <@deen> Savander: works for me
15:49 < Savander> hmm
15:50 < Savander> in console i had only this: http://www.savander.pl/img/NSGpj0Cv7840
15:50 <@deen> EastByte might now why

19:13 < Savander> heh
19:13 < Savander> ^>
20:12 < Chairn> found a bug
20:12 < Chairn> thx do new map dust's leaf
20:13 < Chairn> when you got super jump, if you go on tile 2 jumps, it has no effect
20:13 < Chairn> but when you go on tile 0 jump, you loose jump, but server does not tell you(your feet color stays like if you had dj)
20:14 < Chairn> and when you back on tile 2 jump
20:15 < Chairn> you got super :D
20:15 < Chairn> you got super back(because you never lost it)
20:52 < laxadedi> 32 - 13
20:52 < laxadedi> 21 - 6 
20:52 < laxadedi> 13 - 3 
20:52 < laxadedi> 6 - ??oops
20:53 < laxadedi> ok
20:53 < laxadedi> oops again x)
21:31 < Learath2> ?? = 2 laxadedi ?
21:31 < laxadedi> ??
21:32 < Learath2> looked like a riddle :P
21:36 < Learath2> laxadedi: you have to atleast tell me if my answer is correct or not  :D
21:38 < laxadedi> I dont have the answer yet of that riddle
21:38 < laxadedi> and indeed that is one
21:38 < Learath2> well my money is on 2 )
21:45 < laxadedi> dont say a word Learath2, I have two find myself, and there are 2 unknown number in the riddle :p
21:46 < laxadedi> if you wanna try it yourself : www.newbiecontest.org
21:46 < Learath2> never finished my french course
21:47 < laxadedi> I can translate if you want to do some chall on this site
21:52 < Learath2> normally i love stuff like this but have a horrible headache now :/
22:32 < Learath2> what do you think about a color picker for all the color stuff in settings ?
22:32 < Learath2> HSL certainly didnt make any sense to me first time i tried to color my tee
22:44 <@deen> oh, ddnet ger servers not showing on internet tab for 24 hours and no one even says a word
22:49 < Savander> not now showing?
22:49 < Learath2> thats good means everyone is using the ddnet tab
23:05 <@deen> Learath2: no, the servers were all empty :P
23:06 <@deen> Savander: i restarted them, then they showed
23:06 < Learath2> oh ooops :D
23:06 <@deen> only the non-ddnet-mod ones
23:06 < Learath2> well ill make a color picker as an exercise and you can merge it in if you like it
23:12 < o_be_one> oO thats curious
23:12 < o_be_one> im not getting a DDoS, but my game server is like in ddos Oo
23:13 < o_be_one> is it antispoof problem ?
23:13 < o_be_one> EastByte, ?
23:20 < o_be_one> deen, what happend with paddel :o ?
23:20 <@deen> what's a "paddel"?
23:22 < o_be_one> deen, SAI PITZA, a player who made blockscore
23:22 <@deen> don't know him and don't know what a block score is
23:22 <@deen> i never was on the block servers, don't know the players there
23:23 < o_be_one> oh ok
23:24 < o_be_one> deen, "sai0004" maybe ?
23:25 < o_be_one> ok he just says that he was on your skype and had deleted, just wanted to know what happened
23:26 <@deen> i deleted half of my skype contacts when my private internet line was ddosed all day
23:26 <@deen> then it stopped
23:26 < o_be_one> oh ok
23:28 < Learath2> you can still grab ips from skype ???
23:28 <@deen> Learath2: yes
23:29 < Learath2> so weird they let it happen
23:30 <@deen> apparently you can still grab mine easily, shit^^
23:30 <@deen> on sites like http://mostwantedhf.info/
23:31 <@deen> they even offer ddos right on the website
23:32 < Learath2> thats quality service right there
23:32 < Learath2> it cant seem to get my ip tho
23:32 < Learath2> oh nope it can :D
23:32 <@deen> i also found some instructions about how to disable skype from sharing your ip, but they don't work on the linux client of course
23:33 < o_be_one> deen, you dont run linux ?
23:34 <@deen> i do
23:34 < Learath2> deen: maybe we should give their anti ddos a try its only 27.95$ for lifetime
23:37 < o_be_one> but if i remember well in linux its fixed no oO ?
23:38 < o_be_one> Learath2, who ?
23:38 < laxadedi> omg
23:38 < laxadedi> wtf is that website
23:40 < laxadedi> Well I guess, you gotta VPN for skype deen :x
