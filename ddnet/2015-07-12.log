02:28 < eeeee> EastByte: do you remember why i didn't pullreq my skins patch (https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/commit/93cbce504ad8be8825504657c53361be2390d2c5 ) ? I think there was some problem but I've lost my irc logs :/
02:33 <@deen> eeeee: http://ddnet.tw/2015-06-28.log
02:34 <@deen> 12:42 < eeeee> i'll pullreq it tomorrow but you're welcome to test
02:35 <@deen> should i put the irc logs online btw?
02:37 <@deen> i don't think anyone has been writing something private in here, except maybe the stuff about preventing attacks
03:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vqpYI
03:09 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 77c1442 def: IPV6 fix by east
03:12 <@deen> I think uniteddomains is stuck in the last decade. To enter an AAAA record you have to email them and tell them what to change it to.
03:12 <@deen> but they're by far the cheapest dns for tw domain^^
03:17 <@deen> anyway, a single one of our servers has ipv6, the russian one
03:23 <@deen> oh, and the main one with the website, but it doesn't show in ifconfig
03:36 <@deen> with a glorious ping of 230 instead of 37
03:45 <@deen> I guess the http://ddnet.tw/funding/ site works. Got 4 donations and hopefully the Iran server in 4 days.
11:01 < eeeee> deen: thanks for the log
11:01 < eeeee> i tested the patch a bit more and added some comments to the code
11:02 < eeeee> it generally seems to work great even under extremely low cache size
11:03 < eeeee> however it crashes valgrind on mac somehow (with "valgrind internal error")
11:04 < eeeee> happens whenever it tries to release opengl texture -_- . guess i'll have to try it on windows just in case.
11:37 <@deen> that's strange

12:47 < KinG_> hi
12:52 <@heinrich5991> hi!
12:55 <@deen> hi KinG_ =)
12:55 < KinG_> hey
12:55 <@heinrich5991> what's up?
12:56 < KinG_> just trying to find a server for ddnet irn
12:58 <@deen> hm, so what do i do if I got a donation and don't know who to credit? =/
12:59 <@deen> I don't think I should just list the real name
13:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you get an email address?
13:02 <@deen> yes, just wrote an email to that address
13:10 <@deen> ahaha, tried pinging the new Persian server from all ddnet locations. packet loss from nearly everywhere, duplicated packets from Brazil. I've never seen duplicated packets in ping before
13:12 < KinG_> what u mean?:D
13:13 <@deen> nothing, just testing the worldwide internet connection^^
13:13 < KinG_> well it's good or not? ^_^
13:22 <@deen> it's a bit weird from Brazil, from Germany it's fine^^
13:30 < KinG_> dced ^^
13:34 < laxa> Hey guys
13:34 < laxa> Do you have a good idea to deal with long strong
13:34 < laxa> I need to work with a 10^9 length string
13:38 < KinG_> no ideas here ... :D
13:38 < laxa> x)
13:44 < Sadale> I wonder how does the map change vote of ddnet servers work.
13:44  * Sadale reading around ddnet-scripts in github. Very confused :S
13:44 <@deen> Sadale: haha, yes it's confusing
13:45 <@deen> lots of hacks to make it work
13:45 < Sadale> oh :(
13:45 <@deen> i'm a bit busy with setting up server now
13:45 < Sadale> Thought that there was a single script to do everything :p
13:46 < Sadale> deen, ah! good luck! :3
13:47 < Sadale> lol. Maybe I should make my own python script to generate the vote files :p
13:51 <@deen> I've never seen a server running KDE before^^
13:52 <@EastByte> so you do right now?
13:52 <@deen> yes, the new persian one
13:52 <@EastByte> oh^^
13:52 <@deen> I'm removing kde right now
13:52 <@deen> at least it gets 60 mbit/s to GER
13:53 <@EastByte> not bad
14:00 <@deen> oh, and my first server with debian8
14:06 < Sadale> deen, wow. you've access to persian's server? :o
14:06 <@deen> yes
14:06 <@deen> well, i had
14:06 <@deen> then i restarted it and now it's down^^
14:07 <@deen> i'm afraid some kde thing was setting up the network connection...
14:08 < Sadale> kde on server? :o
14:08 < Sadale> That's actually p stupid tbh
14:09 <@deen> yeah, first thing i did was removing it
14:09 <@deen> and then i restarted and bam, can't connect
14:09 < Sadale> uh oh :(
14:10 < Sadale> deen, time to contact the server owner =P
14:10 <@deen> I did, KinG_ is the owner =)
14:10 < Sadale> cool :o
14:10 <@deen> who are you btw, Sadale ?
14:10 < Sadale> KinG_, why most persian has password?
14:10 < Sadale> deen, Well, I'm new here :3
14:11 < KinG_> Sadale:  idk
14:11 < Sadale> deen, I played teeworlds like a few years ago. City mod was very popular then. My sister have been playing ddrace for a year or two and I've been watching her to play. =P
14:11 <@deen> Sadale: because traffic is expensive in iran i think
14:11 < Sadale> That's my lame introduction of myself =P
14:11 < Sadale> deen, ah.
14:12 < Sadale> I remember that I've seen a few persian server with a lot of players. But it has a password. I just wondered why. :S
14:21 <@EastByte> hmmm I just noticed using a password protected server allows faking player slots since you cannot know whether they are real or not
14:22 <@EastByte> so you could pretend huge clanwars and stuff
14:25 < KinG_> most of their passwords are p30
14:25 < KinG_> but new ones idk some kids run a server to finish maps with their friends
14:25 < KinG_> still no response from isp ^_^
14:59 < KinG_> and still no response for ticket ....
15:02 <@heinrich5991> KinG_: p30?
15:09 < KinG_> yeah
15:09 < KinG_> heinrich5991: yup
15:16 <@deen> heinrich5991: so you're going there to steal maps now? :P
15:16 <@heinrich5991> no
15:17 <@heinrich5991> I was just surprised that there is a common and well-known password
15:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: it's really to keep out non-iranians who would just create traffic and can't play with ping 200 anyway
15:18 <@deen> but i don't see any persian servers on the internet right now anyway
15:18 < Sadale> heinrich5991, same here. I thought that the password was a secret.
15:20 < Sadale> deen, In my area, most servers has 200+ ping :(
15:20 <@deen> Sadale: where are you from?
15:20 < Sadale> Hong Kong, China
15:20 <@deen> have you tried antiping in ddnet client?
15:20 <@deen> Ah cool, how about DDNet CHN?
15:20 < Sadale> The funny thing is that I get 200 ping even in CHN server
15:20 <@deen> damn =/
15:21 <@deen> I saw some russians getting ping 80 on CHN
15:21 < Sadale> Yep. It's pretty funny. 
15:21 <@deen> hm, so our chinese server is not that good =/
15:21 < Sadale> Maybe the server is in north china. Hong Kong is in way south of China
15:21 <@deen> we don't have many players in china
15:21 < Sadale> true
15:21 <@deen> server is in Qingdao
15:21 <@deen> but 200 is still way too much
15:21 < Sadale> I'm not an active teeworlds player. My sister is. My sister is used to high ping :p
15:22 < Sadale> She can perform ok-ish in high ping ddrace server :D
15:22 <@deen> i hope she's using antiping
15:22 <@deen> really helps a lot with high ping in ddrace
15:22 < Sadale> She don't use it all the time AFAIK
15:22 < Sadale> FYI: She also perform OK in shoot and kill mods like CTF and zcatch
15:23 < Sadale> She have installed antiping inside her brain =P
15:23 <@deen> haha
15:34 < Sadale> deen, there're some .cfg file for certain maps. Are they automatically loaded when the map is loaded?
15:35 <@deen> yes
16:49 < KinG_> Pass:123456
16:49 < KinG_> ^^
16:56 < Sadale> great. Map switching is working here(private server atm) :3
16:57 < KinG_> nice
17:08 <@deen> phew, got the persian server working again
17:08 <@deen> they gave me vnc access, damn kde^^
17:09 <@EastByte> the vnc access is not bound to kde right?
17:09 <@deen> nono
17:09 <@EastByte> k
17:09 <@deen> but i removed kde and then the network stopped working
17:10 <@deen> they had some graphical network manager running
17:10 <@EastByte> :D
17:10 <@deen> instead of setting up the network properly
17:10 <@deen> and they didn't manage to enter the root password even though it was right
17:10 <@EastByte> lol
17:10 <@deen> was maybe 2 min and i had it working...
17:10 <@deen> KinG_: all good and working =)
17:11 <@EastByte> okay makes sense now
17:29 <@deen> Up and running =)
17:29 <@deen> if you ever wanted to play in Iran, go ahead!
17:30 <@EastByte> let's do a round on the unnamed server

21:58 <@EastByte> the list is reloaded every 30 seconds
21:58 <@EastByte> and it can be that packet loss causes servers to be ignored
21:58 < KinG_> oh ^^
22:07 <@deen> Didn't know PersianPro has so many players, 100 at a time. i guess that's where all the persian players are, but it's only visible in Iranian intranet.
22:08 <@deen> KinG_: evil saeid also said you ddosed his server and that's why it's intranet only. anything to say about that?
22:17 < KinG_> deen: i never did that
22:18 <@deen> ok
23:13 < KinG_> !peak ddnetirn
23:13 < Nimda_6518> Current channel peak for #ddnet: 26 users online at 2014-10-07 22:44:23 (278 days, 29 minutes and 26 seconds ago)
23:14 < KinG_> hwo can i see how many players are on ddnet persian?!
23:14 <@deen> KinG_: http://ddnet.tw/status/
23:14 < KinG_> better ^^
23:15 < KinG_> and why ddnet.tw server is running on 100% cpu? it doesn't make laggs?!
23:15 < laxadedi> I can code something for that if you really want it
23:15 <@deen> ddnet.tw is just the website, it's always at 100% generating some crap. on http://ddnet.tw/stats/ you can see old values
23:15 < KinG_> it's not that important but it'll be fun 
23:15 <@deen> IRN stands for Iran
23:16 <@deen> and i can use niceness so that servers don't lag even when cpu is always 100%
23:16 <@deen> wait, stats is broken^^
23:16 <@deen> because i added persian server i think, shit^^
23:16 < KinG_> 28 years, 32 days and 6 hours spent on all ranks what does This mean? :O
23:16 <@deen> we finished with time of 30 minutes today on Kobra 2
23:16 <@deen> this is the sum of all rank times on ddnet
23:17 <@deen> but let me fix the site quickly =/
23:17 < KinG_> oh yeah
23:17 <@deen> never added a server since i have it^^
23:20 < KinG_> ddnet persian got some players
23:20 < KinG_> !help
23:20 <@deen> yes, but persian pro has maaaany more
23:21 < KinG_> noobs there they don't know what ddnet is and they like to play with cheats like /r
23:21 <@deen> ok, refresh http://ddnet.tw/stats/
23:21 < KinG_> !twp KinG
23:21 < Nimda_6518> KinG is currently playing Everest on server : DDNet Persian - DDmaX [teecity.ir] [DDraceNetwork].
23:21 <@deen> you can zoom in on the graphs by selecting an area
23:21 <@deen> and click on values at the bottom to disable them
23:21 < KinG_> great
23:21 <@deen> then you see the little brown spot with IRN^^
23:25 <@deen> i notice a bit is wrong with the stats, they are too low, got to fix that too =/
23:47 <@deen> oh shit, i'm stupid^^
23:50 <@deen> i was not comparing ints, i was comparing strings of ints
23:50 <@deen> so 9 was bigger than 11...
23:51 <@deen> that explains some of our low looking player numbers in the stats, oops
23:53 <@deen> now all fixed: http://ddnet.tw/stats/
