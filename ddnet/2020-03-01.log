00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @heinrich5991 thanks for posting it again as wanted to look at it and already forgot xd
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki usually because someone is running a DoS attack against you and Chinese botnets are cheaper. Additionally they could be hiding some interesting requests in all that spam which they don't want you to see, like checking for some vulnerabilities
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how does deen know the prices of botnets by country ðŸ‘€
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> We ddos kog and noby fng to maintain our playerbase:troll:
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :feelssurprisedman:
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby because western targets are more valuable and they can throttle traffic from china easily when attacked
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ooo
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does big.py even do @deen ?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can i test it?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon ok, ur bug was in ddnet7 right?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ok found it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes @Learath2
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/issues/66
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do I reproduce?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> get amber on ur server and give her rcon lmao
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could never reproduce it
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> she was using gamer 5.5
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh cmon, I can't debug sth that's not reproducible
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> auth to rcon
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tried hard to ask amber how she does it
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well authing isn't enough or I'd have noticed it already
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk could it be a specific client version thing?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk if these are proper tests...

14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> Well I tryed it too
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> It works too with ZillyWoods
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0kJFWOXZZg
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> After I pressed escape and then I logged me out and logged me in again, then was the server crashing
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't get it to happen at all
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show me a list of the maps available on your server?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> Okay give me a sec
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> https://i.imgur.com/MctInVz.png
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> https://i.imgur.com/zdoo8c1.png
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> https://i.imgur.com/Fa5Y1Tr.png
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> Thats just a couple of our maps. But I think its not the problem of the map.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> Amber can crash every map xd And I don't know how
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The crash is in the maplist update function, that's why I wanted a list of the maps
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you seem to have modified ddnet7...
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> line 907 does not correspond to your backtrace
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2  https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet7/tree/law
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2  Oh i just realized i got the crash already months ago while local development and working on /save maybe i even introduced the bug back then. https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet7/issues/1
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk i suck in gdb but that seems odd:
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (gdb) p m_aClients[ClientID].m_pMapListEntryToSend->m_pNext
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Cannot access memory at address 0x8
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `p m_aCleints[ClientID].m_pMapListEntryToSend` is null
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea that could make sense
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is not possible at that line
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The loop would have ended if that was the case
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> @snail i think need to open 2 more ger1 servers
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> and add 1 gb of ram
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> just download more ram
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TortiLeq how does ger2 work for you?
