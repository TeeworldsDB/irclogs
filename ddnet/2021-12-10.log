10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its due to brazil lol
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> wtf
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> just delete brazil
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PapotaV> delete usa
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PapotaV> they suck

11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```any ideas on how to not crash the client without a sound card? Running the headless ddnet client on my vps which has no sound card. It works on github workflows and other servers i own. But this one seems to make trouble. Does someone know a hack to fake a sound card or disable sound with a config or something? Or can we make the client more crashsave with bugged soundcards? \:D
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rip irc
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wait i concluded too early its a alsa crash never mind. Run with debugger and realized its something else.
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how the headless works but maybe dont sdl_init the sound system
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Init
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol they updated the wiki
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :pepeH: :pepeH: :pepeH:
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fixed. I was missing a data/ folder -.-
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> without it the headless client crashes in some textrender
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> seems like on all other systems i got some global data dir
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i would delete catalan
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> ^~^
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> OwO
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> so many donos

15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got a r580 which theorically gets this
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah r500 is not rx 580 rip
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got jebaited
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who cares about 20y old gpus
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amd should step up their gpu naming
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen did u get a m1?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> new job, new laptop
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no more super computer about databases?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ehm, still sql databases, but postgres based now
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you work for postgres?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, I'm starting at Yugabyte in January
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh looking at the web looks like ur typical fancy startup
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they always have these 2.5d images
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks interesting
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (to work there)
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen  do you mention ddnet in your job application?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my guess is: yes
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's on my resume. This time I didn't talk about it during the application process, but afterwards made sure they don't mind that I keep working on it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Why would they mind if you work on it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does your employer need to agree to that in germany?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or is it just courtesy on your part?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> You didn't like SAP anymore?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Usually in the contract it's stated that all my thinking time and effort is spent on the company. Side projects you have to get approval for
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf is "thinking time"
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I really liked my old team, just wanted to try something new after > 5 years
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ðŸ˜„
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like, is dreaming or sleeping part of "thinking time"?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> different definitions in different contracts
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting. didn't think the employer could force that stuff on you in your non-working hours
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> That sounds crazy. If you take it seriously then you would have a 16 hour day
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, they mostly want you to relax in your off-time
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that sounds dangerous from a legal point of view in my opinion
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Are contracts above this?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not in France
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if there's an illegal cause in a contract, it is voided by law
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/74105/is-it-legal-for-me-to-contribute-to-open-source-software-while-employed
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I have heard that large companies often own any development employees do outside of work.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if this is true but i would find this crazy
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and idk why any software dev would agree to that, more so when you are often in a position of more power than other professions due to lot of work opportunities
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i heard it's same with professional animators
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was browsing 4chan and I've finally found real cancer
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://tabby.sh/ what is this?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a damn electron terminal
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/thomaschaplin/rust-percentage-change-calculator
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's the point of a git for such a trivial thing?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some people just put everything on there
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the point of such a trivial program even, you can do it with any calculator or pen and paper or even in mind mostly
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also a docker container you can use
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a docker container for rust-percentage-change-calculator?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should start keeping a blacklist of developers that I'd never hire if I ever have a business of my own
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `docker run --rm thomaschaplin/rust-percentage-change-calculator <NUMBER> <NUMBER>`
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shirumono
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> w/c
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'd say that's how you probably started coding ðŸ˜„
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but nobody would put that on github
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The closest thing I ever made was a fahrenheit to celsius converter, and only because it was an exercise in K&R
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would never put it in a docker container because I'm not insane
