00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it was fstd with twN
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/fstd/teeworlds/tree/twN
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but i don't really remember if it worked well üòõ
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you won't get that many players without client support unless you do clipping
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe isddnet belongs in the serverinfo actually
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> these are really hard to get to the right place :/
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro would https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1732/commits/9c3dafac work for you?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this score-time feature really doesn't make much sense at all...
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I think you should decide what kind of mod to make tbh, players having separate scoreformats is just too useless for any other mod
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 it is also usefull for mods that use IsDDNet and want time score but dont have a Race gametype
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 looks good, thank you!
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> clever use of the password field üòÑ
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro lol, your code was so big, and these are so few lines xd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How does this |= and &= work?
09:46 <@deen> x = x | y; => x |= y
09:46 <@deen> ;
09:46 <@deen> same as += etc
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah lol
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 how do i set the ui_color correct now? i have the values of the old variables saved
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant get it with a converter
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> convert it to hex rgb and then set that
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> another pfp üòÇ
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you read jao
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can you read foko
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> give me a link
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for a converter
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> put your old values in a hsl to rgb converter
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> google
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what about alpha
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ui color is hsla
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hsla to rgba converter
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why rgba
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i thought i need hey
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hex*
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I thought you need an alpha channel
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ui color is hsla
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i convert it to the new Format
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ui_color
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before it was split into single variables
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> convert it to hex
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> http://www.standardista.com/hsla-color-picker/
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> first result on google
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if I implemented RGBA hex properly
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have a limited amount of flags for serverinfo, do we want isddnet or something like israce
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut well I don't really see a good way to implement time-score, the way you want, where you can send different values to different clients
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you need a player var for it, like m_AllowTimeScore, then decide if you want to send the flag or not based on that
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know how to hack it in
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how I can add it in as a proper feature
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like look at my current attempt, it's inconsistent, the score-format is set properly, but at some places you just don't know what to display in the hud
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or the title in the scoreboard
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if some players have their level as score and some have time e.g. we don't know what to display
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It all worked fine before, so just leave it like i did (i mean those checks for hud and scoreboard text)
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not leaving in a franken-feature
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a very specific feature that can only be used for your mod, it doesn't belong in ddnet
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it would make sense if the entire server had the same scoreformat at the same time
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you can do it so that i can edit it serverside its ok
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, if you do it ddnet-wise for all players, but give me space so i can edit it serverside to only send it to specific players
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shouldnt that work? if you leave my checks in
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for hud and board
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as long as the scores sent are the same format for every client, yeah that'd work
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> one current score-format, that is applicable for every client
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and you can hack around with it while snapping for a specific client
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats what i want to do
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, that would work, right?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but as i said, you aren't allowed to show levels for one client while showing time for another, there will only be one type of score in the scoreboard
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ??
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What do you mean
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why doesnt that work, if I send it only to specific clients
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the scoreboard will display a single format for every client
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, like before
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i can decide whether client 1's board shows time and client 3's board shows level
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, thats what i meant
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the rest was clear to me xd
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how customisable I should leave this
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you imagine any other scoreformat except time and score?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, there is nothing else i guess? Only numbers, or the time format using 00:00
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what else should it display? xf
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont kill fokkos score sys its used in ddnet++ -.-
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is already
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will redo it
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wat?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for ddpp
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ouch
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> once this pr is merged i will redo it, np
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not much
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> trust me
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what else should it display, that's why I asked
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Shouldnt be any other possibility
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it'll just be a toggle between Score and Time I'll use a flag
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if not I'll leave it an enum
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is no other format, so make it with flags
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> levels
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> leves is normal score tho
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> same format
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isn‚Äôt it about the label too tho
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that doesnt matter
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I was thinking of adding the label too
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> label oent matter
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobody reads that xd
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as a cute feature
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 oh, thatd be sick
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ‚ù§
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in this case I mean just the format
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u sure fok?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> "doesnt matter" "ok that would be sick"
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> classic foko
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the literal format string "%d" or "%d:%d:%d"
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, there is no other
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> format matters much more than the label
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can leave it open
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> one label being like score and the other like time or rank is totally fine
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> let the server send a format string to the client :troll:
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that really is all, I can't think of anything
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon did somebody say remote code execution?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe :p
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> XD
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> remote code executing is feature not security vulnerability
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> true
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> using a scoreboard format string vuln, you could replace the gamecore to add better prediction for your own mod
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that is exactly what people will do
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nothing else
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you see ZombieLoad btw?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ZombieToad sp someone? xd
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://zombieloadattack.com/
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no idk that
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new cpu vuln
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it says download
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> affects all intel cpus
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> melt down 3.0 ?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont even know foreshadow
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> except pentiums, celerons and atoms i guess as those don't have SMT
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "more critical vulnerabilities" jeez
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very similar to meltdown yeah
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> same idea, unprivileged and privileged processes sharing "cores"
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can i use it to get ddnet admin rcon?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> turorial pls
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can also use it between hypervisor threads, so you can access other peoples virtual machines as long as you are on the same physical server
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe amd best
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/IAIK/ZombieLoad
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah there is xd
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt that dangerous for all these coding websites
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that have thes compilers and run user code
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> amd was affected by spectre aswell
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not meltdown as much though
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like the game we played yesterday
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon yep, very
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this a recent vuln
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lez hack these sites
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im always last -.-
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if this is fixable OS-wise
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it's a hardware vuln
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wonder how long the NSA is using this already :troll:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it might require new microcode
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i didnt inform myself a lot on this butr isnt spectre and meltdown hardware too
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they are "fixed"
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or idk
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not much into that
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```To address the issue in Debian, updates to the kernel, processor microcode, hypervisor, and various other userspace packages will be needed. These updates are being announced in Debian Security Announcements and Debian LTS Announcements as they become available. ```
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well meltdown was "fixed" by having the kernel be careful where it executes privileged processes
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh i guess u can update processor microcode?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wathever that is
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.debian.org/DebianSecurity/SpectreMeltdown
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah,, during early boot you can patch the processors code
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that dangerous
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can fck up the cpu right
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's signed microcode
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember how they fixed spectre though
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only total fix to both is disabling SMT all-together
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all  those vulns always get some neat logos
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.debian.org/DebianSecurity/SpectreMeltdown
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/4/47376478-15151132152703211_origin.jpg
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this allows phishing sites
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to do easy phishing
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently they patched spectre with "unoptimizable code"
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and scam
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> write branches in a way that the cpu doesn't try doing speculative execution
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you mean by logos allowing easy fishing @Ryozuki ?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Like distributing scam patches and using the logo to loog legit?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing he means the new vuln
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually, not sure üòõ
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon lot of marketing for vulns most ppl wouldnt care less, some less tech savvy people would get worried and install some shit saying it patches it
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh i was just bored
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh, spectre looks cute, I'd let him on my computer
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why does ``str_toint_base("E0007897", 16)`` give me 2147483647 when it should be 3758127255
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it might be too big
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao ```14:45 <Learath2> ,cc long t = strtol("E0007897", NULL, 16); printf("%ld %d", t, t); 
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 14:45 <candide> Learath2: [warning: format '%d' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 3 has type 'long int' [-Wformat=]] 3758127255 -536840041```
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe you are printing it out the wrong format?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because str_toint_base calls strtol
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you should be getting hte negative thing, not 2147483647 are you also trying to shove it in a unsigned int?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes you are üòõ
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but str_toint_base is int
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :(
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what are you trying?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hex rgba
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> doesn't work as long for me either tho lol

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no @jao its not the first site my theme messed up
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rather do an pr on my theme than fix ur style
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i us elightthemed discord xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> And u're a dark theme user

16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I pack the color in the most significant byte btw
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you do aswell, good
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon nobo u can fix it
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u must tell firefox to use a light theme version of ur gtk theme

16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 what to do about str_toint_base hex rgba
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wym? the answer should be correct
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be returning the negative number
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didn‚Äôt work for me
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> where does it fail?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you not get the negative number?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I get the original number
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how are you checking?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```dbg_msg("DEBUG", "%d", str_toint_base("E0007897", 16));

17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> like that
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but that‚Äôs still the wrong value or not
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the negative value is correct
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> alpha is at the beginning so it also uses the sign bit
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```dbg_msg("DEBUG", "%d %u", str_toint_base("E0007897", 16), (unsigned)str_toint_base("E0007897", 16));
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [2019-05-15 17:22:54][DEBUG]: -536840041 3758127255```
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really get how you can arrive at 2147483647
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao you do exactly that and you get 2147483647?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, what str_toint_base is doing is not well-defined
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `Otherwise, the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it; either the result is implementation-defined or an implementation-defined signal is raised.`
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok you do it
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have no idea how to fix this properly
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> rip rgba then
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> god that entire feature was such a nightmare
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it should work right now
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it worked for other rgba values too
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only that one not
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay that does not make sense at all
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao `dbg_msg("DEBUG", "%d %u", str_toint_base("E0007897", 16), (unsigned)str_toint_base("E0007897", 16));`
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you just print that?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I‚Äôm not at home now
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll make colors an unsigned integer instead just to make sure we are doing things that aren't at the mercy of the implementation
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> aren‚Äôt they already?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kinda cheated, I still save them as integers
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (ab)using the sign bit
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but then as said by the standard the conversions aren't well defined
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> btw why do you floor instead of rounding properly
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao you mean round_truncate? I think it was the behaviour in the past that's why I kept it
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> https://itsfoss.com/windows-linux-kernel-wsl-2/
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u put this shit articles here
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> is the fucking woman needed
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting, why would windows want a linux kernel in it? what would the linux kernel do even? (nt kernel would be running ring 0, I don't see what the linux kernel would manage)
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> fake articles exist :troll:
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> "This is strictly my opinion. You may call it rant, I don‚Äôt really mind.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> 
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> Microsoft is infamous for its Embrace, Extend, Extinguish policy. It has started ‚Äòloving‚Äô open source and Linux in the last few years but before that Linux was cancer.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> 
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> The so-called ‚Äòlove for Linux‚Äô seems more like ‚Äòlust for Linux‚Äô to me. The Linux community is behaving like a teen-aged girl madly in love with a brute. Who benefits from this Microsoft-Linux relationship? Clearly, Microsoft has more to gain here. The WSL has the capacity of shrinking (desktop) Linux to a mere desktop app in this partnership.
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> 
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> By bringing Linux kernel to Windows 10 desktop, programmers and software developers will be able to use Linux for setting up programming environments and use tools like Docker for deployment. They won‚Äôt have to leave the Windows ecosystem or use a virtual machine or log in to a remote Linux system through Putty or other SSH clients."
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux kernel is licensed under gpl and derivative works must be under gpl
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur opinion is shit
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> it has quotes
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> coz i quote
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> ur opinion is copypasta
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "The Linux community is behaving like a teen-aged girl madly in love with a brute. " by reading this it tells me u suck
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and know nothing
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> are u retarded or what
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki they'll be sure to make their contributions public under the gpl
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> i'm actually quoting the article
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> xd
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why put that shit here tho

18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like its not all clear
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the derivative work would be WSL, worst case they'd need to open source that
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only good thing about this is that if you are a linux user and u are forced on a windows only enviroment on your shitty company u might have some breathable air
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i think even gpl 2 isnt infectious enough to include windows and nt kernel with it
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise suck suck
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides gpl hasnt been tested in courts
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> microsoft surely has the money to beat a dragged out case
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah microsoft beats others by using money everywhere
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has always been
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cancer company

18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 "The fact that GPL cases often settle does not mean the GPL is weak. In fact at least in some cases it's because the violators know they will lose and have no motivation to proceed to trial."
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki iirc it never went to trial, it's generally settled
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah that
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the thing is, even if it isn't weak a case that isn't settled will take a HUGE amount of time given there is no precedent
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all hail linux and debian, case closed
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as time goes on the rich people get the upperhand as they have a metric fuckton of money
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> justice works by money
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not by "justice"
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in america atleast
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everywhere i would say
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well atleast here in italy I can sue someone for stealing my money
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in america I'd need a lawyer
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk much about law

18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u use arch learath?

18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> just make linux be in europe and then do EU bullshit :troll:
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just so I can call systemd garbage and people cant call me out on not having used it
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 by using linux u are a teen-aged girl
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> according to the article
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:

18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not that, u can try it here http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/Site/Home.html
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 when I tested some rgb values where off and that sounds like a reason for it
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my god, there actually is an iso and all
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao you mean the rounding?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be more accurate if we rounded to the correct direction, yes
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you have any example i'd like to check it out aswell
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the old code rounded down so I kept it iirc
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> old code was bad
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well one value was off by 2 so there might be another inaccuracy
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you know the color I can check specifically why it happens
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also don't forget, the less saturated a color is, the worse it maps to rgb
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. half of the hsl space doesn't map to rgb space
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but the round truncate still feels wrong
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe if we could get a better way to round
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the property we need while rounding is making sure its invertible
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is it even wrapped in a function
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I wrapped it so it's obvious what I'm doing and where I'm doing it
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I anticipated that it wouldn't be the best way to round, so it's useful to know where it happens
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> xd
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do you have to invert it?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if its invertible then it's consistent on the round trip
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 HSL always maps to 1 RGB
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the bottom of the rgb vube that is
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cube*
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we should quantise the 0->1, so that only integer multiples of 1/255.0f are allowed
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or round to the closest 1/255.0f
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ho does that meme format fit
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> round to closest
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> welll doesn't really help much tbh
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #a96836 is 169 104 54
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> after going through hsl and coming back it's 168.0 102.2 53.9
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rounding closest only fixes the blue, the roundtrip to hsl isn't really safe
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rounding down is the correct choice here
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you map more of the rgb range into the closure of the interval then the boundry
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> would that be too much work (i mean to integrate in the latest version) if i work from hmh's branch `video_rebased2` to create a demo to video thing?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i'm not sure
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can try to git rebase and see how many conflicts you get
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> because right now i succeeded compiling from hes sources
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> k
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> when are you converting that back to hsl tho
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it‚Äôs only output isn‚Äôt it
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> everything entered is converted to hsl
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds stores hsl colors
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i didn't dare break all the old color codes
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so what roundtrip are you talking about
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you enter $a96836
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's rgb
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's stored as hsl
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now when displaying the rgb values again it goes back to rgb
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and why is rounding to closest unsafe? you are doing it only once?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rounding to closest is wrong
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in your example it‚Äôs more accurate
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you round to closest, 0 gets 0 ->0.5, 1 gets 0.5 -> 1.5
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> every integer except 0 and 255 get an entire 1/255 of the space
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which isn't right
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs wrong if it‚Äôs more accurate
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's more accurate in this example
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's less accurate in some other example
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can you show one
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can probably find one if I look, but that's beside the point imho, equipartitioning the space just makes mathematically more sense
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in my mind this can‚Äôt be worse than how it is now
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not like it's any different currently, you just never saw the rgb values
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is always what we rendered
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes it‚Äôs only output that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs unsafe
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not unsafe, it's just not correct, this isn't correct either though, I should be multiplying by 256 and then rounding down
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides, it's not the rounding in the case of this number
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `[2019-05-15 19:38:31][DEBUG]: R: 169, G: 104, B: 54, #A96836`if I print it out before the conversion to hsl and back
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 how does git rebase work? xd
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes current branch, and the target branch
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> finds their common ancestor
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then takes all the commits from the common ancestor to the current branch tip and applies them onto the target branch tip
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hmmm
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but the master branch of hmh is old
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so how can i do?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you are better versed in math, can you give me a hand with all this when you have time?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 you rebase hmhs branch onto ddnets master
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but they are two branches in separate repo
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but they are two branches in separate repos
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I think we just don't have enough bits to store accurate enough hsl to be able to get back to rgb
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sad
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 they aren't
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well yes they are
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you can add ddnets remote to your repo
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `git remote add ddnet git@github.com:ddnet/ddnet.git`
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i did that yea
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then git fetch ddnet
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> oh yea i forgot that
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then git rebase ddnet/master when you are on hmh's videoconv branch
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I will try to prove you wrong
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with the colors? üòõ
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm fairly sure the correct mapping is round_truncate(rgb.r * 256.0f)`
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the problem with my above example isn't that
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why 256?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> I have 2 conflicts
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao to avoid the issue i mentioned earlier
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that's not the issue here either
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the issue is that color has a large mantissa in it's S and L when converted
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 26.09 H 51.57 S and 43.73 L
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the .57 we can't store, we can either round up or round down
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> either way it's 0.5 off
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 0.43
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the .73 we can't store, currently we are .7 off
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so after that it's already no longer the same color
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's now #a66636 rgb
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well it's about accuracy
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I started with #a96836
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> say you round it up when storing the hsl, it's #a96937
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not going to be exact when we have only 255 possible values
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> rounding up is closer tho
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in that case
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also the hsl conversion between all implementations
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is a little different
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't really get 26.09 for the hue but we get 25.41
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that's where the bug is
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the implementation of RgbToHue is the exact one from wikipedia
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay nvm, i found where the inaccuracy is
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the hue is calculated correctly but when it's stored it needs to be mapped to 0-255
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don't like that you can enter wrong hex values
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's impossible to do any better without starting to store those instead of tw colors
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's better to slightly improve it by equipartitioning like i said
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should we start storing rgb hex colors?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 how good is ur bash? :justatest:
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon enough to do whatever i need to really
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sorri if im interrupting here
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh send help then
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well most colors make more sense in hsl?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``echo "g" | grep g | ./bot.py``
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> works
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``tail -fn1 logs/0.log | grep g | ./bot.py``
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao colors are easier to manipulate in hsl
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes and logs are full of g xd
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I guess storing as rgb is more accurate

20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         while True:
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>             line = sys.stdin.readline()
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I don't see what that's supposed to do
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pass along lines that contain g?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to filter tail and then pass it to python
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can pass tail to python
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can pass grep to python
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i cant pass tail to grep and then to python
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways grep waits until the input is done iirc
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> somewhere data gets lost
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tail -f is never done so that's prolly it
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that makes sense then
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any ideas?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could also filter in python
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i prever grep cuz ez xd
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> filter in python
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and learn more python meanwhile
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> -.-
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u better learn bash
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its best
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 can we return an invalid color instead of defaulting to black when entering a wrong color
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i.e. don't update the color if u enter something wrong
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought about that but couldn't figure out a good interface for it
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe a bool m_Valid in color4_base and an override for !
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe a ColorInvalid that fails to cast to any other color
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't do the second one, the functions are supposed to return ColorHSLA
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the first one it is
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ColorHSLA(-1, -1, -1)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> color4_base(-1,-1,-1) and bool color4_base::isValid() that returns false if the components aren't in 0-1 range
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 four mentions. did I miss something important?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even today has >1000 messages üò¶
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the first 3 was probably while we were golfing, wanted to see if you'd join
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the last one I have a math question about mapping intervals
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure. PM in order to no spam the channel?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> buy heinrich o,O we all have nothing better to do than spam and read #developer all day :feelsamazingman:
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> busy* not buy ^^
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hex rgba works with your pr btw learath
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao it's ARGB or RGBA>
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> rgba
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> some uses ARGB for hex values
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so which one do you want
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> rgba(rrr,ggg,bbb,aaa)
