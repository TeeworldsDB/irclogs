16:28 < BeaR_> no more haskell \o/
16:54 <@deen> BeaR_: haha
16:54 < BeaR_> ^^
17:06 <@deen> I'm wondering if i should just try to submit a Nim wikipedia article
17:56 < BeaR_> deen: Sounds like a good idea.
17:57 <@deen> well, it was denied 2 or 3 times already
17:57 < BeaR_> (should work on my nim-openal bindings)
17:57 < BeaR_> oh
17:57 <@deen> maybe i should just pretend i don't know :P
17:57 < BeaR_> why
17:57 <@deen> because we have no external sources
17:57 < BeaR_> ah well ..
17:57 <@deen> all the texts about nim are by nim developers or not serious enough
17:58 <@deen> I'm also working on the GSoC application
17:58 <@deen> would look better if we had a wikipedia article then :P
18:00 < BeaR_> hm looking at the rust article, most references are from mozilla or rust developers /:
18:01 <@deen> yeah, maaaaaany languages have no references
18:01 <@deen> but wikipedia doesn'T care
18:01 <@deen> I'll just refer to this policy if they say something :P: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules
18:02 < BeaR_> hahaha
