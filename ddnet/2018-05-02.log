11:03 <@heinrich5991> deen: can we download teehistorian from ger2 for completeness? it seems down via ssh already
11:33 <@deen> oh right
11:33 <@deen> powering on heinrich5991 
11:48 <@deen> heinrich5991, Learath2 tell me when you synced it, then I shut it down again
11:49 <@heinrich5991> deen: synced
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Delete teehistorian
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I know so many startlineskips but u would just check teehistorian :feelsbadman:
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could you complete mine sometime or is it too late for me? ðŸ˜„
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti not if u dont get a rank 1
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> tee historian is for heinrich and learath to make replay bots and get good ranks on hard maps
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> tee historian should be for players to make ranks without laggs on homeserver
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> da sieht man, dass das ddnet team bots supported
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Im 'corneum deutschland regiert teeworlds, ist doch klar...
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> wo spielen die meisten Leute??? DDNet Ger, weil Deutschland das beste Land auf der ganzen Welt ist oder gibt es EinsprÃ¼che?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nord korea ist besser
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> dann spiel auf deinem koreanischen server
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> english only please
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> ich finde kein #german
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> irgendwo muss man deutsch reden
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> und auÃŸerdem sind hier eh 80% alles deutsch
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> #off-topic
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Im 'corneum  jao ist ein razist
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and stop responding in german now
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> 82.225.63.114:14117
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :banhammer: ðŸ‘Œ
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> he said in german that the world should be 80% german
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> he wants to invade other contries
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> hes a nazi
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> *i dont speak german this might not be true
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he said 80% of this server understand german
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> 98% of the server understands english
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip 2% xd
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon  you are one of the 2%
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Its not possible to track ddos ?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Its illegal right ?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not possibe. illegal
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> @-TwistÂ°~ why you ask?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Because its annoying, for 3 days ddos you cant play anymore... and  I was just interested if its possible
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> who got it?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> hey ! Which Github bot are you using ?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> I need one for one of my server and i'm not sure about what I find on google
19:25 <+Learath2> @Amu~Cookie It's the github webhook for discord
19:26 <+Learath2> ran through a filter in our case to stop bors spamming
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum well, it'd certainly be possible to decide not to care about tool-assisted speed runs
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I  guess the rules are currently: no bots
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence no teehistorian-enabled home servers
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because people will bot on those
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im jhust saying that when teehistorian wasnt out, i was told its so you can play on your homeserver and get your rank with it
19:29 <+Learath2> it was one use case we were thinking of
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and i dont see how that makes botting any more possible than it is now
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then you and a couple of other people came along and botted
19:29 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: while you are here, any way I can complete my archive of teehistorian
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and showed us that it's a bad idea to let players host their own servers
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because we have more data when people do it on our servers, @Im 'corneum
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> aah. see thats new to me
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but nice try to put it on me that you didnt do it
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> ty
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well. that's not what I said
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I said what you and a few other people did showed us that it's not possible
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think it is possible if you replay them back yourself. pehaps automaticly, so you could just send the demo in  and it checks if it is legit. (to prevent using super on homeserver and such) everything else can be done on the normal servers anyway
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just eases the creation of bots
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *it also
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't want to do that
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you mean because the bots wouldnt have to deal with laggs
19:34 <+Learath2> 2 ping makes for a great server to bot on :P
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> at one point no one will play on normal ddnet servers anymore ðŸ˜„
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> isnt it kind of shitty to have laggs being a bot prevention
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would only work with solo i guess
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum better than no bot prevention
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and that's not the only thing it gives us
19:35 <+Learath2> or we can introcude micro inaccuracies in the physics that would make your tees position uncertain :P
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when people play on your servers, you get more data
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah a CP here and the cant be too bad ðŸ˜„
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah a CP here and there cant be too bad ðŸ˜„
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I don't really think you should be the one to advocate less bot protection
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you want to advocate allowing bots
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you may not believe it but i actually want it to play without laggs. and legit
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do that if you want
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> found the lag problem
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/441292324228562955/screenshot_2018-05-02_18-37-01.png
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. I don't actually believe that right now tbh
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> blocker community is cancer
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you cheated again after you were told not to
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why does ddnet host it
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does ddnet host ddnet
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure what kind of answer you expect
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the thing is that the time i botted is like .01% of my whole time in tw. but you see me as a botter because thats the only time you really had to deal with me. now that i see that botting will be detected anyway and i dont want to risk a lifeban on my name i "worked" on  since 2013(on ddnet) i decided that it isnt worth it.  so now i just want to play legit again.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> didnt they already give u an extra chance
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what can i say?  youre right. but i didnt know how they react if i bot again. now that the ban is so long i  genuinely dont want to get banned anymore.
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> so u knew they are gonna catch u and u still cheated
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no i didnt know
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> now i do
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u literally cheated again on the same rank that got deleted the first time
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :GWchadMEGATHINK:
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet doesnt allow blocking so ist Is a good question why ddnet also hosts Block Servers @heinrich5991 and These Servers get ddosed a lot
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon ddnet doesn't allow blocking on ddnet servers, so it's a good thing we have a place for blockers to go to ðŸ™‚
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And ddnet doesnt really care about These Block Servers
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @snail  i tried to be more careful but it obviusly didnt work.
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It Is a extra risk
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> id bet the blocker servers are the target for the current ddos
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And all ddnet Servers suffer the ddos
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> @Im 'corneum  you deserved this  lifeban. At least for being so stupid lol
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you deserved all of the 10 bans in forum for spamming so much
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> xd
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> snail stop!
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i guess its jao ðŸ˜„

20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991 why did u kick lola tho xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> no one here is against kicking lola
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> tru
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to get them to notice my PMs
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes lola ded
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> @ZombieToad i am
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ur a jew
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> do u have any problem with that
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lola spams all our pms, but ignores heinrichs
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i cant answer or jao will ban me for racism
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ðŸ¤¡
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao and me
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> Germany didnt do a good enough job in ww2 though
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> a lot
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> amm guys, its ok to tell that i want a server pc to run all ddnet touraments ...at least free?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i want to make support for ddnet
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i know there is bunch of ddos most of the time
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what would that help
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and on touraments too
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> best talk to @deen about hosting servers I think
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> would get the same ddos as if it were on our servers
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> making ddos protected touraments
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have some tricks to not get any ddos. but its on test with some friends of mine.
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i bet you and your friends made a groundbreaking discovery
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> tricks?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> whyd kick me
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean different codes, locks and stuff, amm that would be really just test
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> stop abuse admin
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you even know what you're talking about lol
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i do, im learning programming all the time, from the basics
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @heinrich5991 why did kick me
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can u prevent ddos with basic programming?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i doubt
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and not just me doing it as i said, i have friends to help me
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no jao XCD
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZombieToad I told you in PM, but you block messages
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i dont block messages
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe from non-friends?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> where is setting for messages xD
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao ammm i dont say it will be offical that what im doing will works, but me and my friends are trying to figure out .... slowly how to protect our connections
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ZombieToad privacy & safety
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i live on the edge
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @heinrich5991 send message
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why im kicked
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao you think i could easily fuck up everything with one touch? ðŸ˜„
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> the holocaust didnt happen
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> ok ok I won't call people stupid even if they are stupid as wood
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I also had to say 'sorry' but I wont
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> I also have to say 'sorry' but I wont

20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> yes
20:38 <+Learath2> Huh, we seem to be getting a lot of people who've made groundbreaking discoveries in ddos prevention nowadays :P
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> @lola no
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 you probably know most about this. why doesn't this work and with normal names it does?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/441310174205050900/screenshot_2018-05-02_20-47-34.png
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mhh
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should theoretically work
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens there?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <azerty> need "name" ?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> nothing
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> no chat message at all
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <azerty> Do /times "names"
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i do
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> but it doenst work with those characters in his name
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <azerty> Did you put "" ?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> ah with the "" it works
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @lola hi my wife
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> didn't know that
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mhhmh
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #include <stdio.h>
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int float_compare(void)
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     float x = 1.3f;
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     return x == 1.3f;
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int main()
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> {
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     printf("%d\n", float_compare());
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     return 0;
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compile with `gcc -m32 -std=c99 a.c` and get surprised. maybe ðŸ™‚
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> well i have no clue what is that about and if it is meant for me, but i am not gonna compile. I heard it was not easy XD
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b dunno if you know c, but if you do: ask yourself what this might output
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @heinrich5991 im curious, what type of vpn are you guys use for your servers? I wonder if someday i would get some more informations about vpns and ddoses. kinda helps a lot if you anwser :,3
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should return true but i guess it will return false since u said i would get surprised
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Cellegen no vpns are involved in the servers
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that is bad isnt it?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I currently see no way how a vpn would improve something
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> from ddos attacks? idk a bit
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> mabye security would be the most recent goal for servers :thonkery:
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> well i almost don't have knowledge about programming. i learned a bit of phyton and html. but that was really basic.
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Cellegen I don't know how anything relating to vpns can help increase the security of the servers
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you could explain how, maybe we could discuss your idea
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i read / watch different types of understandable websites that can tell you how DDos works and how VPN works as well. Its like a balance of a good side and a dark side of the internet. DDos is a meaning of "blocking services on server - taking over control connection - botnet" this is what i could tell about DDos mostly xd.  But VPN is different, if we use any protection against DDos / Dos attacks <message clipped>
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Maybe if we (idk if i could count) could find a solution, which type of vpn could be good enough for stopping overhearming servers and protect our stuff
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> gtfo jao
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ˜¦
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Cellegen VPNs allow you to create something like a LAN over the internet. they're often used to communicate with the company network over a secure connection, or to get a different entry point into the internet. I don't think this helps with protecting public services from denial of service
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> what u talking about cellegen xD
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> >.>
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well he did his best, but from what I know he messed up some concepts
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong the true IP is never been visible before, there is a chance a good VPN filters all DDos packets
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just like a good DDos filter
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you won't be able to pay any of them
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's hard to decide what a "ddos packet" is
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but lets say googles offers us a VPN with 1Tbit/s and automatically filters invalid packets(for our services invalid), then it would help probably
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the packets that are used to attack the servers are often valid teeworlds packets
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but they are spam
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> something like: who's on your server
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's hard to distinguish that from a legitimate person asking: who's on your server
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ofc there is no true protection
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you are right
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but most ddos filters probably filter by ips anyway
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it would help filter some of the traffic, probably
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be interesting if in near future, foreign packets can be disabled by any ISP
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in america net neutrality isnt a thing anymore... there it would deffs be possible
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but even if not, if you say the best route to a german server is always thorugh germany, then you good defenitely filter packets on some nodes near to other countries
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ofc this would only work if no ISP allows fake ips or anything like that
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >only work if no ISP allows fake ips
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it unfortunately doesn't work
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because that isn't reality today
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but the laws can handle most of this stuff
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i doubt some ddos kiddies get bot nets so easily then
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what was GER2 btw, some server that was expired?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shut down because GER was superior AFAIK
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can scroll up a little
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 when was your last teehistorian sync?
22:13 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: this morning
22:13 <+Learath2> but I'm missing like 3 weeks or sth
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> heinrich unban ZombieToad he apologize for being rude and didnt know that his post is a crime in german law
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he definitely did
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I told him 5min earlier
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> via PM
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and he responded to that
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I even posted a wikipedia link
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno the few times i join a ddnet server its lagging hard, GER2 was better about that
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsbadman:
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ok, gimme ssh access
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 and please suspend your sync while I upload the differences
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @heinrich5991 he meant this tv series i meant https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077025/ wasnt real
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Not the real one
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti I won't discuss this right now. he was well aware of what he was writing
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> But we need him :feelsbadman:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'll get him back eventually
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't worry
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all trolls come back somewhen
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you always had ssh on that box iirc
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then tell me where I have to send it plz
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teehistorian@main.learath2.info
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you have intellij installed?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't think so
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh :S
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I do on this computer
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's not really the java one, you know how they rebrand the same editor for different purposes?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have webstorm and phpstorm
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what for?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> start it and go to help â†’ find action
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> type something
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to code such a UI
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> recommendations on how to build that?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IDEA is pretty nice ðŸ˜ƒ
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I'd start with having the structure in place to register all actions
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh no
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean just the UI
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a text box and a list of suggestions
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how could I render something like that, so it looks good
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmmm, just copy theirs? I don't get what you are stuck with, you mean in teeworlds?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I mean just a little native UI
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for a new program
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where this would be the sole input method
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, an example program would help?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's like a db entry program
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first you enter a couple of things identifying a row in some way
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then you enter the value of the column that should be changed
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the column is selected beforehand
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi this essentially just has a textbox and a list of suggestions, you could take a look at how they render theirs
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, and cross-platform would be nice
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X. probably not
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it's just X
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never really done much ui work so I don't really know which framework to go for in this case
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never really done much ui work so I don't really know which library to go for in this case
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh :S
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you know someone to ask?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you could probably use gtk and disable decorations
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't really know anyone sadly :/
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nemo fstd: ^ know someone knowledgable in UI development?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 maybe https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear paired with sdl?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> used it with unreal engine for some debugging windows before
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon we also removed the blocker servers for a few months and ddos attacks didn't reduce in number or strength
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have you disabled your teehistorian sync?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> amazon glacier costs 4$/tb/month
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was giving out errors
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I disabled it, thought I would fix it but forgot about it...
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'd like to not have two sync processes running that are pushing data to your server)
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's disabled
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> upload started
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that you missed a couple of weeks, this might take a while
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @deen .zip source on ddnet.tw/downloads?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ReiTW | Blizzard adding a third tee (2nd dummy) would mean quite some restructuring in the code
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I asked u 1-2 months ago, I think you missed it again, can you please add those back? x)
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I fear it wouldn't be easy
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> hmh
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @heinrich5991 the 2nd dummy stays in connecting state
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lol a second dummy would be nice as hell
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> especially for some testing shit
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> some things are really annoying to test etc :/
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> think of all the new cheats u could do if u had an extra dummy
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lol true
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :danAmazing: :troll:
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> lol
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> think of sv_max_clients_per_ip \*-\*
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> its at you to dont use for dont cheat lol
23:54 <+ZombieToad> hello pls unban discord
23:55 <+ZombieToad> i understand now that german law forces you to learn false history
23:55 <+ZombieToad> the holocaust was real
23:55 <+ZombieToad> @heinreich5991
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u unban first
23:56 <+ZombieToad> ok
