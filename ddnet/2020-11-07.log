00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The problem is that saving happens in the main thread so it would hang all the time
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh, can it be moved to another thread?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and im noticed that player (who is playing with client actually) have some lags on ninja, but without any prediction (with antiping) it has pretty good animation
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can ninja be not predicted for player?
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A CoW snapshot based editor would allow rather cheap threaded saving

07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> how to fix it?
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774535337120759848/unknown.png
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> give me a hint
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the cursor!!!!
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice @TsFreddie
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol xD
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is gona be important update i think
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: i could use something like bezier curve to solve the interpolation of the cursor. but i'm way to lazy. linear doesn't look bad tbh.
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: i could use something like bezier curve to solve the interpolation of the cursor. but i'm way too lazy. linear doesn't look bad tbh.
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in demo it shouldnt be a problem, probably
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since you know all gameticks
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it look better than my stupid tee drawing version of it
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> not really lol
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if so then plsss add
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (not a high bar to set but still)
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i just made server send the cursor back and have the demo save it. so it is still server info.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how laggy is it compared to the tee version
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably less laggy right
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ye.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :DD
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i need this
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but it is probably not accurate due to interpolation.
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can we do a test where u try ur thing at the same time as my cursor thing
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but you'll never get enough information for it to be accurate
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and see how closely they line up
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or it requires special server
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> eh nvm
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think it requires maybe two files to be updated in server.
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and those wont break compatibility with anything?
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> no
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill do the updates if ull wanna test
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but send pls
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :D
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> `network.py` and `player.cpp`
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok ill try, sec
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> for client just grab the artifact
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @noby why didnt u just use a laser entity as cursor
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> becase im stupid
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc a tee laggs if it gets predicted xD
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well cl_predict 0
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its less about that
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :nervous:
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and more about just, whats the best way to send the data to the client accurately
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> then this is not more accurate
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is just convenient and still look like a cursor
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> laser entity + high bandwidth
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u get ur best cursor xd
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if this goes in its fine too XD
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my code base is a bit different with the m_pLastTarget but i (think i) fixed it
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> oh, forgot to add a option to disable it
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> eh
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im compiling this on fng small rn
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can u come with test client in a min
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> sure
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> if china doesn't block me
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its up
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 35.204.119.214:8338
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774540068714577940/unknown.png
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> doesn't work
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but uh
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> try now?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> works for both now
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> admins should be vulnerable to afkkick anyway so ez fix
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie can't u just interpolate over the past
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like everthing else is doing
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but with the correct intratick
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the broken one xd
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> which one
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> is there one?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im leaving the test server and gonna push this to main server while its emptyish
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so if u wana come back to test do it on main
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> int DeltaTick = m_aSnapshots[g_Config.m_ClDummy][SNAP_CURRENT]->m_Tick - m_aSnapshots[g_Config.m_ClDummy][SNAP_PREV]->m_Tick;
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>                 if(DeltaTick > 0)
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>                     m_GameIntraTick[g_Config.m_ClDummy] = ((Now - PrevtickStart) / (float)(CurtickStart - PrevtickStart)) / (float)DeltaTick;
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 51.89.23.241:8338
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this obviously is wrong xd
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> just revert to the old one can see it for yourself
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i can't record screen right now
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok change is live on server
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i hope it doesnt break it xd
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @TsFreddie wana test on main to make sure settings ar e right
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i lied
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i don't know if the recording looks good tho
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> battery is dying
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774547390655889418/2020-11-07_16-13-01.mp4
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, that looks good enough doesnt it
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> no
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> not at all
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant judge on 30fps videos xd
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it shouldn't go beyond the interp target and bounce back
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'm pretty sure it's 60fps
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but thats just how it is
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah jk, im also not used to 60fps tho
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie if u want a smooth interpolation u have to do a interpolation tick
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> snap_prev should be a interpolated snapshot between cur and prev snapshot
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its bascially a fake 50ticks
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> why is cur snap exactly?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> w hatis cur snap exactly?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the current snapshot
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> what is cur snap exactly?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the prev snapshot
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> how current it is
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the last one that was received
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> in 50snaps cur is after now.
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> in 25snaps cur is before now
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> which is weird
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> so there must be something funny going on with now, which is a result returned by CSmoothTime that's not adapted to 25 snaps
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> intragametick is always delay anyway, if it can do 50 interp it should be able to do 25 interp without a fake snap in between
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> intragametick is always delay anyway. if it can do 50 interp, it should be able to do 25 interp without a fake snap in between
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hey we finished a full round with the new code and didnt crash
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üëç
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :no: completely broken is worst than crashing lol
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :no: completely broken is worse than crashing lol
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not completely broken
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> from how i understand it, its already better than my cursor view thing? cus same positions but better sprite and no need to turn off predict
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also let me know if/when u are sure that these are the final servercode changes, then ill push it to the rest of the servers
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> @noby need you in fng small
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i said
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i pushed it to main srv
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> oh
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> then i need a ip for fng
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 51.89.23.241:8338
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you know what
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think noby's server might have different tick values with current ddnet
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think noby's server might have different tick values from fcurrent ddnet
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think noby's server might have different tick values from current ddnet
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :blobban: 25snaps in general have weird stuff happening all over the place
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i reverted the intratick thing
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'll make a option to turn off the cursor interp
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i c what the code does
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and its weird
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> can you do a better intratick?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i really want one
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its alot of work probably
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am currently thinking about just making the cursor smooth
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be enough probs xd
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think the game time in general is traveling both forward and backward at the same time with 50 ticks in mind
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> probs
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it defenitelly slows down and speeds up
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats already strange enough
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> well you're at it. you can probably fix the shaky gun angle too
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it's the same thing.
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i dont even want it, bcs delay xd
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i want atleast the fix for you for testing
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> sure
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> gun angle isn't too important i imagine?
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [2:35 AM] TsFreddie üåà: i think noby's server might have different tick values from current ddnet
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> yours better
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üëÄ
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you silly goof
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh yeah it totally has better tick values than ddnet
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet sux
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :pepeH:
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> > gun angle isn't too important i imagine?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i doubt any one would could have a 1/25th sec decision to dodge a pre aim with other ppls gun angle.
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby what tick value
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nobert
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he has high bandwidth xd
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> > gun angle isn't too important i imagine?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i doubt anyone could have a 1/25th sec decision to dodge a pre aim with other ppls gun angle.
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye i was just gonna say
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its because my server has default high bandwidth
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well to be fair noby has 30 players, ddnet has over 1k
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and ddnte doesnt
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that too lol
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> high bandwidth on noby's server behave slightly different than my local server
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no ddnet doesnt have 1k players on one vps
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> maybe it is a debug thing.
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but a few hundred on a single vps maybe yea
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or PING
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and i have 32 max
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> sure, but noby's server's interp is smoother
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt higher bandwidth lag ppl with rly bad internet too
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ppl with rly bad internet will lag no matter what the server settings are
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> either way i'm counting on @Jupstar ‚ú™ the wizard to make this thing better.
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i modified the network_server loop a little bit
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nothing that should affect this
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just some simple optimizations that help against naive ddos attacks
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> maybe master have some weird server changes
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> or it could be a debug thing.
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> probably a debug thing
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> when fix multieasymap design its full of halloween crap
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie ok its a bit strange but i assume, its bcs it targets the next tick (even if u only have 25 ticks, it still acts like it targets the tick that never happens)
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats why for 25 ticks the values are always around 0.5-1.5, bcs the calculation uses the difference between the actual ticks
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe a PrevPrevCursorInfo would already work
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when the intratick is smaller than 1 it can interpolate between prevprev and prev
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for >= 1 it should then interpolate between prev and cur
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (ofc -1 calculated)
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i guess you can fix the code somehow else
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its too much work and thinking rn xD
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> chinese brain ain't getting it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> prevprev is good idea i didnt think of that
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well imagine it like this
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> prev tick is 0
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cur is 2
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> your target is 3
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so 3 / 2
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is 1.5
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as you are at 3 however its like the prev tick
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so basically 3 - 2(the cur tick) / 2
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so 0.5 again
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that only happens bcs it doesnt get the tick between these
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant explain better, but it does target these ticks
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if u dont lag its jump around 0.5 and 1.5 is my bet
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for 25 ticks
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and the target can be anywhere from 2.01 to 3.99 right
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its always the tick between the actual ticks
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then there is also the "smooth" time thing
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that just is random, i cant explain it
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> wait now is a tick?
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it targets the tick as the next time
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> not a continuous time or something?
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it calculates the time cotinously ofc
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it tries to "know" which is the next tick to smooth this time
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> where did that happen
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> the part where it tries to "know"
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> CSmoothTime::Get
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this uses the target tick
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that is set in the update function of it
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that is the Gametick - 1 multiplied with the time
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> what if we Gametick - 2
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> well assuming we can know the tick rate when it does that.
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `m_GameTime[g_Config.m_ClDummy].Update(&m_GametimeMarginGraph, (GameTick - 1) * time_freq() / 50, TimeLeft, 0);`
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it always uses -1
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but remember that for 25 ticks this is always the tick between
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the actual ticks
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats why this whole stuff is just confusing xd
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> oof
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am also not sure if that really makes sense, but its not like tw looks unsmooth, so it probs isnt too bad
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think nuborn or so wrote this whole prediction stuff
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he will be able to tell u why xD
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> lol i just tried change every GameTick - 1 to - 2
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what happened xd
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> look pretty good in 25 snaps tbh
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok xD
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it targets an even more in the past tick
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not gonna judge if that makes sense
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is definitely not working for 50 ticks. with -2 (duh)
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> do you see a 12.5 tick server happening in the foreseeable future
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> or 16.6 ticks
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well its server side
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can send snapshots whenever u want xd
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but no, i dont even know if the client works  with it
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can try ofc xD
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if(g_Config.m_SvHighBandwidth || (m_CurrentGameTick % 2) == 0)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if(g_Config.m_SvHighBandwidth || (m_CurrentGameTick % 4) == 0)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if(g_Config.m_SvHighBandwidth || (m_CurrentGameTick % 2) == 0)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if(g_Config.m_SvHighBandwidth || (m_CurrentGameTick % 4) == 0)
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well gl with it xd, it too confusing for me rn, maybe another dev with more insight can answer you the impl details more accurate
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :d49Rip:
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i kinda have a feeling why it happens
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i tried to explain it above xd
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you know what
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> GameTick - 3 works with m_CurrentGameTick % 3 as well.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf xD
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats random tho xd
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ye.
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and sure it is delayed, but like, it is 16.6ticks, you can't make it instant and smooth at the same time.
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats true
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but not sure how the line up works with -
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but not sure how the line up works with -3
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> dude
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it works with -6 and %6
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> <a:nlaYosho:745988401785864252>
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Q.E.D. all teeworlds problems solved
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but yeah, cursor looks like it is drawing polygons with a tick rate this low.
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> (maybe it is possible to further reduce chn server's tick rate to save some bandwidth)
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> chn infclass was having problems with way too many objects.
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> We should pressure teeworlds to have 100ticks with 50snaps by default then you can fine tune the snap rate and have the clients to deal with the smoothing automatically.
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but sadly that isnt possible
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mathematically not
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u cannot increase the tickrate of teeworlds without breaking psysics
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i know
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i tried it it almost feels the same but it isnt
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> csgo 128ticks have the same problem i think, but 3d shooter doesn't really need the ability to reproduce physics like we do.
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that probs is still a different problem
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs physically it is possible to do a velocity, position interpolation
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc its still not 100% the same, but its really insanely close
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Uniform_acceleration
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if teeworlds would follow this
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it adds a kostant to the velocity directly
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> anyway. should i try to detect the tick rate and adapt the csmoothtime with it?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cannot tell if this breaks something
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u can try out for sure
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'll do it in a separate PR, and maybe have a test server
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> just to see how it goes
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> best is probs u do git blame and ask the person who created this, bcs i dont even see  the reason behind all this code xD
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it almost seems random
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: but it works
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> normally in unity i would just use system time as a fallback. since high precision timer is always hard to deal with.
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> std::chrono
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to deal with constant time
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> steady clock
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and i almost never to tick sync for multiplayer. (probably because i never do physics based multiplayer)
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and i almost never do tick sync for multiplayer. (probably because i never do physics based multiplayer)
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a kostant tick is nice tho
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its like you scale psychics into virtuality
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> makes calculations very consitent
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> time is hard.
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :saddog:btw we can even try lower tick rates on test servers (if we does one), if that didn't break enough things then it is probably fine for 25.
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think i really need a bezier curve to solve cursor position in lower tick rates
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> operation failed :troll:
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774580336423862312/unknown.png
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heinrich implemented bezier curves in ddnet already
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> looks like a one dimensional curve currently. i'll see if it can be used for vec2 as well.
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it should be ddnet.tw
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its on behalf of ddnet team
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i've changed it
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774581471402393640/unknown.png
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you can have smooth dyncam toggle with smooth camera on without having to tick dyncam in menu @deen
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same for many other options we don't show in menu when their parent option is disabled
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i mean i can have dyncam off, smoothcam on. then i can use bind to toggle dyncam smoothly
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, I understand
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and i don't need to check dyncam option that resets my settings
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then let's at least rename it to Smooth Dynamic Camera?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you can probably group them with indent without hiding it
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But it's still unintuitive. Because people will enable smooth camera and notice nothing happens
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because they additionally need dynamic camera
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> fair
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's why I made the change, someone asked me what it even does
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> then go for Smooth Dynamic Camera i guess
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> > if its on behalf of ddnet team
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> @Ryozuki then it really should be @noby :troll:
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but ddnet.tw does make more sense

11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Okidoki:greenthing:
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> @deen you know what, just hide smooth camera. i doubt anyone toggling would need it to be smooth anyway.
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üòÑ
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok

12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ^ 25tick server, no anti-ping
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> maybe add a separate CSmoothTime for gun and cursor only. keep the 50 tick one for characters and envelops.
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: but the delay won't matter like at all for local players or antiping.
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: but the delay won't matter like at all for local players or with antiping on
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> antiping is also anti-interpolation-delay in some sense.

15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> nice
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> teeworlds' code gives me depression
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is what happens to people that think they understand the scoreboard code ^^
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rule 1 of working with the teeworlds codebase is to assume you understand nothing and touch as little as possible
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rule 2 is if you don‚Äôt understand why something is there, assume it‚Äôs there for a reason and not just because the previous developer had a stroke
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> There is  a rly weird bug that happened to me, i played on entity mode for a really long time and now some blocks are just plain color white on some maps,  here are some demo files of the bug

16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i got that bugged scoreboard on steam beta lol
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> Is there a fix for this bug?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well gfx bugs wouldn‚Äôt show up in demos @PopCorn181. It would be nice if you can show a screenshot. CC @Jupstar ‚ú™
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> Weird
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis yeah, it‚Äôs a recent change. It looked rather short for a scoreboard change which was what I was referring to
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @PopCorn181 well it‚Äôs to be expected, demos only contain the state of the game, that‚Äôs why they are so small. Rendering is done by the client, so a gfx bug won‚Äôt be part of the demo

17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it broken?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If so we should just remove the setting
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Yes you should. But firstly need to test in other game mods, because I don't play it and don't know every mechanic

22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> this isn't a major bug but for some reason the Global Old Shotgun part of the editor, doesn't have text.  At the bottom where it usually explains what an entity does, the Global Old Shotgun says "Glo"
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774752100126949376/unknown.png
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> Bottom left of image shows what I mean.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @PopCorn181 version?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> I updated to the most recent for win32 today.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> most recent on website?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> yeah
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> don't know, works for me
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774752664889589760/screenshot_2020-11-08_00-50-12.png
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> also works on 640x480
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774753282442133534/screenshot_2020-11-08_00-52-22.png
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @PopCorn181 can u run 64 bit too?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or are u actually on win32
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cannot repr on wine with the 32bit
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @PopCorn181 thanks, I can reproduce it. @Jupstar ‚ú™ depends heavily on resolution, I tried a few and got it
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, i tried 5:4 too, what he seem to have
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 5:4, but only some resolutions, not all
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for me it just shows GLOBAL then
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it probs tries a new line
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just stop at end or smth xd
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> TextWidth changes the text you pass it, that should definitely not happen
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow, that sounds really bad
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where exactly?
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't find it yet
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs its a const char*
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, you can cast the const away
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true üòÑ
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> int Wlen = minimum(WordLength((char *)pCurrent), (int)(pEnd - pCurrent));
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> here for example
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which is a useless cast, so it's not that one
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still shouldnt be done
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, will fix
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> has clang tidy something for that
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or enable a compiler warning?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know i system.c we have atleast one false positive
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, modernize casts I think
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then static_cast would forbid that and you'd need an explicit const_cast I thin
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you can grep for them at least
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but even for old casts this can be enabled
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and have another check to disallow const casts
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs modern cast is ugly xD
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-cstyle-cast.html this should work
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but well, maybe it just suggests the modern casts
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho i am pretty sure clang has warnings for that too, i use them in other projects
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i compiled the source with weverything some day and thought about cleaning up xD
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but was too much
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We enabled quite some warnings
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can add some more
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not all at once of course
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ScaleFontSize
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in editor
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that makes it 0
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast it always removes more and more from the string, but didnt follow the loop whole time
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> str_append(aBuf, "...", sizeof(aBuf))
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sizeof(abuf) XD
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its a ptr
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange that clang tidy didnt find this
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> havent we enabled pointer sizeof
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> phew, it's not TextWidth
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's my bad usage of str_append. such a dump mistake
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still strange that clang-tidy didnt find it
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also found this bug in system.c
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with the network addr thing
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because that was more obvious
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it only has some patterns it looks for, didn't have this one
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
