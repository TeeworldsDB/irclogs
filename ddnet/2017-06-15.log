10:49 < ochristi> hah, heinrich5991 this one https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1392/decent-gui-for-gdb/1444#comment679_1444
10:51 < ochristi> had to debug something generated with bison/flex, but I just did not compile for debugging with cmake, so I was looking for alternatives :)
10:51 < laxa> I use gdb-peda, there is also gef, pwndbg
10:51 < laxa> But those frontends are probably more asm oriented than debugging source code
10:52 < laxa> https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui
10:52 < laxa> there is also this
10:53 < ochristi> I tried that, but it did not suit me very well
10:53 < laxa> those are perfect for asm debug
10:54 < ochristi> I eventually managed with kdgb, it even stepped through the original, not generated, bison source
11:05 <+Learath2> gdb -tui
