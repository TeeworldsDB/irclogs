22:11 <@heinrich5991> @Learath2 no, crc32 is trivially invertible AFAIK (i.e. I could break the system)
22:12 <@heinrich5991> remember that this shouldn't even be the difficult part ("finding a crypto we can't break")
22:12 <@heinrich5991> we should rely on primitives in use elsewhere for similar problems so we can achieve the difficult part ("finding crypto that people smarter than us can't break")
