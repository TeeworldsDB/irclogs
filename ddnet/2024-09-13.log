04:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo @melo∆û as far as i know the official dummy drag race network corporation still runs teeworlds and not ddnet based ctf servers in 2024 xd
04:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so no server side race demos or teehistorian
05:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is there some intended way of waiting for the database workers? @zwelf2  I assume thats one of the things which causes my ddnet server to take seconds to shutdown. I can't seem to find the code -.-
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I access a bunch of pointers in the sql worker thread that will be invalidated during the runtime of the server so i need to block the invalidation until the worker thread is finished
05:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmkay I found it. Okay but that would require shutting down and then reconnecting the dbpool i guess.

10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I think you are using the score workers incorrectly like that, you need to copy all the data that the worker use into the `ISqlData` to avoid synchronizing access to server variables

15:14 < bridge> <Tyrone> WHERE IS THIS GAMEMODE
15:15 < bridge> <matodor> keywords for search: flatcity, ALPHA, tee.community
15:15 < bridge> <Tyrone> & Does it take REAL MONEY
15:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> pls let me gamble
15:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> ( im not addicted )
15:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> sorry for offtopic jupstar
15:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> I think there might be an issue with 0.7 directed server messages that target a specific client id, might be that client id and target id are incorrectly swapped
15:16 < bridge> <matodor> no, but you will have to work in the mine :greenthing:
15:16 < bridge> <Tyrone> :brownbear:
15:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> tho, cannot find the code where that is happening
15:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, generated code looks ok..
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, if that was broken in general it wouldn't work
15:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> is there an rcon command to talk to individuals through server messages?
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think so
15:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> playing around with the Go client which seems to be detected as weird client version and then gets that "Do you know someone who uses a bot? Please report them to the moderators." message sent to it directly.
15:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> but Target is -1 and ClientId is 3
15:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> which seems weird
15:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be a Go client issue, dunno. The client does receive the message.
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> found why that message is weird. it is being sent from an empty client id: 
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> {
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>     int Empty = -1;
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>     for(int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>     {
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>         if(Server()->ClientSlotEmpty(i))
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>         {
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>             Empty = i;
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>             break;
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>         }
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>     }
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13>     CNetMsg_Sv_Chat Msg;
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13>     Msg.m_Team = 0;
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13>     Msg.m_ClientId = Empty;
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13>     Msg.m_pMessage = "Do you know someone who uses a bot? Please report them to the moderators.";
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13>     m_apPlayers[ClientId]->m_EligibleForFinishCheck = time_get();
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13>     Server()->SendPackMsg(&Msg, MSGFLAG_VITAL | MSGFLAG_NORECORD, ClientId);
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> }
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
16:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> some weird attempt to crash bot clients that are badly implemented or what's the reasoning here?
16:23 < bridge> <fluffysnaff> maybe like this
16:23 < bridge> <robyt3> It triggers some old bot to trigger this check: https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1277691882222387240
16:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> I cannot follow
16:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> D:
16:26 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably the bot detects any chat messages containing a specific word, like "bot", and responds with its own message
16:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> ok. so it needs to come from a non -1 client id, then
16:27 < bridge> <robyt3> probably yeah
16:28 < bridge> <robyt3> but that code can probably be removed or it could be moved in a separate sample open-source antibot module
16:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> can a client actively tell the server that it is a bot?
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's a weird question, you can include a custom versioning
16:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> I see the not eligible for finish stuff.
16:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> might make sense to actively tell the server not to save the times or something along the lines
16:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> but that's a super edge case
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you have control over the server make it a chat cmd or smth
16:34 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think we have support for that or want to support it
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But most servers dont allow cheats
16:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> ok
16:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta host your own server for those funny TAS runs, then
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that anyway
16:48 < bridge> <notzxpixty> where can i find lines with cl_** ?

17:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want a list of all settings? https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=ddnet%20client%20settings
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> We've requested a couple TAS client developers to include a self-identifying message just in case their clients leak. As far as I know none do yet
17:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> üò¶
17:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1284176906140389499/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-13_um_17.39.56.png?ex=66e5ae71&is=66e45cf1&hm=c78827999e930dce946aa41ee0d408e25a34b32d1167a62a82cde8cb7be5fec2&
17:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> there actually are client settings
17:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> first entry
17:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> end of page
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> If I were to develop a replay client for TAS I'd embed a secret signal directly in the high frequency component of the input recording
17:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I get client settings as first result weird
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> Just incase any of the recordings end up with the wrong people. It'd be extremely annoying to get rid of. Fairly easy to detect with an autocorrelation
17:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought DuckDuckGo was consistent
17:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> thought the don't steal m ypersonal data for advertising
17:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> they
17:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> you mean like good old ps1/2 times, where you had to press left right, triangle, etc. you will add some random sequences of inputs?
17:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> that can be found again
17:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs more a theoretical thing as far as I know. Or do they actually work?
17:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> been recording since I started hosting 0.7 servers
17:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> half a TB of data, I guess ._.
17:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> they work perfetly fine and I highly suggest you enable them for the gctf league servers \:D
17:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> perfectly
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's ok chiller, just revert 0.7 and i'll forgive you
17:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well how do I pass a function pointer that is gametype specific then? For custom database layouts per gametype.
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> Random very high frequency patterns that can be found again inside teehistorian files relatively cheaply
17:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> hmhm
18:14 < bridge> <notzxpixty> any help?
18:17 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Addnet%2Fddnet%20cl_overlay_entities&type=code>
18:35 < bridge> <zhn> @iamhardliner
18:39 < bridge> <iamhardliner> I still haven't extended it to teehistorian files
18:39 < bridge> <iamhardliner> just demos xD
18:39 < bridge> <iamhardliner> just demos üòÑ
18:43 < bridge> <zhn> its time to!
18:52 < bridge> <iamhardliner> I know
18:52 < bridge> <iamhardliner> sadly motivation is at -5
18:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> -5 sounds pretty high
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> He doesn't need to implement my paranoid solution, but if he is doing TAS I'd really appreciate him sending an indentifying netmsg
19:31 < bridge> <teero777> u32 hehe
19:31 < bridge> <teero777> Wrap around!!
20:27 < bridge> <iamhardliner> Yeah, had a motivational boost
20:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> p√∂rfect
20:54 < bridge> <qiworzzz> what is the lvl on the ds server?
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are you sure you talk about ddrace?
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe #questions is a better place, and maybe ask the question a bit more extensive
21:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you have some resources about type checking, preferably with examples for brainless idiots
21:18 < bridge> <zhn> hes doing something tas-unlike
21:33 < bridge> <swarfey> I guess you can use https://raw.githack.com for that
21:34 < bridge> <swarfey> raw.githubusercontent.com has a limit of 1mb i believe. i use raw.githack for my https download
21:34 < bridge> <swarfey> raw.githubusercontent.com has a limit of 1mb i believe. i use raw.githack for https download on my server too
21:36 < bridge> <matodor> nice, thank you very much, I'll try
22:02 < bridge> <iamhardliner> might as well just link it https://github.com/hardliner66/tw_demo_analyzer üòÑ
22:02 < bridge> <iamhardliner> It has no readme, but in short I thought it would be cool to analyze inputs from demos, kinda like people did for trackmania to see if people have weird inputs. Support for teehistorian files is planned, but if someone wants to contribute, you're more than welcome
23:13 < bridge> <learath2> Nope

23:52 < bridge> <stormaxd> :Bloonge:
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> does your client write to settings_ddnet or its own cfg?
23:54 < bridge> <stormaxd> own
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> is sc not short for storma client üòÖ
23:55 < bridge> <Ewan> is sc_ not short for storma client üòÖ
23:56 < bridge> <stormaxd> it actually is
23:56 < bridge> <stormaxd> wait
23:56 < bridge> <stormaxd> :Susge:
23:56 < bridge> <stormaxd> ok that's weird
23:56 < bridge> <stormaxd> i've build different client
23:56 < bridge> <Ewan> did u change the config file name in your client code?
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ~/.local/share/DDNet is system wide configs
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ~/.local/share/ddnet is system wide configs
23:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and it‚Äôs preferred that you put settings there instead of your binary dir because that dir is often unwritable by the user
