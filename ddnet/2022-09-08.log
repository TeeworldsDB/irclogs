00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is there an indicator for if you're against a wall?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Like, if you're rather on normal ground, against a left wall or against a right wall?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't think so, maybe you can look on the physic code that handles wall jump ?

01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> very ironic how we're going back to ➡️
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> very ironic how we're going back to ➡️ by the way.
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> just my main thing to focus on is making the weapon look *good* in afk states
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> because currently it clips into the ground
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017213266763731037/unknown.png
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also for this update I won't add a sleeping particle. Maybe another time.
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I like the gun position a lot more
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> feet still a bit too far to the side imo
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its the exact same pos as when you're not afk
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but the back foot goes all the way from the back to in front of the other foot
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they should be more or less aligned imo so you can see just a bit of the back foot's toe poking out
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> alrighty. i'll do that after i eat supper
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Ravie

02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> perfect
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ye that's a lot better
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe adjust the feet just a little big so the outlines don't merge into one huge one
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> bit*
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh yea
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, other weapons than hammer dont go to the back anymore?
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Nah. Transitioning from AFK to normal is a bit jank like that

08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> half rushed blog post using nom i had lying around
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel could you show how weapons look like now
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh right one second
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im kind of not liking how they look right now, since they're pointing into the ground, but ravie said he liked it.
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I would probably leave them how they are, or put them on the back
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I only suggested this thing for the hammer xd
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not all weapons, cuz tbh its not very fitting i think
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017346432308613180/unknown.png
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least if its gonna be this, then we can better leave weapons how they are
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What if you look up?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017346570305421382/unknown.png
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it's bidirectional too
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah but no, this doesnt look right at all.
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (and the transition would also not be smooth, your argument)
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Better leave it on the back.
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> maybe you can make the legs' position be vertically flat, if you're not near wall
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'll keep hammer like this
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017347223949938698/unknown.png
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, hammer is something different.
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but, i would also have to find a good placement for every weapon
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why? Only for gun, maybe
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the other 3 looked fine

11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL about `env -S`
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a new-ish feature that lets you pass arguments in shebang lines
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `#!/usr/bin/env -S python -O`
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wasn't it always the case? I know i have some scripts with `#!/bin/bash -ex`
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I remember you working on some proxy code, how complete was that?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4791
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can only pass one parameter like that, and if you want to use /usr/bin/env (and you should), you could pass 0
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this might be our only hope at making this game playable again
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the proxy works IIRC, but it's a dumb proxy right now
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it forwards the DoS to the origin
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I got stuck because I needed to implement protocol-specific stuff
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which I didn't like ^^
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds un-fun indeed

11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk why im laughing at this, this whole wip proxy thing could save ddnet
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> DoS attacks particularly bad right now?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah seems some of them picked up their welfare payments or their parents increased their allowance
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> urgh
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Special events are basically impossible and long team 0 maps are pretty much not finishable
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> other thing, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5599#issuecomment-1240413404
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you know what the quoting rules for CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS are?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably ad-hoc and whatever fell out of the "I forgot to quote arguments"?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea. I'm horrible with quoting rules of shells
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without knowing how many times something will be evaluated it's genuinely hard to know how many pairs of double quotes to put
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Did someone say shell quotes?
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8djxld pw: 1234
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You changed it so that the walking animation also the feet flip
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If we would do that also in all other states the feet should flip. Else it looks real strange if you start walking aiming to the left. 
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I see alternatives to this:
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> - Flipping only in afk state.
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> - Flipping not in walking but only in running and afk, but that would still be a strange transition from walking to running
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> - Handle Flipping in the player logic and not in render.cpp and use vel.x as indicator for the feet direction. (vel.x keeps the last direction you moved with 1 and -1) and flip it in all states
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If we would flip the feet also on walking I would prefer 3. alternative. I think the feet should not be connected to the aim but to the walk direction.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Also I think the new weapon position is strange :/ you should defnitly handle hammer diffrent from the other weapons
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So it's official that I should have weapons on back, but hammer as it currently is?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> No we better wait for @Ravie  feedback
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> True
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you walked against a wall vel.x is 0
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you want to detect collisions you can do it. But do you really need it?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you want to detect collisions you can do it. But do you really need it?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I did the same to make the jump indicator display
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you want to detect collisions you can do it. But do you really need it?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I did the same to make the jump indicator display (only for the floor)
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But my collision detection will maybe get deleted again with my next update (not completely sure) xD
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i decides against it, dont worry
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i decided against it, dont worry
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki what do u think about deno?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://deno.land/
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Good
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But i prefer if it was v8 itself in rust
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw deno is made by the nodejs author
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: you can also help me if you know the answer of where to find it
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Yeah saw that
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @c0d3d3v @Voxel I like the gun position, guns on the back look totally wrong
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also flipping feet only while sitting is probably the best solution
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I wouldn't mess with the walk animation at all
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I liked the running animation, it gives you a good indication that you'll slide slowing down
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also like the gun on back; this is e.g. where your gun is in cs:go when it's not in use
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but I'm not fixated on the gun being on the back, somewhere else is also fine. I just wanted to show that not everyone thinks the gun on the back looks bad)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not as wrong as weapon being in the floor, especially if you look up lol
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> weapons in the floor are nothing new in tw
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> even the default spec position has the gun in the floor
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it doesnt look good if you look somewhere else
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats just a bug, and is only shown that way for yourself
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in afk state eye pos should be fixed so only either left or right
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still it isnt the direction the weapon is going
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then tbh, we can also just leave the weapon untouched
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and only do the sitting
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think that wouldnt even look bad
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it looks good to me, he let his weapon hang behind the platform
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that was also the first approach i think, i just threw in we can put the weapon on the back, which first turned out to be nice
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there we are, arguing about personal opinions again
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> useless
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> on the back looks like just some random made up position that makes no sense to me
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is basically the same
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel can you make a version where the weapon renders as before, and only the tee is sitting? i think that will look the best. and this way it will also be consistent, because players who keep shooting have that behaviour anyways
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This looks wrong.
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also where guns are when they're not being used in some video games
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but tees don't really have a back, it just looks weird when the gun is at a random angle somewhere
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what if you quote only the part after `=` ?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i beg to disagree
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/846815559408549888.webp?size=44&quality=lossless
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, someone already posted a vote. seems like most people (in that random vote) liked the back position better
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Chairn ah now I know how they are holding the guns on their backs
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might actually work by accident ^^
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://tenor.com/YT4n.gif
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it might change how it is parsed after first "escape"
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you pass `--option="abc"`, the program sees `--option=abc`
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same if you pass `"--option=abc"`
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but you said there were multiple round
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but you said there were multiple rounds
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> otherwise, just random number of ̀`\` can work ?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if the quotes are moved behind the =, due to unequal number of unquotings, the program will see `--option=abc` in one case and `--option="abc"` in the other case
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `--option="abc"` is wrong, but at least not an invalid option, so it'd work
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> more detailed view
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1017412193353994281/unknown.png
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> exactly
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's not wrong imo if there's a shell call in between 🙂
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm saying the programm will get `--option="abc"`
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when it should get `--option=abc`
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it gets passed the wrong data
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (after all shell expansion)
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (yes, if there's a shell expansion in between, the program will get `--option=abc` in both cases, which would be correct)
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not necessarily if the call is shelled once more than expected:
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sh -c "sh -c \"program --option=\"abc\"\""
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> --> sh -c "program --option=abc"
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> --> program --option=abc
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> given you call cmake, i'd expect more shell expansion than just one
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in this case, I know how often it's shell expanded
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in cmake once
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the other program not at all
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe there's a smart way by alternating double quote and single quote?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> adds some backslashes and you're good for a head ache 😄
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so cmake shell expands, this means that special characters (and spaces, but we don't have those) need to be quoted
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the other program only splits by ascii whitespace, not interpreting any characters
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so given that the wanted parameter contains something like `{a,b,c}`, which is interpreted by shell expansion
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see a way to make it work with both programs simultaneously, without passing different data to each
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can't quote stuff; it'd get interpreted literally by the other program
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how about environment variables ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can't backslash-escape stuff; it'd get interpreted literally by the other program
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can't not quote or backslash-escape stuff, it'd get interpreted by cmake
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these are environment variables, not sure what you mean by that ^^
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like you protect first `$` and the resulting `$somevar` is expanded to what you want next round
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but there's only one round?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's only one round in cmake
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and no round in the other program
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> only solution i see is to pass it through a file 😄
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I reported a bug to the other program)
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs/issues/719
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe some shell redirection? `program <(echo abcd)` ?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the second program interprets it literally
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'd pass `<(echo abcd)` like this
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you change the call to second program through cmake?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both programs take data from this environment variable. my current solution is to unset it (or set it to the format the program expects) before calling the second program
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> calling the program through cmake wouldn't change anything; both cmake and the program evaluate the environment variable; but neither changes it
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so even if I call one through the other, the interpretations would still be the same
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (anyway, I don't think there's a solution anymore. I reported a bug and I think I found a workaround (don't pass CXXFLAGS to the separate program), so this should be fine)

18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yea, I'll try to edit gun position too so pistol isn't hidden
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> old computer or bad latex?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> overleaf.com did also struggle with my bachelor thesis with 90+pages ... I had to get one of the premium options xD but I got it for free for one month and stopped the subscription then. If I now open my theses there it can not be compiled because it takes to long 😄
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rewrite latex in rust
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Rewrite rust in latex
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Possible
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Latex is turing complete iirc
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> take a piece of rusty metal and cover it with latex fabric..
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw the queen is dead
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rip
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the queen isnt dying, shes just being immortal in a different plane of reality
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the last breath of uk monarchy
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> have you the news article to this? German media still only states she is very ill...
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bbc guy is with black tie
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Eyc
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Etc
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They waiting on family to arrive
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Everyone is sure she dead
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only believe in wikipedia
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> she is still alive there xD
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Videos
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> She was in the ICU
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> She is a deep frozen tee rn
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im sure
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> In german news they say the Death message is not true... she is still alive
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fake news
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :kek:
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> just take a hammer and swing it at her ripcage, that'll unfreeze her :troll:
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> just take a hammer and swing it at her ribcage, that'll unfreeze her :troll:
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I hope that after her death the royal house will dissolve and there will be no more representative monarchy. But as stupid as the English are, this will not happen.
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i could still imagine the public will loose more interest in it tho
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the queen was the last special connection to the royal family, as she is pretty popular
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> file itself compiles within 30 seconds after first run
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> It's just that i externalized all figures so each takes 10 seconds to compile and i have a lot
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chairn computer compiles ddnet in 4 minutes
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can just call external program from latex, problem solved :troll:
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki btw we getting closer

19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Voxel  I notices on other teams you see through the tee so you can see the weapon behind him in AFK state... you could use that to find a good spot 😉
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn now yes
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true

20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> @ReiTW Can you comment on #4170 if you know a way or specific servers to reproduce the issue?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4170
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Volvicc> closer to what?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> closer to alpha v2561650
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then comes beta
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Volvicc> ah haha :D
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best engine incoming
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Who was involved again in bugs with a lot of particle or laser doors and stuff?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> the last problem was that the client lagged when you zoomed out on some maps. maybe fixing the other problems made this problem more noticeable
