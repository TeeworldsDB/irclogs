01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't expect spectre-related bugs in DDNet üòÑ
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think it's actually the mitigation by OS
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> or it's causes by some other combination of hardware and the nanosecond change that's unrelated to spectre
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> or it's caused by some other combination of hardware and the nanosecond change that's unrelated to spectre
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could disable the spectre mitigations and see if that's the issue
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> you can't disable them on AMD
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> not easily atleast
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I'll try to find someone with on intel who can test it
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I dunno. It's more likely there are rounding issues i think
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it hard to believe its spectre
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Would destroy all usefulness of any time measurement xd
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.7 does what?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the error function only returns true if it could not unpack the ints before... that should not happen.
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we ban tune zone messages for new maps?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're not localizable
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Maps should indeed make it clear what a tunezone does without to have to look into the chat. 
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Material layer could help in this situation by adding context to the entities. But the mapper would still have to help the players in the tile/quad layer.
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I theory they could be made localizable xD but would require a lot of work.
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it'd be on the mapper to provide the translations
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Not if we would lazy load translation
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please explain
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but to much work, for something that should be explained in the tile layer
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> with illustations
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or something
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> that you do not have to read
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> making tuning msg translations separate from the map, (could also in theory include game menu translations, but that would add extra complexity). And load them into the client on request.
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see how this improves upon storing them in the map
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> simpler version would be to localize messages for the new material layer. And force new maps to use standard materials from material layers, and only tune layer if really needed
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> This would require the materials wanted by the tune layer to be present, also even if you have a tune layer with the same tuning values as a material, they might have slightly different physics on the edges
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ^this
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> lets add a translator :greenthing:
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> automatic translation doesn't really work well, if that's what you're talking about
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> they never work well üòÑ
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> How to pay a few Indians for real-time translations.

13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> Hi tees!
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> I've switched to new ISP and now I can't connect to KoG servers. It thinks I use vpn. Any idea how to get out of this blacklist?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> image.png
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986228121671987200/image.png
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, use a vpn that is not detected
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> üòÜ I don't want to use vpn
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check out their discord
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't have influence over their servers (or their vpn detection)
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPiRiT> Oh, ok I'll try to reach them. Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I have a question: If you add a sound, does the netcode change? Because I know that files are generated and Some of them are only client sided
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> some sounds are generated through events emitted by the server, others are generated in the client. Depends on the event for that you want the sound
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> some sounds are played on events emitted by the server, others are generated in the client. Depends on the event for that you want the sound
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> and where is this defined? To me it looks like the server can send any sound, even the menu music
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it can send the menu music
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> some servers used that
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> wtf üòÇ
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am pretty sure error() returns true if there are unpacke bits
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> okay I understood it now, might require some refactoring there
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least i thought so
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think so, let's look at the source code?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was just that i worked with this and probably remembered it wrong then
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cuz i added a tuning on the Clientside
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in fclient, the jetpack strength
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And i had some troubles
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> then you had more unpacked then there is data
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's something different, in your case you're reading further than what's in the packed
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's something different, in your case you're reading further than what's in the packet
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye true i get it xd
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sry
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Would it be okay if I refactor this into client sounds? similar to sprites, sounds that are not available in the netcode
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and how would you then play jump sounds?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and how would you then play jump sounds, and all other game sounds?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't quite get what you want to do. you want to have separate server-sent and non-server-sent sounds?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> not all of them, split into client/shared sounds
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what sound do you think is client only, other the menu music?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, I don't want every new introduced material to send their own sound on jump, hook, whatever
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what sound do you think is client only, other then menu music?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Do we predict weapon pickups?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think so
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD yes
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :thonk: are you sure?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats why new shields are buggy in old clients
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I notice quite the delay when picking up weapons
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (with high ping)
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have antiping enabled?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I always play with antiping
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> auto pickup is not predictes nor serversided
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> auto pickup is not predicted nor serversided
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah, yeah auto pickup, thats what I meant
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, interesting question on how to deal with that
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> why not :/ I see no problem with that.
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> chat_server, chat_client, chat_highlight, and all sounds that are not send by the server, Ibwould need to check tho
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> chat_server, chat_client, chat_highlight, and all sounds that are not send by the server, I would need to check tho
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> alternativlly we could predict events and play sound and effects in client. But I do not think that would be good,
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Would be enough for the server to send hook@pos and the client to find out the sound
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this is actually how it's handled rn
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> We also have a problem here again with old clients xD they will not have the sounds of new materials.
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> exactly
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you mean hook@pos? does it not differ between player hook, unhookable-tile hook hookable-tile hook?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I just noticed, that hook sounds are played from the player pos
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you mean hook@pos? does it not differ between player hook, unhookable-tile hook, hookable-tile hook?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> they would have bigger problems with new physics üôà
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> guess that's the easiest solution ü§î
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> Is it possible to change save folder of .demo?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can have the entire config directory in another location by removing `add_path $USERDIR` in storage.cfg and adding a different path there. But I haven't tried it. Alternatively maybe you can do a symbolic link on Windows so that the demo directory links to another directory
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> thx!
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you figure out a way that actually works, maybe write a small tutorial and put it on ddnet forum or steam workshop. With the size of demos I can imagine more people have this problem
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Does someone know what CFlow is? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/flow.cpp
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> In DDNet it is seems to be an unused class
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use git blame to find out
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or rather `tig blame` or the github UI)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess it is used to display lines where players and particles moved along.
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But we removed the rendering of it
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> it was supposed to be a fluid physics simulation for particle effects
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the main problem is that the game doesn't have particle effect that last for more than half a second
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2437
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 can you pr your changes üòÑ
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ones in the skin thing @Not Keks?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks ^^
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ty
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks could you maybe let them upload UHD and non-UHD in one request?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does php provide a good PNG resizer?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> as good as gimp
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with anti aliasing etc.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then yes üòÑ
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or u mean upload two images?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you have access to imagemagick in PHP, but I meant upload two images
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the add popup should stay active after uploading one skin, so u just need to set the new skin and check is uhd D:
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah maybe someday
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> QOL
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you also have access to gd which has aa for scaling and stuff iirc, though gmagick/imagemagick probably also do
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok good to know üòÑ

18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think it broke again
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I might have made a typo there
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis that should fix it
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> üëç
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is glowfox in normal tho
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before u add them all, is that intended?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i forgot to
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd change that thing
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can just upload them agian it should automatically remove them from normal
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh it woudl be nice to be able to change from normal to community and back with the change button
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont need to delete them
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i didnt add that bcs it needs to mirror the skins
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here are SVG versions for them, made by @mind btw

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> since we calculate the vector field anyway we could also add it to the smoke trail already ^^ but think to particle emitters would make more sense

19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you have to change the top left snow flake, in extra.png. If you have decided for one you can send me a png with only that snow flake (but also in 512x512)

20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah annoying, my file browser and vscode use different sorting
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats why I did not use vscode ordering for that xD but turned brain off ^^
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or change the cmake setting to correspond to vscode one, might be easier for most people to do this automatically
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon sent u a mod üòõ
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is vscode uses locale-specific sort, idk if that's available in cmake
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides the order would change by locale, idk how we'd handle that üòõ
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or just tell exactly what ordering is wrong for the cmake file, bcs potatos like me read it xd
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or we find out how to change the sorting alg in vs-code
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a sorting plugin that doesn't seem to use locale-specific sorting
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/1536773220560429058
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 thanks arrived
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 do u have a webkit browser installed?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks I do but I don't have access to it rn as its on linux and I'm booted to windows
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on windows u have edge xd
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway:
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> go on skindatabase, sort after "UHD" with webkit and firefox
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why the fuck is there a different result
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how is smth so simple not well defined?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i used Array.sort
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's probably spidermonkey vs v8 but either way, I'd think array.sort was well defined by the ecmascript spec
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you show an example of the difference?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well firefox shows me UHD "yes" on top
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chrome doesnt do this
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> an i have to say i'd expect what firefox does
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i have to say i'd expect what firefox does
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh wait I do have chrome on here
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sorting up also works on chrome
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its weird af xd
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aha, it doesn't work at all actually, let me investigate
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just dont understand how this can behave different xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> firefox seems to do the opposite of chrome
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still really weird that this isnt well defined
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chrome doesn't sort at all for me
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I don't think that's quite right
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it does, but only in the wrong direction
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yesterday we talked about spectre
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today i present you hertzbleed
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.hertzbleed.com/
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31743110
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u sort "up", the last element is "yes"
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its just the opposite of firefox üòÑ
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Hertzbleed takes advantage of our experiments showing that, under certain circumstances, the dynamic frequency scaling of modern x86 processors depends on the data being processed. This means that, on modern processors, the same program can run at a different CPU frequency (and therefore take a different wall time) when computing, for example, 2022 + 23823 compared to 2022 + 24436.
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Hertzbleed is a real, and practical, threat to the security of cryptographic software. We have demonstrated how a clever attacker can use a novel chosen-ciphertext attack against SIKE to perform full key extraction via remote timing, despite SIKE being implemented as ‚Äúconstant time‚Äù.
20:52 <+ChillerDragon> SIKE
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > SIKE (Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation) is a decade old, widely studied key encapsulation mechanism. It is currently a finalist in NIST‚Äôs Post-Quantum Cryptography competition. It has multiple industrial implementations and was the subject of an in-the-wild deployment experiment. Among its claimed advantages are a ‚Äúwell-understood‚Äù side channel posture. You can find author names, implementations, talks, studies, articles, sec
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks I have a feeling your compare function is failing to satisfy a requirement
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its broken, even tho i dont really understand why, but still funny how the browsers behave differently
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is really wrong xD
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's not wrong per se, given the spec says `The sort order is implementation-defined if SortCompare is not a consistent comparator for the elements of items.`
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does consistent mean?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should i simply not use a => function?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986344143775207424/unknown.png
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling you are breaking one of these rules, but not sure which yet
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> coding is too hard
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can I suggest something?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about just turning the uhd values into integers and comparing them?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. `Skin1.uhd - Skin2.uhd`?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> multiply the entire thing by -1 if the order is to be reversed
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That I thiiink has to be a consistent comparator
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> epic
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah makes more sense, tru
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully it works ü§û
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> merge then we knopw
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> works üëç
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 10/10
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ECMAScript spec is pretty handy to have at hand when messing around with js, browsers do seem to comply pretty well and the decades of compatibility they try to maintain only makes things very unintuitive
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sort of like coding in C now that I think about it üòÑ
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im too lazy to look smth up xd
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but in this case it was just stupidy anyway
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I took one look at your comparator and it looked sus to me üòõ
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it was sus af xD
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but didnt think about such any easy solution xD
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> put here somewhere my points and rank
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986350539669401600/unknown.png
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Not Keks what is "template skin" supposed to be in skin upload?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wasnt it u that requested it? XD
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at least this sounded like it
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I requested a link to the svg template and wiki tutorial when it's finished xD
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess requirements are already in #üìåinfo
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but could still say how to upload
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can also just add a template skin there
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but the template is not a png
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but does that matter?, they can just download it, but yeah discord has no svg preview
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> kinda sucks xd
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there doesn't need to be a preview of it
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i can remove template again,
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we can also add SVG support, like UHD
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then we dont loose them
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's no need for that imo, the only svg needed is the base for a tee to start working on
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I can make a nice one with guides and stuff and then we link it there and any other skin making resources that there may be
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> svg is future ready üòÑ
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 10 years 8k might be standard
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> please no
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what speaks against 8k
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> me :troll:
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u dislike higher quality or what XD
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's not higher quality
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> at some point where you can't easily see pixels with the naked eye it's just a pain to work with and nothing else
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont mean 8kx4k, i mean skins for 8k skins
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont mean 8kx4k, i mean skins for 8k screens
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But I guess thats why u use vector graphics? XD
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so you dont have to care about pixels
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's more about workflow than the format itself
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with 8k or 16k anti aliasing will die üòÑ
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> most of the time I pick a resolution at the start of a project and at the end I only export it at that resolution
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well anyway, im really used to 512x256 skins now, and i find normal ones really blurry
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since i also have 2k screen
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah 512x256 is just perfect for skins
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2k = 1920x1080?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats full hd
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2k is usually used for wqhd which is 2556x1440
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2k is usually used for wqhd which is 2560x1440
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about 4k
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 4k = full hd * 4
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (3840x2160)
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whats the most
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's called 4k because 3840 ‚âà 4000
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> possible
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> these numbers dont really make sense
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Test it on a local server, on official server you will still get ninja as weapon. So you get both particles.
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can then also test how you like it if you still have a weapon in your hand if you are frozen.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can then also test how you like it if you still have a weapon (other then sword) in your hand if you are frozen.
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> no, its not intended to be. read this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4855
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> if you have multiple items with the same value their order is implementation defined
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> just starred the ddnet-maps repo. thats so awesome to play dummy maps without ping. i even have an idea. play maps locally and sync with other people playing the same map. so you would just see them, like seeing other teams. +demo hub/upload for rank/finish verification on local server üòÖ üòÖ üòÖ ah, forget what i sa
