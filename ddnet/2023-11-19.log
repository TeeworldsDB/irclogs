09:44 < bridge> <deen> thanks a lot!
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks What is `benchmark_quit` used for? I like to change it so the file is written to the `dumps` folder in the config dir instead of being an absolute path. I also think it would be easier to use as a CSV file, so instead of printing `Frametime %d us` to each line I would only print `%d` so it can be used as a number.
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it used for the benchmark suite
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/ddnet
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the format was done on purpose
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but deen did it, better ask him

12:15 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why do i have to make a new group to change the position of layers
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> someone ran into the same issue when mergin ddnet? in demo.cpp there's 
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if(io_read(File, pDemoHeader, sizeof(CDemoHeader)) != sizeof(CDemoHeader) || !pDemoHeader->Valid())
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> which screams at me that there's no member named 'valid' (couldnt find it aswell)
13:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> my problem is that i only ever changed server-side, so i never touched demo.cpp or anything related to it.
13:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you are missing some changes that added the `CDemoHeader::Valid` function in `src/engine/demo.h`
13:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> that would be weird, i merged, accepting all incoming ```git merge DDNet/master --strategy-option theirs```
13:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but i'll take a look, thanks
13:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Why not use the default merging strategy and solve conflicts manually? You are throwing away arbitrary changes with `theirs` strategy.
13:14 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i tried doing it manually, but even then the error happened (with even more happening on the ```src/engine/client/backend/*``` stuff for some reason
13:15 < bridge> <robyt3> If our changes cause compile errors in your new code then you also need to fix that, throwing your code away in case of conflicts seems suboptimal
13:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> true - thanks tho!

14:01 < ChillerDragon> Does anyone have xp with bug bounties?
14:11 < bridge> <Iza> why is there neither a ddnet filter nor an official checkmark in the server browser now
14:11 < bridge> <Iza> on the latest nightly
14:12 < bridge> <Iza> i really do hope this is just a bug or something
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> bug
14:24 < bridge> <chairn> @heinrich5991 isn't there a risk since merging #6256 to have uninitialized vec2 somewhere  ?
14:24 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6256
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Ooh, I missed the merge of #7325 while I was away. That's exciting
14:36 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7325
14:38 < bridge> <learath2> I predict this one will cause the long awaiting fork
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so we all wait that ddnet kills itself, or what?
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ddnet killing itself is not in my expectations at all, so no, I'm not waiting for that
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is so horrible about the idea to ask the community first?
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all guys here always say its a community game
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but whenever you and deen have an idea you go all ego
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean asking the community would probably prevent vulkan, too. showing that not in all questions, the community's opinion is best
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> Kill itself? No I expect a couple people to go off on a fork because they are pissed, then it'll be maintained for a while, then they'll get bored of it and disappear or they'll change their mind and come back
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well a huge majority
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet 75% of the community likes more FPS
14:54 < ChillerDragon> do we have stats?
14:54 < ChillerDragon> on community feedback to community browser
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I bet most of the community doesn't care as long as it's stable and reasonably high
14:54 < ChillerDragon> probably hard to get because even asking people if they like it results in random responses
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you agree
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I do not agree
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u always against anything i say
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't object to asking the community as long as you keep it in mind that people that don't care won't show up
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's incorrect
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i say:
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this change will be liked
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you say
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "no i dont like it"
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i understand your way to argument
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not logic based
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you seem to only remember the instances where we disagree
14:56 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 people not caring not showing up is a good think right? So only the people that care have a voice
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u the poor person, that has no chance
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh no
14:56 < ChillerDragon> thing*
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: not really. sometimes there are good changes that are welcomed by the community, but get held up by few
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yet the people who like it won't show up on the discord
14:57 < ChillerDragon> so the people that dont care miss out on stuff they dont care about? :D
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> There is a silent bulk of players that just don't care all that much as long as things aren't broken, then there is a group of people that like any change but will only react with a üëç and disappear (which will always look weaker than the 8 paragraphs that people who don't like it will write)
14:57 < ChillerDragon> ah okay but thats not what i understood from leratos message
14:58 < ChillerDragon> i though everyone who has a opinion might show up and the rest does not
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> Then there is the Chinese community which makes up 50% of this game that everyone that speaks english is completely okay in not even taking the opinions of because they came after the steam release üòÑ
14:59 < ChillerDragon> I am big fan of asking the community and then letting a dictator decide anyways
14:59 < ChillerDragon> So everyone has a chance to give feedback 
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> I'm okay with asking with opinions on it aswell, just need to keep the factors at play in mind when polling for stuff
14:59 < ChillerDragon> Yea you can always overrule poll results
15:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. look at chat tees
15:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd expect the vote to come out as a "no"
15:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you suggested the feature before it was in the client
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> I think it did come out as a "no" and then a config option was added for it as a compromise
15:00 < ChillerDragon> yea that was a intense change
15:01 < ChillerDragon> remember emojis? xd
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how many people still use the config option, some sort of telemetry on configuration would actually be pretty cool
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my problem is rather:
15:01 < ChillerDragon> i think newtee and fokkonaut still play with the old gun position
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the pr i said, we could at least make custom tabs.. i don't really care about the community feature itself. but completely objective, the UI is worse for persons that play: kog, ddnet, fng
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly got ignored, maybe bcs it's too hard. and yes maybe only 25% of the community play these 3 like me and dont need tabs
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then heinrich with his absurf backward compability acts like it would kill ppl, even tho it probably affects less ppl
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i simply dislike the weird argumentations
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i propose useful ideas, fixing it for all ppl's opinions/needs. try to stay logical, describe my problems with the changes... 
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> complete ignore
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> I think my cute ideas for that PR were also ignored üò¶
15:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think a PR to allow people to add tabs by themselves would be accepted
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but for now it's getting worse
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is no hurry to merge this community stuff pr
15:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> üçø
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could aswell wait 6 months and implement all missing features
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now i either use old client or do this PR i dont want to do
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> There is no way custom tabs ever has decent UX for the layman
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> Moving the community filter buttons up top right below the tabs could make it more palatable for people who think the filter ui on the rhs is not friendly
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> Which I do kinda agree with, such an important thing hidden away in a sidebar that most people forget exists isn't really the best idea
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to me filters are smth u rarely change, in any UI
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, depends on the sort of UI, on steam I use filters alot
15:09 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700402971.png
15:09 < ChillerDragon> ``cl_old_gun_position 1`` be like
15:09 < bridge> <murpi> 90% of the community doesn't know what vulkan is, or whether it'll affect their game experience. xd
15:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't stop people from having an opinion ^^
15:11 < bridge> <murpi> It stops people from caring, so your example isn't really a good comparison to a major change like the server browser one
15:12 < bridge> <murpi> (it directly affects all players, the graphics api does not)
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess that makes sense
15:12 < bridge> <chairn> rgpd says hello
15:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean it was probably an insignificant amount of people from the start
15:13 < bridge> <murpi> I'm already used to the new server browser tbh, so it didn't take very long to adjust
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> GDPR doesn't ban all sorts of telemetry outright, as long as we anonymize it properly it should be fine, no?
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ohhhh, that's the french abbreviation?
15:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> üòÑ
15:14 < bridge> <chairn> no idea about that, just saying that if we go into that direction, we need to look into it
15:14 < bridge> <chairn> yeah, RGPD "R√®glement G√©n√©ral sur la Protection des Donn√©es"
15:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> GDPR in english DSGVO in german üòÑ

15:17 < bridge> <vinifoxhd1901> Is there any way to kick out people who use ddos??
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 sometimes it feels you will not accept a no from the community so you just lobby against asking them, making a public announcement, gathering opinions and deciding on that later among active devs is probs better than doing changes blindly and waiting for a reaction
15:18 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700403528.png
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```sh
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> $ rg m_Intersection | cat
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> src/game/server/gameworld.cpp:                pChr->m_Intersection = IntersectPos;
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> src/game/server/entities/character.h:    vec2 m_Intersection;
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks like it
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> it ia objectively better to ask the community and then take that into account when making the decision
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> rather than not doing ao
15:18 < ChillerDragon> why pipe into cat?
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> so
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try without
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> my 5 centa
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> my 5 cents
15:19 < ChillerDragon> interesting
15:19 < ChillerDragon> it gets rid of the interactive mode
15:19 < ChillerDragon> truely minimal
15:19 < ChillerDragon> i like it
15:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> *truly btw
15:19 < ChillerDragon> forgot who the proper term for the pipe environment is called
15:19 < ChillerDragon> not interactive is it?
15:20 < ChillerDragon> how
15:20 < ChillerDragon> omg
15:20 < bridge> <chairn> tty ?
15:20 < ChillerDragon> wanted to say that too
15:20 < ChillerDragon> but that sounds wrong xd
15:21 < ChillerDragon> @chairn burn it with fire
15:21 < ChillerDragon> bloat variable
15:21 < bridge> <chairn> doing it
15:21 < ChillerDragon> pog
15:45 < bridge> <Iza> i also think ddnet needs to consider the opinions of the community more
15:45 < bridge> <Iza> referring to jupstar
15:46 < bridge> <Iza> at least with ui stuff
15:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> could someone take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7501 and merge it if it's okay?
15:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd like to deploy an antibot update, but this would require another one, so I'd like to do both in one
17:05 < ChillerDragon> TIL watching memory in gdb is super nice for detecting UB
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome in 1990
17:06 < ChillerDragon> :c
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but pro
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not ez to detect it reading memory xd
17:06 < ChillerDragon> you can use ``rwatch`` to break everytime memory is accessed
17:07 < ChillerDragon> it broke twice on my debug prints
17:07 < ChillerDragon> and the third time was in score.cpp which should not access my variable
17:07 < ChillerDragon> ez
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u run it in production?
17:07 < ChillerDragon> nono locally
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not simply use sanitizers then xD
17:08 < ChillerDragon> actually i went with sanitziers first they also got the issue instantly xd
17:08 < ChillerDragon> but with gdb i felt more under control
17:08 < ChillerDragon> and verified that the asan stuff was not just a warning or unrelated
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
17:08 < ChillerDragon> but yeah asan is super pog
17:09 < ChillerDragon> but i will for sure keep using gdb to watch variables
17:09 < ChillerDragon> so nice to see every place a variable is access
17:09 < ChillerDragon> ed
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's funny
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my brain actually:
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "ryo: with rust u wouldn't need asan"
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instantly when u said it's pog
17:09 < ChillerDragon> xd
