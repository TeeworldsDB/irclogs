06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> about freezejumps: I once did a 2-freeze-high freeze ground jump :D Skipped the top freeze and perfectly the second one in the right tick to jump :)

11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: **suggesting**:ddnet: 
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> make it the design hook when you hook someone work in same place not just in middle Tee

11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tees have a magnet in their mid
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it makes sense
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> no they not have:banhammer:  so it's not sense
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can  you proof it?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hook in edge, hard if they have magnet
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> supposed be easy
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> wait i got a prove video
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDr_DXznlIM
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> xd
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> weak magnet
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only around their hitbox xd
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> lmao XD
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i have magnet inside me too but you can take my hand not mid :_:
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the peak of the hook is magnetic, your hand is not
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :nouis: :signs:
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i will go cook breakfast to my lunchüëã
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis\: i rebased the tick stuff now, there might be bugs with particles and other effectsThe physics will feel similar to the real tw physics.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Remarkable are\:
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚óè 1 Tile Gores techniques are MUCH easier. I am not sure if that comes from the simple fact that hooks are just checked more often(bcs more ticks) or if thats already a floating point rounding thing
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚óè I also fixed the cursor in this commit, so enable the hookline and do a 360¬∞ cursor rotation will feel amazing(one of the few physics changes i'd love to see in teeworlds upstream)

12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> However, this is a completly different game, bcs as said, tw physics are mathematically not possible to 100% convert to higher tick rate
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Shyzo\: you were also interested in this

13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a nuclear bomb yields 1 megaton by comparision
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok its 6 megatons
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cool, i will check it out later

17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Hiroshima was 15kt, but Tsar Bomba was more than 50Mt, so depends on the bomb size
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> suggestion: add map tile and feature no speczone. it acts like the end of the map and u cant go further. it will prevent very big emptiness with spec in some (future) maps. it also may lead the camera better through the game
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> You are proposing non squared maps? ü§î
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> yes, as an optional feature
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Zoom out will break.
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> How do you move from one zone to another?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> We could  add a menu to reach tele entity in spec mode
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i dont get the point of this. You just want to limit where people can spec?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> yes
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> im not sure. maybe you tele to the next free position with camera. or maybe caught ?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i would caught the camera tbh and only swap when tee gets teled
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> so it feels like 2+ maps
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> should be disabled by setting or "entities on"
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Á∂†Ë±Ü-green bean> @everyone who will catch this gift?)
