13:03 <@heinrich5991> deen: I altered tables on ddnet.tw but it hasn't replicated to ger
13:09 <@heinrich5991> I don't find logs or antything, maybe I should have checked first
13:09 <+Learath2> there should be binlogs somewhere
13:10 <@heinrich5991> nothing in systemd logs if you mean that
13:10 <+Learath2> no actual relay ogs in mysql bin format
13:10 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: how to check that?
13:12 <+Learath2> they should be in /var/lib/mysql
13:13 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: do you know the replication strategy?
13:13 <@heinrich5991> i.e. where do I have to look? ddnet.tw or ger.ddnet.tw?
13:13 <@heinrich5991> or is it on both?
13:13 <+Learath2> not really
13:17 <+Learath2> the ALTER TABLE shows up on neither
13:18 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: not even on ddnet.tw?
13:18 <+Learath2> not on the relay logs n
13:18 <@heinrich5991> so what do I do?
13:19 <@heinrich5991> and how do I access the relay logs?
13:19 <@heinrich5991> and do you know more credentials?
13:19 <@heinrich5991> > SHOW SLAVE STATUS;
13:19 <@heinrich5991> ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER, REPLICATION CLIENT privilege(s) for this operation
13:20 <+Learath2> mysqlbinlog --no-defaults file
13:20 <+Learath2> use root
13:22 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: shall I just issue the ALTER TABLE on all machines?
13:22 <@heinrich5991> would that fix stuff?
13:22 <@heinrich5991> or would it make things worse :P
13:24 <+Learath2> I don't get our replication strategy
13:24 <+Learath2> it looks more like a chain then a tree :P
13:24 <+Learath2> Last_Error: Error 'Got error 64 'Temp file write failure' from InnoDB' on query. Default database: 'teeworlds'. Query: 'ALTER TABLE record_race ADD COLUMN GameID VARCHAR(64) AFTER cp25
13:25 <+Learath2> that's on CAN
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
13:25 <+Learath2> actually on USA
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm applying it manually to GER now, let's see if I can replicate a record from GER to ddnet.tw then
13:28 <+Learath2> inb4 it adds 2 columns
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does somebody know who created the web map rendering feature (e.g. https://ddnet.tw/maps/?map=Quick), where to download the sourcecode and what license it is under?
13:35 <+Learath2> timakro something tells me it was eastbyte but not sure
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> do you know how i can contact him?
13:38 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: it's a chain yeah, @ > usa > can > ger > @
13:38 <+Learath2> it propagated fine to usa
13:38 <+Learath2> can gave an error so it couldn't go further
13:38 <+Learath2> how to fix it I have no idea
13:38 <+Learath2> :D
13:39 <+timakro> oh EastByte is here in irc -.-
13:40 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: might need to restart slave on can and see if it fixes itself, it said couldn't write to temp maybe it was full on diskspace
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> @timakro  https://github.com/east/tw-webgl ?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Sonix danke!
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sen pa'> Gerne
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably disk full on CAN
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen can disk size be increased on CAN? what's the hosting provider?
15:19 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: did you manage to get it to propagate all the way?
15:20 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: dunno. can you retry propagation to CAN?
15:20 <@heinrich5991> restart didn't seem to trigger it (?)
15:21 <+Learath2> it errored again
15:21 <+Learath2> we don't have much diskspace available at CAN at all :/
15:22 <@heinrich5991> yea, I tried optimizing it a bit
15:23 <@heinrich5991> but it only freed around 500MB
15:25 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: can we maybe take a dump from ddnet.tw and just drop table and reimport on CAN?
15:25 <@heinrich5991> that sounds super easy to get wrong
15:25 <@heinrich5991> :D
15:26 <+Learath2> it's better then replication being stuck right here
15:26 <+Learath2> god knows how big that dump is going to be :P
15:27 <@heinrich5991> probably bigger than the DB
15:27 <@heinrich5991> which is 5GB in itself
15:34 <+Learath2> oh you did add the column on GER didn't you? :D
15:35 <+Learath2> it propagated back to ddnet.tw and caused a duplicate column error
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 it's OVH. Let's just remove the DB there instead
15:37 <@heinrich5991> sometimes re-ordering a server can increase its specs
15:37 <+Learath2> skipped the bad queries on ddnet.tw
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> throw out CAN db from all servers, connect the other ones directly
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and shut down CAN db
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> enough space
15:39 <+Learath2> deen: CAN should dump records to USA, stop slave on CAN, make GER master USA instead, done?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like that
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why dump to USA?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why not just connect GER <-> USA directly
15:43 <+Learath2> well CAN needs somewhere to send it's records, USA sounds closer then GER
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they always have multiple
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you can add USA and GER as fallback
15:43 <+Learath2> and don't we want to keep the loop GER->USA->ddnet.tw->GER?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, keep loop
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I shut down GER2 in a week?
15:44 <+Learath2> do you happen to know how to remove CAN from the loop? idk what master_log_pos and master_log_file should be tbh
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can do that when I'm home
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know either, but I guess I'll figure it out along the way
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can get the master log values from CAN
15:45 <+Learath2> I'll replace GER2 with a kimisufi node, see if that holds up btw
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on CAN: stop slave;
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on USA: stop slave; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='ger.ddnet.tw', MASTER_USER='repl', MASTER_PASSWORD='SECRETREPL', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000010', MASTER_LOG_POS=37941939; start slave;
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> something like that
15:47 <+Learath2> I'll do it as soon as I figure out how master_log_file and master_log_pos are supposed to work
15:47 <@heinrich5991> thanks
15:47 <@heinrich5991> sorry for destroying everything :(
15:48 <+Learath2> my shower is dripping... I'm about to go insane
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Replace the rubber circle thingy inside, they get brittle with time
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heinrich5991: np ,i remember having the same problem with CAN^^
15:50 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: you didn't break anything, just CAN
16:02 <+Learath2> should be fine now \o/
16:06 <@heinrich5991> you fixed everythingâ„¢?
16:08 <+Learath2> just need to let CAN connect to USA instead
16:08 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: shall I disable the mysqld service on CAN?
16:08 <@heinrich5991> so it doesn't start on next boot?
16:08 <+Learath2> yeah
16:09 <+Learath2> and could you check the log for why CAN cannot connect to usa mysql?
16:09 <@heinrich5991> which log?
16:09 <@heinrich5991> CAN's ddnet server logs?
16:10 <+Learath2> nvm, old pw on CAN
16:10 <+Learath2> yeah all should be fine (tm)
16:12 <+Learath2> should try to propagate sth around to see if it actually works fine
16:13 <+Learath2> removing one point from myself
16:14 <@heinrich5991> and re-adding 10 points afterwards?
16:14 <@heinrich5991> classic
16:14 <+Learath2> :D
16:15 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: the DB is still on CAN btw
16:15 <+Learath2> yeah just stopped it while working on it
16:15 <@heinrich5991> ok
16:17 <+Learath2> yay it works(tm)
16:18 <+Learath2> CAN still messes up my terminal...
16:20 <+Learath2> DROP DATABASE teeworlds; inbound :P
16:23 <@heinrich5991> sounds safe
16:23 <+Learath2> very
16:23 <@heinrich5991> de*en has backups ;)
16:30 <@deen> what's the state?
16:30 <@deen> tell me if you need help
16:31 <+Learath2> can is no longer in the loop
16:31 <+Learath2> deen: the blocker pw in the db doesn't match the one in mysqlblock.cfg do we no longer use mysql for block?
16:31 <@deen> dunno
16:31 <@deen> no one cares about ranks on block
16:32 <@deen> but fix them please
16:32 <+Learath2> it must have been broken for quite some time on all servers
16:32 <@heinrich5991> playing on the blocker servers, I thought that was by design :D
16:33 <@heinrich5991> that there are no permanent scores ^^
16:33 <+Learath2> and whoever changed the pw scrubbed the .mysql_history :D
16:33 <+Learath2> guess we need a new pw for them
16:34 <@deen> or just keep them without ranks
16:34 <@deen> i don't mind
16:34 <@deen> and no one complained
16:38 <@heinrich5991> I don't care either, was just my experience :D
16:40 <+Learath2> do any of you know whether zcatch sql implementation would accept a domain instead of an ip?
16:44 <+Learath2> well I went with ip just incase
16:44 <+Learath2> anyways done with all the mysql stuff, everything I can think of is fixed now
16:44 <@deen> i think so, but I prefer ip too
16:45 <@deen> since dns sometimes breaks
16:45 <@deen> especially with dns amplification attacks hitting us
16:46 <+Learath2> deen: do you happen to remember what fixes the weird TERM issue I kept having with zaf?
16:46 <+Learath2> it happens with can now
16:48 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: guess you can merge #1025 now if you don't see any issues with it
16:48 <@deen> what's the issue?
16:48 <+Learath2> deen: backspace doesn't seem to work, colors don't work
16:49 <+Learath2> if I do TERM="xterm-256color" it does work tho
16:49 <@deen> what's your normal TERM?
16:50 <+Learath2> rxvt-unicode-256color
16:50 <@deen> weird
16:51 <@deen> i also use rxvt-unicode with 256 colors and for me TERM=xterm-256colo
16:51 <@deen> r
16:52 <@deen> either terminfo or ~/.zkbd
16:53 <@heinrich5991> y'all should just fish with default options
16:54 <@heinrich5991> :P
16:55 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: CAN's hdd is now at 42%. good work. thanks ;)
16:55 <+Learath2> can store so much teehistorian data
16:55 <@heinrich5991> ^^

17:33 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: it worx :)
17:34 <+Learath2> yay
17:35 <+Learath2> we should probably populate the null ones in reverse btw
17:35 <+Learath2> after we have better tools of analyzing teehistorian files that is
17:35 <@heinrich5991> :)
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> gameid? an uuid for runs?
17:40 <@heinrich5991> nah, for server runs
17:40 <@heinrich5991> it's the file name of the teehistorian file that corresponds to the run
17:40 <@heinrich5991> i.e. we can replay the race with that id
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> I see thanks
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is the gameid for?
17:50 <+Learath2> 17:40 <@heinrich5991> it's the file name of the teehistorian file that corresponds to the run
17:51 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: uhm there seems to be a cmake problem on circleci
17:51 <+Learath2> circle didn't like the wavpack update maybe?

18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .git/info/exclude doesn't work anymore?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this due to the new .gitignore changes?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or i am blind?
18:07 <+Learath2> well it works just fine for autoexec_server.cfg no?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it isnt edited
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why it isnt shown
18:09 <+Learath2> hmm, doubt gitignore overrides .git/info/exclude anyways, idk
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is weird
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might have relation to 
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> !**/

18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> !*.*```
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any thoughts on this?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check the doc of gitignore. it should tell you the preferences
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> level of precedence is `command line > .gitignore > .git/info/exclude > core.excludesFile`
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so yeah, gitignore is killing my exclude file :c
