01:04 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon if you want to add more to your tool: https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Automapper#Tools
01:05 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon if you want to add more to your tool: <https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Automapper#Tools>
01:06 < bridge> <patiga> I reimplemented automappers in twmap, I hope I did it right there. @k2d222 has actually tested the implementation somewhat iirc :)
01:06 < bridge> <patiga> as the automapper iterates over the layer from top-to-bottom/left-to-right to apply the rules, it usually checks the rules on a copy of the layer while modifying the original one. otherwise the changes made would affect the rules that checked later in the loop.
01:06 < bridge> <patiga> LAYERNOCOPY tells the automapper to not create a copy, and check the rules on the same version of the layer where the changes are made
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> I thought I had fixed that
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> Oops
01:10 < bridge> <Assa> I am aware, I put this in the wiki above with a link to in-place operations and a warning for potential side effects
01:10 < bridge> <Assa> I reverse engineered the automapper at this stage.
01:10 < bridge> <patiga> thats also what I did back then ^^
01:11 < bridge> <patiga> XFLIP is switches left<->right, no?
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> You don't change friend states often. I did try this but it looked wrong. Also if Id can be shown on the same line
01:12 < bridge> <Assa> yes, a mirror on the *VERTICAL* Axis
01:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You sure you don't mean *across*
01:12 < bridge> <patiga> vertical/horizontal caused quite some confusion, my 2 cents there are to say which sides it switches
01:13 < bridge> <Assa> I have the same issue xD
01:13 < bridge> <Assa> I sure am no english man
01:15 < bridge> <louis> i feel like itd look weird for ppl w short names
01:15 < bridge> <Solly> Show
01:15 < bridge> <Solly> It looks wrong for my sized names
01:15 < bridge> <k2d222> +1 for rhe confusion 🙂
03:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: I remembered what i wanted to ask about the protocol range limit.
03:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> m_PlayerFlags a `NetIntRange[0,256)` I want to check if that is still varint or just a byte.
03:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if it is just a varint there is no reason we couldn't just.. you know, increase it to add more flags.
03:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 😬
04:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> TWWE's automapper is so jank
04:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i upload a .rules file and its almost like it doesnt even recognize it
04:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @k2d222 ik you dont touch twwe but how do automappers work in that site
04:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like i can edit them but the `config` option doesnt work
05:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> zen browser update jump scare

05:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they just made it look like arc now
05:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and sidebar resize doesn't work lmao
05:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh it does work, it's just the min and max range is so small there really isn't any difference
06:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t understand what you mean by „if you want to add more to your tool“ which is my tool?
07:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That is a crazy idea! But yes that should work. I did not check the code it depends on if the client indexes the data buffer or calls GetInt. But usually in the tw code GetInt is used. So this will most likely work actually!
07:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
07:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Especially because ddnet does not drop but clamp it should be fully backwards compatible. But it can not be sent to 0.7 clients.
09:01 < bridge> <Assa> isn't twwe from you?
09:02 < bridge> <Assa> I added it as well as other tools to the automaper guide in the ddnet wiki. I assumed, that your automapper support is high quality
09:02 < bridge> <Assa> others claim it's jank, I have no idea.
09:03 < bridge> <Assa> We currently simply don't have a userfriendly feature complete tool for it
10:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah now it makes sense. No twwe is made by the k222d22222 French rust pro
10:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> k2d222
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> This is what happens when you don't update your gentoo machine for a while
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316344225914421288/lolwat.png?ex=675ab497&is=67596317&hm=3247da97f9c294957b18a042aba86c4d281fde0f5d4e0247b5eba0173710f742&
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> It decided the best way to solve this conflict is to build rust 9 * 3 times

11:36 < bridge> <k2d222> halloo 
11:37 < bridge> <k2d222> automapper support was left in a broken state for a long time but I fixed it a couple weeks ago. I just updated the server with the new fixes 🙂
11:38 < bridge> <k2d222> @_voxeldoesart I cranked the jank levels to 20% jank hope it's enough dejanking

11:41 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> how much money does ddnet pay for internet every month?
11:42 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> if you can share this information
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whar
11:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet.org/fundin
11:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://ddnet.org/funding
12:01 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> im only intrested in internet subscription
12:02 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> like what kind of internet subscription allows to send data so many players? and how much does it cost
12:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> With hosting providers you often don't pay for your network traffic separately, so there's a good chance the amount they pay is simply *zero*
12:03 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> oh i see
12:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You only pay extra for networking in the case that you use a lot of network bandwidth relative to the amount of processing and storage you pay for
12:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> nice!
12:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ill look at it when i can
12:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ...which honestly might be the case when it comes to DDNet since the game is so easy to run
12:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cries in CHN servers
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> With some help from the gentoo irc we managed to get it down to just 3 rebuilds of rust :Celebrate:
12:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would never be able to deal with that
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> eh, it happens in the background, I don't mind
12:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i probably would just panic and wipe the disk
12:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> happened to me a lot when I was in middle school
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> This is how I used to fix my gentoo machines back in the day
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> I couldn't figure out how to fix the conflicts, so I'd just wipe it all
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919> i can break ubuntu back in the day and i usually give up in 5 minutes
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably why i'm still on windows
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> going to linux improves your programming skills by 70%
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> it is known
12:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't need more programming skills, i need blender skills and music theory right now
12:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> make a donut in blender rn
12:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> been there done that
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm just figuring out animation stuff and designing cutscene workflow for godot
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make a custom shader in blender
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that makes everything look teeish
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then send to me
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why would i do that
12:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Freddie if you want some fancy music hmu, I'm proficient in guitar and piano, I'll drop you some sick beats
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why would you not

12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> AND YOU TELL ME NOW?
12:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just create a shader, drag a shader to rgb, add a color ramp and set your two tone. done.
12:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you are welcome

12:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
12:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's called having severe ADHD
12:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i don't even have a piano rn
12:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> I hyper focus on topics I'm interested in for like a year or two, most of them I just drop after a while, the only one I stuck with was gaming, coding, and machining
12:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you have a soundcloud
12:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:  I had yes
12:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> Did heavy techno with like 15/16
12:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://soundcloud.com/tsfreddie
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> me too lmao
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> I also did some dj'ing a few years ago at parties
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> But never really seriously
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: @blaiszephyr where did you take all the side quests, is there like a quest board or something in german
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is it made by you?
12:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: @blaiszephyr where did you take all the side quests, is there like a quest board or something in germany
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> these tracks
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well kinda
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> mostly loops that i modified
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didn't know you such an allrounder
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet should hire you
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i made basically everything in that blindjump game
12:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my friend made a sprite and i did everything else.
12:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> As mentioned, I read something, I think I might like it, and I hyper focus on it for a while
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> I love experimenting, learning and stuff
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> defs a nice idea that game
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> showed it my bro, he played it for like 1-2h xD
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
12:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:  bro played a 30minute game for 2 hours
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it just felt so long
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but we actually wanted to do smth else and he continued playing it xD
12:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was either really easy or really hard depends on the person
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://tsfreddie.itch.io/blind-jump
12:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so probably not really a general audience friendly game
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> speedrun
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i start at xx:27
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so 10 seconds

12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it would be teeworlds physics all first try
12:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 😎
12:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did it again
12:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> poorly tho

12:42 < bridge> <learath2> I have this same thing. The amount of unnecessary knowledge I have accumulated is actually surprising
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> make games when?
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> I don't get to pick what my stupid brain is hyperfocusing on on a given day
12:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:dumbduck:1191800929679310919>
12:44 < bridge> <learath2> Soo when brain feels like make games I'll make games
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't either actually, i'm kinda forcing myself to make game when i'm not focusing on anything
12:44 < bridge> <learath2> For an entire month I was quite interested in drawing. Was actually getting better at it. Then suddenly woke up one day and I had 0 motivation to draw. Completely stopped doing it
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it usually doesn't work out, but at least i have a steady workflow towards something currently
12:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When post tee art in #showroom ?
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> That's more than an hour a day I was putting towards drawing to 0 in an instant
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> I'm still shit at drawing, so never 🙃
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> btw does that border animation look familiar
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lmao
12:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> did you learn any good resources?
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Such a cool idea for a game
12:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> checkout this fucking spritesheet. the game doesn't takes much, I keep getting stuck on useless animations

12:49 < bridge> <learath2> I probably did. I don't remember anymore, I could check my old notes. I think I was following a youtube guy and a book
12:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> cool. can you send me in #off-topic ?
12:50 < bridge> <learath2> I'll check after work and send if I find some

12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that from teeworlds or what xd
12:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i made it in a ddnet PR
13:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you asked me about it iirc
13:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like last week
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks slower or smth
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno
13:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that was about on par with how long it took everyone livestreamed it beats it
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wouldn't have thought it's that
13:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that border animation in unity was shader tho
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah, ddnet defs isnt shader friendly 😂
13:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> would be nice tho
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning peeps from the south side of the world
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> im closer as ever to Voxel kek

13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what u think https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/12/11/making-memcpynull-null-0-well-defined
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u in the north our south side of na
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u in the north or south side of na
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The llvm.memcpy intrinsic may lower to a call to the memcpy function, which is treated as a "compiler runtime builtin" here, even though it is ultimately also provided by the C library.
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > When used as a builtin, LLVM requires that both memcpy(x, x, s) and memcpy(NULL, NULL, 0) are well-defined, even though the C standard says they are UB. GCC and MSVC have similar assumptions.
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Making memcpy(NULL, NULL, 0) officially well-defined removes one of the assumptions, while the memcpy(x, x, s) case remains for now. Allowing this was originally also part of the proposal, but was later dropped, because it didn't fit well with the other changes.
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In a weird turn of events, this change to the C standard came about because Rust developers kept nagging me about the mismatch between LLVM and C semantics.
13:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> na?
13:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ohhh oh
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> im in south america, argentina
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> for work, for 10 days
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> well now there are 7 days remaining
13:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is new england east or west
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess west, but i have a europe centric view xd
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think east is more arabs
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and asia
13:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ah

14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is created outside of an if statement. So i assumed this would be sent to 0.6 and 0.7 clients. But as far as i can tell from dumping the snaps it does not send this item to 0.7 connections
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am struggeling to understand how this item is dropped for 0.7 connections
14:26 < bridge> <zhn> first concepts looked way more unique imho
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> watcha mean
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> freddie posted first sketch in #off-topic and you could use rewind to actually affect gameplay instead of just replaying afair

15:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chatgpt
15:36 < bridge> <woidless> It doesn't work, I tried
15:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> how can chatgpt fail with simple file I/O ? :kekw:
15:37 < bridge> <woidless> I asked him to create this script, and it didn't work for me.
15:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you have to be experienced proompt engineer to ask chat gpt properly
15:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> are we in that time of the life where we stop telling people to learn how to google, but learn how to AI ?
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> you, yourself, and thy

15:39 < bridge> <woidless> I've been wanting to create this script for 2 weeks now
15:39 < bridge> <woidless> But I can't do it.
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> have you done anything except wanting?

15:42 < bridge> <woidless> I'm learning C++ now.
15:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> write the script in C++
15:42 < bridge> <woidless> Iterations, variables, etc. I know
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```c++
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> C++ fstream
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 1
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> The fstream class in C++ is used for input and output operations on files. It is part of the <fstream> header and is a typedef of basic_fstream<char>. This class maintains a filebuf object as its internal stream buffer, which performs input/output operations on the associated file
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 1
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> .
15:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
15:43 < bridge> <woidless> I can write a console application, and that is "weak" using if/else and some loops
15:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I get compiler error when I try to compile this
15:43 < bridge> <woidless> I am currently unable to write this script in c++
15:44 < bridge> <woidless> and at least I have to run it on the host, and I have never run c++ scripts on the host.
15:46 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> imagine needing to learn how to ai lmfaooo
15:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> then again ive argued enough to you guys about ai
16:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's arguable if anything C++ can count as a script...

17:21 < bridge> <aegisub> 👍
17:32 < bridge> <avolicious> But mostly people in here do it for free 😄
17:32 < bridge> <avolicious> So why does he need to learn if there are still people willing to write all the scripts for him
17:33 < bridge> <avolicious> its win-win
17:35 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> for 1 person willing to do this for free there are 100 who are annoyed by it
17:36 < bridge> <avolicious> It is how it is
17:44 < bridge> <woidless> In general, yes, c++ is a low-level language
17:44 < bridge> <woidless> Who can create a script for fifo?
17:47 < bridge> <louis> what does your script need to do (i'm not creating it though)
17:48 < bridge> <woidless> I just want my message to be displayed in the broadcast every specified time.
17:49 < bridge> <woidless> this is implemented via fifo
17:49 < bridge> <woidless> But I do not know how
17:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> so you want a script, that runs a script that broadcasts stuff to your server via fifo?

18:27 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> does anybody here know how to test for servers that support above 64 players?
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> checkout that support 128 players commit #9274
18:28 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9274
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> ah or wdym
18:29 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> i actually extended the feature that allows vanilla clients that only support 16 clients to be on 64 player servers so that clients that support 64 can be on servers with even more
18:30 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> but i have to check i didn't miss something somewhere server sided or client sided, so i gotta be able to simulate a lotta players server sided
18:30 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> opening up a lot of clients failed around 18 probably because of graphics contexts, didn't even get to the main menu
18:30 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> i heard there might be a way add a lot of fake players to test these types of servers?
18:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> debug dummies, server side

19:28 < bridge> <Ewan> wyd
19:29 < bridge> <Solly> trying to make hooklines use prediction
19:29 < bridge> <Solly> ```
19:29 < bridge> <Solly>     CCharacter *p = (CCharacter *)FindFirst(ENTTYPE_CHARACTER);
19:29 < bridge> <Solly>     for(; p; p = (CCharacter *)p->TypeNext())
19:29 < bridge> <Solly> ```
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> please don't pr that to ddnet xd
19:29 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt look like you can get ccharacter from id
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hooklines cannot be predicted
19:29 < bridge> <Solly> wdym
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whatever you do is not a prediction of hooklines
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hooklines depend on the current player movement
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so moving will invalidate the current preview of the hookline
19:30 < bridge> <Solly> well sometimes when dragging the line shows no hook when it very much can hook
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the opposite is true too
19:31 < bridge> <Solly> if youre lagging enough, hook line does nothing
19:31 < bridge> <Solly> i think it should be made to work best when you arent lagging
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, they cannot be predicted
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not properly
19:32 < bridge> <Solly> you just use predicted world instead of current world?
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok let me rephrase
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you cannot predict if the hookline's prediction is ever correct
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also hookline itself is already a shady feature in ddnet
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would be better if it stays as it is
19:34 < bridge> <Solly> nor can you any other prediction, but its good enough most of the time and better than no prediction
19:34 < bridge> <Solly> i slightly, as someone who plays with max distance 30, rely on it
19:34 < bridge> <Solly> i slightly, as someone who plays with max distance 30, rely on it. dym "shady" as in slightly cheaty
19:34 < bridge> <zhn> skill issue :troll:
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then let me allow to say. skill issue
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
19:34 < bridge> <Solly> well i cant put my cursor on tees as they are... too far away
19:35 < bridge> <Solly> hookline makes that a non issue
19:35 < bridge> <zhn> ye thats why its a skill issue
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100%
19:35 < bridge> <zhn> ppl play with 100k sense and do perfect flick hooks, you just need to practice
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> hookline has a few legitimate uses imo none of which need prediction. yea it would be better if it worked that way but you’d probably be making it even less reliable
19:36 < bridge> <Solly> the fact that its unreliable even when youre still is a problem
19:36 < bridge> <zhn> wdym
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> then u can fix that without touching pred right
19:36 < bridge> <Solly> sometimes you can hook when the hookline says you cant and visa versa
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:37 < bridge> <Solly> sometimes you can hook when the hookline says you cant and visa versa (when still)
19:37 < bridge> <zhn> it has nothing to do with pred though
19:37 < bridge> <Solly> i dont really care about that tho, it isnt an issue to me. the issue is being inaccurate as its using the non predicted world when im seeing the predicted one
19:37 < bridge> <Solly> i dont really care about that tho, it isnt an issue to me (doesnt mean i dont want it fixed). the issue is being inaccurate as its using the non predicted world when im seeing the predicted one
19:38 < bridge> <zhn> the thing is predicted hook is more unreliable than a still one
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i’d like to see it working for sure. i’d almost rather have a ghost hookline like ur tee in the debug menu
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> when you arent lagging it isnt
19:38 < bridge> <zhn> you can depend on still hookline and just feel the game itself
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> when you arent lagging it isnt (there are lots of cases where hookline is reproducably wrong)
19:38 < bridge> <zhn> also isn't it prohibited?
19:38 < bridge> <Solly> not in ddrace?
19:38 < bridge> <zhn> i remember there was a person who implemented it already
19:39 < bridge> <zhn> and it was dropped cuz its literally da chot
19:39 < bridge> <Solly> "da chot"?
19:39 < bridge> <Solly> if the current hook line isnt cheating, one which is wrong less of the time isnt any more cheating
19:40 < bridge> <zhn> current hookline is as debatable as dummy, too
19:40 < bridge> <Solly> why is dummy cheating
19:40 < bridge> <zhn> automated inputs
19:40 < bridge> <Solly> (dummy hammerfly is iffy cuz thats aimbot)
19:40 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but you give it every one of those inputs
19:41 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but you give it every one of those inputs (again excluding hammerfly)
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> you can't control two opened clients in same time as you can with dummy copy
19:41 < bridge> <Solly> with two keyboard you can
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> you cant focus on two windows at once lol
19:41 < bridge> <Solly> (given your wm has multi keyboard focus)
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> yes you can B)
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> even in X, but its janky in X
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> idk about windows
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> yeah exception on exception, still exploitable, still a chot
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> cheat*?
19:42 < bridge> <Solly> whats "exception on exception"
19:42 < bridge> <zhn> .
19:43 < bridge> <Solly> you can just have 2 computers, same outcome
19:43 < bridge> <Solly> i dont see the problem if you arent automating the inputs
19:44 < bridge> <zhn> then why dummy is a feature if you can achieve it anyway
19:44 < bridge> <zhn> that's exaclty why dummy is unnecessary
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> because windows and most linux installs cant do multi keyboard. most people dont have multiple computers or even keyboards
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> oh also alt-tab exists
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> oh also alt-tab exists (completley forgot about that)
19:45 < bridge> <zhn> and? you can open two clients and play like this lol
19:45 < bridge> <zhn> like i did back then
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ya but like
19:45 < bridge> <Solly> and dummy is just a better way of doing that
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> sure ur window system can do it
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> what about ur brain
19:46 < bridge> <zhn> yea and it simplified gameplay too much
19:46 < bridge> <Solly> you would have to move your hands quite fast
19:46 < bridge> <Ewan> or just learn to play w feet
19:46 < bridge> <Solly> from alt-tab which you could bind to a single key
19:46 < bridge> <Solly> to... a single key?
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the concept is that nobody was really double-teeing before dummies afaik so it was a paradigm shift regardless of your technical ability to do it beforehand
19:47 < bridge> <zhn> so whats the problem with my approach lol, you exactly point out that it is as easy as dummy without copy and hammerfly features
19:47 < bridge> <Solly> dummy copy you cant do like this, but i think its fine you are still giving all the inputs (as you could with 2 keyboards)
19:47 < bridge> <Solly> hammefly is cheaty
19:47 < bridge> <Solly> opening 2 clients is a pain
19:47 < bridge> <zhn> not really
19:47 < bridge> <Solly> you have duplicate audio
19:48 < bridge> <Solly> unless you turn one off
19:48 < bridge> <Solly> prediction for dummy isnt a thing
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> u can mute on unfocused iorc
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> thats fairly new
19:48 < bridge> <Ewan> u can mute on unfocused iirc
19:48 < bridge> <Solly> if you mute one chat pings dont work
19:49 < bridge> <zhn> the only good point, i mean current state of dummy is really debatable, i don't know why you argue with it and still say that hammerfly and copy features are literally chots
19:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> hookline is very useful to make edgehook not fucking praying to god that you hit
19:49 < bridge> <zhn> it is debatable, you just proved it once more
19:49 < bridge> <Solly> if controller support existed and was decent i bet atleast someone wouldve figured out how to competently control 2 at once (as people do with other gmaes)
19:49 < bridge> <Solly> it = dummy copy and hammerfly
19:50 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, main dummy features lmfao
19:50 < bridge> <Solly> i cant live w/o my dummy, too many novices
19:50 < bridge> <zhn> find new friends
19:51 < bridge> <Solly> ddnet is quite...
19:51 < bridge> <Solly> a niche game
19:51 < bridge> <Solly> to get people i already like into it
19:51 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Wait
19:51 < bridge> <Solly> i guess i could befriend exisitng playres
19:51 < bridge> <zhn> all my friends came out from teeworlds chat and forums
19:51 < bridge> <Solly> i guess i could befriend exisitng players, i do
19:51 < bridge> <zhn> you just have to communicate ingame
19:52 < bridge> <Solly> but most of the time theres not going to be someone that i can conveen(?) with on whatever im playing
19:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> gerdoe are u saying dummy is bad
19:52 < bridge> <zhn> like its the main point of playing teeworlds :justatest:
19:52 < bridge> <Solly> to have fun :D
19:52 < bridge> <zhn> dummy is chot
19:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> not
19:52 < bridge> <zhn> to find good ppl in it kekeke
19:52 < bridge> <zhn> prove it
19:53 < bridge> <zhn> can you do the same tricks dummy players do without dummy?
19:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> imaging mapping without dummy
19:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what tricks
19:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> also dummy maps
19:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> imagine mapping without dummy
19:53 < bridge> <zhn> i don't say dummy is bad, but its indeed chot
19:54 < bridge> <zhn> any dummy-only trick
19:54 < bridge> <zhn> like perfect triple kinta fly
19:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> no because i dont do it with dummy either way
19:55 < bridge> <louis> dummy chot
19:55 < bridge> <louis> u can't do horizontal deepfly without dummy
19:55 < bridge> <louis> u can't do horizontal unfrozen deepfly without dummy
19:56 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, kinta fly xd
19:58 < bridge> <Ewan> what's chot idk
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> ya true
19:59 < bridge> <zhn> pinkrat definition of legalized cheat
19:59 < bridge> <Ewan> ah lol
20:02 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks hookline prediction would just have the same issues as any other prediction :D
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I disagree. if you play solo all prediction works fine
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But hookline would not work
20:02 < bridge> <teero777> why?
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because it would require to know your next movement
20:03 < bridge> <teero777> same as other prediction
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you see prediction errors while playing solo maps?
20:03 < bridge> <teero777> usually not you're right
20:08 < bridge> <Solly> (minus packet loss)
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean you could argue that instant input also miss predicts.
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So you could purposely run the whole client 3 ticks behind and have accurate hookline :lol: 
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but would feel like even more input delay
20:09 < bridge> <Solly> that would be removing prediction
20:09 < bridge> <Solly> also this is mostly for dragging where the other person isnt moving
20:10 < bridge> <Solly> also tees are big so if you are off by 3 ticks of movement (assuming pretty not high ping) then its fine
20:10 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what about player-only? is it not a chot to dummy users then
20:10 < bridge> <Solly> (really the same as any movement, being off a few ticks of movement is only so jarring)
20:11 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316482450620289034/image.png?ex=675b3553&is=6759e3d3&hm=8d894303cb0ad50f3a271bc30ee18add926c356855f2be0e7897babf5b9de4fe&
20:11 < bridge> <Solly> famous last words
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he wrote next week
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it's next week
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and next week your read it again
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still next week
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so will the 128p servers be only for newest client?
20:14 < bridge> <Solly> (is 2 weeks ago, he said next week 2 weeks ago whichis 1 week ago, and it hasnt been merged)
20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I think the idea would be we release one or more client versions with 128 support (just increase `MAX_CLIENTS`) and when we switch on the server those versions don't need any translation
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i thought it's happening xd
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 did you improve perf since last time?
20:16 < bridge> <robyt3> no :justatest:  it's still fine in release mode, but debug mode goes down to 50 FPS
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> im wondering if max clients necessarily has to be a constant
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so 400 fps for you?
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly the whole game is build around static sized arrays
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> sure, that's fine
20:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you can do runtime static things
20:18 < bridge> <Solly> even with 64 clients debug mode slows down to 10fps rendering all of them
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that also means it always iterates over MAX_CLIENTS for loops
20:18 < bridge> <robyt3> In release I have 2000+ FPS. In debug I also have around 1200+ when alone on a local server
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if all it's about is indexing then frankly that sounds like more of a mental blocker
20:18 < bridge> <robyt3> In release I have 2000+ FPS idle. In debug I also have around 1200+ when alone on a local server
20:19 < bridge> <Solly> is collision done with octtrees?
20:19 < bridge> <Solly> (or anything else which makes it not O(n^2))
20:19 < bridge> <robyt3> no, it's O(N²)
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> owch
20:19 < bridge> <Solly> yeah thats... a problem
20:20 < bridge> <Solly> simple fix +5000 -5000
20:20 < bridge> <Solly> simple fix +5000 -3000
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> lmao
20:20 < bridge> <Solly> "just use octtrees, it would be easy they said"
20:21 < bridge> <Solly> this is what you get for not using a game engine i guess
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> no the game is just old as shit
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just saying octree solves nothing
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> updating octrees isnt cheap either
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think the best solution is to use a tile based approach
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> cheaper than n^2 every collision check
20:22 < bridge> <zhn> players are real, have no automation, no aimbot and no additional inputs
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works, is simpler
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works, is simpler (and faster) (at the cost of memory)
20:22 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works, is simpler (and faster) (not at the cost of memory, why are octrees used?)
20:23 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works, is simpler (and faster) (i guess its how you impeement either?)
20:23 < bridge> <Solly> "chunking" also works, is simpler
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s the concept behind an octree no
20:23 < bridge> <zhn> some of old devs implemented quad tree collisions, @essigautomat implemented it too once afair
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s the concept behind an octree no?
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but 400 with 128 tees in the screen?
20:24 < bridge> <Solly> oh yeah its 2d :monkalaugh:
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> ye i mean
20:24 < bridge> <robyt3> In debug I have max 50, I don't remember release
20:24 < bridge> <zhn> ye, quadtree is a chunking
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i get around 600-700 fps
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316485883721158688/image.png?ex=675b3885&is=6759e705&hm=0179464d822663843ec78dbfdb5364dccf17b61ed4849f3c44fe751b06e92ae6&
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with the non O(n²) physics
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> does anyone have like an i5 igpu
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> that should be the basis of these metrics tbh
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> well you can just store chunks in a flat array
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> does anyone have like an i5 w igpu
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without nameplates 1200fps xd
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> guess i should optimize that at some point
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> why are nameplates so expensive
20:25 < bridge> <zhn> i do, but it's at home rn
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are currently not buffered in this client you see
20:25 < bridge> <Solly> it should just be rendering already made text containers (textures) (atleast since updated ones)
20:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> hookline ai prediction
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @sollybunny this isn't ddnet, it's a client that has almost O(n) physics
20:26 < bridge> <Solly> is this jupey client?
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
20:26 < bridge> <Solly> nice
20:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i love jupey client
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> when can i use it
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> dd pg
20:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its like    nothing rn tbh LOL
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @sollybunny https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/29bc281e6301402ad9289d252dc7283ddbb75aad/game/shared-game/src/entities/character/pos.rs
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in case you interested, this is how i solved it, instead of a quadtree.
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tile based, so i kinda assume in the avg case 1 tile = 1 tee
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all day
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> is it usable
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on what your goal is xD
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ig it’s not compatible w ddnet
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can play vanilla
20:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you can only play LAN
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> can i play online vanilla
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well you can play on servers, but the current ones are pretty outdated xD
20:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ohh
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you host a server yes
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> ur not hosting any
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> blast
20:29 < bridge> <zhn> i can play dm1 1o1 theres so its alright :troll:
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i sometimes update the ones i host
20:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> still wanna make more sounds and textures for dd pg
20:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i already did itsabot
20:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> maybe void_tee and maybe a wooden tee next
20:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or maybe weapon sounds/looks
20:31 < bridge> <teero777> i was on my phone and couldn't listen to it when i saw it. could you link it again? i wanna hear
20:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> one src
20:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @teero777
20:32 < bridge> <teero777> :ooo
20:32 < bridge> <teero777> sounds so cool
20:33 < bridge> <teero777> are there clanking sounds for walking?
20:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> walking sounds dont exist
20:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> theres clanking sounds for jumping
20:39 < bridge> <louis> we should add them
20:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> no
20:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> walking sounds x 10 in fat map is bad idea me thinks
20:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah   i think itd be too distracting
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tees got fast feet
20:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Time to pull out my 1.83GHz Celeron
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would probs sound like some machine gun
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Around 500 FPS with 128 players visible, 150 with scoreboard open
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316490381533249607/image.png?ex=675b3cb6&is=6759eb36&hm=334ecac85c1bf20da0f46ba53a146d9873840f0935ba9a260b7313d042ccd93e&
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that relwithdebinfo?
20:44 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah
20:44 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think what would also be cool is a dedicated jetpack weapon
20:44 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> three sounds: the activation sound, the running sound and the shutoff sound
20:44 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> the running would sorts have a crossfade sort of action so it can continuously play without it overlapping, and since you,re gonna be flying everywhere it can smoothly transition with positions  since im  assuming sounds cant really track a tee
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh well tbf it also depends too much on hardware
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tee rendering is just so slow
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Somehow joystick axis reading is also pretty slow
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> And we'd might benefit from the snapshot performance improvements from 0.7
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> And we might benefit from the snapshot performance improvements from 0.7
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that only done if "enable controller" is on?
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah defs 😄
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, otherwise we shouldn't update the joystick
20:47 < bridge> <robyt3> I just had it enabled for testing
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was just wondering if that causes the steam versions input lags xd
20:47 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i wonder if theres a way to optimize it
20:47 < bridge> <snowybeloved> still vulkan cant visualize btw
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Controller is disabled by default though, but I guess you could ask affected users if they have joysticks enabled
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your hardware?
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gpu
20:48 < bridge> <snowybeloved> GeForce GTX 1650
20:48 < bridge> <snowybeloved> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316491844883841065/image.png?ex=675b3e13&is=6759ec93&hm=20ca650d384533e60aaa2ba2d371b74f897e2455bb590a4cfdf75c2f8b17dfcb&
20:48 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Particles rendering is also slow. Kill of those 100 players would cause huge lags on a low-mid laptop.
20:48 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I checked this in renderdoc but I'm too far from gfx dev to do anything. The issue was that we reset all params for each particle, and each death emits 64 particles.
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's harder then it sounds actually.
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even patigas twgpu does not really use the GPU for that
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i also know why
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> death particles or spawn particles change the color
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i first wrote the updated particle rendering i didnt know that
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would need to be part of the shaders
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> check f1 there are usually some details immediately before
20:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which driver version?
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and this is good too
20:50 < bridge> <snowybeloved> 2024-12-12 00:49:38 I gfx: Created Vulkan 1.1 context.
20:50 < bridge> <snowybeloved> 2024-12-12 00:49:38 I vulkan: initialization failed for unknown reason.
20:50 < bridge> <snowybeloved> 2024-12-12 00:49:38 I vulkan: vulkan warning: initialization failed for unknown reason.
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> above?
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> or is that all
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i am affected user xd
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah it's disabled
20:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> idk why the spawn particles are gray if they're always purple in-game
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you show a screenshot of the full console?
20:50 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I can tell you a lot of people (I know at least a dozen) would appreciate such improvement.
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> starting from what you posted
20:51 < bridge> <snowybeloved> arch btw
20:51 < bridge> <snowybeloved> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316492455943737404/image.png?ex=675b3ea4&is=6759ed24&hm=423c5da768477b6b0dbedbf69265664e585a6aeb1fd650521c755e3264d7a100&
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah lol
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> oh lol
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> could have said that earlier
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> was expecting windows
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316492524856279100/image.png?ex=675b3eb5&is=6759ed35&hm=d2378d7042d57aee66cb35fe4521d328986d21b0192355d3617d5461329585aa&
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you use nvidia open source drivers
20:51 < bridge> <snowybeloved> WHAT THe
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> nouveau doesnt support vulkan at all
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as much as i dislike telling you, but you better use the official nvidia ones
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> the open source first-party driver does
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> or you can use the proprietary one
20:52 < bridge> <snowybeloved> ok
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> on arch u need nvidia-utils as well i think
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> nvidia-extras
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> idr
20:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nvidia-open has worked well for me
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> same
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> been using it for like 2 months no issues
20:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That is, the proprietary drivers with the official open kernel modules
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> it is a step in the right direction
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> and frankly a bold compromise considering the circumstances LMAO
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it's sad the measures u have to go thru to get ppl to open source even a portion of their shit
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah we have to build a new one to open source it.... great, that instills a lot of confidence :justatest:
20:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Actually the reason I switched from fully proprietary was that something broke with suspend
20:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Now it works better than ever
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> oh u know. i have been having suspend issues lately
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but that is since i switched *to* the open driver
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> there were issues before but different
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> now it doesn't even wake up :feelsbadman:
20:58 < bridge> <zhn> you can add it in normal ddnet too btw
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah the funny thing is that when I looked up my issue I only saw people complaining about the open driver
20:59 < bridge> <Solly> ditto
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:59 < bridge> <Solly> ditto (wqell i dont use nvidia anymore)
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i would have switched back but i got into the habit of turning all the power off in my room when i sleep except for alarm clock
20:59 < bridge> <Solly> ditto (wqell i dont use nvidia anymore, not a single hickup with amd x-x)
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> But for me it was backwards somehow
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> all the whining sounds and little lights
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i just cant
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> so no need for suspend
21:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The issue is with some change to systemd
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> someone might say the issue *is* systemd
21:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> About storing framebuffers on suspend
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah, my issue is a little different, there are suspend hooks & kernel mod params that u can pass to mitigate those issues
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> vram corruption right
21:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love how well it works now
21:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can actually suspend with a game open and it won't corrupt when I wake it up
21:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can imagine such a low level feature would be easy to mess up
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah without a standard model for that kind of thing anyway
21:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean yeah but 
21:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> where would the jetpack skins go
21:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> extras.png? game.png?
21:28 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is it because it has the inner and outer outlines
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, and also it has to change the skin textures for almost all tees
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and additionally it is mixed with other rendering like hook, weapons etc.
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you end up rendering lot of single quads
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gpus like batching
21:30 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i wonder how much more fps if you just drop those outer lines
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd maybe a bit
21:51 < bridge> <zhn> skins? :justatest:
21:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 💀
21:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im talking about replacing the pistol
21:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like not completely, just replacing the jetpack pistol
21:56 < bridge> <louis> could probably just solve it w particles
21:56 < bridge> <louis> jetpack gun also emits particles or something
21:57 < bridge> <louis> too bad someone already made a part with jetpack and telegun, or else we could remove the bullets as well
22:00 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i just hate the sound the jetpack gun makes
22:00 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and ninjajetpack feels too confusing for a map that has ninja in it
22:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 now types can be *kinda* inferred, and now it's not necessary to type variable's type in most obvious scenarios 😏
22:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1316510127120973844/image.png?ex=675b4f19&is=6759fd99&hm=cf166841883302fb6522d2d1dd9601963088f470bda6baf3cf09a69754fadacc&
22:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And it looks much better then before https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/c04a49aef06ab81a27bf1f13beb4a2dd48fdaac1/src/passes/type_checker.rs#L232-L322 xd
22:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maybe there can be a different sound for rapid fire and single fire?
22:05 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that'd be nice
22:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And it looks much better than before https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/c04a49aef06ab81a27bf1f13beb4a2dd48fdaac1/src/passes/type_checker.rs#L232-L322 xd

22:06 < bridge> <barbs0327> ChillerDragon I found a bug on JsaurusRex server hosted by you
22:06 < bridge> <barbs0327> I can't send demo here apparently though
22:45 < bridge> <zhn> thats how infclass did it with mercenary, solid way imo
23:48 < bridge> <totar> On the hook line thing there is a specific github repo made by a specific cheat developer that has accurate hookline prediction via analytical solving, it wouldn't require prediction to implement
23:49 < bridge> <totar> @jupeyy_keks why is tee rendering so slow btw?
