00:00 <+Learath2> redix: think deen was looking to upgrade to the first version with c++11 support
00:01 <+Learath2> that's why i said check 4.8
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> Ah okay. I'll try it tomorrow
01:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vFOJJ
07:21 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> where would i find a list of valid ddnet version numbers
07:22 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> like i use ddnet 10062 = 10.6.2
07:24 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> for the auto kick ive figured out that baumalein=708, zclient = 602/605, fclient=502, etc but im probably missing alot
09:20 <+Learath2> i=1; n=""; while [ n -neq "firstddnetcommitsha" ]; do;  git checkout HEAD~$i; n=$(git rev-parseorsth); echo $(grep GAME_VERSION src/game/version.h); done;
09:21 <+Learath2> sth like that should take a couple hours but should work
09:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> could prolly only checkout version.h but then idk hao2 get the rev
11:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> they will change gameversion to ddnet's one and autokick will be broken
11:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> mhmmhmnhmhmmhhhmmmjnmhnhjjjhhjnhhhhhnhhh
11:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> That's going to be a problem
14:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> @Savander most of them aare clients which arent being updated anymore
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so you want use broken solution, just because they are not updated yet
14:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good choice
14:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> @Savander most of them are clients which arent being updated anymore
14:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> why do you call blocking outdated clients a broken solution?
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it doesnt block all bot clients
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and they could change the version
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and they could change the version (pretty sure the one that made the bot would notice fast)
14:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> since its about to block bots which arent being updated anymore (Deprecated)
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> the maintainers doesn't care about their deprecated client being blocked on one server
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> if you have a solution blocking all bot clients without any false postives go ahead
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not solution
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> why not
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's open source, someone can make or have his own client
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> its not intended to keep out all bot clients, but the outdated ones it does
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with  same version
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yeah but how would u detect that
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and he wouldn't know why
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not working
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on certain servers
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yeah but why would i care
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> idk, make hash from whole the code
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for each ddnet version
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> and how do i get the hash from the clients?
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why do you ask me
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i said that gameversion is bad solution
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> broken
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> not like i know better solution
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> and I am saying its not
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> it works
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> your opionion.
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, like other things can works
14:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that doesn't mean its stupid
14:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it''s not stupid*
14:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yeah but in this case it isnt stupid
14:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> since it does that what is wanted
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 1. You can change gameversion easily.
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 2. Some other clients could have the same gameversion
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 3. Cheaters will change gameversion to one which standard clients has
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> 1. I know
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 4. You will make troubles for that guys from 2.
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> 2. I know
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> 3. I know
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because i bet, you will not tlel them that
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you check for gameversion
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> no one cares about 2.
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I care
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and you should as well, as a developer
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> no why should i
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> if someone is 2. he can go and 1.
14:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you think, that the smallest % is worthless, then wow.
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> and if they change to a non ddnet cheat client it is easier to track
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What?
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You want force people to change their clients
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because you are smarter?
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> no this is nothing for ddnet lmao
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> i dont force them to play there also
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but in fng ppl care about bots
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> and if they see that clients are being blocked which contains cheats
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Are you listening to yourself?
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> they are rolling their eyes and fucking hit connect
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you will take effort to make that "filter", then after one day bot will back
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because it's bad solution
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> sure there will be botters
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> much easier to work around
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> than to code
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but less botters
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and MORE! you even
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> make troubles to normal players
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and other developers, which are not making cheats
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> the filter is running on an fng server since months
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Anyway, try
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it will be your problem
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> about 50% less cheaters
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on your server
14:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> no one complained
14:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good to you.
14:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> other developers can change it easily, normal players can update their client
14:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> or just dont try to play on that server lmao
14:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
