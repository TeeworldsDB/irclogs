09:52  * ChillerDragon what is this *.net *.split and why is connection so instable these days?
09:55 < ChillerDragon> seems like planting a tree requires a shipping address? How should i understand that? xd
10:10 < ChillerDragon> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è can i get you to look into compose binds in vanilla as well? it sadly is even more broken there :/ thanks for the ddnet fix btw
10:11 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
10:12  * ChillerDragon so quakenet added a new srv or something?
10:12  * ChillerDragon i use /me hacks to not bother discord ppl with irc talk
10:13  * ChillerDragon ah no more like they lost a server
10:13  * ChillerDragon ye something like that k
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think the new novice maps should be moved into the perma server and replace 'Basics', 'CandyLand', 'Pados', 'Kobra 2'
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :f3:
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga which one specifically?
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> linear, beyond dreams, inure
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not linear
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats more solo than novice
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, added Beyond Dreams and Inure
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :f3:
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a nobo at this kind of stuff, but i made a blog post about ddnet source code https://edgarluque.com/blog/intro-to-ddnet.html
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (i plan on extending this to explain how to do more stuff) :justatest:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/base is also an abstraction layer over the platform APIs
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÄ
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " it also contains most platform specific code"
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe i worded it bad
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nice, linked in https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2420
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf: could also be linked in the wiki mb
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u send zwelf link
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf is on IRC, shold see pings
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what did he do
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to see it
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> OH
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im retarded
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i understand what you mean now
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for some reason i read as in zwelf did a article too
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It shall be safe to destroy an initialized mutex that is unlocked. Attempting to destroy a locked mutex results in undefined behavior.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how do u make sure a mutex is not locked?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4abf699726a23936bd21db7a9a29d57da7bd349d/src/engine/client/sound.cpp#L373
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it safer to acquire the lock and then unlock it and delete it?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that doesn't sound correct
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46345261/how-to-safely-and-correctly-destroy-a-mutex-in-linux-using-pthread-mutex-destroy
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> between the unlock and delete someone else could lock it
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah, from what i see u usually join the threads and then destroy the lock
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast from code im seeing elsewhere
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, that's safe
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or get all threads into a state where you know they can't aquire the lock
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The combined bind pr we merged concerns me. Given it looked way too simple. Whenever I thought there was a simple fix/improvement in that bind code I broke something else that I didn‚Äôt consider. Just the fact that how combined chords behave w.r.t simple binds is not well defined really makes it harder than one would expect
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sound code is hilarious
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773196268079022160/unknown.png
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "the real shit:"
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know how the sound code works
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we mix sound on our own?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got curious so im kinda learning about it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i also wanted to know if #3167 was obvious
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3167
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could use SDL_mixer
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its another dependency
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not that its a big one tho
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if sound mixing is simple, we can also do it ourselves, no?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it's just adding stuff together?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it rly that simple?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be tm
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I'd guess you add configured_volume * current_displacement of all sound sources
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw we dont have "surround" sound right? if someone hammerhits on ur right u hear it on the right?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember right now xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we do have sounds at specific positions
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2.0.2:
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>  * Implemented 24-bit and surround sound support for FLAC audio files
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl mixer has it out of the box
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggies:
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could already be doing it. I don‚Äôt really remember
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we do stereo
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we don't do surround
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, the simple mixing we do is simple on circuit, it should be trivial in code
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its true it looks simple
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we wanted eq per channel or something like that, it might be worth looking into a library that probably has vectorization which would help with performance
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, and that loop that looks slow also probably vectorizes great
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might even get auto vectorized if iirc and that version of gcc and clang are out
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SDL_MixAudioFormat
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exists in sdl base
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_MixAudioFormat
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This is provided for convenience -- you can mix your own audio data.
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :weird:
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets use openal :BASED:
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine all those sound effects in ddnet
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doppler shift lol, tees might actually be moving fast enough for that to matter
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> @Learath2 it is possible to have cursor data stored in demo
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ideally for spectating too.
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ~~ideally for spectating too.~~
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki nice blog post more pls
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'll just ask about demo, because i have no idea how demo works.
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> also where can i like :D
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> you rly work on a portfolio latley hm?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: also i probably need a lesson on the difference between netobject and netmessage
17:11 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon yeah gotta have stuff i guess
17:11 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon nice to know u like it
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this dude keeps messaging me with this
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773218444874350612/unknown.png
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what it means
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> thinking emoji
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > :thonk: also i probably need a lesson on the difference between netobject and netmessage
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie i think a netmessage is more like a event
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> so like netobject is intended to be packed into snaps?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich is the expert in this
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :EeveeShy:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> netobj is in snaps
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> k
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when do you open a school or a 4 weeks bootcamp to learn tw coding?
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> i would pay 5 bucks lmao good price
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Any intel user on windows already made the october update from windows?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ what do you want to check?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the intel driver is updated by it
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How do I detect if I have the october update?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I get "Feature update to Windows 10, version 2004"
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 19042.610
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/release-information/
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno they say 20H2
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> appearently its still a manual update yet, but will rollout soon
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "manually seek to ‚ÄúCheck for updates‚Äù via Windows Update"
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I did that, installing now, but it's called 2004 for me, not 20H2
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, dunno xD
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/4562830/feature-update sounds like the same
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> super slow for me, I'll check back tomorrow
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know if windows updates intels drivers anyway
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> was just an assumption bcs it was so sudden with all the problems

18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> with both antiping on and off
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it's like the interpolation is wrong or something
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/source-code-watch-dogs-legion-leaked-560gb/
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 560gb
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of sourcecode
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> insane
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats more than my ssd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably also assets?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its still a lot xD
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > it will be interesting to see whether a DRM-free version performs faster than the protected version. After all, Watch Dogs Legion has ridiculously high CPU requirements on the PC.
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this means watch dogs legion will have mods
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe

19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie subpixels
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> huh?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u exactly between two pixels its blurrier
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> than when u close to one pixel
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> also should IntraGameTick ever go beyond 1.5f?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> no. it is shaky
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> not blurry
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its dummy copy or what
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> spec other clients
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its just the network which is limited to 25 ticks
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> (1)TsFreddie is another client
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can enable high bandwidth
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its 50ticks
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: so the intragametick doesn't adapt to 25 ticks?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it cannot predict the future xd
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its like teleporting with antiping
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is not future tho?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how not?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> how is interpolation predicting?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like a cursor has some kind of velocity
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how should it predict something
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is just lerping between two snaps
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what else do you want todo xD
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> idk interpolation should at least make it smooth, but it didn't.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> isn't that wrong?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh, don't think so
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> backward interpolation would just delay it
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and you don't know where the cursor is next tick
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'm doing backward interp for spec
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773249598785191946/unknown.png
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> how is this forward
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok but spec is probs less critical
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then ingame
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still, this might look strange
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho i wonder if this cant cause issues
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when following someone for example
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> btw the video is not using intragametick for cursor
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well as said, the cursor has no velocity or smth, it cannot predict anything
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the client has some interpolation its probably bad anyway
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: no even backward?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well this will create delay
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as you interpolate the past
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> why do you care about delay when spectating?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i assume the cursor is wrong too if you dont spectate?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> huh?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean the weapon movement
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> of the other tee ofc
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> yes. it is wrong for all other clients
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so your idea is to delay the whole spec by 1 tick?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you can interpolate everything
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: i don't get it. i don't care about other tee for now. i just want to know why backward interp is wrong.
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well as said, its interpolating the past
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: i don't get it. i don't care about other tee for now. i just want to know why backward interp is buggy.
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not really nice to have wrong timescales
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'm not saying you should change it to backward or something
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> example:
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you start a hook, but the cursor is still somewhere else
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> the interpolation is janked even if i do backwards interp
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you code is wrong or what do you want to say xD
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk:
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i just want to say
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> intragametick probably shouldn't go beyond 1.5f or something
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it is probably a bug
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ü§® so any idea why?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that always or really just iinside this single calculation?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> definitely not always always. since it depends on the frame time. but intragametick is just a variable, if it is wrong in this routine then it is probably wrong everywhere
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u quickly enable high bandwidth and see if it happens there too
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> sure
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd assume that this happens bcs tw is 50 ticks but the snaps can get as old as 2 ticks
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: but i guess if we really don't care about how other tees looks then we can just leave it as is. (if it is the tick issue)
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well maybe we should use the prediction intra tick for most stuff
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i think in 50ticks server other tees looks fine
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah for the weapon movement this probs doesnt work
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if tw wouldnt have this cancerous snapshot model we could just send individual packets every tick
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> huh
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> with high_bandwidth enabled it feels like it is under interpolating now.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: let me check the intragametick values just to be sure
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> the values looks fine
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> makes sense then üòÑ
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: won't fix?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well as said, for cursors probably unfixable
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all other stuff should just use the prediciton intra tick
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> sad noises
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best would be to update cursors every tick
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would require a unique packet
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> independent of snapshots
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we just need to overtake vanilla
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and fix everything
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: maybe just do some animation style interpolation instead of keeping accuracy.
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> go @TsFreddie get vanilla admin
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what are you trying to do?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> spec cursor
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> spec cursor?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the weapon movement of others tees
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cursor movement of other tees
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh cool
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> show cursors of spectating player
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i guess
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, isn't that already saved tho?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> a better implementation of the thing i made
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> you mean in the demo?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no it isnt saved in demo
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would BE AWESOME to have higher precision too
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> over the protocol only angle is sent
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. the hookline is always wrong
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for the other tee
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> from server to client that is
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think he means like this except actually done correctly rather than drawing a floating tee
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773255437063290890/bot.mp4
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> client do sent cursor position to server.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why don't you forward it along to the client?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> huh? i was forwarding it with a separate netobject
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats the best way to do that
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> should it be snapped since its updated so frequently
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, exactly that, I guess I misread your conversation
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ye.
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> the problem is the interpolation is jank
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What seems to be wrong? Bad interpolation? üòÑ
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> and i have no idea how demo works
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does the demo show cursors even?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i mean it should
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> well not should
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho demos will always have the inaccurate netobj cursor
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> probably nice to have let's say
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's not part of the snap it's not sent
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/sent/saved
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> ye, it is not. also it's not in localplayer as well.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maaaybe for the local tee I could see the entire input being saved, though I don't remember an override there
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'm only sending spectating players alongwith spectatorInfo
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the demo is probably cheating using the angle if it shows the cursor at all
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> i'm only sending spectating players' cursor alongwith spectatorInfo
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> it doesn't
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if it could, the precision is bad
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> so i was trying to ask you if there's a hacky way to just store local players cursor info
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> in demo*
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well invent a new netobj extension
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> could it not be added to snapshot instead
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be nice for ddnet anyway
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> does everything in demo have to be network based?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it current is using the snapshots
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to render stuff
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can do it the same way 0.7 injects the netmessages into the demos
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: i mean if the interpolation could be better it probably won't matter too much. even csgo only has 20tick demo.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There will always have to be interpolation
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tw theoretically has 50ticks
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Demos are still 50 tps
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and 50ticks is ok
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its really just that snaps are only send every 2nd tick
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but the interpolation is over interpolating in 25ticks, and a little bit under-interpolating with high_bandwidth enabled
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well for demos you could just use the next tick for interpolation
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For live you'll need to predict sadly
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> let's not talk about predicting anymore, spectating player's cursor is fine with backward interp thanks.
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> backward interp?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> the term @Jupstar ‚ú™ keep using
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> interpolating the past XD
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> from prev to cur tick
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if there is a term xD
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah, that's fine
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> but that's wrong currently lol
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wrong how?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> prev to cur interp is 
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> > is over interpolating in 25ticks, and a little bit under-interpolating with high_bandwidth enabled
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wait, I don't think that works
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We render at intraticks
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> intraticks is the interpolating stuff no?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> (now-prev)/(cur-prev)
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but as said for 25 ticks
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its 2 ticks per actual tw tick
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like 50/25
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, you don't know what you are interpolating towards at an intratick
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> what? you are interpolating from prev tick to now based on cur tick. both prev and cur is already received
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> hm so either im stupid or i lost a demo ._. is it possible to playback a demo while it is being recorded and does it stop recording?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> shouldn't stop recording
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and you should be able to play it while recording
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> at least on 0.7 :justatest:
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ ok, i have the update now. Intel UHD Graphics 620 driver date: 21.01.2020, driver v ersion: 26.20.100.7810
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlackTreez> guys
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlackTreez> i need aip-race map
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlackTreez> and standard infection mode without classes
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen that sounds bad üò¶
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> windows update finds no further updates, so that's it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then rip intel users
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can we just blacklist this one driver version, switch to gfx_opengl_major 1 for it and show a red warning on startup telling them to update driver?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> better to look bad on it than crash in the middle of a long run
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i get a clear sign from @louis that new drivers don't crash bcs of this bug anymore, yes probably.
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which new drivers
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the newest one had a separate bug
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> (not unique to ddrace client), so i don't want to use it
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what bug?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when i tabbed into/from any fullscreen window there would be a black screen for a second
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just important that we dont blacklist random drivers
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill try again when i have some time
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> probably tonight
21:42 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> > [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf: could also be linked in the wiki mb
21:42 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Yes, thanks for pointing it out
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe also make sure that all the links are archived on web.archive.org
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or archive them yourself üòõ )
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how many gb of data web.archive.org has
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amazing work tho
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but nothing beats https://libraryofbabel.info/
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has every possible book text article ever written
