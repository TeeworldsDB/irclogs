01:22 <+bridge> <visitop> is differents profils in player section is a thing in development ?
01:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @APFFF I don't think I understand your question. But when running a ddnet client or server you can set the config `stdout_output_level 1` to print all `dbg_msg()` calls to the console
01:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> By console i mean your terminal log. If you want the in game console to be more verbose you can set `console_output_level 1`
01:33 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Or if you need a backtrace on crash you can enable debug builds. That depends on your tooling. If you are using cmake it would be `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` if you are using visual studio there has to be some button somewhere that says Debug instead of Release
01:46 <+bridge> <totar> It's available in tclient currently, I don't think there's any plans to add it to ddnet.
07:21 <+bridge> <mian_ku> @deen I change my server IP. Can you delete 121.41.47.41 in the  whitelist and add 47.109.47.122 to the whitelist?
07:22 <+bridge> <mian_ku> @0xdeen  I change my server IP. Can you delete 121.41.47.41 in the  whitelist and add 47.109.47.122 to the whitelist?
07:49 <+bridge> <0xdeen> done, should apply in a min

13:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://obsproject.com/download
14:08 <+bridge> <yrrr_> why is random_float only returning zeroes i dont get it
14:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in which variable are you storing the result?
14:09 <+bridge> <yrrr_> in a float array in my own file i added which i call from control.cpp
14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you hover with your mouse at the assignment and send a screenshot
14:10 <+bridge> <yrrr_> what do you mean with hover mouse at assignment
14:10 <+bridge> <yrrr_> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254770634051817632/image.png?ex=667ab3b7&is=66796237&hm=a75160fe0a76d123e0b71c012755e4d27f8684d8a9a39d45bef505e52eed3572&
14:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so or so it must be float& v: ...
14:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think
14:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else u just create a local variable called v
14:11 <+bridge> <yrrr_> you are right im dumb
14:11 <+bridge> <yrrr_> java exercises at uni poisoned my brain
14:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> normally compilers should warn about dead assignments
14:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i dont blame you
14:22 <+bridge> <zhn> ye it does
15:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i just had a look at the network connection tests in libtw2 and thats super neat! Pretty inspiring to have tests that ensure correct client server communication without actual networking.
15:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/01f6b0464e995b23055b2d003eec597b67d23890/net/src/connection.rs#L948-L1058
15:49 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I was this close to add yet another CI where actual clients and servers talk udp to each other which was such a pain to setup and debug every time.
15:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I might yoink that concept of callbacks for networking to test the state machine.
15:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Also development is so much faster if there is a test that can be run within seconds vs trying to actually connect a client to a server
16:38 <+bridge> <visitop> sadly, I think it would be a great addition
16:38 <+bridge> <visitop> Sadly. I think it would be a great addition
16:43 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> devs i need help
16:44 <+bridge> <egyt> I remembered something
16:44 <+bridge> <egyt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254809353274527825/bildo.png?ex=667ad7c7&is=66798647&hm=6ac14e90080f6f70cc7cb1bbae29c2ad1ca6a08a3b990404267be20bf59a2965&
16:44 <+bridge> <egyt> "Hz" is not translatable
16:44 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> i play blocker on 200ms in 200ms people tp's like can u make a program that fix people movement?
16:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> turn off anti ping
16:45 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> bro i am goona die
16:45 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> if i turn ooff
16:45 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> antiping
16:45 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> my hook will lag
16:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with anti ping it wont get better.
16:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can try `cl_antiping_smooth 1`
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure but u want to predict 200ms into the future üòÑ
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how should it not lag
16:46 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> like i just want to fix the player movment
16:46 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> if u can make a program like that
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at that moement you'll have no anti ping xxd
16:46 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> that will be very help full
16:47 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> jumpstar what if i only enable antiping of hook
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then.. whom do you hook?
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the player is not where you aim too
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the player is not where you aim to
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the player is not moving the hooking should be very smooth
16:47 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> nah ik i play on spg server with 40ms it fell so smotth
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as he moves he will jump around
16:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it has to predict 160ms less into the future
16:48 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> hm
16:48 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> cant we revmocer future some how
16:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can move to the location where the blocker server is hosted
16:48 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> with vpn?
16:49 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> i play rus
16:49 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> 2-1
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no by actually moving there
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like, go on a plane
16:49 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> ah
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fly there
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy a house
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> get kids
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teach them teeworlds
16:49 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> omg
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> be elite family
16:52 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> like can u give me only hook and
16:53 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> hammer antiping
16:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea exiling to russia is a child hood dream of mine to finally do some Copy Love Box block gaming there
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said if the players are not moving at all you have that already
16:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as they are moving it cannot directly work. at least not if your goal is to hit someone with your hook
16:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the goal is pvp
16:56 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> ok and can u give me glow camo skin name
16:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so ping is fucked
16:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didn't valve fix ping somehow? i get headshotted by russian csgo players all the time
16:57 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they have multiple game server locations somehow and optimized their internal ping
16:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imagine one dude playing on ddnet ger and ddnet ger which proxies via blazingly fast data center connection to ddnet rus where the actual game server is located
16:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wasnt proxies the plan anyways to also fix ddos?
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what you could theoretically do is:
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8372
17:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cloudflare for kirby game
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it only works if:
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - the other players have low ping
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - the low ping players purposely accept more lags for themselves xD
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so for a public server it probably wont happen
17:00 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
17:00 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> jumpstar
17:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller, they might have server side prediction or smth
17:00 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> can u gvie me glow cammo name?
17:01 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> nothing
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://skins.ddnet.org
17:01 <+bridge> <mussa_yt> i got it
17:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> purposly accept lags sounds like malicious clients could skip lags xd
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here u can search skins
17:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jumpstar
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> input delays* chiller
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt mean lags
17:01 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> someone called me jumpster back in the days

17:13 <+bridge> <egyt> I guess it is time to make a pull request again
17:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is the translation for a physics unit?
17:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> –ì—Ü
17:19 <+bridge> <egyt> yes
17:21 <+bridge> <egyt> and we have a precedent in a form of `–ö—ñ–ë`/`–ú—ñ–ë` (`KiB`/`MiB`)
17:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so they swapped the B with a 6

17:32 <+bridge> <egyt> 4-ish, learning Esperanto atm
17:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> quadrolingual delta man so it seems then
17:33 <+bridge> <egyt> bruh
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> learn ancient greek
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is what i call worth it
17:36 <+bridge> <egyt> then I'll be able to swear in 4 scripts, yey
17:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd convince ddnet maintainers to allow it as translation for ddnet too
17:37 <+bridge> <egyt> what about Toki Pona
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you provide a font for it
17:37 <+bridge> <egyt> Toki Pona uses Latin script
17:38 <+bridge> <egyt> although there is also a logogram variant
17:38 <+bridge> <egyt> (it is not in Unicode, yet)
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hieroglyphs would be a banger too

20:19 <+bridge> <gojegreen> üòÖ thanks to ai
20:21 <+bridge> <gojegreen> Asked ai for reading teeworlds chat system from github and use harfbuzz to implementing rtl language support in chat üëå
20:23 <+bridge> <gojegreen> A persian guy named "javad" did this with hardcode before
20:23 <+bridge> <gojegreen> https://github.com/MJavad/teeworlds/commit/7898e2ae393285f01d0b36806e1e75d33a52cf49
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc
20:28 <+bridge> <learath2> It's actually a pretty hard problem, harfbuzz can do the text shaping but then we have the issue of mixed text
20:28 <+bridge> <aegisub> fribidi toilet
20:28 <+bridge> <learath2> We'd need a bidi implementation to handle embeddings
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> And after all that is over, we actually also need to right align everything üòÑ I think that final part will never happen
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Our UI code is sooo not built for that
20:30 <+bridge> <gojegreen> So learning english is the best way
20:32 <+bridge> <learath2> Heh, sure, but we should one day properly handle it
21:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://www.badspacecomics.com/
21:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend u read these comics
21:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> short comics like 1 strip page
21:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they rly good

22:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> probably don‚Äôt do that
22:12 <+bridge> <learath2> the hazards of leaving open ssh sessions
22:14 <+bridge> <melo∆û> docker kill $(docker ps -q)
22:15 <+bridge> <archimede67> you assume docker is used? <a:thinking360:394115046994870274>
22:16 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i assume some servers run over docker :o
22:21 <+bridge> <archimede67> did you ever look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts
22:24 <+bridge> <learath2> docker :xDe:
22:24 <+bridge> <learath2> ddnet is a proud utiliser of 0 newfangled technologies
22:24 <+bridge> <melo∆û> :angy: ok fine i will never say anthing again
22:24 <+bridge> <archimede67> when redo all the ddnet infra?
22:25 <+bridge> <learath2> everything runs of some bash and python3 ported from python2 üòÑ
22:25 <+bridge> <archimede67> yeah
22:25 <+bridge> <learath2> I wrote some ansible playbooks to deploy ddnet but I never really liked them very much
22:25 <+bridge> <archimede67> it's an headache when you try to understand how everything works
22:26 <+bridge> <archimede67> especially when you want to make some modification but you don't know where to make them in all the ten thousands scripts there are
22:26 <+bridge> <learath2> It's insanely difficult to get into our infrastructure. I don't know all of it, I only know where to start digging to find the one script responsible though
22:26 <+bridge> <archimede67> i believe having an infra running on top of docker/k8s could improve this a lot
22:26 <+bridge> <learath2> Perhaps deen is the only one that knows where everything is
22:26 <+bridge> <archimede67> Yeah
22:26 <+bridge> <archimede67> I can also dig to know which script to touch
22:27 <+bridge> <archimede67> but how do I test?
22:27 <+bridge> <archimede67> how do I replicate the ddnet infra locally ?
22:27 <+bridge> <archimede67> how do I replicate the ddnet infra locally?
22:27 <+bridge> <archimede67> for example i was looking at how the `record_points` table is filled, used, updated
22:27 <+bridge> <archimede67> (+ seems like the scripts are out of date on the repo)
22:28 <+bridge> <learath2> there is no way to replicate it
22:28 <+bridge> <archimede67> what if I want to make some modifications to this table, and then simulate how it would work on the real ddnet infra? Welp i can't
22:28 <+bridge> <archimede67> exactly, and that's very inconvenient
22:28 <+bridge> <learath2> tables are easy enough but the rest of the infra you just can't
22:29 <+bridge> <learath2> you have to be an admin so you can just test on prod like all of us üòÑ
22:29 <+bridge> <archimede67> ahahah
22:29 <+bridge> <archimede67> *when make me admin then ;)*
22:29 <+bridge> <melo∆û> ey make me mod first!
22:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when you stop playing the game
22:30 <+bridge> <archimede67> i wonder if that's a requirement <a:thinkinghmm:988271308120940625>
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the unwritten rule
22:30 <+bridge> <melo∆û> last time i saw admin's play was stronghold 4 :XD:
22:30 <+bridge> <learath2> I might have a month or two of nothing in august. I might containerize some of ddnet then
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with us, right :3
22:31 <+bridge> <archimede67> *you didn't answer my question*
22:31 <+bridge> <melo∆û> ye! in vc!
22:31 <+bridge> <melo∆û> was a lot of fun actually
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true, chiller was in too
22:31 <+bridge> <learath2> but honestly I'm not even sure how much it'd benefit from containerization, we don't really split servers very much
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's always fun
22:31 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i simp for chiller
22:31 <+bridge> <learath2> our db server is entirely needed to run the db e.g.
22:31 <+bridge> <archimede67> allow devs to have a reproductible environment
22:32 <+bridge> <archimede67> + easier orchestration of servers, easy addition of new servers
22:32 <+bridge> <archimede67> i've seen a lot of scripts and text files to do stuff manually
22:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the speed deen sets up servers cant be manual
22:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do u even gain with docker, isnt it a VM?
22:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it will just run slower xd
22:33 <+bridge> <archimede67> lmao no
22:34 <+bridge> <archimede67> why do you think containers are used in large scale applications
22:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it a vm or not
22:34 <+bridge> <melo∆û> docker is a way to isolate everything
22:34 <+bridge> <melo∆û> no
22:35 <+bridge> <archimede67> @jupeyy_keks you think of a vm = virtualbox or something similar with the GUI that is slow right
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it can limit memory and stuff
22:35 <+bridge> <melo∆û> docker only virtualizes the app layer
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no even kvm is _slow_
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i see, so it does have overhead
22:35 <+bridge> <archimede67> yeah well containers are fast
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe negatable
22:36 <+bridge> <archimede67> and you can use kubernetees-like technologie to have orchestration across multiple machines
22:36 <+bridge> <archimede67> and you can use kubernetees-like technology to have orchestration across multiple machines
22:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this isnt really an argument tho.. i bet most docker containers ship python apps
22:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
22:36 <+bridge> <melo∆û> could wake up rei - he knows his way around kubernetes professionally afaik
22:36 <+bridge> <archimede67> ?xd
22:37 <+bridge> <archimede67> @jupeyy_keks maybe you need to learn about containers
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean most software isnt optimized
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is what i wanted to say
22:37 <+bridge> <archimede67> who talked about optimization
22:37 <+bridge> <melo∆û> blockworlds runs on docker - best ddos protection existing on the master server :dab:
22:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here you did
22:37 <+bridge> <archimede67> no
22:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you implied that large scale applications must be fast
22:38 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i saw that more as a way to tell that docker is used in large scale applications because it can be used - not implying that its fast
22:38 <+bridge> <archimede67> yes
22:38 <+bridge> <archimede67> it is performant
22:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254898546855903456/image.png?ex=667b2ad8&is=6679d958&hm=d3500c156c267975a949b8c03f387e7928624d4fbf123eff8c8ce3c493651b5e&
22:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
22:39 <+bridge> <archimede67> not talking about the underlying app?
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok but why is python used in large scaling apps
22:39 <+bridge> <archimede67> ofc if your app is slow af then it'll be slow no matter if it is containerized or not
22:39 <+bridge> <melo∆û> because its convenient and portable
22:39 <+bridge> <archimede67> because python is easy
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so even if containers add performance penalties it probably isnt an argument
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for many
22:39 <+bridge> <archimede67> it doesn't
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see, so apparently that is more important
22:40 <+bridge> <archimede67> add penalties
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think you are purposely missunderstanding me rn
22:40 <+bridge> <archimede67> also people may not have a use for containers
22:40 <+bridge> <archimede67> but in case of the ddnet infrastructure, i can see how it can all work on top of docker
22:41 <+bridge> <melo∆û> docker allows maximum portability because it fully virtualizes the application layer it uses to run it - it seperates the container from your host machine, and you can run multiple at the same time
22:41 <+bridge> <archimede67> because once you have a container image you can distribute it and for example it can allow us devs to replicate the production environment but locally to easily test our changes to server code, or server db/tables etc
22:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deenis probs against it anyway
22:42 <+bridge> <archimede67> there's not only docker
22:42 <+bridge> <archimede67> there's podman
22:42 <+bridge> <archimede67> which is an alternative
22:42 <+bridge> <archimede67> *of which I just had a certification exam today*
22:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deen is probs against it anyway
22:43 <+bridge> <archimede67> https://podman.io/
22:43 <+bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.vagrantup.com/ is also cool
22:44 <+bridge> <melo∆û> reitw recommended that
22:44 <+bridge> <archimede67> does it follow the https://opencontainers.org/ ?
22:44 <+bridge> <archimede67> does it follow the https://opencontainers.org/ (OCI - Open Container Initiative) ?
22:45 <+bridge> <melo∆û> **never heard about that so idk**
22:46 <+bridge> <archimede67> :kek:
22:47 <+bridge> <archimede67> Well it's a set of standards for containers
22:47 <+bridge> <archimede67> For example it defines the structure of a `Containerfile` (`Dockerfile` for docker)
22:47 <+bridge> <melo∆û> oh vagrant is not a container
22:48 <+bridge> <archimede67> oh what is it?
22:48 <+bridge> <melo∆û> https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant
22:48 <+bridge> <archimede67> ohh
22:48 <+bridge> <archimede67> that sounds cool indeed
22:49 <+bridge> <melo∆û> yeah i sadly suck at containerized envs - docker and kubernetes in general :KEKW:
22:49 <+bridge> <archimede67> :Kek:
22:49 <+bridge> <melo∆û> but i do write rust from time to time!
22:49 <+bridge> <archimede67> time to learn ;)
22:49 <+bridge> <melo∆û> we talked about that before! - while suffering through galactees!
22:49 <+bridge> <archimede67> XD
22:49 <+bridge> <archimede67> We gotta do that again some time!
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @archimede67 r u a server administrator or what
22:50 <+bridge> <archimede67> Nah *not yet*
22:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, but do you want to become one?
22:50 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i may present to you
22:50 <+bridge> <melo∆û> archimedes website!
22:50 <+bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.corantin.me/
22:50 <+bridge> <archimede67> Not specifically but I am interested in containerization, the could blabla modern technologies that is
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> oof
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> nice leak :justatest:
22:51 <+bridge> <melo∆û> when im bored i look at spinny globe for hours
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> lmao
22:51 <+bridge> <melo∆û> its in your damn github bio ...
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> :justatest:
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> *true*
22:51 <+bridge> <archimede67> but honestly i dont like it very much
22:52 <+bridge> <archimede67> i wish i could've done something better but I ran out of time
22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Graduated from a Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science (Image,
22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Virtual Reality, Interactions and Games track) with high honors."
22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> help tsfreddie with his virtual reality
22:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:53 <+bridge> <archimede67> ahaha
22:53 <+bridge> <melo∆û> we all should just help freddie
22:53 <+bridge> <melo∆û> i want to see him succeed in life
22:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let me test if that's true
22:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254902268403388436/image.png?ex=667b2e4f&is=6679dccf&hm=6aca5cd26bcd5b0eabc67559d3d57678247ec8f817a7dc1042b8a9ae5b7fa11e&
22:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
22:53 <+bridge> <archimede67> @tsfreddie need any help? :brownbear:
22:53 <+bridge> <archimede67> Well yeah
22:53 <+bridge> <melo∆û> be glad you didnt put vulkan in there
22:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then he'd be doomed
22:54 <+bridge> <archimede67> why would I put vulkan, i don't know shit about vulkan XD
22:54 <+bridge> <melo∆û> neither does jupsti
22:54 <+bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
22:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tru story
22:54 <+bridge> <melo∆û> **hey chatgpt, so i have this problem here, how do i add the vulkan Renderer to an already existing game**
22:54 <+bridge> <melo∆û> and thus, a 3K PR spawned
22:55 <+bridge> <archimede67> :kek:
22:55 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> vulkan prs start at 5k loc

22:57 <+bridge> <melo∆û> rip jupsti - you broke rule nr. 1
22:57 <+bridge> <melo∆û> you will be missed
22:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant it seriously
22:57 <+bridge> <melo∆û> damn.. maybe i am the bad guy
22:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the game doesnt have multiplayer as far as i can see
22:57 <+bridge> <archimede67> nah
22:57 <+bridge> <archimede67> it's singleplayer
22:58 <+bridge> <archimede67> but we also made a multiplayer game, with our own gameserver wirtten in pure C#
22:59 <+bridge> <melo∆û> archi doing all his comits on english
22:59 <+bridge> <melo∆û> while his friend/s scream at us in french
22:59 <+bridge> <archimede67> XD

22:59 <+bridge> <archimede67> yeah I always use english
22:59 <+bridge> <melo∆û> "ruf zu den waffen, DU FEEDBACK SPIELER"
22:59 <+bridge> <archimede67> LMAOO
22:59 <+bridge> <melo∆û> or smth - idk i dont speak spanish
23:00 <+bridge> <archimede67> :kek:
23:00 <+bridge> <archimede67> its a mix of english and french yes
23:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> du feedback player :lol:
23:00 <+bridge> <melo∆û> spotted!
23:00 <+bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1254903969826738236/image.png?ex=667b2fe5&is=6679de65&hm=b578ceae0eb9ea20a7e0c7ada2ad8036e2176103393726c950da776601cac769&
23:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's a nice insult
23:00 <+bridge> <melo∆û> HAHAH
23:00 <+bridge> <teero777> XD
23:00 <+bridge> <teero777> What does that even mean lmao
23:01 <+bridge> <archimede67> yeah some times i have to write in french so they understand ;)
23:01 <+bridge> <teero777> Like you have slow reaction speed? XD
23:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, it kinda insults a tester
23:01 <+bridge> <archimede67> it means "player's feedback"
23:01 <+bridge> <melo∆û> "du feedback spieler" - would translate to -> you as a feedback giving player
23:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only french word i know is
23:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sauf
23:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:05 <+bridge> <teero777> Oh lol I thought "feedback spieler" was some sort of new insult I haven't heard of xdd
23:05 <+bridge> <teero777> Like backseat gamer
23:05 <+bridge> <teero777> Or smth xd
23:05 <+bridge> <melo∆û> ||**DU SC***S FEEDBACK SPIELER**||
23:05 <+bridge> <melo∆û> oh yeah i can see that
23:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my brain directly interpreted it as insult, even without a meaning
23:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just because of "du"
23:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:06 <+bridge> <melo∆û> ye
23:06 <+bridge> <melo∆û> lmao
23:07 <+bridge> <teero777> :kek:
23:08 <+bridge> <teero777> So what does a feedback spieler do?
23:10 <+bridge> <melo∆û> he tells people they play bad
23:10 <+bridge> <teero777> gpt says it's a guy who gives unprofessional feedback midgamr
23:10 <+bridge> <teero777> xdd
23:10 <+bridge> <teero777> gpt says it's a guy who gives unprofessional feedback midgame
23:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:13 <+bridge> <teero777> Player1: "Dude, can you even aim? Your shots are all over the place. It's like you're playing with your feet."
23:13 <+bridge> <teero777> gpt is brilliant
23:14 <+bridge> <teero777> It's a backseat gamer with his feet on the keyboard
23:17 <+bridge> <learath2> podman :Celebrate:
23:18 <+bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't mind having ddnet more containerised but I'm unsure if we would benefit much from it, it would I guess make deployment simpler, but that's all I can think of
23:22 <+bridge> <archimede67> Yes!
23:22 <+bridge> <archimede67> Both development but also running the whole infra would be much simpler, probably no need for most of those crazy scripts laying all around ddnet-scripts
23:24 <+bridge> <archimede67> I must admin I am looking to make the `/profile` command and thought I might edit the `record_points` table or create a different table, but then how could I test it without being able to replicate what's exactly done in the current ddnet infra
23:39 <+bridge> <learath2> Well the biggest part of the script mess is the website, that won't be helped at all. Then there are all the crons running doing stuff like calculating points, those don't really get helped either
23:40 <+bridge> <archimede67> Yeah the website is another topic...
23:40 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm thinking mostly gameservers will get a container each
23:40 <+bridge> <learath2> the db can go into a container too I guess even though it takes an entire server
23:41 <+bridge> <archimede67> yes
