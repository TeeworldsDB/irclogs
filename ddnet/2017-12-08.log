01:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> at the moment i cant reach steam even    hmm
01:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> i tried teewebs and ive seen some servers, which i couldnt connect to, but thats kinda normal there
01:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991  how can i fix it
01:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> steam? no idea
01:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> i mean UDP (whatever that is😅 )
01:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> check whether you can run other real-time online games
01:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you can't, you can't use UDP over your mobile connection
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> well, i cant even connect to steam to start any game. seems like steam itslef requires UDP too (?) anyway, unfixable then.
01:28 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> teeworlds via mobile internet connection would probably be horrible anyway 😛
01:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> its weird, the LAN doesnt work but tethering via phone-wifi does
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> by the way has the editor bug i had posted reached any attention? i really dont know where i can submit bugs anymore, hmh told me to make it directly on github but i have no idea how that site works, and i dont want to get into it.
01:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/new create a new user account there, and enter title and description of your bug
01:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I can help you with any problems you encounter with the site, if you want
01:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Im 'corneum> that good?
01:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum thanks 😃

17:33 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> anyone knows where i can buy ddos? i would like to ddos valis server
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yo guiis. some1 using kaspersky internet security on his windows?
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its pretty annoying while developing and recompiling and testing. And on ever execution after testing kaspersky goes wild and wants me to press a magnet to the harddrive

19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its pretty annoying while developing and recompiling and testing. And on every execution after testing kaspersky goes wild and wants me to press a magnet agianst the harddrive
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its pretty annoying while developing and recompiling and testing. And on every execution after fresh compile kaspersky goes wild and wants me to press a magnet agianst the harddrive
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> magnet agianst the harddrive ?
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> that was a bit of hyperbole. It does the anti virus stuff. It tells me that my own code is evil and wants me to delete it :c
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> then i have to klick around and tell kaspersky that im ok with the risk ._.
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> annoying af lul
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's rather normal
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you are making new software every compile, antivirus scan it, then it can't find any certificates
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So it tells you, that you doing it on your own risk
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can disable antivirus while progrmaming, don't know other solutions 😛
19:29 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> .-.
21:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Set the development directory as an exclusion. (Or just get rid of the AV)
22:59 <+eeeee> you don't need 3rd party AV in modern windows, the built-in one is good enough
23:00 <+eeeee> and kaspersky is known to be a backdoor for intelligence agencies
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Defender is quite good
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> +1 for builtin windows AV
