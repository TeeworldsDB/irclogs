20:29 <+c0d3d3v> is there a way to stop chating without deleting all the text?
20:35 <@deen> c0d3d3v: could you be more specific?
20:38 <+c0d3d3v> If I write something in the chat during the game, in a critical situation and then I have to react quickly and want to return to the game. But I don't want to send the text because it's not finished and I also don't want to delete everything because it takes too long.
20:42 <@deen> cl_chat_reset 0
20:42 <@deen> personally I would just press enter and keep writing the sentence after the part
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @deen is there a bind to delete the text that chat kept when u put cl_chat_reset 0 ?
20:47 <@deen> bind x chat all " " but it leaves a single space at the start, will be fixed in next version so that you can do 'bind x chat all ""'
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> okay thanks 😄
20:49 <@deen> hm, might actually not be that easy. no parameter has always been handled the same way as empty string, so I'd have to go through the entire code
20:50 <@deen> use this: bind x "cl_chat_reset 1; chat all; cl_chat_reset 0"
21:15 <+c0d3d3v> cl_chat_reset 0 don't works for me... but i found a better solution :D ... just pressing ESC thats exactly what i want
21:19 <@deen> c0d3d3v: ESC does what you want after you set cl_chat_reset 0
21:20 <@deen> the default is cl_chat_reset 1 and then ESC deletes the text
21:22 <+c0d3d3v> deen: ah yes ... cl_chat_reset 0 + ESC is what i want :D 
21:26 <+c0d3d3v> thank you
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @deen okay i'm trying this
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> yeah this is exacly what i needed
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> thank you
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you're welcome
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just press CTRL+C, then ESC and after the part you open chat and press CTRL+V, thats how I do it
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (because in teeworlds the whole input gets "selected" and copied, not only what you selected (because you cant atm and will probs not in the futute))
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i didn't know that chat was selected by default
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> that's a great solution too
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :)
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arch Linux> ddnet ger is blocking connections
