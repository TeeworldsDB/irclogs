00:13 <+Chained> Hi guys, whats the name of the software which is used to show the server performance at https://ddnet.tw/status/ ?
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/BotoX/ServerStatus
00:14 <+Chained> thx :)
00:15 <+Chained> nice previewsite from the developer
00:15 <+Chained> Enable JavaScript you fucking autist neckbeard, it's not gonna hurt you. 
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Savander there is also Qt, you can style it with QSS: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html
00:40 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> or just write QML
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜® Sounds cool
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-usecase-visual.html
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I said that above ðŸ˜¦
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> [11:02 PM] BOTirclink: <heinrich5991> qt and gtk can be customized by css I think
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> <heinrich5991> qt and gtk can be customized by css I think
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
00:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry :<
00:42 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> next time throw some cool links in there ðŸ˜›
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜ƒ
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why does ðŸ˜ƒ get converted to a ðŸ˜„ smiley?
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> :) -> :D
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hm
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> discord likes tooths?
00:47 <@heinrich5991> *teeth :P
00:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
00:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
00:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> still a lot to learn
01:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> C > C++; i just found out that this returns true, and that is is a old joke :o
01:05 <@heinrich5991> C > C++ is at least unspecified behavior, if not even undefined behavior
01:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well, if C has a value
01:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> C++ returns the old value
01:08 <@heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/a/7870653/870079
01:09 <@heinrich5991> you're not allowed to read C another time in the expression if you also increment it
01:09 <@heinrich5991> C > C++ may return true, false, 42, "Hello World!" or delete your hard drive
01:09 <@heinrich5991> (programming in C/C++ is fun)
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> int C; C > C++; returns true
01:10 <@heinrich5991> on your current compiler version, OS, etc.
01:11 <@heinrich5991> the concept of undefined behavior is important in C/C++, you should maybe read up on it
01:11 <@heinrich5991> I have a link, sec
01:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah, havent read about it

01:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> first time contributor
01:17 <@heinrich5991> see above ^^
01:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i know nearly nothing about opengl :/
01:25 <@heinrich5991> I don't know a lot either
01:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> time to learn :)
01:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://learnopengl.com/
01:25 <@heinrich5991> nah. I'm rather going to sleep
01:25 <@heinrich5991> good night :)
01:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> gn :P
01:26 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> good night
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> at least we are lucky and do not have to deal with Vulkan
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is vulkan harder than opengl?
01:30 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> well, yes it is far more complicated, pretty bloated, i mean you need ~1k lines to get a damn triangle on your screen...
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Swap_chain_recreation
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/code/swap_chain_recreation.cpp
01:39 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> as far as I understand it is lots of boilerplate code, so for two triangles you fortunately wont need 2k lines of code, I might even give Vulkan a try when Qt 5.10 is out as it will include some wrapper to reduce the ridiculous amount of code to set things up
04:04 <+eeeee> so what's the plan around shaders PR? we have to check that it really improves perf (especially on intel and other weak gfx), and doesn't break on older systems
04:05 <+eeeee> could also try to condense some copypasta to avoid adding 3.7k new lines
04:07 <+eeeee> should we release some kind of beta client (out of band of regular autoupdate) and ask people to try it?
08:33 <@deen> eeeee: sure, I can do that when the reviewers think it's ready to be tried
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> from a quick glance at the source yesterday, it still keeps the old method of rendering
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @HMH AFAIK Vulkan ist the opposite of bloated
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> OpenGL is the one that is bloated beyond repair, has a stateful API and so on
12:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #862: removed crypto lib from bam.lua (macOS compile improvement) (master...master) https://git.io/v5yuX
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what you recommend learning first? vulkan or opengl
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I said that I don't know either ^^
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I think I read that you usually want to learn OpenGL
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'd learn ogl
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's been around forever, guess it'll stay for quite some time, and even if it becomes obsolete the knowledge doesn;t
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "Vulkan offers programming models that are much closer to how contemporary GPUs work, so if you learn Vulkan, you'll have a better understanding of how the technology really works"
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/3575/should-new-graphics-programmers-be-learning-vulkan-instead-of-opengl
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well i already started opengl so ill continue with it

13:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what i do?? D:
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i found a really good tutorial for opengl
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but vulkan i only could find the oficial one
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> top answer: "Should new graphics programmers be learning Vulkan instead of OpenGL?" "Hardly!"
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (i.e. no)
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i know
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i read more than that
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they also say its easier to go from vulkan to opengl when u know the first
13:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander GTA5 might be a tad too complex to learn for a bot ðŸ˜›
13:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it seems to have understood that if(vehicle == TANK && seepolice) shoot(); which is pretty cool
13:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he's training him
13:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> since may

14:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon is there a reason why you don't compile with cmake?
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i have alot more expririence with bam. And it works fine for me.
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> Never Change a Running System
14:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> kk
14:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> unlike bam, cmake is used by other projects as well btw ðŸ˜ƒ
14:22 <@deen> but there are thousands of cmake versions everywhere
14:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ChillerDragon sooner or later we prolly will nuke bam out of the orbit, so you might want to give cmake a try before then ðŸ˜›
14:22 <@deen> anyone want to make sure the cmake build can be used to release?
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you're missing cross-compilation for that, mainly?
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or instructions on how to cross-compile, that is
14:23 <@deen> well, you have my scripts for building
14:23 <@deen> if you can change them to work with cmake that would be the best :D
14:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> kk
14:23 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release.sh
14:24 <@deen> right now it's basically "bam release && scripts/make_release.py"
14:24 <@heinrich5991> I was tinkering with the CI automatically uploading the releases, so you don't even have to run them locally anymore (+getting nightlies)
14:24 <@deen> yeah, that would be nice too
14:24 <@deen> so we could just grab a package from there and release that
14:25 <@heinrich5991> although we should prboably retain the ability to do releases without them
14:25 <@deen> (even though that would require reproducible builds)
14:25 <@heinrich5991> (see the previous mac outage on travis)
14:25 <@deen> i wouldn't trust them not to have malware either
14:25 <@heinrich5991> do we have reproducible builds?
14:25 <@deen> probably not
14:25 <@deen> git version might land in
14:26 <@deen> ah wait
14:26 <@deen> that's ok
14:26 <@heinrich5991> that's not non-reproducibele
14:26 <@deen> anyway, could check this: https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/Howto
14:26 <@heinrich5991> (in fact, I think that our build doens't work without git right now)
14:26 <@heinrich5991> (which should probably be fixed)
14:26 <@deen> that's bad as well...
14:26 <@deen> I don't have git on mac
14:26 <@heinrich5991> I didn't change anything I just saw the script
14:26 <@deen> ah, then it works
14:27 <@deen> just throws a warning
14:27 <@heinrich5991> print('#define GIT_SHORTREV_HASH "%s"' % os.popen('git rev-parse --short HEAD').readline().strip())
14:27 <@heinrich5991> that thing should prboably be fixed to allow for git not to be present
14:29 <@heinrich5991> deen: btw, reproducible builds across OSs is probably going to be hard
14:29 <@deen> ok
14:29 <@deen> then I will prefer to keep building the binaries myself
14:29 <@heinrich5991> i.e. with cross-compiling and normal compiling both trying to produce the same executable
14:29 <@heinrich5991> ok
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> languages in English are written with capital letters
14:54 <+Learath2> I added some changelog to the past couple of builds
14:54 <+Learath2> oh missed that one
14:56 <+Learath2> well the S for simplified could have been lowercase
15:00 <@heinrich5991> nah, don't htink so
15:00 <@heinrich5991> lemme check
15:02 <@heinrich5991> ok, wikipedia writes it in lowercase
15:07 <+Learath2> feel free to fill in 10.6.7 and 10.6.6, couldn't find anything to put there
15:07 <@deen> (you can also just remove them from the download page)
15:07 <@deen> they were just quick bug fix releases
15:08 <@deen> not sure which ones to keep listed in the long term btw
15:08 <@deen> site is kind of long already
15:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> pagination? ðŸ˜„
15:09 <@deen> I don't believe in pagination, as is obvious when you look at ddnet.tw
15:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why not
15:10 <@deen> pages are used to increase ad revenue
15:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And to improve perforemence for clients
15:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he shouldn't load tons of informations at once
15:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if not needed
15:12 <@deen> maybe browsers shouldn't load the entire site immediately
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe, but I still prefer pages instead of almost infinite scroll  :P.
15:16 <@deen> i guess it's a matter of how much. news articles shouldn't paginate
15:16 <@deen> ddnet.tw probably should
15:16 <+fstd> def needs endless scroll
15:16 <+fstd> all the hip websites have it
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Articles shouldn't be paginated? You mean, every post should be displayed on mainpage
15:17 <+fstd> also a hamburger button.  is there even a hamburger button?
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or certain post shouldnt be paginated
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> There were concept
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you really don't like modern websites, right? ðŸ˜„
15:19 <+fstd> i hate it when websites have html in their javascript
15:19 <+fstd> like html is so 1990s
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> modern website don't means, full of javascript everywhere
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because WE can
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ofc it does
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can do a lot with pure css
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> as i do
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> try loading a modern reactjs angularjs w/e web app
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> without js
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anway, that what you are describing is called one page website
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> withr eact, angular
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> react*
15:21 <+fstd> i tend to call it app-grade
15:21 <+fstd> because it's obviously designed to look like a smartphone app
15:21 <+fstd> which is modern and hip by definition
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup, because webdevs forces
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "mobile first"
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> look
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "<deen> pages are used to increase ad revenue", but we don't have ads (?)
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> definitly the downloads page needs infinite scroll or pagination
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also the skin database
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and  ddnet.tw/releases/all/
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I would like to see in dwonload section
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe list of versions
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> isntead of download links, and descriptions
15:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then if you want to see what were changed, then you click and you have. but it would be a long journy to change it
15:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i guess
15:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> journey
15:54 <@deen> write a script to do it

19:26 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: any idea? https://circleci.com/gh/ddnet/ddnet/1677#tests/containers/0
19:29 <+Learath2> eh think i figured it out
19:29 <@heinrich5991> the fancy log doesn't show up
19:33 <+Learath2> well it's not xz-utils :/
19:33 <@heinrich5991> can you paste the log somewhere?
19:34 <@heinrich5991> circleci doesn't work for me
19:34 <+Learath2> http://paste.pr0.tips/fL
19:35 <+Learath2> but artifact generation does work \o/
19:36 <@heinrich5991> yea, I know where that error comes from
19:36 <+Learath2> oh cmake might be too old to have TXZ
19:36 <@heinrich5991> no, the error is something different
19:37 <+Learath2> well the escape sequence thing doesn't happen on my computer, and the generated TGZ archive looks fine on circle
19:37 <@heinrich5991> it does? hmmm

19:38 <+Learath2> oh nvm
19:38 <+Learath2> the TGZ is empty
19:38 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: sry :P so what's the actual problem?

19:46 <@heinrich5991> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.9/module/CPack.html
19:46 <@heinrich5991> I guess cmake on circleci is reasonably
19:47 <@heinrich5991> old
19:49 <+Learath2> well we could build on a newer ubuntu container but not sure if the builds will be any use then
19:50 <@heinrich5991> we could also install a newer cmake version
19:55 <@heinrich5991> what did you do for josh back then, fstd
