13:25 < pause> hi
13:45 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #84: Balance sending of vote options (DDRace64...voteopslow) http://git.io/Fhq7Dg
13:52 < cris272> hey deen, yes
13:53 < cris272> ops, i am ansering to a old message lol
13:58 < o_be_two> hi
15:31 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
15:35 <@EastByte> I hope deen took it down
15:36 <@EastByte> hm ip is not responding, so I guess datafabrik took it down
15:36 <@EastByte> but we don't have the first of november yet
15:36 <@EastByte> so it might be ddos
15:37 <@EastByte> detective east
15:52 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
15:55 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
15:56 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
15:56 <@EastByte> ddos on rus
15:57 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
16:00 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
16:10 < Savander> EastByte: 
16:10 < Savander> question
16:10 <@EastByte> me
16:10 < Savander> do you have "DDNet 5.3 is out" at the bottom? And you can't update it in DDnet Client?^^
16:12 <@EastByte> yep
16:12 < Savander> so it's bug?
16:12 <@EastByte> I guess
16:12 < Savander> :)
16:20 <@deen> sorry, update message fixed
16:21 <@EastByte> oh hi deen :)
16:21 < Savander> hi :)
16:21 <@deen> i did not, but there are only ictf servers running on GER1
16:21 <@deen> hi
16:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 5 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/UcuTbw
16:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 5fd50e0 def: Fix warning at client start
16:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 28d276c def: Add OGG
16:22 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 a7dafa4 def: Add Opus
16:22 <@EastByte> ogg/opus :o
16:22 <@deen> another train coding session^^
16:23 <@deen> i got the libraries into ddnet statically
16:23 <@EastByte> cool
16:23 <@deen> but the sound comes out as noise so far
16:23 <@EastByte> heh
16:23 <@deen> they also did something weird with the decoded wavpack
16:23 <@deen> not sure what's going on there
16:23 <@deen> I'm busy with other stuff now, so if anyone wants to take a look, go ahead
16:24 <@deen> interesting stuff is in sound.cpp
16:25 <@deen> and i think mapsounds should just be opus, since wavpack is way too big for that
16:26 <@deen> opus sounds great even when 10 times smaller than wavpack
16:29 <@EastByte> that's good
16:30 <@EastByte> evem if it'll end in maps with full music tracks 
16:31 <@deen> We should run a disco server when opus is working
16:31 <@EastByte> =)
16:31 <@deen> servers with music should be much more fun than regular city servers
16:31 < o_be_two> city server !
16:32 <@EastByte> city servers with music would be even more fun :/
16:32 <@deen> EastByte: yes, that's what i mean
16:50 <@deen> that was a ddos on GER1 today
16:50 <@EastByte> okay funny
16:51 <@deen> same on RUS then I guess
16:51 <@deen> but really weird to ddos a server with maybe 5 ictf players
16:51 <@EastByte> so empty instagib servers are the target now
16:52 <@EastByte> maybe eur/ger2 have been attacked already but we couldn't notice it
16:52 <@deen> maybe their target is GER2 and they haven't noticed that we switched servers
16:52 <@EastByte> attackers can't be that dumb
16:52 <@deen> for GER2 we'd have to ask xRothx
16:53 <@deen> he gets a message on ddos
16:53 <@EastByte> okay
16:53 <@deen> you don't get mail from OVH?
16:53 <@EastByte> only on ddos mitigation
16:54 <@EastByte> but I hope the firewall comes first
16:55 <@EastByte> so I'm not informed about an attack
16:55 <@EastByte> except the ones which bypass firewall rules
16:57 <@EastByte> ggr, struggling around with memory management in C and in the end the problem turns out to be a debug message printed add the wrong time
17:04 <@deen> ^^
17:25 < KinG_> deen: when all of my modem ports are closed how can i ping myself from vps with a big packet? ^^
17:25 <@deen> no idea
17:25 < KinG_> okay
17:25 < KinG_> i'm going out
17:25 < KinG_> bye
18:13 <@deen> cris272: read pm
18:50 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
18:50 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 410
18:50 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
18:51 <@deen> people say we're killing teeworlds
18:51 <@EastByte> nah
18:51 <@deen> In German: http://teeworlds-friends.de/Forum/index.php?page=Thread&postID=183398#post183398
18:52 <@deen> especially nice person writes "we know what to do to destroy ddnet"
18:56 < eeeee> yeah they don't really care about teeworlds, just wanna destroy something
18:57 < laxa> deen: is that normal that there are still 2 tournament servers online 
18:57 < laxa> ?
19:00 <@deen> only when another server type is voted, the name changes
19:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: why is milk first on the global points rank, while someone else is first on both on team rank and normal rank?
19:04 < laxa> heinrich5991: that's 2 differents ranking.
19:04 < laxa> he is first on number of maps he finished
19:05 < laxa> but ninja_valik has better ranks overall than him
19:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: scroll down to see how they're calculated
19:05 <@deen> i guess milk just plays for finish, no matter what time
19:05 <@deen> while Ninja_Valik plays for good time
19:09 <@heinrich5991> ah
19:09 <@heinrich5991> thanks
19:35 < KinG_> DDraceNetwork takes over world domination
19:35 < KinG_> seriously?:|
19:35 < KinG_> what's wrong with people
19:36 < KinG_> anyone wants to play a novice map? 
19:48 < pielover88888> Hi, I was wondering what "antiping for weapons" does. It has no explanation, and with a few tests I haven't found a difference with it on or off. What does it do?
19:48 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
19:49 < laxa> !fr-de déjà vu
19:49 < Nimda> Translation: gesehen
19:49 <@deen> hi
19:49 <@deen> pielover88888: try it on a server with ping 300
19:49 < pielover88888> I tried it on a server with ping 800
19:49 < pielover88888> does that count?
19:49 <@deen> try shooting grenade down
19:49 <@deen> or hammering another tee
19:49 < pielover88888> I did.
19:49 < pielover88888> I did.
19:49 <@deen> strange, it works for me
19:49 <@deen> action happens immediately then
19:49 < pielover88888> okay, so it does what I thought it was supposed to do. Make rocket jumping smoother on high ping servers.
19:50 < pielover88888> ..but it doesn't, for me? XD
19:50 <@deen> aaah
19:50 <@deen> it only works if normal antiping is on
19:50 <@deen> (antiping for players)
19:52 <@deen> welcome Edible and _guest 
19:53 < Edible> hello deen 
20:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/-XLxSQ
20:04 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 451cc89 def: Revert "Add option for weapons prediction"...

20:09 <@EastByte> deen: ddos on eur
20:09 <@EastByte> ah
20:09 <@deen> no^^
20:09 <@EastByte> I see
20:09 <@deen> i copied something
20:10 <@EastByte> well that was the first time I saw traffic on the monitor
20:10 <@deen> sorry for alarming you :P
20:10 <@EastByte> np =)
20:16 <@EastByte> hmmm
20:18 <@EastByte> deen: using rand() without srand init always gives extact the same sequence of numbers right?
20:19 <@deen> may be system dependent, dunno
20:19 <@deen> on my system yes
20:19 < pielover88888> all antiping was on when I tested it
20:19 <@deen> pielover88888: doesn't matter, i just removed antiping for weapons because it caused multiple server bugs^^
20:20 < pielover88888> deen: all that does is force me to never update my ddnet client.
20:20 <@deen> pielover88888: why?
20:20 < pielover88888> if an update removes a cool thing, I won't like that update, and will avoid it.
20:20 <@deen> your cool feature doesn't work anymore without server support
20:21 <@deen> and it caused bugs in the server
20:21 <@deen> so i had to disable it or many maps are unplayable
20:21 <@EastByte> updates here always are for a good cause
20:21 < pielover88888> oh, it only worked on specific servers due to the fact that lasers would.. for example, explode, but only on specific configured zcatch servers?
20:21 < pielover88888> makes sense
20:21 <@deen> pielover88888: it never worked on zcatch servers, only on ddnet
20:22 < pielover88888> right
20:22 < pielover88888> I tried it on a vanilla dm1 default config 800ms ping server
20:22 <@deen> aah, that may explain it
20:22 < pielover88888> yep
20:22 < pielover88888> i only play OpenFNG and Vanilla
20:22 < pielover88888> completely useless to me, then.
20:23 <@deen> i'm not sure if we should accept any patches like the antiping for weapons anymore
20:23 <@EastByte> so in the end it was too hard to maintain?
20:23 <@deen> these big patches that change physics stuff always cause some unforseen problems
20:24 <@deen> i got 3 separate bug reports today that were all caused by it
20:25 < pielover88888> would it be easier to implement in vanilla only?
20:25 <@deen> probably, since no one would notice these slight physics changes in vanilla
20:26 < pielover88888> why does it need to change physics?
20:26 < pielover88888> it just needs to assume that firing a weapon will work, and that thing might explode when the predicted grenade hits the ground.
20:26 < pielover88888> And that the explosion will modify your speed somehow.
20:26 <@deen> i didn't actually understand why it was necessary
20:27 <@deen> but they had to transmit some additional information to the client
20:27 <@deen> maybe something went wrong there
20:27 < pielover88888> because on 300 ping servers, rocket jumping just..sits there..and then 300ms later you're not even near where you thought you were
20:27 <@deen> as i said, i didn't investigate but just removed it entirely
20:27 < pielover88888> ...
20:28 <@deen> pielover88888: yeah, i know. But DDRace is unplayable with high ping
20:28 < pielover88888> not with antiping
20:28 < pielover88888> that was kinda the point, right?
20:28 <@deen> it's kind of playable, but not enjoyable i think
20:28 < pielover88888> I suck at ddrace, but I find it enjoyable regardless of ping.
20:28 <@deen> ping should be under 100 in my opinion
20:29 < eeeee> theoretically playing solo could always feel like on localhost even with 1000ms ping
20:29 < eeeee> but playing in team can never be
20:29 < pielover88888> well, I find it perfectly the same as 60 ping with 140ms ping.
20:29 < pielover88888> they just feel the same, with antiping.
20:29 <@deen> where are you from btw?
20:29 < pielover88888> USA
20:29 < pielover88888> I get 60ms ping on USA ddnet servers
20:29 <@deen> hm, not enough action on the USA servers?
20:29 < pielover88888> nope
20:29 <@deen> =/
20:30 < pielover88888> in my experience, the germans are better in all gametypes anyway.
20:30 <@deen> why is teeworlds so unpopular in North America?
20:30 < pielover88888> they own us.. on our own servers. With them getting 200ms ping.
20:30 < pielover88888> idk
20:30 < pielover88888> it's awesome XD
20:30 < eeeee> imo it's just has a high bar for entry
20:30 <@deen> well, just yesterday an American won our Tournament: http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/29/
20:30 < pielover88888> O_O
20:30 < eeeee> so only gets spread thorugh friends
20:30 <@deen> and linux users
20:30 < pielover88888> we need to advertise it :3 jk
20:31 < pielover88888> too many noobs would ruin it
20:31 < pielover88888> keeping it off the radar is good
20:31 <@deen> i installed teeworlds when it first appeared in gentoo repository
20:31 < pielover88888> for example; all the android/blackberry players ruined it ._.
20:31 <@deen> no way, we need all the noobs we can get
20:31 < pielover88888> nah
20:31 < pielover88888> dude they RUIN openfng in the weirdest way
20:32 < pielover88888> their aim, my god, their aim is amazing
20:32 < pielover88888> but they cannot sacrifice. So, a pro on their team has to do it.
20:32 < pielover88888> 5 noobs and a pro wins against 6 pros, every time.
20:32 < eeeee> that doesn't make any sense
20:32 <@deen> in ddrace playing with noobs is fun
20:32 <@deen> maybe your openfng noobs are actually botters
20:33 < pielover88888> nah, our botters don't even use binds
20:33 < pielover88888> very noob botters
20:33 < pielover88888> just constant aiming at nearest person :/ very easy to detect
20:33 <@deen> if you don't want noobs send them over to ddnet
20:33 < KinG_> deen: u didn't think about somthing to prevent using bots? 
20:33 <@deen> KinG_: i worked on it half a day but it didn't work =/
20:33 < KinG_> :|
20:34 < pielover88888> deen: tbh, we ban them. They change the entire way the game is played, almost as much as the Anti-chat kill feature someone added.
20:34 < pielover88888> luckily we nerfed that stupid feature..
20:35 < KinG_> i've always hated boters that's why i want to be the owner of the only iranian server if it's possible :|
20:35 < pielover88888> lol
20:36 < KinG_> deen: evilsaeed don't ban boters cause 80% of block players of iran are boters even himself i really hate that 
20:36 <@EastByte> blocker is the source of all devil
20:36 < pielover88888> yep
20:37 <@EastByte> deen: why do we have the blocker servers in ddnet tab? :/
20:37 < eeeee> liez, blocker is the destination of all evil
20:37 <@EastByte> <->
20:37 < KinG_> it's a cool mode but source of all bots as u said
20:37 < pielover88888> you know how sometimes, like in Kobra map, at the first part.. with just a dummy, it's almost impossible to do.
20:37 < pielover88888> but with a vbot dummy, it's possible and easy.
20:38 < eeeee> openfng and ictf are the source of bots
20:38 < pielover88888> yep
20:38 < pielover88888> and i<gametype>
20:38 < KinG_> vbot dummy?!
20:38 < pielover88888> yep^
20:38 < KinG_> vbot have dummy?!
20:38 < pielover88888> nah
20:38 < pielover88888> sadly
20:38 < KinG_> u know iranian guys made vbot? :|
20:38 <@EastByte> what's vbot
20:38 <@EastByte> I hear it everywhere
20:39 < pielover88888> um
20:39 < KinG_> it's a popular bot between noobs
20:39 <@EastByte> valindur made a bot named vbot
20:39 < pielover88888> basically it's a client side bot
20:39 < KinG_> iranian guys made id
20:39 < pielover88888> and it is the worst type of them, get 13x37 instead
20:39 < KinG_> iranian guys made it*
20:39 <@EastByte> but the term seems to be popular
20:39 <@deen> valindur isn't iranian, we tracked him down pretty well^^
20:39 <@EastByte> it's not only used in tw
20:39 <@EastByte> vbot
20:39 <@deen> ah
20:40 <@EastByte> afk
20:45 < pielover88888> anyway, if you need the vbot to shoot you with a laser so you unfreeze..it's pretty darn good at that.
20:45 < pielover88888> almost impossible to do with a dummy in ddnet client.
20:53 < KinG_> deen: i can't install wine what is a good download manager for ubuntu that can gimme full speed ?i downloaded xdman but it doesn't work
20:53 <@deen> no idea
20:53 <@deen> i use firefox or wget
20:54 < KinG_> they don't give full speed like IDM 
20:54 < KinG_> with firefox i get 80KBps but the same link from IDM i get 230KBps
20:55 <@deen> maybe aria, but I've never used it
20:55 <@deen> and it' command line
20:55 < KinG_> apt-get install aria    ?
20:56 <@deen> no idea
21:01 < pielover88888> KinG_ that's very weird o_o
21:01 < KinG_> what is wierd?!
21:04 < pielover88888> different download speeds in different applications
21:04 <@deen> pielover88888: the download manager probably uses multiple connections at once
21:07 < KinG_> yes
21:07 < KinG_> i configured it to use 64 once but it was so much so i made it 16 but now i don't have my windows :(
21:12 < KinG_> i'm so tired i go to sleep bye guys good night to all of u
21:19 < pielover88888> night
