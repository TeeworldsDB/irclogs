19:01 < bridge> <deen> Manhattan, work
19:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> business man
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> https://bun.sh/ this looks quite interesting
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i refuse
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> joking if its good its good
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i believe same can be made with zig
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc deno is not as fast cuz it uses v8
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think bun made its own
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i believe same can be made with rust instead of zig
20:00 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Could somebody explain why m_ReckoningCore updating each tick? When one tee on server stand still, no direction moves, no cursor moves. Seems should no be so or am I misunderstanding something? (tested on latest master)

21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> C enjoyer
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is this live live?
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or recycle live?
21:44 < bridge> <learath2> Live live
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who is this for ?
21:44 < bridge> <learath2> It‚Äôs starter level CS for harvard undergrad
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So Harvard Students are watching this right now in person?
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And us online at the same time?
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: how even did you come across this?
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yes

21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks fun ngl
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im so Stuck in the video lerato help
21:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Love how he said you have to configure Linux to support arrow key up in the terminal to cycle back your history. He must be using a truly minimal history where this is not the default xD
21:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Distro \*

21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rust moment
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rust so unstable it break all ddnet pipelines
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when selfhosted pipelines
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Would it even fix?
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If we switch to GitLab I‚Äôd share my runner with ddnet
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GitHub is becoming slowly unusable anyways
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The new GitHub feed is so bad might as well switch to Netherlands libre alternative
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let's open a vscode server instance and code all in the same vscode instance
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs fun
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You host
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just bcs it has terminal access? don't be so shy
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude lerato is a thing
21:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This CS50 dude is fun I wonder if they also have x86 assembly
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet that's learath
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd imagine
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He fits the age I assume lerato to be
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you think he is 12?
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> crazy
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But his English is not fancy enough and lerato is also more hacker
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude the guy in the video is a fossil
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 12 years old fossil
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ryo is 12 and lerato is 40
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Change my mind
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from code languages they use it probably fits xd
22:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> harvard is top of the top right
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should teach rust
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> Not for computer science, but still way up there yeah
22:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude the stream changed from building super Mario to building a calculator ‚Ä¶ what a downer
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is actually not teaching general stuff tho
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's fucking boring
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> but C specific printf subteities
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's like lower grades highschool stuff
22:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> go to uni to learn this
22:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i learned this 14y old
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought havard is the elite üòÇ
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is more like a noob class
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> I mean what do you expect, it‚Äôs the first lecture of their first years first computer science class. We all have a decade of experience in C üòÑ
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> one would guess elite unis require entry level knowledge
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> of the most famous language
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i expect them not to start at 0 xD
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> It‚Äôs far better than the sad excuse my uni had for a first C lecture
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> You‚Äôd be surprised how many people enrolled in a CS/CEng program have no clue about programming when they start out
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> but
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> they do be getting in debt
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> to go there
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> in that uni
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> 100k‚Ç¨ debt
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> student loans
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> america dream
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> Most harvard students don‚Äôt pay iirc, very few don‚Äôt get a scholarship at harvard and mit in STEM
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if im honest i dont really believe in elite uni stuff
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the elite programmers are more like transgender anime freaks xd
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not trans tho
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :EZ:
22:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon is elite too
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://www.youtube.com/live/XG9xUxIf73o?si=iVstSn48fgNKHs8A
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Elite
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> KDE
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the spirit
22:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thought it‚Äôs windows
22:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Similar uglyness
22:10 < bridge> <louis> busy city
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i was young i loved manhattan
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now even m√ºnster is too big for me xd
22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u live in new york?
22:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> rly
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> why was not invited
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz im not murican right
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> racist
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
22:13 < bridge> <louis> nope
22:13 < bridge> <louis> visited new york city once though
22:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw today is catalonia day celebration
22:14 < bridge> <louis> meh
22:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> not 11 sept america thing
22:14 < bridge> <louis> its a big split in most top colleges here
22:14 < bridge> <louis> lots of lower class, lots of upper class
22:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> üá®üá¶
22:14 < bridge> <louis> a lot of top colleges don't give scholarships, only financial aid (so they pay what your family is unable to pay)
22:14 < bridge> <louis> so lower class gets full scholarships, middle class gets sorta fucked, and upper class can pay it all anyways
22:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> top schools like those dont rly matter for teaching, they are for making connections because the sons of influential people go to them
22:14 < bridge> <learath2> Who even is able to pay 90k$ a year anyway? üòÑ
22:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i believe uni is not rly for the sake of knowledge much anymore tbh
22:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just politics
22:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> deen
22:15 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, it‚Äôs very good for your future if your deskmates dad owns exxon
22:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im sure mr Manhattan is making 200k
22:15 < bridge> <louis> my parents üò∞
22:16 < bridge> <louis> well we are upper middle class and my parents don't mind taking a chunk out of their retirement ig
22:16 < bridge> <louis> wat
22:16 < bridge> <louis> i mean you'll get a good education wherever u go
22:16 < bridge> <louis> but yeah a lot of top schools are better for networking
22:16 < bridge> <learath2> Make them disown you so you qualify for financial aid <a:_smart:701851736079335424>
22:16 < bridge> <louis> or if u go to a culty school (a&m)
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> uni should be about state of the art knowledge
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> but
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> many if not all
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> are stuck in old ways
22:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> and old knowledge
22:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should be teached more novel stuff than rust even
22:17 < bridge> <louis> become unemployed for the 2 years before you send your kids off üß†
22:17 < bridge> <louis> u lose out on $200k but u make $300k in saved tuition
22:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stonks
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep, same for schools generally
22:17 < bridge> <louis> well
22:17 < bridge> <louis> i dont think any beginner can just jump into rust
22:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my bro is teacher.. and the older teachers don't want to share any material (like papers)
22:18 < bridge> <louis> u need to build up foundational knowledeg
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should be teached new type theory, things like the borrow checker itself
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's so 18 century thinking
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> why would i bother paying so much money
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> to learn generic stuff
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> they should be teaching new type theory, things like the borrow checker itself
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well u also need foundations
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i believe exams shouldnt rly be a thing
22:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i also believe diplomas shouldnt be a thing
22:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You are spoiled selfthought
22:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You get bleeding edge for free
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if there are no certificate exams are pointless
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and people do it for the sake of knowledge
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well companies just need to test the knowledge itself
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> not check if u have a checkmark certificate
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats my ideal wolrd
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks for coming
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> to my ted talkw
22:19 < bridge> <louis> not every employer has the ability to throughly test for all of that
22:19 < bridge> <louis> unless u make some standardized shit
22:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ryo Ted
22:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not that hard, most companies dont do novel stuff
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have a uni certificate cuz i didnt finish it
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> yet i got a nice work
22:20 < bridge> <louis> i feel like its different for cs / tech
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks to this company not only believing in a paper saying u know x by some random mofo
22:20 < bridge> <louis> imagine if ur a molecular biologist or smth
22:20 < bridge> <louis> or engineer or doctor
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho rn the only ones who need oficial certified knowledge are doctors
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and maybe lawyers, but because laws themselves are stiff
22:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and  well any person workign in a place that can endanger themselves or others
22:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> should also need stricter revision
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd defs say there a specific areas
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like building a plain
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everywhere, where life is on play
22:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rocket science
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> elon
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> our certified rocket scientist
22:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know the best
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he even has a checkmark on X.com
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> elon is a royal fellow in uk
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he must be legit
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society
22:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bought for 8 bucks
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> I‚Äôm watching this accounting lecture, the dude asked ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt land depreciate?‚Äù I was genuinely curious. Some kid answered ‚ÄúLand doesn‚Äôt lose value‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúExactly, land doesn‚Äôt lose value‚Äù and just kept going with the lecture.
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tf
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> royal fellows are newton, faraday, darawin, ramanujan, einstein, and in this group
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> elon
22:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its such a joke
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> Land doesn‚Äôt depreciate because land doesn‚Äôt depreciate, thanks boss
22:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i laughed when i found out

22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine naming einstein and musk in the same wikipedia article
22:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im on Matrix i Even edited my message earlier xd
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> land can lose value by global effects or effects in its vicinity
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example if u have land u farm and someone makes a toxic thing nearby
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> u lose value
22:24 < bridge> <learath2> Apparently as far as accounting is concerned we pretend it never loses value, idk why, and he didn‚Äôt explain
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye its a joke
22:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> aint no way they're putting elon on the same pedistal as stephen hawking
22:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
22:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Money loses value faster than land
22:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Money is printed Land is not
22:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Basic supply and demand
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell the arabs
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah wtf, Hawking didn‚Äôt send cool internet satellites into space
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> they print islands
22:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
22:25 < bridge> <louis> i mean land is limited supply no
22:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> hawking did not boost dogecoin for one day
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers
22:26 < bridge> <louis> and population increase so theres always going to be a constant/rising demand for land
22:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> imagine being named annus
22:26 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly, Hawking is basically a nobody compared to Elon
22:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh i thougbt that was a person
22:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What if population starts to decrease and we go to the mars too?
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://news.ucsb.edu/2023/021198/wifi-can-read-through-walls
22:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Random ryo tab
22:27 < bridge> <learath2> Sure but we don‚Äôt consider an increase either. Land value is recorded at book value and is always static
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> accounting should be a thing done in HS
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a shame they never teached me how to handle my money
22:29 < bridge> <learath2> It‚Äôs actually quite simple and ingenious how double entry bookkeeping works
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can teach you how to give me your money
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> im good teacher
22:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs what we have financial advisor jopsiti for
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> gnu has a program
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks for recommending me

22:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :D
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i learned my skillz here

22:35 < bridge> <cyberFighter> but i like crust
22:36 < bridge> <louis> give me dev role now üëπ
22:36 < bridge> <louis> same but only on pizzas
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u run optimizer?
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150893095383224320/default.png
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 5.3KiB
22:40 < bridge> <louis> optimizer for what
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> png
22:41 < bridge> <louis> is there one shipped with client or smth
22:42 < bridge> <louis> or do you want me to update it with the file u sent just now
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, have u ran dilate?
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, we used zopflipng for most stuff
22:42 < bridge> <louis> yes
22:43 < bridge> <louis> if its just dilate i already ran that
22:43 < bridge> <louis> ill dl the file u sent though, i wasnt aware of zopflipng
22:43 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> @jupeyy_keks should update dilate to set empty pixels to black
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it does that since years
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ask deen to update the website tool
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that is still wrong
22:44 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> does it? not the one I've been using
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i think tools for website are generated seperatelly
22:45 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> newer versions of inkscape save fully transparent pixels as background color instead of black, so usually white or so
22:53 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> @jupeyy_keks I tried the dilate.exe that comes with 17.2.1, still white pixels
22:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> optimally, this should indeed not happen
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then let me remove it
22:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also connecting you to like-minded people
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> like-minded and in the same class range
22:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you shouldn't have to pay, education should be free
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i agree
22:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like CS people? ^^
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait but what does that even mean?
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> knowledge should be global, universal, freely accessible, not tied to ads or data collection
22:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's just wrong though, some land does depreciate
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the alpha threshold as far as i can see only affects the calculation for transparent pixels
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it never leaves behind wrong alpha values
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ravie_ravie can u send me a skin?
22:59 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> it means zeroing out invisible pixels so you don't get this mess
22:59 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150898558707449959/image.png
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that's not an issue with the dilate tool tho
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> land in general, no, don't think we're close to using all of the land
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not in germany for the last 20 years
23:01 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> yeah but it should clean it up for more optimized files
23:01 < bridge> <louis> still globally
23:01 < bridge> <louis> we're close to using all the "usable" land no?
23:01 < bridge> <louis> ofc not places like antarctica or the deserts
23:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but that shouldn't have an effect on places where the population doesn't grow
23:03 < bridge> <louis> even if a population doesn't grow land still provides value
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym by usable? I don't think that we're anywhere close to using all usable land
23:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but the reason "population increases hence it's more scarce" doens't apply then
23:04 < bridge> <0xfaulty> based on the data in the Predicted character (on my screenshot) the data is always wrong and because of this it always doesn't match and do re-send, maybe need to create an issue if this is really a bug
23:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, please do
23:04 < bridge> <louis> where's an example of usable land that's not being used in some form
23:05 < bridge> <louis> i guess. but i think in the long term it will apply
23:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think our models all say that population is going to increase
23:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean "used"? it's hard to find something unless you define what you mean by that
23:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis.place
23:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150901059104022608/default.png
23:10 < bridge> <louis> @jupeyy_keks i already uploaded the one u sent earlier?
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but this is without white pixels
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as ravie suggested
23:11 < bridge> <louis> does it not already have no white pixels
23:11 < bridge> <louis> since i dilated
23:11 < bridge> <louis> your past version looked fine in-game
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the tool never did smth like that
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only did what it was designed for xd
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it didnt clear transparent pixels
23:12 < bridge> <louis> yet but even if population stagnates or decreases some amount, land will be in demand
23:12 < bridge> <louis> for farming, production, etc.
23:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but it won't increase in value due to more scarcity then
23:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rather, it should decrease, if population shrinks
23:12 < bridge> <louis> yeah i acknowledged that
23:13 < bridge> <louis> even if population shrinks i dont' think land will necessarily decrease in value
23:13 < bridge> <louis> because land can always provide some sort of monetary value
23:13 < bridge> <louis> i'm confused
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis.place
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is what it looked like
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> enough to show correct ingame
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the white transparent pixels dont matter
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for file size they do
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> esp for skins, which have black border
23:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't sound like an argument that supports the thesis. even if something can always provide monetary value, it might decrease in value. in fact, it should, if it provides less value
23:18 < bridge> <louis> ok ill just replace it again i guess?
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it affect anything network related?
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ig xd
23:20 < bridge> <0xfaulty> just looks like what was supposed to save bandwidth doesn't do that.
23:22 < bridge> <louis> i don't think land will decrease in value in the near future
23:22 < bridge> <louis> unless population decreases by a significant amount
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> land where?
23:23 < bridge> <louis> any land currently on earth used for some commercial purpose
23:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean that sounds trivially disprovable
23:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's probably lots of land that decreased in value in the last 5 years
23:24 < bridge> <louis> let me rephrase it to all land currently on earth then instead of any
23:24 < bridge> <louis> of course specific places will decrease in value due to circumstance
23:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can imagine that as well, especially since the current population will increase a little at least in the next decades
23:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I also feel that statement is different from "land does not decrease in value"
23:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because that sounds to me like I can own a piece of land and its value will never decrease
