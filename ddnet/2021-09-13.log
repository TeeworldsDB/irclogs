11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> :CLOWNguna::CLOWNgunb:
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hm wat dat?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Jupstar ✪)
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> software renderer
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wanted to see how it compares to the GPU 😄
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah right ill test it soon(tm)
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ seems a bit slower as expected 😄
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i love how u filtered out the "bot" out of the command
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> brandsafe instructions
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you also have that phone? 😄
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i guess he tested it on his machine
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think he also has a linux phone
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im sure my phone is just so slow because of manjaro bloat i should get plain arch
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on a real mashine the GPU is ofc faster, but you only had like 80fps... thats beatable by the CPU maybe xD
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if the driver are too bad for example
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its next level flex to respond with "i use arch BTW" when someone asks about your phone
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ngl you made me a bit curious, even if the hardware sucks
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just cool to have xd
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its very cool to have
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and the hardware sucks ass
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but idk how cool it is coming from android
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> android can do a lot of shit already
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> iOS is really shutdown
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it really blows my mind to ssh into my phone
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from a user point android is good
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but from dev point its annoying xD
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we have to wipe it out
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea its cool to run desktop apps on phone
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so its desktop dev
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but also desktop performance requirements bloat software running on potato hardware with immature OS
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i was told some dudes use it as daily driver but i can not imagine that
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its big troll that on that default distro it ships with it forces you to set a digit only password on setup and then exposes a ssh server by default so its really a dev device not for real use
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Phone?! I just tried it on computer 😄
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea thought so
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> juppeyy just drunk
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I only have iphone, can't run DDNet there
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but what os
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hahah deen the apple boi
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u can @deen
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon:
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is also librem5 that runs linux, i wonder if thats faster
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah he has iphone lol
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i got some old iphone5 with teeworlds on it
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was in the app store for a while
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i would sell iphone with tw on it for 5k
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  librem5 is much faster
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> makes more sense for a company phone, it's a bit janky with Android
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> better hardware
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> smoother touch
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> etc
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but also expensive af
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats janky
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The vpn and company-specific apps, since nearly no one is using Android
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u only have a company phone?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and no private one?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent there any android distros made for corporative things
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> crazy
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait do you use your company phone fro private stuff too?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, dual sim with an e-sim
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Just why
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why would I carry two phones around? 😄
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why u want 10 phones xD
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats esim
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 🧠
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just need WhatsApp and a terminal for private stuff and I'm ok
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, there are no company phones here so...
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is e-sim a virtual sim? u dont need a physical sim?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why we still need them
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes whatsapp
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i once had to wait and get a new sim cuz it broke
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> got scratched when pulling it out
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zzz
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yikes wire
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imagine your company completly uses linux, but then whatsapp and iphones xD
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ikr
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ikr
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use XMPP
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> suggest switching to completly usable pinephones
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the company can host a XMPP server
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used to, and had about 2 people to talk to. But I'm not going to convince everyone else to switch to something else
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> revolution
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I even ran my own
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would xmpp for you babe
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have 3 android phones, all are about 5 years old, 1 is bought by me, 2 are free from ppl that bought a new one and didnt want their old ones anymore xD
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> flex
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only 77 to go and i can play yugioh with phones
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xxD
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have xiaomi, china already knows everything about me :monkaS:
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 🇨🇳
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @deen\: does ur company pay for whatsapp?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I use WhatsApp only privately
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Strictly forbidden for anything business related, it can't even see my business contacts I think
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it for transparency, that the company sees all communication?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What do you mean, what is for transparency?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not using Whatsapp?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that you're not allowed to use whatsapp for business stuff
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably because they don't trust them, we are only allowed to use the channels that we are explicitly paying for
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that we have contracts about what happens with the data
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> How can I keep player's character after player disconnected?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check the timeout code
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @HamidReza Like timeout protection?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i would do
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Like that but in a different way
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> like FNG
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I don't want the character to be destroyed before the freeze time completes
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea its like timeout
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> force close ddnet
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in fng i just keep the network connection
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if that is closed it will also notify the gamecontext etc
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea use a client 0day to crash the client and then u have timeout protection
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> my brother using 2-3 phones to keep their business great
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah advanced pack is next xd
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> brothers*

12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I told heinrich I have a minute to look at his PR
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cursed stats hacking
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> f
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aforementioned
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> adjective Mentioned previously.
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that not a word?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> TIL
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> meh seems like i will never have a cross client config \:(
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wait that was eval\_if\_cmd
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> eval\_if was for password manager
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 seems the logic in OnCharacterDeath changed a little, did you check if the correct person gets strong on team kill still?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did not test it, only try to preserve it
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 bors seems to be fine (?)
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, seems equivalent to me
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut whats the state of #4108 btw?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4108
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 um, @fokkonaut's PR seems to be broken, bors won't merge it
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #4114
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4114
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ wym
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ ur linked pr is by nuborn
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but you were unhappy with it
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just suggestions for future?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have stated out my points
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 try to dismiss your declining review
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be cool to have that in before it gets merged @Jupstar ✪
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because we want to design new Objects carefuly
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> didn't seem to work
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll look into the bors logs, sec
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (https://bors.tech)
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I checked that, there seems to be no logs for it or I missed it
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 4114 is even missing there wtf
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, seems to be completely missing, not even "sync pull requests" works
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll merge it manually after the current bors run, okay?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So weird
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the PR is somewhat important, right?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise we could report the bug
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it is important, as current master would introduce a worse version of that netobj and we have no way of revising after a release
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git nobos who dont rebase their pr into a single commit after multiple single line edits
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cc chillerdragon
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I mostly force push fixes into one commit but also try to separate different things into commits
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw if we start using <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/> for our commit messages, we will be able to make changelogs automatically
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then deen doesnt have to work on that too :monkalaugh:
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\:  you suggested keeping the message but what format you want it in?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> something more generic all custom clients share?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, the current way is good
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> reply?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> to ryo or me?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no reply
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and what u referr to?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to you
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ok thanks
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not that its impossible to add bots into chillerbot \:D
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or what do you mean by useful for antibot?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for distinguishing clients
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hm
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not too interested in discussing antibot btw, you can DM me for more info
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> discussing antibot publicly*
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i see
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if you want to ban my bots i can give you a hint all chillerbots with a "z" in the type name are actual cheats
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lile chillerbot-zz chillerbot-z7 chillerbot-zx
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u keep making them
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> to bot on fokkonauts server
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> dont tell him pls
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yesterday i found a game with hook physics that reminded me of ddnet: <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390350/Webbed/>
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> kek
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh no he is here

13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3997 merge or close?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> still considered z series since i will not publish a autowalk bot
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: stop discussing bots
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new release soon?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oke sowwy
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I just decided to go through all open PRs, if that's what triggered your question
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow so active
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 🔥 @heinrich5991
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 🚀
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah if chiller doesnt want to do what we discussed, just close
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: you sure? did you test? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3991#discussion_r707247943I can not really remember all the code i spend a lot of time testing it and do not want to redo it now. Can i blindly do what you said?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do what? change upstream instead?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> change upstream xd
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can you sell it to upstream?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who cares about vanilla except you xd
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ay
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: you're right, I misread the code
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah oke
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you rebase the PR?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has merge conflicts
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ya
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> done
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "rebase" 😛
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but thanks 🙂
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ye i hoped u wouldnt notice
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i never rebase \:D
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u mean like `git rebase master`
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> then it would be on top and no merge commit?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then there would be only one merge commit, not two
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from merging your branch into master
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea sorry next time
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i should make it a habbit
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper slow
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Jupstar ✪)
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 12 fps ingame but took forever to load \:D
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rip
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ty for testing tho xd
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh no
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did i presist some shit now ?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i cant start it anymore
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> X connection to \:1 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah je
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gfx\_majjor 1 fixed it
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> majjor
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 720x360 cant look that bad can it?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it might have reset your resolution
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, @heinrich5991 have you seen the pr jupeyy got in for the serverlist thing?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. wanted to test that
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to ask if you liked it or if you’d prefer to do it another way
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I liked that
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 really great to see you back so actively 🙂
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks 🙂
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the pause was definitely good for me, too
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks, you on of the few persons that spells my name right xD
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most are like juPPPPey XD
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 "ut it kinda locks us in to support the insecure way of using ed25519 keys forever"
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u cant even spell it ur self
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do you mean by that exactly?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u type it different everywhere
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> s / ut / but
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Jup is the prefix
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> star bcs dragonball
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> eyy bcs i dunno
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> jopjap bcs i was 12
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and pppeyy is the suffix
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jupjopjap
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My name was also chosen when I was around 12 😄 I think I found the name deen somewhere on a DragonBall OST CD
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was 13
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my name was also chosen when I was like 12
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf, you know dragonball? nice xD
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who doesnt
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, 50/50 i'd say
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> many dont like anime at all
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki when you verify an asymmetric key over a non-encrypted connection, the verification can be forwarded to another server. you cannot be sure that you're talking to the right server. by supporting it, we'd have to continue supporting it once we get a secure version of that
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am also not a huge anime fan, but if its not ecchi it can be good xD
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i guess thats why parents pick the names and not the newborns
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would we make a secure channel?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. by using quic
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is ddos protection against quic good?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It has quite a heavy respone if it includes the encryption key there
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a "retry" packet that is small
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can send it to avoid reflecting
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.1.2
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can this even be solved without a trust hierarchy?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it actually can
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by talking over an encrypted connection you can make sure that you're *only* authenticating yourself against the person you're talking to
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might not be the right person if you're MITMed, but the person cannot steal that authentication to use against another server
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, so you establish a shared secret and include that as the challange to be signed?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's called channel binding, I think
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, but why does the channel need to be encrypted? We can establish a shared secret over plaintext
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the rest of the channel needs to be secured with the same mechanism
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you could MITM just the authentication
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the only way to completely avoid this is to encrypt everything. Which just won’t happen in my lifetime 😛
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> encrypt/sign everything, yes
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could leave inputs unencrypted imo
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that "lifetime" thing only refers to our programming power, not to you being opposed to it?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Programming power
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, the more we wait the more ranks go unauthenticated the more annoying it will be to ever get ranks on accounts
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was kinda my point in that comment on ryozuki’s pr
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4148 in can I switch our official servers to master again?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that was the plan
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doing so now
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 👍
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> can someone explain why
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/887038749412839574/unknown.png
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why what
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how those numbers related to each other
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont its random xddd
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> :nouis:
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no but, higher teamsizes require smaller items i guess
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if(Team == -3)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         upper16 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     else if(Team == -4)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         lower32 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     else if(Team == -5)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         upper32 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     else if(Team == -6)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         lower16 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     else if(Team == -7)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         lower24 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     else if(Team == -8)
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         upper24 = true;
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from inside the function
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe a bit weird that all these numbers arent in order xD
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `> `48 = -5, -4
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `> `32 = -8, -7
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `> `16 = -3, -6
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `< `16 = -2?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> upper16 isnt next to lower16 for example xD
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah, as you see it was programmed like that
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> this is so complicated
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a troll
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> advantages:
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - you code more carefully
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs you have to focus xD
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :greenthing:
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> dont code while ur high
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> never
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Jupstar ✪ im making ur fng scoreboard for non-team servers and it looks kinda cool already :greenthing:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/887050512749437008/unknown.png
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😮 looks indead nice 😄
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> lmao i broke it
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/887052622991867914/unknown.png
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> hi, can i ask how can i change settings of race maps to short ones
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> or was it removed fom ddrace?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> or was it removed from ddrace?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> or was the opportunity removed from ddrace?
22:48 < crackhead5> linux is free, if you dont value your time.
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Robin720 I'm afraid I don't understand the meaning of "short ones"
22:56 <+Ryozuki> oh this crackhead5 is not here anymore
22:56 <+Ryozuki> sad
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, there are some map types on unique race and probably on other race server. There are shot, medium, long and etc
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, there are some map types on unique race and probably on other race servers. There are shot, medium, long and etc
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that just depends on map length
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no actual setting
