01:14 < BlueBow> hey guys
01:22 <@deen> hi bye
09:05 < laxa> deen: I went back to sleep after my alarm clock rang, so I am late cause of you lol !
10:37 < BlueBow> hey 
11:37 <@deen> laxa: Not like I forced you to stay :P
15:12 < Savander> deen: maybe buy individual VPS for tournaments? Or change your server to server with better bandwidth? Hetzner.de maybe? I just think.. ;]
15:12 <@deen> bandwidth isn't the problem
15:12 <@deen> I have 10 Gbit/s
15:12 <@deen> and i don't want to pay more money for ddnet
15:16 < Savander> http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38
15:18 <@deen> ?
15:21 <@deen> Other servers have higher ping, more ping jitter and are more expensive
15:30 < Savander> Funny bug: http://www.savander.pl/img/FMgNf9Es7807 (Look at my score)
16:09 < EastBite> deen: what about a demo cutting feature in ddnet client:
16:09 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/public/demoslice.webm
16:11 <@deen> Sounds cool
16:11 <@deen> if you want to add it
16:11 < EastBite> I would add three new buttons to the demo player
16:11 <@deen> sure
16:12 <@deen> start slice, end slice, save slice?
16:12 < EastBite> yes
16:12 < EastBite> well, I'm not a gfx guy :D
16:12 <@deen> first demo recording should be fixed though
16:13 < EastBite> you mean autorecording dummy/player?
16:13 <@deen> yeah
16:13 < EastBite> hmm
16:13 < EastBite> yes
16:13 <@deen> and also second client
16:13 < EastBite> second client?
16:14 < EastBite> running two on one computer?
16:14 <@deen> yes
16:14 <@deen> on the same map
16:14 < EastBite> how is that supposed to work?
16:14 <@deen> by saving the temporary demo into different files
16:14 <@deen> because right now one overwrites the other's file
16:15 < EastBite> what about some random id in the file
16:15 <@deen> yes, that would be the fix
16:15 < EastBite> k
16:15 <@deen> like the PID
16:16 < EastBite> looks like you have a lot of work to do :D
16:16 < EastBite> I need to go outside, cya :)
16:16 <@deen> me? :P
16:16 <@deen> I'm hoping someone else will do it
16:16 < EastBite> ^^
19:48 < EastBite> deen: how long does timeouting take?
19:50 < EastBite> okay I had to reconnect
21:01 <@deen> EastBite: timeouting?
21:01 <@deen> you mean timeout protection?
21:01 <@deen> normal timeout is after 100 seconds, timeout protection after 1000
21:30 < EastBite> so clients which used /timeout are kicked later?
21:30 < EastBite> deen: 
21:32 <@deen> yes
21:32 < EastBite> okay
21:33 <@deen> well, they time out, but their character stays in game
21:34 < EastBite> and when occurs the session "rejoin" ?
21:34 < EastBite> only on connect?
21:34 <@deen> when you rejoin and type your timeout code again (so automatically at connect with ddnet client)
21:34 < EastBite> ah
