11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao that comment
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did consider artix for a while but I find it can be a painful experience to use a distro without it's main supported init system
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Devuan is a very janky project because of this
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Raidon> guys who have n-client, i need convert demo
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> convert demo to video? you can use obs or ddnet client too

16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> new macbooks do fit too well with the timer
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, not sure how to work around that
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poor design decisions by mac
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe detect at runtime and move it down? Idk
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hardware rounded corners xd which 7head came up with this
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon hey, looks like my laptop. I hope 86 is your ping and not fps ðŸ˜„
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I never use full screen so I don't mind
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually my fullscreen apps don't extend into the area, how did you set that? (And why would you do that?)
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/924706535450509322/IMG_5227.JPG
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, maybe you compiled your own version instead of using the app. Because my understanding is that in the app we have to set https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsprefersdisplaysafeareacompatibilitymode?language=objc explicitly to enable going into the notch area
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Itâ€™s fps itâ€™s the cheapest pro
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Fresh download on ddnet.tw with factory settings caused to go full screen with nod
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> interesting. 15.8-rc2 too?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (you should also get more fps with that)
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also have the cheapest pro in 16" and get 1800 fps
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't go into notch for me, some setting maybe?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or maybe you're missing a macOS update?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, it's with m1, not m1 pro?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Dunno not my device canâ€™t run any more tests w it. Just wanted to note that a timer movement might be an idea
