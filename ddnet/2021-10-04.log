00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is the SDL lib, the 2.0.16 release, or current master?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2.0.16 release with the 2 patches
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alright
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if somebody with wayland wants to test it, would be nice @nori or someone
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, SDL merges like 200 wayland patches per second, so no idea when it works and when not xd
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why does everyone hate standards?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Belgium ignored the fact that there is a completely usable euPLF system, and they made their own
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 america uses foots for distance
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feet
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for length* xd
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> legs
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dick length
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> differs from country to country
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sometimes wonder if america had like a massive experiment done on it to give rise to the generation before us
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can see a sharp decline in sensible policy in its history
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like did they remove omega3 from formula or add lead to wine to sweeten it?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe its all the leaded petrol they burnt, idk but something is srs off with the previous generation of americans
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> @Kigen did you get your ARIN alloc
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> üòÑ
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/894604844646662154/unknown.png
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Not yet.  Congrats on getting more. üôÇ
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Should be getting it by next week or so then
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> they're usually able to fulfill the entire waiting list
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> I estimate Wednesday for me.
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Based on the current rate of entries disappearing from https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/ipv4/waiting_list/
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> We were #110 for our first placement
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/110
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> and had to wait like an entire week
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> this time #52, same day.
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/52
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> ok bro stop spamming
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> fucking bot
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> For me I am near the end of the list.  Just because I got the idea for how I plan on doing my service just recently.  As before I was always doing the protection privately for people associated with me that already had IPs, etc.
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> How much is a /22 these days
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 20211004\_171620.jpg
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/894613811414306886/20211004_171620.jpg
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> $60k
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki Is this common in spain? What am I supposed to do?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is wrong
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> just walk?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u mean no sun
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its october
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most rainy month
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> if ur talking about the red light
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> you wait until it turns green
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> then you walk
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> yes, those are normal
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> and common.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Hop with 1 foot on the white line. Touch black is dead.
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> üòÇ
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> ARIN only allows people onto the IPv4 wait list if they have less than a /20.  Which is why the IP blocks go for so much these days in the secondary market.  (btw, ARIN also limits transfers for wait list IPs for 5 years after they've been received to prevent people from just turning around and selling the IPs)
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but leasing still works.
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> and also heavily increases in pricing
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Market went from $30/ip to $55/ip average
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yup, and probably smarter in the long haul to lease.  I'm seeing sites leasing /24 for ~$1000usd.
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> speaking about expensive things üòã
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/894616066129535036/56ba3403def1d50020eb991bb1f5e33d-png.png
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Heh.  VM?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> no
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> that's a machine
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> dedicated server
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> I mean the host for VMs. lol
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> nah
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> New router for dallas
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Ah.
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Not smart to lease for long term.
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> We do it for 3x/23
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> 
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Provider can just increase price whenever they like
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Beefing that thing up.  But I am curious what the point is since RSS queues have limits from the NIC.
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Equal the CPU cores with decent NICs.
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> I mean for the IP holder to lease them out.
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> oh yeah, agreed.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Anyway, that 3990x should be able to do 100Gbps line-rate
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> (assuming ~160m pps)
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Nice.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Dual Port Mellanox ConnnectX-6 too
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Dump all that bad traffic.
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> so loads of offload capability
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we shoudl just switch to ipv6 and forget ipv4
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yeah, I got some Mellanox cards, but only the 25Gbps right now.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I found these nerds created their own IX for fun
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2018/04/creating-internet-exchange-for-even.html
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Duel port.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> ConnectX-6 is Dual 100G
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki last time I tried that people had worse routing via ipv6
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that ipv6 fault or isps doing weird stuff
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe some also had better, but people complain when it's worse üòÑ
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ü•¥
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Instagram is down
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> üòê
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yeah, IX have bad routing with IPv6.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> https://instagram.com/
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I also wondered why WhatsApp was down and then tried Facebook, not the smartest move üòÑ
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> But the world badly needs IPv6.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> oh
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Facebook is also dead. nice.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Hopefully forever.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> DNS error for Facebook
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> That would make my day.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> seems like their dns resolver is dead?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Ping request could not find host "facebook.com". Check the name and try again.
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Facebook has just been a very bad influence in the people I've been around.  (I don't use it myself)
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> BGP session for
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> 185.89.219.x
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> is dead
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> (Facebook's NS)
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> lol
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Sounds like you running your own cloudflare
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> ConnectX-6 isn't super huge
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but 5 of those are *technically* enough to handle 1Tbps
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> The problem is the upstream providers.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but I recommend
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but I recommend something beefier than a 3990x in that case
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> @Kigen I doubt all these are dead
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> AS701 - MCI Communications Services, Inc. d/b/a Verizon Business

18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> No.
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just realized that the "Cloudflare guy who offered to help" with DoS protection is actually the CEO: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28676237
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> I was referring to the CF link.
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Not Facebook's problem.
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Don't see a CF link
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Facebook's AS not announcing their IPs is Facebook's issue.
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Agreed
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> What I meant by what I said earlier is about 100Gbps link.
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Just didn't get the context
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Yep. Happens.
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Got a response yet?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Upstream providers offering 100Gbps have been rare in my limited experience.  And fairly expensive when you do find them.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Meh
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not yet.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> If you go with transit providers directly, no problem.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> They'll gladly rent out a 100G line for $25k/mo
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> (assuming we're talking GTT/NTT here)
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> (assuming we're talking GTT/NTT here, not shit Cogent)
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Do you run like any network tools on that box? Like quagga, bird, exabgp etc or something?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Just XDP.
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> Just XDP/eBPF.
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> our switches handle bgp
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a random guy from cloudflare üòÑ
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The firstname@fancytechcompany.com usually implies some sort of high level position

18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know he usually answers
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur inquiries
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> assuming you go with vps / dedicated server providers, no, most will not give you access to 100g lines
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> assuming you go with vps / dedicated server providers, no, most will not give you access to 100g lines
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> most don't even have 100gbps capacity themselves
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/894619323556057138/unknown.png
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mailing bezos is a good way to get escalated on amazon support
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> My limited experience is largely colo.
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> But what I've worked on currently and in the past has no need for 100Gbps so largely never really needed anything more that what a colo provider can offer.
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> You haven't been getting attacked with <600Gbps then
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> You haven't been getting attacked with >600Gbps then
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> but yeah, makes sense.
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yeah, most of the attacks that I've deal with are largely sub 100Gbps.
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Though we did have one that reached just under 200Gbps once when we (gaming community) were at Psychz.
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> I'll never forget the dude that was doing that garbage since he had basically an infinite amount of Steam accounts and VPN accounts.
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Probably some rich person's child or something.  Or just got real spend happy with a credit card.
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Since he literally would tell us it was him attacking, we'd ban him from the server, and he'd always come back.  I think I ended up banning almost every major dedicated server provider.
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly there is no cure to antisocial personality disordere
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly there is no cure to antisocial personality disorders
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yeah, we had at the time been paying Psychz for DDoS protection but theirs was absolute garbage.
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Couldn't even block TCP SYN floods.
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Much less the DNS, SSDP, NTP, etc reflections.
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> We ended up moving the server to OVH and that worked for DDoS protection.  But people hated their pings with OVH.
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon i looked at the source code of what u starred and found code i made lol <https://github.com/swarfey/tw-chatonly/blob/main/huffman.py>
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tw sure is small kek
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk if i made that
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i remember doing some huffman stuff
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <F√§n> no I did not

19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it might be due to some program i had to control the fans

19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> so is facebook and instagram
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they all are from same company
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Facebook, whatsapp, insta still not fixed?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Their engineers for the last 3 hours:
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://youtu.be/ObWrdYQ_6xY
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> It would appear, though I don't know for certain, that they locked themselves out of their own routers.  Basically the only way they had access to their routers being through their BGP routes.
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Which were all withdrawn.  Example #1 of incompetence: status.fb.com
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> The fact they hosted their status page on their own infrastructure was stupid.
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> the internet is a lot cleaner now at least üôÇ
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kigen> Yup.  If only it would die permanently I'd be happy.  But I imagine they will eventually fix their BGP configs.
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> I cant wait to read the RCA. Hope its juicy.
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Teeworlds servers are having a better uptime than facebook üí©  Maybe facebooks asks us how we achieve such uptime
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kigen> So more Facebook incompetence.  Apparently their door access system relies on their network being functional.   So no door access to get to the routers that are down.
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lmao
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kigen> Seems like they're stuck in a catch-22 of their own making.  No backup connections to the routers, no physical access to the routers, just no access at all.  Since all access needs the routers functional.
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And what now? xD
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Completely fucked or what xd
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> $ddos
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> lies
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> @F√§n do you know why sometimes input packets seem to be arriving but game msg packets don't?
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on which server
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> ger1 in this case
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @denkbar
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah eh
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what you mean by game msg
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <saibotu> just normal packetloss probably, input doesnt check sequence iirc
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> forgot to mention that it went on for like 10 seconds. Like a certain sequence checked packet is dropped over and over again
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> game msgs like chat are reliable, I mean
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah so only input is fucked?
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs u said it the other way round
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> exactly, that is why it is weird
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh?
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which way do you mean it now
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> game msgs aren't supposed to get lost or stalled. But that happened in that case.
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> input worked just fine
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> maybe it's due to packet size
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Here u say game msgs are reliable
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> yes, they are, but they got lost, which is weird
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont understand what you mean in any way xd
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You say input packets seem to be arriving but game msgs dont, then u say game msgs like chat are reliable then u say input works fine and then u say game msgs get lost
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so what do you mean now
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> game msgs are reliable by definition, but in practice they got lost <- is this better?
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why are they reliable by definition?
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> because they are sec
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> because they are sequenced and re-send on packetloss
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah you mean that
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it can still happen they get lost
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> right, but they are supposed to arrive at some point due to resend
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Itube> aaa
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but bot during an attack
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but*
22:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then they can also just get lost
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> yup, but why would game msgs be dropped but input just work fine without lags
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Input gets sent often and multiple times per second where game msgs are sent once
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so if one input packet drops you dont notice it at all
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because you send another one anyways
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> next tick
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (i think even more often than tick)
22:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (not i think, i know)
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> yea, that could be the case
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do all game messages dusappear?
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or just sone
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> some*
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> all, for like 10 seconds
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ALL? xd
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so u dont receive any chat msgs? or how do you kno
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> obivously when one gets lost, subsequent game msgs cannot arrive
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc they can
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> I mean, they arrive but are ignored per protocol
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> who r u even btw
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> denkbar
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and how do you know so much about tw protocol when nobody knows you
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe u r vali trying to gather more information on how to improve ur ddoser
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would be denkbar
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> I haven't played for a long time and did some mod development in the past
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah ok
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which mod?
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> hm, good question
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol?
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> I remember doing stuff with build walls and such
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you dont remember what mod you worked on but you do remember how the whole protocol works?
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pretty denkbar who you are
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And if you only "did stuff with build walls"
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then you shouldnt know that much about the protocol :p
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> why not, everyone does some networking in their free time
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vali especially much
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> dunno who that is

22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > JUST IN - Facebook employees reportedly can't enter buildings to evaluate the Internet outage because their door access badges weren‚Äôt working (NYT)
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> topkek
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "clowns cant enter their own circus" xD
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> is it a literal fortress or why don't they just break in? should be pretty cheap compared to a global outage of their services
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> mark lose $6.6 billion so

22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Conspiracy Theories About Facebook Outage Spread Even Without Facebook
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Some people believe the hours long outage may be linked to a supposed data breach that is, most likely, actually a scam.
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddddd
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> One evening without WhatsApp is actually quite relieving
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> maybe someone switches to signal ü§î
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> signal is definitely not the best alternative
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> there is no best alternative
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Robyt3> best is just never talking to anyone about your secrets :thonk:

23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah robyt3 is right
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best is irc

23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ If you're on Arch, install clang-format-static-bin
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm not on debian bookworm, but i guess i'll just download the executable somewhere

23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah that arch thing works, nice \:D
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use VSCodium and use the CMake extension
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it automatically gives you a build dir and also works without problems
