07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @Ravie what happened to this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/blob/main/skins/bluekitty.svg

07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whats wrong with it @TsFreddie ?
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah there is a broken path?
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno how that happened :D, guess i have to export it again
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i splitted the SVGs, so its not ravies fault ðŸ˜„
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok wtf
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in inkscape its not buggy XD
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie can you download it and check too?
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in firefox its even buggier xD

09:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea i saw it on github im hyped thanks heinrich5991 
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> visual bugs like that sometimes happen when zooming but not on export, I usually try to fix them anyway but this one doesn't show up in my svg
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 nice
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> i love how stable it is it swallows bridge and 0.7 traffic without crashing :3
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> any plans to add 0.7 support? heinrich5991 
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1613298132.png
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> this looks weird o.O
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wtf thats cool
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it public?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/wireshark-dissector
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o:
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: plans are there ðŸ˜›
12:48 <+ChillerDragon> nice!
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> My game doesn't start anymore since 15.3.1, it keeps crashing even after entering the main menu.
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The console shows 4 rows of `ANOMALY: meaningless REX prefix used` before crashing, any idea how to fix this?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> OS? how many bits?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> win10 64 bits
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36873664/anomaly-meaningless-rex-prefix-used
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that error message seems to come from some hooking library
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I had to install a new win update just recently, I could try a rollback to the previous update
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/topic/february-9-2021-kb4601319-os-builds-19041-804-and-19042-804-87fc8417-4a81-0ebb-5baa-40cfab2fbfde
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> alright, it starts again after rolling back, but I still get the `ANOMALY: meaningless REX prefix used` errors. It jumped from 4 errors to 7 errors this time
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> make skins load faster, it`s possible with tw engine?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ask it from sdl2 programmers and nvidia/amd/nouveau drivers' contributors
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's directly loads into (gpu) ram
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it directly loads into (gpu) ram
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably possible from tw's side, too
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. by allowing to show the main menu before all skins are loaded
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (talking about the perceived loading time)
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> hey everyone who knows what bug? client dropped. cid=0 addr= ....... reason='Wrong version. Server is running '0.6 805cfab418a4c72e' and client '0.6 626fce9a778df4d4''
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> hey everyone who knows that bug? client dropped. cid=0 addr= ....... reason='Wrong version. Server is running '0.6 805cfab418a4c72e' and client '0.6 626fce9a778df4d4''
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds very concerning
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Queen Julia 5th did you compile your own client? is it based on ddnet?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not a bug, if you want to make changes to the network code in a client you need to fix the nethash
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> no, vanilla , 0.6
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> By fixing the nethash, you are basically promising that you won't break the network as it won't be checked for you anymore
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> no, vanilla 0.6
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, where did you get the client? Teeworlds.com?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> client? i get client from ddnet.tw
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> but i dont update to long time client xd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah can't connect to a vanilla server?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah right, that's the server with the wrong version
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 626fce sounds familiar
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> what mean it xd?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the correct one, where did you get your server? did you modify the server?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 626fce is where I think everyone fixed their nethash. Is 805cfab 0.6.5 or sth?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> from github @heinrich5991
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with git or with the browser? and where exactly?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> git
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (anyway, you can change `if hash == "cb14â€¦":` to `if True:` in scripts/cmd5.py to fix the problem, if you haven't changed the source code)

16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> ok i will try
