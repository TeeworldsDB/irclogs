13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perks> Heyy, I have a problem, sometimes when I'm playing gores my DDNet froze, I can't still move and shoot, but my screen is froze at the frame it stopped
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perks> If I close and open DDNet again it frozes once more at the menus, I need to restart my pc, does any1 knows how to fix it?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> f1, gfx_opengl_major 1, restart client
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do any of you know whether modern ram distributes the data between the modules? e.g. does ddr spread a bank across multiple memory chips?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> iirc, memory module is made of several chips that are are themselves decomposed into bank and then into arrays and subarrays
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so to answer your question, i'd say no, bank is not spread. It would enhance performance but energy cost would be multiplied by n
