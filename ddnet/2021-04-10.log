00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently llvm failed to see through pointers in the optimization(?)
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, glad to see zig gets it right though
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, I see what you mean with the pointer thing
00:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> goes to show llvm still has much to learn
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> he forgot to allow C++ compiler to use AVX instructions as well
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830368139576475678/unknown.png
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Comrade arent all those SIMD stuff disabled for your usual binary distributions
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz some cpus dont support them?+
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, some very old CPUs don't support them
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> by the way, if you want the shortest machine code
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830375972040605736/unknown.png
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> still the same C++ code ðŸ™‚
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster

12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u use chrome now is the best time to switch
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Ability to uncloak 3rd-party servers disguised as 1st-party through the use of CNAME record. The effect of this is to make uBO on Firefox the most efficient at blocking 3rd-party trackers relative to other other browser/blocker pairs
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wasnt chrome adding some anti adblock stuff in chrome 90?
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i blocked 4.000M ads since i installed ublock
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats more of a reason xd
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are removing extension apis
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thus making it harder for ublock to work
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> GLonDirectX12 works fine, around 30% of native GL performance, dont see any rendering glitches
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess some intel user can test it ðŸ˜„
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll create a small tutorial and maybe batch file for the environment variable
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade or maybe it's fixed in trunk? the ir generated looked off to me
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @louis SRY FOR PING, this is opengl to directx12 converter, maybe you can test it(you dont need to switch drivers or anything ðŸ˜„ ) 
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://gist.github.com/Jupeyy/ca2ac80fb9765a9c4370bb9a6b88fb32
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice PAINT key works too, since directx support is just better on windows
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>  minimize/maximize tha app is also very quick
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on opengl it creates a black screen for ~1 ms
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on dx12 its pretty isntant
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, something is wrong with Clang 10 and 11, but it's fine in older versions and trunk, gcc is fine too
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that makes much more sense than such a trivial optimisation going so wrong
15:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> The Discord bot generates a wrong graph if i issue $points. See https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/500032072455290880/830441290898079744

15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> The Discord bot generates a wrong graph if i issue $points. See https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/500032072455290880/830441290898079744  and https://ddnet.tw/players/Scrumplex
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Seems like it uses old data, as it only shows 1674 points, while my profile has 2000+ points
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the dataset got too large to load, I'm looking into how to fix it
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> it has been doing that for 2 months <a:pepecry:566993543504330752>
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Just an idea from the top of my head, but I think you could use a GROUP BY statement to group by day and then SUM the points for the day
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/blob/3a16092e96048924621b34322fe0c7f0e13183f0/cogs/profile.py#L364
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Here I guess -> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/blob/3a16092e96048924621b34322fe0c7f0e13183f0/cogs/profile.py#L364
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> by that you would only have at most 365 data entries per year shown per user
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> by that you would only have at most 365 (366 with leap years) data entries per year shown per user
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh itâ€™s trivial when you have a db connected. The bot relies on pre-generated data we use to generate the website
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The part thatâ€™s failing is the parsing of the massive pre-generated msgpack
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Which is used to populate the db of the bot)
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> having web-api db will be solution imho
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeeh, itâ€™s not exactly cheap this kind of db access. Sure it would solve it but how much more processing power will we need on our db server in exchange?
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (And some statistics take time to actually calculate like most common partners and stuff)
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, you are right, db server would burn :justatest:
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it just needs some buffered reading, I just didnâ€™t have time to look into it yet
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> clustered db?
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Putting a nail in the wall with a hydraulic press :p
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> small box with nails in it! xd
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot/blob/3a16092e96048924621b34322fe0c7f0e13183f0/data/tools/convert_players_file.py fwiw this is the part thatâ€™s failing
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to use the buffered unpacker from msgpack I think
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho it does already look buffered, so what do I know ðŸ˜›
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it does unpack buffered but the result is all in memory at the same time
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thatâ€™s a no go
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this needs external sorting
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 Theres a bot on the chinese discord aswell, maybe their bot works
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe let mysql do the ranking, hm
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie have you surpassed us in technology? ;P
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, Iâ€™ll try to shove it into the database then use a query to do the sorting instead
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, the msgpack is only 11M actually @jao are you like running this on a C64?
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I see the issue
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not memory ðŸ˜›
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this should have been broken for such a long time now :/
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe jao has another version running that he didn't commit to github yet
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, now it makes sense :/
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pf, even getting this running is a pain how am I supposed to have the ddnet module on my computer that thing is a proper mess
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh and most of these ancient scripts are in py2
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the bot is py3 ðŸ˜›
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yet another mess caused by python being the silliest language to be ever invented
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> I couldnt get the bot to work either, it requires uvloop which isn't available on windows
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> is loading a diskcache generated on another system even sane??
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent almost an hour or two now to bolt this together and it just chokes on trying to load the disk cache
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> better use a C64, no python there
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry but @jao will have to either show me how to get this thing even working if I'm to fix it or he needs to fix it himself :/
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> closer to the metal the more fun it is to debug
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh, now that I wasted the 2 hours I'd alloted for cooking and eating I have to either order or have boring pasta ðŸ˜¦
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if u eat meat, eat a python
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> nothing wrong with ordering food ðŸ˜„
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> is expensiv
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or unhealthy
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or both
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> think I'd take nodejs any day over python :/
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 i sent u the latest version
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> the thing thatâ€™s fail isnt on github
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I'm trying to get that working, but loading the diskcache from ddnet.tw fails
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pickle seems to want the ddnet module we have on ddnet.tw which is py2
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even if I bolt it in there patching the obv failures I get a UnicodeDecodeError while it's trying to deserialize
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah ye it uses a py3 version of it
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think we ever made one, you did?
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> it just needs a few functions
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I'll figure it out...
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does anyone know telnet's actual buffer size of tw econ?
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn maybe you are interested in Opengl to dx12
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://gist.github.com/Jupeyy/ca2ac80fb9765a9c4370bb9a6b88fb32
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe the 64bit version works then on nvidia xd
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> I would prefer to try that, but i can't compile 64 bits version
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10535950/forcing-nvidia-gpu-programmatically-in-optimus-laptops/14041061#14041061
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can let github compile it
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```C++
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> extern "C" {
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn>     _declspec(dllexport) DWORD NvOptimusEnablement = 0x00000001;
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> }```*
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can?
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah just fork ddnet and then add it in a commit
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can try to add it, if thats acutally enough ðŸ˜„
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i already have a fork but its quite old, does it work for new forks or old ones too?
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u just need to fetch current source and push the update
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> according to the link, it works for some people, depending on driver version
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/runs/2313923755
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> which file did you add the declaration?
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah i hope it generates artifacts if all except windows fails ðŸ˜„
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> im trying it as well
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> src/engine/client/client.cpp directly above the main() function
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah nice it did upload the artifact tho:
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/actions/runs/736528331
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, im trying it out
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> just need to close other game
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, it failed to compile with mingw ðŸ˜¦
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think mingw doesnt support _declspec
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, it failed before
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh thats strange
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesnt knwo type ```C uintptr_t```
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesnt knwo type ```C
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> uintptr_t```
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, are u not using mingw64?
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think that other mingw is really struggle
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> E:\Teeworlds_DDNet\DDNet-fork\src\base\system.c:3394:10: error: 'uintptr_t' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'intptr_t'?

21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, my installation is from 2014 i think ðŸ˜„
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho i get this with mingw
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> src/engine/client/client.cpp:4275:14: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before â€˜(â€™ token

21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with __declspec it works
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> not working unfortunately
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can't even objdump it, mingw says unrecognized file format
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, you have another error, guess u can only update mingw
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah wait
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, the file you sent me
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesn't use NVidia
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its just opengl related
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> try the dx12 thing xD
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its pretty easy to setup and the performance is quite good
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> hey, i found this on my github page
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/security/code-scanning
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> not sure if you have access to it

21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> seems like there's some code analysis tool running on github ^^
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yes, i think u can just ignore them
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah xd
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but would be nice to fix i guess ðŸ˜›
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its mostly about localtime function
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830522585237946409/unknown.png
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, see you later ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> don't know whyit's so slow
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's because of that WinRAR icon for sure ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u need msvc release anyway
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the mingw release doesnt contain the d3d12 driver
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah i realized that after posting the screenshot, still slow anyway
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> use tor or smth xD
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> some proxy
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> problem is on github's side, not mine
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its probably between both
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the routing between
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, your compiled client was downloaded normally
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then rip xd
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830523435608178719/unknown.png
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, server is one city away
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ur upload
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ;~;
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> bonus for living in a city center, you have optic fiber ðŸ˜‰
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and since one year, city center is quite calm, i wonder why ðŸ™„
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just need 10k, then i could let it built here xd
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> econ's buffer is 1024 bytes
22:36 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I get 250fps ingame only. Is there anything I am not aware of that I need to configure to get full power on windows for grafic output.
22:36 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I use RTX 2080 Ti btw, so fps should be higher naturally
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cl_refresh_rate 0
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gfx_refresh_rate 0
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and vsync off
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what OS?
22:43 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I checked those setting already and there are set to unlimited or off and os is Windoes 10
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with /showall on or what?
22:45 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> showall is not used
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then i assume its a missing driver
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> download latest from nvidia directly
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 250 fps could e.g. be done with a good software opengl implementation
22:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also get around 250, but only with entities
22:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> kamillentee with nightly you can check in f1 what device is used btw
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'd still upgrade the driver
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never use the windows preinstalled thing
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> kamillentroll get out of here
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :whistroll:
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @Jupstar âœª can testing commands be done with a duration? I mean would it be hard to implement?
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> So u can just bind ur super command to stay on for 1 seconds so u wont have to press ur key twice when testing a tight part or Something
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh sounds useful, its definitely possible. you can just create github issue and suggest it ðŸ˜„

23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830547720103002142/message.txt
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Windows user
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> apparently, it's AI malware detection
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i guess those are false positives
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you only need the dlls anyway, but i think graphic apis are often detected xd
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast back in the days on windows i programmed a opengl app and it was detected too xD
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i need ddnet nightly or current version is fine?
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nightly has the advantage of showing you, what driver it uses
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then u can verify it uses dx12
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> current version does it as well i think
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-04-10 23:03:36][sdl]: SDL version 2.0.8 (compiled = 2.0.8)

23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah i mean in f1, but that already looks wrong
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did you run the .bat file?
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> not yet
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny tho
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that it uses nvidia for some reason
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, that's the 32 bit
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum starting script second time didn't start ddnet
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just clikc ddnet.exe
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it shows the prompt and closes it immediately
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it just important that the script set the env var
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> interesting
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u took x64 dlls and x64 ddnet client?
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i assume then, that it sadly uses the intel driver, bcs louis also could start it
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sad that intel doesnt support it, even tho it supports dx12 since gen 6
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also couldnt*
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how to get a log file from command line?
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can do cl_show_console 1
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in a working client ðŸ˜„
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or add a logfile
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> might be better as the console might close too
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> im trying, but it doesnt work as the output is in another console window that closes instantly
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> logfile test or smth like that
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `logfile test` or smth like that

23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should create it where the client is started
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah too bad
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rip
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> intel, my friend and helper
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i even tested it on my mashine lmao, why does it hate progress so much xD
23:12 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Github issues lack tagging (we need at least two groups bugs and feature suggestions). So bad overview. Sometimes not even the author remembers he created an issue for something.
23:12 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> @Jupstar I tried what you said. Installing the driver did not help, but I used the nightly to find out which device is used and it says I use an RTX 3080 for ddnet. Which is built in but the monitor cable is not plugged in this card (just checked that).
23:12 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I try something else now, I have an idea.
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have tags in github issues
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe u cant set them?
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then plug it into rtx 3080? XD
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isnt that card even better
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why are u so rich xD
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how can i unset the variable?
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> so that i can see the normal output to compare
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you dont need to unset it, aslong u use a client without the dlls it will run fine
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as soon as u use the dlls it will use software renderer or this one
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so better just extract a second client
23:15 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I  looked it up, you cant set tags for your own issues and you cant give others the permission rights to set tags on github. So only very few people can do it.
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt know users cant do that, could swear i saw it in other repos
23:16 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I want to sell the 2080 ti
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, well maybe u can set the card in some nvidia settings

23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's the default
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i hoped, when it inits dx12 it just uses the best card
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead of intel
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since dx12 is better supported on windows
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I wish he was rich then i would be too, on the other hand he wouldnt share his richness to his family damn
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, so he showed you teeworlds in first place? well atleast one good thing then? ðŸ˜„
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> yes he did :poggers:
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> then he rq
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> XD
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I always changed my name when playing at night so he couldnt report me to mom
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ur mom is qshar?
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> xd
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> qfart is a troll
23:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Not related to us
23:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I plugged it in the 3080. Now i have 1600fps.
23:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Hm apparently 2080 ti is too bad for tw now.
23:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> still too low
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, except you have a weak CPU
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or playing a GPU intense map
23:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> ryzen 9 3950 x
23:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in entities you should have around 5k-10fps fps
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows i get around 6k-7k fps, and i have a much weaker GPU
23:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, i get max 700fps ðŸ˜„
23:23 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Ah I think I know it. PSU is too weak for two cards
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> nobo i have 2,5k fps with way worse
23:24 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I will take one out so it does not matter I think
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
23:24 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I get 120 fps with entities on my t450s
23:24 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> it really sucks
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Same
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my rx580 > rtx 3080 in tw
23:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :monkalaugh:
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Imagine wasting power to run a rtx 3080 to play nothing but tw with
23:26 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I might do some calculations with it all night when I dont run tw
23:26 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> So its the cheapest gpu in the end
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> thats cheating
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i dont like cheating
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Save by waste
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Big troll
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Use linux, u'll get more fps than windows. 
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Windows is :trash:
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> +
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good to see more linux users
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Windows is :kog:
23:27 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Linux? is that thing still around?
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> m$$ is trembling :BASED:
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> kamillentee trolling again
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its true tho, ddnet runs over 10k fps on linux
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Someone kick
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> same setup just different OS
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Yeah, i got 5fps on windows, and 125 on linux
23:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> What linux would you recommend to me if I ever wanted to switch?
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
23:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> :greenthing:
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Ubuntu
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> that question i normally ask to u
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ubuntu worst
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how skilled you are, so ubuntu or smth easy as that xD
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> dont feed him
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i personally use debian unstable
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Hes trolling
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gentoo
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im switching soon
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> Mint
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from arch
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <m!ki> :troll:
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Konsti :kek:
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gentoo is nice idea, but i dont want to compile everything xd
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> He deleted my mothers windows when i was 12 and installed linux and i was mad cuz i couldnt play my shit flash games anymore
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> XD
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you want to follow the GNU god you should use a GNU approved distro by stallman himself https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Im a nobo using MX
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> super simple
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Manjaro always breaks
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want something familuar do ubuntu so simple
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you wont be a windows normie, you will just be a ubuntu normie
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ubuntu Is the worst linux
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u can jump to the real juice
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Its just few less shit than windows
23:32 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Ryozuki you are a fan of rms but are still using unfree software like discord or steam?
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :monkalaugh:
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://guix.gnu.org/
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based distro
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Steam sucks
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i am sinner
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i try to be closer to rms
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think even rms can't be full rms sadly
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> yes they can
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> look at kamillentee
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> No facebook no discord no whatsapp no Steam no skype
23:34 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I use windows right now and android with gapps
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> u normally dont wingay
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ur probably just too lazy to switch rn
23:34 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> yes
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And accidently bought something with wingay 10
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/wafelack/orion
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to learn lisp
