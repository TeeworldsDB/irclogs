00:22 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it is from the clangd extension though. reloading that extension also resets the warning
00:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what is a "player flag"?
01:02 < bridge> <yrrr_> gcc -v gives me x86_64-w64-mingw32 as target in mingw64 and ucrt64 environments so i think it works with both
01:05 < bridge> <yrrr_> using msys2 clangd should be fine, though i just use the vscode-clangd and it works, but adding -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON should help with finding headers and definitions

04:03 < bridge> <louis> life is hard on the countryside
04:33 < bridge> <Ewan> if you push immediately after you commit like most ppl then there's not a super convenient way to atomically amend the commit
04:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeppers
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> there is a way tho
04:56 < bridge> <Ewan> and u can script it easily
04:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i prefer more commits, it's easier to read intent
04:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> plus there's something funny about "oops" commits
05:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think i miss i3 sadly

12:56 < bridge> <Assa> yes, it's showing down. The image suggest, that it also could go left, do you want to deny that?
12:57 < bridge> <kebscs> True I guess
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> good ðŸ™‚
12:57 < bridge> <kebscs> That's why there's in game entities in editor
12:57 < bridge> <Assa> which you can toggle
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> sorry for asking so mean ðŸ˜„
13:02 < bridge> <kebscs> Np, I see what you mean
13:02 < bridge> <kebscs> Im not graphic designer, I didn't touch tile texture
13:03 < bridge> <kebscs> And idk how good it'll look if it's not corner to corner
13:04 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> if its not corner to corner its much smaller
13:05 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> hmm
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> isn't this only interesting for the editor anyway?
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the hitbox ingame didnt change anyway
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in worst case add an arrow to the editor pickups xD
13:12 < bridge> <_qey> @0xdeen @admins

14:10 < bridge> <zelamusinc> thanks,i need thoze feedbacks
14:10 < bridge> <zelamusinc> thanks,i need those feedbacks
14:16 < bridge> <melon> @sollybunny wake up there's code to review!
14:16 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
14:19 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> OKAY
14:20 < bridge> <melon> I SAID WAIT I'LL REBASE
14:20 < bridge> <melon> 
14:20 < bridge> <melon> anyway add me to maintainer rn or i'll sue
14:20 < bridge> <melon> /s
14:21 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i can squash :D
14:21 < bridge> <melon> :o
14:21 < bridge> <melon> d..damn
14:21 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> for some reason i couldnt fix the merge conflicts tho
14:21 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> apart from just.. taking ur code
14:21 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> but i wanted you to get the pr
14:22 < bridge> <melon> ah i guess i dont allow maintainers to edit my code
14:22 < bridge> <melon> ah i guess i dont allow maintainers to edit my code :Pepega:
14:22 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> theres currently a segfault in master
14:22 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> because im silly
14:23 < bridge> <melon> bruh
14:23 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i hopeu didnt run into it when testing
14:23 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> xd
14:23 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> not the like "magical disapearing segfault which only happens sometimes on startup when previous runs fail"
14:23 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> just like a plain i fucked up manipulating c strings
14:23 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> very fixable
14:24 < bridge> <melon> i see XD
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> ```cpp
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> if(std::holds_alternative<ColorRGBA>(ColoredParts.m_vParts[0]))
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)>     Line.m_CustomColor = std::get<ColorRGBA>(ColoredParts.m_vParts[0]);
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> ```
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> it was actually not the cstring
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> it was the i assumed that all echos would be more than 1 character long
14:27 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> it was the i assumed that all echos would be more than 0 character long
14:57 < bridge> <melon> @sollybunny can i add potato button easeregg
14:57 < bridge> <melon> that does nothing but render a potato in the middle of the screen
14:57 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> make it in one of the corners
14:57 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> then you can have it permanently enabled
14:58 < bridge> <melon> got it
14:58 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> you get to decide where ... the easter egg is
14:58 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> apart from just f1 if you make it a config
15:00 < bridge> <melon> siiick
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> I only need approval from one maintainer or are there any rules I am unaware of?
15:00 < bridge> <melon> some maintainers may approve but not merge when they want another maintainer to look over it aswell
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> Man I wish I could ask questions properly ;_;
15:00 < bridge> <melon> but yes, 1 approval is enough for it to be merged
15:01 < bridge> <kebscs> ok merge <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10000>
15:02 < bridge> <kebscs> client side change anyway
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> I guess this one is too big, @ryozuki can you take a look at #10153 ? I already see other future stuff possibly interfering with it and I maybe want to do some followups on it, it's already so big ðŸ˜¦
15:04 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10153
15:09 < bridge> <melon> gosh @sollybunny how do you not loose your mind working with CUIRects
15:09 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i did, when i redid tater settings
15:09 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> now i know... how to not
15:10 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> loose my mind
15:10 < bridge> <melon> i can tell
15:10 < bridge> <melon> tried adding a smol button in a smol corner in a smol page and i.. cant
15:10 < bridge> <melon> XD
15:10 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> you can cut without setting
15:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> the output to anything
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> ```cpp
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> cuirect body = ...
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> cuirect totar
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> body.vsplittop(50.0f, nullptr, totar)
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> body.vsplitleft(50.0f, totar, nullptr);
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> ```
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> something like that
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i forgot which way the args go around
15:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i appreciate htop not requiring any dynamic memory, beacuse i use it to kill stuff when memory is maxed
15:13 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> idk how it does it
15:13 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> surely ncurses uses alot of dynamic memory
15:13 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> and loading processes means you have to resize
15:13 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> magic
15:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melon where stream
15:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: where stream
15:14 < bridge> <melon> chillerdragon: where stream
15:14 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> backfired
15:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o shiet
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> gave you a review
15:47 < bridge> <patiga> @murpi Where do you maintain the testing discord bot? (I created a Python script that visualizes how much of the map size is taken up by which images/sounds and I'm thinking about adding it to the testing bot)
15:51 < bridge> <murpi> At the moment, locally on my machine only, since I'm constantly making changes, improvements, and additions everywhere in random order ðŸ˜„
15:51 < bridge> <murpi> Give me like an hour and I'll upload the source to github
15:52 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> rename testing bot to "murpis blood sweat and tears"
15:52 < bridge> <patiga> if it is too much work, I could also send you the relevant files
15:52 < bridge> <murpi> fwiw the testing code is relatively unchanged, I just moved around stuff a bit to make it... more readable I guess
16:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what is the different between playerflags and explayerflags
16:37 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess explayerflag is ddnet thing
16:37 < bridge> <kebscs> and the normal ones are from vanilla
17:05 < bridge> <kebscs> @jsaurusrex whats the status on <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8372>? do you want to update it, or do you want me to revive it, fix conflicts, code style etc? I would add you as coauthor ofc
17:08 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> if you wanna get it in go ahead, its a very simple pr, having a link to mine is fine if you're gonna open a new one
17:08 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> at the time i was waiting for tater to change input handling with another pr, besides that its mostly feature ready already i think. Though i remember i was thinking if i should send all the inputs of every player or only those in view. It'd mean it would take a bit before there are no missing preinputs and the prediction is correct if somebody popped into view
17:08 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> gl o/
17:10 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty
17:24 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> and <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8432>
19:02 < bridge> <Assa> this one is scary
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> ^ this works so well even 300 ping playable
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> cl_prediction_margin 300
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean cl_prediction_margin 300
19:37 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean cl_prediction_margin 300, this simulates high ping
19:54 < bridge> <Assa> what is a pre input, can you explain? is this like a buffered input?
19:54 < bridge> <Assa> from the size 200 array I assume it's ringbuffered
19:55 < bridge> <kebscs> if you have high ping, youre behind with whats happening on the server
19:56 < bridge> <kebscs> so server sends you the preinput ahead of your tick, so you can properly predict
19:56 < bridge> <Assa> what it currently doesn't? lol
19:57 < bridge> <kebscs> read original pr, maybe it explains better
19:57 < bridge> <Assa> but it does send you things that already happened and not predictions right?
19:58 < bridge> <kebscs> yea, server doesnt predict
19:58 < bridge> <Assa> ah it uses the client's prediction margin, interesting
19:58 < bridge> <Assa> so if a player turns it off, he may look laggy for you
20:00 < bridge> <kebscs> idk
20:01 < bridge> <kebscs> dont have a high ping server to test every corner case
20:01 < bridge> <kebscs> but it does work well
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That is not the goal of this PR tho
20:05 < bridge> <kebscs> no?
20:06 < bridge> <kebscs> goal of anitping is to improve how it feels on high ping
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The idea is, that a low ping player sarcrifises some of his ping so that a high ping player gets the inputs _earlier_ and that makes the ping seem lower for the high ping player
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But it won't work on a china server
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You cannot magically remove ping
20:08 < bridge> <kebscs> ok
20:09 < bridge> <melon> (Closes PR) would be wrong, rather "supersedes"
20:09 < bridge> <kebscs> does this magic word also close the pr?
20:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> guyz i just lernt how to suggest on github
20:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> \`\`\`suggestion
20:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> change
20:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> \`\`\`
20:11 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> then u can press commit
20:12 < bridge> <melon> i dont remember if any keyword can close a PR
20:12 < bridge> <melon> 
20:12 < bridge> <melon> issues have a lot of keywords, not sure about pr's
20:12 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i thought it was the other way around
20:12 < bridge> <kebscs> closes does close the pr thats why i put it there
20:12 < bridge> <melon> does it? :o - cant find it in their docs
20:13 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess

20:13 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> only resolve fix and close
20:14 < bridge> <melon> they should add supersede in their tbh
20:14 < bridge> <melon> they should add supersede in there tbh
20:15 < bridge> <melon> and ig the docs are incomplete if the PR gets closed with these keywords
20:15 < bridge> <melon> 
20:15 < bridge> <melon> "automatically close the ISSUE when someone merges the Pull Request"
20:15 < bridge> <melon> 
20:15 < bridge> <melon> :angy: - nvm then
21:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> is there a way to choose the default weapon a tee has on kill
22:43 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think there's a setting for hammer?
22:47 < bridge> <louis> u can enable remember weapon selection and then bind r kill; weapon 1 i believe
22:47 < bridge> <louis> u can enable remember weapon selection and then bind r "kill; weapon 1" i believe
22:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh that's true
22:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what's remember weapon selection
23:36 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> thanks for explaining, i forgot to check if kebs properly understood what it does xD
23:36 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> I still think it can help, whilst it doesn't do anything for 2 high ping players to improve the experience. As long as the client side prediction is accurate to the servers (no custom behavior / physics) it will feel like low ping between 2 low ping players with high prediction margins, because the communication time between the 2 is still the same if that makes sense. And for the high ping player it removes a bunch of ping. The more I remember 
23:36 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> not sure how it would fit into the players experience though, it would have to be fully seamless for it to be enabeld i think
23:45 < bridge> <kebscs> if both players are ~50 ping and margin 10, doesnt it predict by at least 1 tick, as original pr says?
23:46 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> its been ages, im not sure ngl
23:49 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> thanks for explaining, i forgot to check if kebs properly understood what it does xD

23:49 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> edit: forgot but the high ping player would feel slightly laggier to the low ping players iirc, depending on the distribution
23:56 < bridge> <pluskz> Is top5team broken in the last commit or is it just me?
