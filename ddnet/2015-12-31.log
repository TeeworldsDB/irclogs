12:52 <@deen> Always great when your hoster's reaction to a DDoS attack is to permanently block all IPv4 packets to your server and shut it down additionally^^
13:25 < vali> hello
13:28 <@EastByte> hellow
13:34 <@EastByte> deen: perhaps running a cronjob which presses the vps start button once a while would be reasonable
13:35 <@deen> EastByte: no, they also added firewall rules
13:35 <@EastByte> permanent rules?
13:35 <@deen> well, i can remove them
13:35 <@deen> but they don't seem to remove them even after the attack stopped
13:35 <@deen> but i have to see that they're there first
13:36 <@EastByte> nothing a bot cannot do :p
13:36 <@EastByte> nvm, it's silly
13:42 <@deen> might be more useful if i change the passwords and give the remaining technical admins access to the server web interfaces
