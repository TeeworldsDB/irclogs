00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is there currently a patch available I can apply to a 0.6 servers netcode to make it compatible with 0.7 clients? In case there isn't, are the protocol changes too big for a universal patch like this to be viable?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Could there even be a server which is compatible with both client versions?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm also interested how @fokkonaut approach the ddnet 0.7 port. Did you apply vanilla 0.7 patches to ddnet or did you apply ddnet patches to vanilla 0.7 or is this more a cherry-pick/rewrite?
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I copy-pasted ddnet code 20+ hours into the vanilla code
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :)
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 20+ pure copy pasting while comparing files from 0.7 and ddnet, then fixing bugs and compile errors, and currently still fixing stuff all the time
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Okay, probably the only viable approach, so much changed that any git solutions would probably fail or be a huge PITA.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So I assume you basically lost all the commit information in the process and you never had to look at the netcode?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, but i do know a lot now since i am constantly working on my F-Client, my F-DDrace server mod and DDNet7 itself
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> do you think a server which is compatible with both client versions would be viable?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now that you say it, I would love to try that. Would be much of a hacky business, but we could give it a try
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I could imagine it being possible, which would be huuuge
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it is probably possible
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> back in the days I made a server compatible with 0.5 and 0.6
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro lets go for it?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Do you know how much they touched the netcode? Is there any fancy handshake/security stuff? Is the basic "message" system still the same? (I don't know much about teeworlds networking)
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Do you know how much they touched the netcode? Is there any fancy new handshake/security stuff? Is the basic "message" system still the same? (I don't know much about teeworlds networking)
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess they finally fixed the sever status vulnerability with a handshake, but that would only be server status
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, it is. They added a token afaik in 0.7, but the messaging is the same (they do have different ones tho, also name changes and stuff doesnt work, skins between different versions would need to be set to vanilla mostly)
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep, i also thought of skins immediatly
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep, i also thought of skins immediately
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No big deal tho
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We can remap a lot for vanilla skins
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So that they dont all have default, but thats another fine tuning thing
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> didnt they change the format of the snapshots a bit too
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh yes
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that shouldnt be a too big deal too
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro 0.7 doesnt handle the playerinfo for example in the snaps anymore, they are net messages now
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> that seems like it would be the most complicated part of this 0.6<->0.7 software
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> unpacking adn re packing the snaps in the different format
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> player-skin(also in snapping functions), indicators, server commands
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> something like that were the biggest changes
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you mean the chat commands?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> They are not much of a big deal, in ddnet7 i still have the old chat system too, to support clients older than 0.7.? (dont remember exactly when chat commands got added)
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Most mods don't touch the netcode at all so what I would love is a patch that applies to most mods with minor manual work that "adds 0.7 support". It should always adhere to 0.6 and just do the least necessary to make 0.7 clients happy.
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i ported fng, and i can remember i changed these things ðŸ˜„
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I managed to port my mod too, after I ported ddnet :D
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wouldnt a client that supports both 0.6 and 0.7 be more useful than a server
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my mod was based on ddnet in 0.6
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually i agree with noby, that a proxy that translates messages, would be most useful
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> client + server is working then
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> servers that support both would be cooler tho, so one would not have to download an extra client ðŸ¤”
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it wouldnt be an extra client
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if for example ddnet client could connect on 0.6 and 0.7
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> people would just use that
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we could simply run our ddnet servers in 0.6 for both versions, so new players can also find filled up ddnet servers
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the 0.7 official ddnet servers are empty
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but actually, someone could also just port the netcode and skin system to 0.7  cleanly.. if someone then wants 0.6, they can still use older client versions
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Btw do you have any usage statistics? Do people actually play on the ddnet7 servers?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we played gores today
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and a multimap server is always full xd
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro official ddnet7 servers are mostly empty, while Law's servers are played
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, thats laws
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but not alot pros yet on 0.7
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Probably all depends on the 0.7 ddnet client
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably yes ðŸ˜„
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think @fokkonaut has one
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 0.6 fng is still more populated than 0.7 fng
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most ppl play ddrace based mods ðŸ˜„
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> alot of people want antiping
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a server that supports both would be better
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 its not a full ddnet client, just some features
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://fokkonaut.github.io/F-Client
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> feature list^
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah @onby so release 0.7 antiping lmfao
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fk u
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u said u just copy pasted code
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The DDNet7 server could potentially introduce new players to ddrace who wouldn't see the gametype at all with the default 0.7 clients
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> someone else is just gonna copy paste code and release it sooner or later
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and if someone wants to try and do a better job than me then go for it
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye and i hope they do it better
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> nice
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/692522996551647331/Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_6.58.57_PM.png
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> turn off high details
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lolol
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and @louis if someone makes a server for 0.7 where ddnet client can join then it would fix both problems
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bro i am not a frontend dev @onby
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and also the problem where i cant change screen res (-.-)
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut new design by @Soreu pro coming soon tm
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and lmao @onby what zooz resolution do you use to get that tree in front of text
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if i resize the window it moves
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/692524077180518440/Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_7.03.13_PM.png
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> macos
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -.-
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> problem?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/692524249612550244/unknown.png
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> small res?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/692524330055368745/unknown.png
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol ima stealer
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeet
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeet
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought i developed that frontend on macos
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well idk
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the size of the window matters
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if i make it large size then i can see the links
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> tbf i have no clue how to fix it either
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> just write the code that fix the problem
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> download and use windows to access the website
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> The code is actually not that bad, except for the part with doodads...
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I mean, small changes and they'd stay behind & be resolution-independent, but I will finish the new design most likely in morning, so... xd
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A server that supports both 0.7 and 0.6 would be quite a hassle tbh, you'd need to dissect and craft the snaps to reinsert the playerinfo where it belongs
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Not to mention duplicate netcode, different tilesets on both client versions, new map features that are not supported by 0.6 clients and probably a lot more tiny details...
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The clients would need some patches as well I guess. Adding 0.7 map support to ddnet client would make sense anyways I guess.
11:16 <@Learath2> What would be great is if we could have a proper extensible map format patch with uuids
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a well documented map format is all i want
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> +1 for the extensible map for mat
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut @ChillerDragon ok, didn't finish this morning, but made some progress at least xd
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> hey, can we add libnotify support for linux? it would be useful when some1 tag you
20:52 <@Learath2> Huh, I was coding that, then I dropped it for some very specific reason that I can't seem to remember now
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oy didn't like it
21:32 <@Learath2> not for teeworlds, I was coding it for ddnet client
21:33 <@Learath2> AH, I couldn't get cmake to link to libnotify
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can help you
22:23 <@Learath2> kinda wrestling with some sdl stuff again
