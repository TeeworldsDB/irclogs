00:02 < bridge> <_qey> Holy fuck, thank you. I wasted like 2 hours trying to figure it out.
00:03 < bridge> <kebscs> np
00:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I chat/whisper: ‚Üê xxxxxx: ok=)I use the voldemort ultimates client but on your servers I don't use any of the features from it.
00:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gg
00:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> another self report
00:28 < bridge> <melon> I made over 5 people actually switch clients on your server by not banning them immediatly
00:28 < bridge> <melon> ü§∑
00:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not much
00:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its honest work
00:28 < bridge> <melon> 5 more than ddnet
00:28 < bridge> <melon> 5 more than on ddnet :justatest:
00:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon>  I chat/whisper: ‚Üê xxxx: I only use the TAS function why I use it, I have lost interest in the game and want a new experience using these functions.
00:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaaa yikes
00:29 < bridge> <melon> :(
00:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melon wanna know easter egg? try writing this in the chat "i am using a cheat client"
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon maybe they should try *vanilla*
01:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good idea
01:04 < bridge> <pioooooo> There should be a open tas client with its own community imo
01:05 < bridge> <Teero> working on an external tool... once I'm done optimizing the physics to not be complete trash
01:05 < bridge> <Teero> I'm working on an external tool... once I'm done optimizing the physics to not be complete trash
01:06 < bridge> <kebscs> if it cant be ran on ddnet servers it might kill voldemort client i guess
01:06 < bridge> <kebscs> or at least people wont be using it for just tas
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whats the point of tassing
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont gain anything
01:08 < bridge> <zhn> optimizing as much as u can
01:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fOr EdUcatiOnaL puRpOseS oNlY
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for actual educational purposes only, tassing is epic
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but people using it "cuz theyre bored"
01:09 < bridge> <zhn> that's the whole point of ddrace btw, but they used for whatever but optimizing runs
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tassing is extremley obvious, just stop it
01:09 < bridge> <zhn> used it*
01:09 < bridge> <pioooooo> I think it's okay if they're not count as valid runs or interfere with normal runs
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but the tools if they are public are... easy to apply to legit servers
01:09 < bridge> <pioooooo> Like what the Celeste community has done
01:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the celeste community is filled with the oposite of toxic little children
01:10 < bridge> <pioooooo> Maybe turn it into some different protocol then normal player
01:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> And openly release it so they don't have to pretend not to be tas
01:11 < bridge> <zhn> no it's unreal with no id system (accounts)
01:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we need accounts
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eeeeeoooo
01:12 < bridge> <zhn> any real improvements' consequence is about dropping old ddnet or integrating account system (actually both)
01:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> I mean it won't make things worse than the current status
01:12 < bridge> <kebscs> you cant tell, its singleplayer
01:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> accounts tomorrow
01:12 < bridge> <zhn> it will mess up protocol for no reason
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> community
01:13 < bridge> <zhn> since it will do nothing against tas players
01:13 < bridge> <kebscs> idk i mostly get positive interactions in game
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which game
01:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> Like tas has their own servers and players idk
01:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> Just separately
01:13 < bridge> <zhn> they did for a while. nothing changed
01:14 < bridge> <zhn> they actually still have em afaik
01:14 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet, moderate maps
01:14 < bridge> <zhn> it's just useless, you can't flex there with your tas ranks xd
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> good for you, i dont xd
01:14 < bridge> <zhn> because everyone use tas
01:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> I don't get it
01:19 < bridge> <zhn> i don't get it too. they use tas to advertise themselves and pollute leaderboard rather than optimizing their runs
01:19 < bridge> <zhn> so you can just assume they're kiddos
01:23 < bridge> <Teero> @gerdoe: yes
01:23 < bridge> <pioooooo> Yeah so I mean after we release something like a official tas that isn't counted as ranks, I would expect things get better
01:24 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk the current tas client tho
01:26 < bridge> <Teero> The problem is that without accounts the "official" system can just be modified since the game is opensource. So you'd basically be shipping a client which can turn into a cheat client with only a few lines of code changed
01:26 < bridge> <Teero> Also people will still try to cheat real ranks even if it might get boring quickly the amount of players is ever increasing
01:27 < bridge> <Teero> Also people will still try to cheat real ranks, even if it might get boring quickly the amount of players is ever increasing
01:27 < bridge> <Teero> especially children, as gerdoe said
01:28 < bridge> <zhn> if people will still have access via old client they just will not use newer. also voldemort maintainer will just not support the protocol. it's shrimple as that
01:29 < bridge> <zhn> it's like adding client anticheat post mortem - there's no sense
01:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> They already do that now tho, so I think it's not making things worse
01:31 < bridge> <Teero> Relieving the bot client makers of writing code is definitely making things worse xd
01:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> They already have the thing, I don't think adding another one would help them much...
01:34 < bridge> <Teero> They do not have well made tas tools
01:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> Oh I thought they did
01:34 < bridge> <Teero> they play slowmo and can reverse/stop. That's all xd
01:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> What about yours
01:35 < bridge> <Teero> it's not public so I'm not saying anything
01:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> :think_bot:
01:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its like god compared to the public ones
01:40 < bridge> <zhn> yeah voldemort maintainer would probably drop the game after teeros being published
01:49 < bridge> <_qey> Never understood that kind of behavior. Does it get you recognition if you fake/cheat your runs? Just‚Ä¶ Why?
01:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I suppose it makes them feel a little bit powerful
01:50 < bridge> <zhn> that's the only way some people on tiktok got their followers btw
01:50 < bridge> <_qey> Knowing you can‚Äôt do shit on your own kind of defeats the purpose.
01:50 < bridge> <zhn> one of projects tried to advertise with tas runs publishing them on tiktok too
01:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but you're also getting a lot of people pissed off anonymously, and you're kinda leaving a mark by putting your name on the top of that leaderboard
01:51 < bridge> <zhn> making good tas run is hard btw, especially with nothing but replay bot. you have to be skilled in first place, kids use it instead of play the game and polishing their skills since its easier and more enjoyable ig
01:52 < bridge> <totar> you don't technically need accounts to fix TAS but the cure is not very appealing
01:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's like tagging a mcdonalds bathroom stall, very high class behavior
01:52 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, that's too
01:52 < bridge> <zhn> but anyway if ddnet would have account system everything would be slightly better from moderation/administration pov
01:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> also flexing pov
01:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> *Slightly*
01:54 < bridge> <totar> the account protocol requires a secure communication channel, which lowers the traffic on the account server but IMO it's not worth it
01:55 < bridge> <totar> it would have been really easy to start with inefficent protocol over insecure channel like openid connect and then upgrade later
01:55 < bridge> <_qey> Kids be kids, not much you can do about it. It‚Äôs surprising how sparse the age span is on DDNet.
01:57 < bridge> <_qey> Are you the guy making some TaterClient I‚Äôm hearing about all the more lately?
01:58 < bridge> <_qey> For some reason players asking me if they will be banned for playing with this particular client, does it have cheat functions?
01:58 < bridge> <totar> yes, no
01:59 < bridge> <_qey> For some reason players are asking me if they will be banned for playing with this particular client, does it have cheat functions?
02:37 < bridge> <always> or just copy and paste it into voldemort client
02:40 < bridge> <zhn> outcame is obviously the same, right
02:40 < bridge> <zhn> outcome*

08:48 < bridge> <Teero> element works fine
08:52 < bridge> <melon> Oh hi
09:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki how to make a signed const in irvm?
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> a int type has no notion of sign
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the instruction you use
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki>  Div {
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki>         lhs: Operand,
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki>         rhs: Operand,
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki>         signed: bool,
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki>         /// If the exact keyword is present,
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki>         /// the result value of the udiv is a poison value if %op1
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki>         /// is not a multiple of %op2 (as such, ‚Äú((a udiv exact b) mul b) == a‚Äù).
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki>         exact: bool,
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki>     },
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess u say that cuz Operand::Constant takes a u64
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> which i should change
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what would you change it to?
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> Operant::const_int
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think there was a library
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> for arbitrarly sized numbers
09:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot the name
09:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://lib.rs/crates/rug maybe this
10:33 < bridge> <remakepower> I plan to work on NetworkTranslator. Could someone provide any suggestions?
11:53 < bridge> <kebscs> Any review on #9902? It's ready, part 2 of concerns in comments already in another pr
11:53 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9902
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki how cursed is this?
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub trait IntoInt {
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     fn into(self) -> u64;
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> // probably will be put in a macro to implement for i8/16/32/64
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> impl IntoInt for i16 {
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     fn into(self) -> u64 {
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         use std::mem::size_of;
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         let mut bytes = [0; size_of::<u64>()];
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         bytes[..size_of::<Self>()].copy_from_slice(&self.to_ne_bytes());
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         u64::from_ne_bytes(bytes)
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     }
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fn main() {
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     assert_eq!(IntoInt::into(-1i16), u16::MAX as u64);
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I want to use this trait for `Operand::const_int` function, so it would take an argument which implements this trait instead of `u64`
12:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not use the crate num
12:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has traits for numbers
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw u kow u can use self as u64?
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
12:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i found `num_traits` crate
12:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im gonna build such a monstrosity
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye num traits is like the standard for this
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> // Each player can also have a spectator char whose name plate is displayed independently
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(GameClient()->m_aClients[i].m_SpecCharPresent)
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     const vec2 RenderPos = GameClient()->m_aClients[i].m_SpecChar;
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     RenderNamePlateGame(RenderPos, pInfo, 0.4f);
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> // Only render name plates for active characters
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(GameClient()->m_Snap.m_aCharacters[i].m_Active)
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     const vec2 RenderPos = GameClient()->m_aClients[i].m_RenderPos;
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     RenderNamePlateGame(RenderPos, pInfo, 1.0f);
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is the spectator char indepndent
12:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cant there only be 1 nameplate per player at a time?
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Work layer by layer, start by first making a teeworlds connection possible. For that, iirc you need to handle token translation and packet header translation.

13:19 < bridge> <Assa> oh java is also big, I know companies build around them
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> this is like posting the "main car manufacturers" of the world and just listing 3

13:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> john, rebecca and zoe

16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> me? xD
16:23 < bridge> <Assa> from you all (including you)
17:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Hi I'm @soulyvevo , the balls are great, I don't know about more balls for stronger, I like either the rubber band or the claw but not both. I think I prefer the claw
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> claw would either be behind the Tee or we would need to change some rendering logic there, in an uneasy way üò¶
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> would you still prefer the claw with half of it behind the Tee?
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> maybe put a huge fishing-hook at the end which sticks out üôà
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You could have another component just for claws or render them in players.cpp. both solutions but idk how you could do it cleanly
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> hmm
17:28 < bridge> <Assa> does the client know, if it's hooked? I have no idea
17:30 < bridge> <chairn> it does know for prediction i'd say
17:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think so yes.On ddnet servers it should know the hookedid of all visible players or something like that. Which you can reverse to who hooked you
17:34 < bridge> <Assa> I found the prediction code for draggers, so we could set a flag and render a hook over it in player.cpp, I don't know if this works
17:34 < bridge> <Assa> but I can try üòÑ
17:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> WTF is Bro cooking
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> We were talking about grabbers/draggers/pulleys and not about players hooking each other ^^
17:40 < bridge> <Assa> Wait we can make grabbers look like hooks ü§Ø
17:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> For the sake of complexity just do the rubber band thing for now, you can always do grabbers later
17:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is a NetworkTranslator?
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Woaw cooking
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> But they don't act like hooks
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It translates the networks
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> yeah :/ I don't believe anyone would ever do this if we don't do it now
17:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> You can/will
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> this page looks so overengineered now, I love it xD

17:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> German Menu ewww
17:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Schrotflintenlaser
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> Eww, having a menu in your Muttersprache
17:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes!
17:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I have 3baud internet what is this image
17:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You need to have the menu in the Muttersprache of the application, which is english
17:54 < bridge> <Assa> But who else is debugging german translations then?
17:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> someone else
17:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
17:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fair
17:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> if it were to be behind the tee i think it would need to be pretty big so that its clear what that even is
17:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1357745895986171925/g13.png?ex=67f152e7&is=67f00167&hm=a0fa9759bb8385f36547dc91b86fb6d4242370a5bc183f452c6d1da9b5b1511d&
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> xD
17:58 < bridge> <sans._.> the tee looks so annoyed its cute
17:58 < bridge> <sans._.> :owo:
17:58 < bridge> <soulyvevo> :owo:
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> OMG
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> Please PM me Tee, need to draw my idea
18:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @essigautomat this?
18:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1357747431353356338/g48.png?ex=67f15455&is=67f002d5&hm=45a1075ffae3d75846a1bf290059701a7bec96d094a9d6441b96ffee3a2380fb&
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Why is grabber flipped?
18:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :pepeW:
18:08 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1357748742945509416/pummel.png?ex=67f1558e&is=67f0040e&hm=76dcaa378959fc4270626c5867d924381cbe3ccf5c6ea1739f52399d7979ed1c&
18:09 < bridge> <sans._.> lmfao
18:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I love this
18:09 < bridge> <Assa> exactly ü§£
18:09 < bridge> <sans._.> what if there was just a magnet on his head
18:12 < bridge> <Assa> but are tees magnetic? ü§î üß≤
18:12 < bridge> <Assa> I guess too many shotgun bullets in their body
18:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Tees are just beanbags full of shotgun bullets
18:13 < bridge> <Assa> oh you mean in the menu, because it's rendered the other way round, I don't know why it's done like this, also this looks a bit better with placing I think
18:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Doesn't matter much /shrug
18:13 < bridge> <Assa> oh you mean in the menu, because it's rendered the other way round, I don't know why it's done like this, also this looks a bit better with placing I think. The grabber moves taking the Tees place as object of interest
18:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Would be cool if you had like a map part in there
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> With a tee being grabbed
18:14 < bridge> <soulyvevo> xd
18:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> If you wanted to make it even more overengineered
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> you mean beeing moved aroun? xD I thought about that, but the Tee sprite would just be moved and it'd be missing feet movement
18:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I meant like a full map
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> You mean like a grabber, that hooks the tee through the freeze laser, against a door, the laser hitting it for unfreeze and the shotgun shooting it back down to repeat the cycle?
18:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Yeah
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> I refuse, I want stop you, good luck have fun :justatest:
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> I refuse, I won't stop you, good luck have fun :justatest:
18:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Haha lmao
18:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I will probably first have to refactor all the rendering fncs to accept data instead of clientid
18:41 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny I thought about this and we should do the pummel and also add the corresponding sounds for attaching and detaching ü™†
18:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Would be funny +1
18:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Any java enjoyers? How can I run https://git.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/weka ? üò¨
18:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Alle auf Gewehr setzen
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, why? It would be rendered as part of the tee, it should be fairly easy to sequence it in wherever you want in there
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> hi developers
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi developer
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> uhhh Maven I guess (or maybe Ant?)
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I don't wanna deal with that, I'm not enough of a Java fan to actually know what I'm doing
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> note that the actual code seems to be in https://git.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/weka/-/tree/main/trunk/weka
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this repo terrifies me
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> Use eclipse
19:55 < bridge> <Ewan> javabuilder
19:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u should just be a able to load the .project in trunk
19:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i ran some random maven command and it worked xd
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> winner
19:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but now it crashes in some class :pepeW:
19:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe it will work if I checkout stable branch
19:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it looks old
20:03 < bridge> <Assa> It's not just call `renderLaser` anymore but I am gonna look into it üëç
20:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> still doesn't work :\ will try to use zip from download page
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> good luck
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> which os are u on btw and what class
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> wasn‚Äôt there a runtime loader thing right in there that said it works only on supported platforms
20:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1357778488739889313/image.png?ex=67f17142&is=67f01fc2&hm=aa62c5b04414b5d67fd83d6b6a0847a6c2bd42fdf2d88f10defb709c5a097837&
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
20:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it works with code from downloads page
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe you‚Äôre off a bean
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> beans
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I guess it does split up the rendering into two components, which is not particularly nice, but it's not too too ugly, just a `isBeingDragged()` inside the tee rendering to render the claw. That is if that is the look you want to go for
20:21 < bridge> <ha9nes> https://discord.gg/uJ5kUV8Agt
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> üòí
20:33 < bridge> <syrinok> now draw them strapped to the back of another tee carrying them
20:40 < bridge> <soulyvevo> no u
21:23 < bridge> <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1357797654356037833/insane_clip.mp4?ex=67f1831b&is=67f0319b&hm=e34145fe4680e9ff4eccc39e1235d36fdb098f4b3bdfb4f9a9bdad02624823a4&
