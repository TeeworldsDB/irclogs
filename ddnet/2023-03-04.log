00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> can something be done about the obnoxious mouse grab
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> when the game is in windowed mode & the user isn't using the mouse in game (in chat, in console, in menus, w/e), it should not capture the mouse
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but it still does
00:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> press f1 to workaround
00:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be nice if it behaved that way when in chat or menus as well, because there's no difference in intended mouse behavior among those
00:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's probably an issue about that somewhere
00:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and probably people who will complain if it were changed this way
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> why on earth would they
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't see why someone would want their mouse trapped in the game window unless they were using it to play the game
00:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mouse sense changes
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> does the game have its own cursor movement code for the UI
00:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i would have assumed it just does what the OS does
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> or do u need raw mouse input on for that
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> either way i'm not really buying it

10:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> enough internet for today
10:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> But the day just started
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> i dont get it is the religion thing a trick to force employers to provide linux or is there an actual religion? xd
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> seems like a cheap trick saying "my religion forces me to do x y z"
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> cant an employer then simply say ok bye?
11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> agreed. i really dislike this ‚Äúlinux culture‚Äù, it‚Äôs what gives the people who use linux & are passionate about its capabilities a bad rap
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> unfortunately not
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> when push comes to shove you can‚Äôt fire on the basis of religion (and a few other things), at least here in the united states
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
11:57 < bridge> <Ewan> üÜó
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u are just a windows user
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say, use linux bcs its better
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not bcs u are religious
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use linux because its better, it doesnt tie you up, it respects your freedom and rights
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the image was a meme lol
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> altho i would say its smart
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i think there are laws to respect religion
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so maybe companies are legaly requried xd
11:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxDFjGPqYog
11:59 < bridge> <ReiTW> Still not totally for gaming
11:59 < bridge> <ReiTW> :feelsbadman:
11:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the vid is actually serious
11:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i agree
12:00 < bridge> <ReiTW> People are getting banned btw on linux, playing Apex legends lol
12:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @ReiTW if u read the news, it was about steam deck, and it was just 1 user
12:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a bait headline
12:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:02 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well there was more
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i hate  these arguments
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not that linux is worse because that
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its that they ban u for that
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (if thats true)
12:04 < bridge> <ReiTW> I mean
12:04 < bridge> <ReiTW> It's not that they wanted to ban linux users
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if you cant run X software on linux is not because linux is not technically capable of running it, and faster, its that it wasnt targeted at that OS
12:04 < bridge> <ReiTW> It's a false positive ban
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so for me its never an argument that windows is better cuz that lol
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i hate it
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure technically linux is a better piece of software engineering wise
12:05 < bridge> <ReiTW> For me linux is only worse cuz I can't run all the games I love to play
12:05 < bridge> <ReiTW> For the rest Linux is way better
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but thats not linux fault
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its the game devs fault
12:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> Not only
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is
12:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> It's anticheat devs fault too
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but thats not linux fault either
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> because its the anticheat devs fault for not supporting linux
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> would u say windows is worse if i made a linux only software?
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and say it cant run on windows
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so windows is worse
12:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> I would if it was a huge diff
12:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah ok
12:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u win
12:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> Can give another example, I have a Samsung galaxy tab s7, this tablet for me is way better than apple's one, but huge advantage for apple having their own drawing software which is amazing but not on android
12:08 < bridge> <ReiTW> So would give a point to apple
12:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess we have  a difference sense on the word better
12:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont believe a software not running on X os makes it worse
12:08 < bridge> <elsaastrid> Hi
12:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> separate faults
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> who is this
12:09 < bridge> <ReiTW> Tf
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:09 < bridge> <elsaastrid> I have a legit online business earnings for everybody.
12:09 < bridge> <elsaastrid> Kindly dm me to know more about it if it interest you
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> god
12:09 < bridge> <ReiTW> :justatest:
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go fuck urself kek
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well what I meant is just that for each use case something Can be better or not
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> 
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> Linux in general is amazing but still worse for gaming even if it's not Linux's fault, but because of devs sure
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well still alot of games runs even better
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> even windows ones
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> Tarkov you have like 2-3 more fps
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since they use vulkan behind, and directx had some issues in some games
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like elden ring stutters
12:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> But u can't play online sadly cuz of battleye
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well ddnet is linux first
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and windows second
12:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> üáπüá©
12:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and mac on the trash can
12:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so many issues xd+
12:14 < bridge> <ReiTW> Idk if u can run bf on linux, ig so
12:14 < bridge> <ReiTW> Ah well it's on steam, probably runs with proton
12:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> Not playable, rip
12:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anticheat
12:16 < bridge> <ReiTW> That sucks

12:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > This game is known to utilize Easy Anti-Cheat. EAC has limited support for Linux, but multiplayer functionality varies depending on how the developer has implemented it.
12:19 < bridge> <ReiTW> Rip
12:20 < bridge> <ReiTW> People wouldn't cheat, we wouldn't have more issues like that
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> comments are good on the yt link you sent ryo :D
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1677929547.png
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> and yes i use light mode
12:41 < bridge> <Learath2> This is why we should really think about my real id proposal. Dox all gamers so we can get rid of anti cheats :Celebrate:
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> or allow cheating much easier
12:44 < bridge> <Learath2> No that ruins the game for everyone else, go away bot dealer
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhr
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> pre order chilerbot now!
13:04 < bridge> <ReiTW> Good idea
13:05 < bridge> <ReiTW> So I can send pizzas to chillerdragon
13:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> @Ryozuki had the project presentation yesterday about my xdp firewall etc.. all of my rust parts worked so well (ty, you and heinrich for the rust help)
13:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> But damn the web interface that my other mates did is shit af, they didn't care lol,rip
13:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> F
13:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah it happens
13:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when i went to school all others werent also as interested in programming
13:08 < bridge> <ReiTW> The website is just full of copy paste only from internet
13:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lul
13:08 < bridge> <ReiTW> 1/8 features were working lmao
13:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Typical web developer behaviour
13:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @ReiTW i mean they cant even do a web?
13:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u were doing something rly niche
13:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should get a passing grade
13:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and they should suspend
13:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> They're not devs at all, and one of them gave up months ago
13:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> same grade for the group, but one of them talked yesterday to the teacher and said that I shouldn't get penalized because of them
13:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> (they're 3 but only 1 knew and tried at the end, the 2 others you couldn't talk with them, they were like "no won't do it"
13:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> (they're 3 but only 1 knew and tried at the end, the 2 others you couldn't talk with them, they were like "no won't do it")
13:16 < bridge> <ReiTW> working alone in that situation is better lmao
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yea
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> relying on others is a bit meh
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they will say its a useful skill later in the workplace
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the dynamics is different
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at work if u do less u have consequences
13:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (usually)
13:20 < bridge> <Learath2> The one group project we had I just asked the dude if I could just do it alone and he said sure
13:21 < bridge> <Learath2> I messaged the people in my group and they were all like oh great you can do the project and we can try to add stuff after
13:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Fuck that
13:28 < bridge> <ReiTW> lmao rip
13:28 < bridge> <ReiTW> that sucks alot
15:24 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> wtf is this
15:24 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> very pig-behavior

17:35 <+ChillerDragon> yes im just being passive agressive here hehe
17:35 < bridge> <SPYRES> Also seems like some of my message is missing in your screenshot. Easy solution, get Discord client.
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Patiga lit website https://patiga.gitlab.io/
17:36 < bridge> <SPYRES> Guess I'm enquiring more from a design/architecture solution. Maybe I'm just trying to over engineer my basic script tbh.
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> just start the systemd job from cron :D
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> on a more serious note i think you can also schedule systemd jobs

18:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Scraped directly from a website, I should have sanitized it more üòõ
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> i hope u use curl and other linux cli tools to scrape
19:01 < bridge> <Learath2> Python with beautifulsoup4 to scrape, aria2c to download all the links I scraped
19:20 < bridge> <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Do you know if it's possible to combine parameter expansion with command substitution in bash?
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> not sure what have you tried?
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> there are so many parameter expansions not sure what you wanna do but i usually use `eval` in those situations hehe :D
19:30 < bridge> <Learath2> `${$(sed 's#:#/#' <<< "$f")@Q}`
19:30 < bridge> <Learath2> This is just insanity üòÑ
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> bru wat
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> whats the @Q thing?
19:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Aren't you a bashwizard wtf?
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> e
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> whats @Q
19:31 < bridge> <Learath2> These filenames are quoted, I want to discard the quotes, which is insanely annoying to do
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> is that a string you want to append?
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> just pipe it tru xargs :D
19:32 < bridge> <Learath2> @Q expands the parameter but it quotes it properly so that it can be used in another bash command
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> ``echo "\"'foo'\"" | xargs | xargs`` :D
19:32 < bridge> <Learath2> The filenames are not always quoted properly to survive xargs like this gem e.g. `''\''Lezione del 05:10:2020 - USEFUL part from 15'\''\'\'''\''45'\''\'\'''\'''\''\'\'''\'' to 82'\''\'\'''\''.mp4'\'''`
19:33 < bridge> <Learath2> I have no idea what will happen if I run that through xargs
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> rce
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> just slug em?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> replace all non a-z with _ :D
19:34 < bridge> <Learath2> Okay but when doing that I need to first be able to work with these names in bash
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> but i still dont get the @Q
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we should be there too xd
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> is that bash syntax? or a fixed string 
19:34 < bridge> <Learath2> It's a bash parameter expansion https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> i have the page open
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> but i never used a @ xd
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> lemem search
19:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 use sd
19:35 < bridge> <Learath2> It'll quote the string properly while expanding so you can feed it into another bash command without losing your quotes
19:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/chmln/sd
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> why do you want to keep the quotes? xd
19:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Sed syntax is not my issue
19:35 < bridge> <Learath2> So I can rename the files...
19:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ask chatgpt to rename them
19:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why bother putting efort nowadays
19:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ai everything
19:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks right
19:36 < bridge> <Learath2> ok, nvm I'll just figure it out myself
19:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets hope AIs are as good as humans soon
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im making some bindings to a C api from rust
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bindgen is rly nice
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe we should have exposed a C like api from ddnet
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> slavery without moral problems
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and use bindgen
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> altho its less secure i guess
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cxx does compile time checks
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 is eval not an option here?
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> like doing it in two steps
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> first run the subshell then the expansion
19:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Show example?
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> your specific case confuses me ill show u another ok? xd
19:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u know what phantomdata is?
19:40 < bridge> <Learath2> sure
19:41 < bridge> <·∂¶·µÉ·µêSŒ±Œ∑œÑŒ±‡øê> What?

19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no tell me about it
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks its a way to tell about a objects lifetime
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its useful when using unsafe
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081647944001925170/image.png
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its just a marker xD
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u want to say, X instance will only live as long as that reference lives
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> without owning that object
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> yours could be ``eval "${$(sed 's#:#/#' <<< "$f")@Q}"`` but not sure i would need to try and error a bit
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Adding a PhantomData<T> field to your type tells the compiler that your type acts as though it stores a value of type T, even though it doesn‚Äôt really. This information is used when computing certain safety properties.
19:43 < bridge> <Learath2> This is about what I have planned, but the problem is all the quotes
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so a compile time check?
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its indeed useful
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yes
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> so running the subshell first makes the quotes so broken that the expansion breaks?
19:44 < bridge> <Learath2> @ChillerDragon: `for f in *; do echo "k=$(sed 's#mp4#mkv#' <<< $f); mv $f \$k"; done` something like this
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081648467442667640/image.png
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> lerato could you send a two liner that defines f and breaks so i can trest
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like the building block
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when u go lower
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and deal with pointers
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is cool, but it sadly wont help me in threaded context
19:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe I should just do this in perl or python where the quotes aren't an issue
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> i hate to admit it 
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean for that u have  sync and send
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> but yea maybe
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to share data for a specific lifetime over a thread
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without Arc or smth
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no copying
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> wait are those files from your uni?
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be useful, but probs almost impossible to do at compile time üòÑ
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> dont u study computer science?
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> does your drunk cs prof add random quotes?
19:47 < bridge> <Learath2> For legal reasons I may or may not have scraped those from my uni
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks scoped threads?
19:47 < bridge> <yeeeey> why are you texting trough bot?
19:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Electronics prof likes to add ' to denote seconds in some filenames
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.scope.html#example
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no arcs here
19:47 < bridge> <·∂¶·µÉ·µêSŒ±Œ∑œÑŒ±‡øê> ‚ÄûSilent co-reader‚Äú
19:48 < bridge> <Learath2> He is on the run from the authorities
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is chatting from matrix
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or irc
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the bot is a bridge
19:48 < bridge> <yeeeey> why??
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont want to start a thread on fly
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> lerato so after mp4 there is another quote?
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can just keep the thread join handle
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for a specific lifetime?
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk tho
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i havent tried
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> send another ls pls lerato
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i basically have a threadpool
19:49 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh I think I got it `for f in *; do k=$(sed 's#mp4#mkv#' <<< "$f"); echo "mv ${f@Q} ${k@Q}"; done` about works
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081649592824758373/image.png
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need a scope for a specific set of tasks üòÑ
19:49 < bridge> <Learath2> There can be quotes in the file name, and there is a quote at the start and end of it
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats also two steps
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still good to know
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> might solve a problem some day for m,e
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> might solve a problem some day for me
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:50 < bridge> <Learath2> ChillerDragon: https://paste.pr0.tips/tB1
19:50 < bridge> <Learath2> Here this should create the mess I have üòÑ
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> honestly i probably would have used vscode for that problem @Learath2 :D `ls > rename.txt` and then ctrl+d on the .mp4 highlighgt
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> if you only want to change the extension
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://docs.rs/threadpool_scope/latest/threadpool_scope/
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> ye u got the fix alr so its useless
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> wait are those mp4 files with a mkv extension!?
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> do they even playback in the browser? xd
19:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, how would you get the rename done though after fixing the stuff in vscode?
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> using a mv command
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> ou
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> that breaks hm
19:52 < bridge> <Learath2> nono mp4 -> mkv was just me testing stuff so I don't have to mess with the quotes first
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks actually rayon is a scoped threadpool too, its just that by default is uses a global threadpool
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/fn.scope.html
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> whats your end goal?
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rayon is more maintained
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh if i restructure my code that might work.
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> why not simply strip all quotes of the filenames?
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use the rayon one xD
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that crate is outdated
19:52 < bridge> <Learath2> I'll be doing `sed "s/^'//` followed by a `sed "s/'$//`
19:52 < bridge> <Learath2> Tjat
19:53 < bridge> <Learath2> that is what I'm doing üòÑ
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> ah ok
19:53 < bridge> <Learath2> meh wrong reply
19:53 < bridge> <Learath2> whatever
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> i dont see replys anyways xd
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd need to think about it. its kinda edge case what i do
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur always doing edge cases
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i am iterating over a vec and then start threads on items of it, and join them at a later point
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think that should be doable
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with scope
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably
19:55 < bridge> <Learath2> mfw I did all this and xargs ruins my quoting anyway
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think another problem was that i need to spawn it on a specific thread, but maybe rayon indeed has some functionality to do this
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the items are not allowed to execute out of order, and multiple items are basically a chunk to execute on one thread xd
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the chunks iteself can be out of order tho
19:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> itertools to chunk
19:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rayon to paralelize
19:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.chunks
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but that for example would not dirctly work. i need to iterate over all
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then batch them
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then execute them (i know the exact moment a thread is allowed to start)
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is currently not high prio anyway, but someday i want to make it work without using pointers to evade lifetime checks
19:59 < bridge> <Learath2> @Jupeyy_Keks what are you making?
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am running commands on a threadpool
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but commands can also change stuff in the "main" thread
20:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vulkan commands i guess
20:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is that a thing? xd
20:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should recheck my vulkan
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what how could u tell xdd
20:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:02 < bridge> <Learath2> And why are lifetimes being an issue?
20:02 < bridge> <Learath2> (I'm just curious btw, you can ignore me) üòÑ
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs sharing data between threads needs static lifetime
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or moving
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so smth like Arc
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which i dont want to use
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u use scoped threads u dont need static
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also cant u just share and give ownership of the data to the thread
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and then get it back
20:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> channels? xd
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah i want good performance
20:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u perf
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also thought about using Box and moving them around, but i can 100% garantuee the lifetimes in my head
20:05 < bridge> <Learath2> I thought scoped threads solved your issue, what is your problem with them?
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so scopes are probs good to go
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont have any problem
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just need specific requirements
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as accessing a specific thread
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and run tasks in order
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stuff like that
20:09 < bridge> <Learath2> iirc crossbeam channels were pretty good performance wise, maybe worth benching
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :cammostripes:
20:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> RAM is my channel for communication üòâ
20:10 < bridge> <Learath2> There is even crossbeam-queue which guarantees order üòõ
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1677956910.png
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> still dont really know wat you want but i managed to slug em
20:12 < bridge> <Learath2> I did aswell\o/
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> ``shopt -s extglob;for f in *; do x="${f//[^a-zA-Z0-9 ._-]/_}";x="${x%%+(_)}"; mv "$f" "${x##+(_)}"; done``
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> bru
20:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw @Ryozuki rayon also supports creating own threadpools, and thats also important, i guess it already has everything i need. its defs a cool lib
20:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also great how easy it is to rewrite smth like resize image to par chunk
20:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also great how easy it is to rewrite smth like resize image to par chunks
20:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Rayon probably uses a channel somewhere in there üòÑ
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what a bad library
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Yep, it depends on `crossbeam-channel` surprise surprise üòõ
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but what does it want to channel around
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all information i need is already part of the RAM...
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc it needs to share the references
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if thats all ok
20:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Probably the task chunks, I'd guess it passes some pointers on the channel
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as long its only one directional
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's probs not too bad
20:16 < bridge> <Learath2> The thing that the channels do is also guarantee lifetime stuff
20:17 < bridge> <Learath2> Though honestly, I haven't dug into threading internals in rust
20:18 < bridge> <Learath2> I'd guess it's just boilerplate so the compiler knows that it's illegal to touch that data until the other thread is done or we have a lock
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> neither
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am never sure if i want to write idiomatic code in rust or high perf.
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> idiomatic rust tends to do heap allocations regulary
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at the same point its much cleaner to write most of the time üòÑ
20:20 < bridge> <Learath2> That is also always on the top of my head whenever I touch rust. It's a dilemma
20:20 < bridge> <Learath2> My C/C++ brain really wants to do a lot more on the stack üòÑ
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah xD
20:31 < bridge> <Chairn> that's because that's the standard way to do it
20:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Sure, but it's also very annoying
20:33 < bridge> <Chairn> actually, it's `'` for minutes and `''` for seconds when you denote an angle, especially in astrophysics
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn did you study physics too for what u studied
20:35 < bridge> <Chairn> i did study physics
20:36 < bridge> <Chairn> i did first year university in physics
20:36 < bridge> <Chairn> but i also had physics class during my cursus
20:37 < bridge> <Chairn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc#Symbols_and_abbreviations
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u finally start your processor design career
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need faster CPUs, they too slow
20:39 < bridge> <Chairn> not really, no more faster CPU anyway
20:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Teeworlds ASIC when?
20:39 < bridge> <Chairn> kinda easy to do that üôÇ
20:40 < bridge> <Chairn> just need money to send it to a foundry
20:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Do it, hardware accelerated gamecore.cpp
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why no more faster CPU :c
20:40 < bridge> <Chairn> technology reaches a dead end
20:40 < bridge> <Learath2> when fix the memory wall?
20:40 < bridge> <Chairn> never
20:40 < bridge> <Learath2> make faster memory rn
20:41 < bridge> <Chairn> come vocal, i can present my phd üòÑ
20:41 < bridge> <Learath2> It's only an order of magnitude or 2 behind the cpu, no? just do it ezclap üòõ
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i fear that too, on the other hand we'll still get the few percentages by optimizing all kinds of sizes, be it transistor gaps or memory controler etc
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe no high steps
20:41 < bridge> <Chairn> no more high steps
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so maybe invent smth new so we can overtake this bottleneck
20:42 < bridge> <Chairn> come voc
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what will i head there xd
20:42 < bridge> <Chairn> heard and see
20:42 < bridge> <Learath2> I would but I'm wasting time playing league
20:42 < bridge> <Learath2> His phd thesis
20:42 < bridge> <Chairn> can you hear me?
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> what‚Äôs going on in there
20:43 < bridge> <Chairn> damn, is my mic dead already?
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hear u for 1-2 ms
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it dies
20:44 < bridge> <Chairn> nah, i just unplugged it
20:44 < bridge> <Chairn> was the laptop mic for like a few sec
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no idea what powerpoint and windows activation keys u talking about now but thx xd
21:31 < bridge> <Chairn> yeah, sorry talking about wifi identification with eduroam
21:31 < bridge> <Chairn> eduroam is the shared wifi network across lots of univerisity/school in europe
21:41 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> @Ewan Green ü•∫
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> need
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what giraffe
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> data-svg repo is only for stuff that is shipped with the client
22:03 < bridge> <Chairn> he meant giraffe skin i believe
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think it's shipped with
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's on ddnet skins db
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u looked in chillerdragons data directory on github
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whatever the repo was xd
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i have not
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> can i get a link
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon give link plzz
22:13 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://gihab.cum/chilladrakon/reponuma67294/teestuff/svgs/skins/cc-by
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon porn
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> lmao
22:15 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB found this only
22:15 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> *sniff sniff* there is no svg images
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah

22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/raw/master/06/0045-spike%20head.png
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> this is probably the best skin around
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant believe nobody has made hd giraffe
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> the quality difference is very noticeable at zoom 10, which is necessary for non ddnet or kog servers
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081687771632128172/image.png
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> though the svg skins have some sort of bad aa artifacting
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1081687854037618828/image.png
22:22 < bridge> <Chairn> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/blob/master/06/giraffe.png
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the one
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> https://ddnet.org/skins/index.php?search=giraffe
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it's on here too
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> where there are... *slightly* less than 2,000 skins
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> and im pretty sure everyone gets giraffe because it gets auto fetched when they don't have it
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> and im pretty sure most everyone gets giraffe because it gets auto fetched when they don't have it
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> unless they changed the setting
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway cant find a svg version of it
