00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never figured out how to make this user friendly at all 😄
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then it wouldn't be only speedups but switchable entities too
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine turing complete switch layer
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe we could compile pacman into teeworlds switches
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> imagine tuning tiles...
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nope, switchable tiles are easier
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have tunezones
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huh i guess tune layer would fit just as well
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > then it wouldn't be only speedups but switchable entities too
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Cellegen my suggestion was that only the timed freeze tile should go into the speedup/tune layer
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, did anyone see that guy who compiled C to powerpoint?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also @Learath2 how well does the coordination system handles well detailed numbers like (0.00)
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> coordination system?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz i think TeeUniverse have that feature but ddnet editor doesn't
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> I'll demonstrate on dm
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> I'll demonstrate on pm
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im also interested :)
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Then I'll post here as a bug. This bug makes the coordinations on the DDNet Editor fucked up when modified, since when it updates, it cannot register numbers beyond [0.xx]. But I would like to have the possibility to make a more precise number editing on the DDNet Editor, so it won't be a hell of a trouble finding a perfect clipping point, so it won't bug out.
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723298212060069908/hm.png
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> left is ddnet editor, right is TeeUniverse editor
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't actually remember whether we save these as floats
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we do, it should certainly be possible to get the editor to edit them
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it shouldn't but saves it anyways
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> a lot of people mapped maps on teeuniverse and got away with it without any obvious bugs
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> pretty sure parallax is not a float
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah its about position
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga I sorta remember us storing these as fixed point actually
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the teeuniverse exporting mechanism is as weird as these possibilities that even the ddnet engine can read it
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how people instead of reporting this as an issue, used teeuniverse 😄
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> exactly
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> teeuniverse isn't famous for the best GUI or for the best features it has, but rather the advanced tools it has
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for animation and information gathering, editing and using, it's absolutely perfect
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> necropotame was working on quite interesting stuff, I wish he hadn't left
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he did make it open sourced
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that"s something
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you have any interesting features you'd like in ddnet, leave an issue. I kinda like doing editor patches
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> alright, will do
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i am confused
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so in my map parser i parse the position as integers
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are saved as integers
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could be that however they are fixed point numbers in reality
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think quads have them
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that doesnt really explain this
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i tested it on the map puzzlebox, the second group
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> this one has a position of (0, 25)
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and my parser says (0, -25)
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and if im not too tired float wouldnt explain that
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *shouldnt
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga so wait on that map, the second group has a float position?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> no, its simply 25 on there
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> not float
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (in the ddnet editor)
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah but your parser thinks it's -25?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for whatever odd reason pos x and y are negative but are negated when displayed
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does anyone have map where there should be floating point positions?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't look possible to me, teeuniverse must be doing some weird scaling trick to achieve it
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Cellegen do you know map that uses precise coordinates?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> xmas move on the Qshar gores server, MAIN category
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the first place i found this
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the quads do use precise values
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> all the animations are set on different intigers
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah quads do have fixed points
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and when you mess with them, its gone
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> obviously
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> animations are set on integers?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you show what you mean?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well shit, i can record it but you can reproduce the bug by editing the map and try to change the values between the layers
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> all of them. gets fucked
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I was going to go to sleep but now I'm intrigued
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the map if you're too lazy
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723303569968594944/XmasMove_3f11eba4.map
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Cellegen which layer should I take a look at?
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or layer group
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> QFr (freeze) is the easiest to see the bugs
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> first you cannot change anything but the position only cuz thats the only one it has no float in it
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> anything that has float in it will get it fucked
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sometimes it renders it completely transparent and gone
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm what else is there to change about a quad?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you sure? look closer
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723304876565594152/screenshot_2020-06-19_00-35-01.png
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> guess which one i wasnt able to edit
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but what did you do to id?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it*
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> opened it as i got it downloaded from the original source, edited it and this was natural for it to happen
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i didnt do anything cuz i cannot do anything with it in the first place
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> did you place those quads yourself? i cant find those
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> animation seems fine cuz it supports floats but dragging the picture is not possible
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> drag some of them out, you'll see it
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly I don't get it, I moved those from the left and they move fine, I can also move their corners around
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> position is possible cuz its not float based, but i cannot change the shape of the picture
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can play with the color
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> weird
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723305725849239602/Screenshot_2020-06-19_at_01.38.21.png
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> didnt manage to recreate that bug
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723305767003881482/2020-06-19-003801_1920x1080_scrot.png
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> howw
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Learath2 nice
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so you found the one with the float indicator in it
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which ones did you use?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No I didn't I can change the shape just fine
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm the one who messed up the shape by hand
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723306053516656700/screenshot_2020-06-19_00-39-51.png
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this one @Patiga
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Cellegen so if you try to move the corners of that it breaks?
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i used all of those up but found one working deeper in the map
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you cant change shapes, it wont move the pictures
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you cant zoom in or out the pictures
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you stuck with an old version maybe? I can move the corners just fine
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have latest
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you just record it please, I don't quite get it 😄
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can even make this an image quad with smoke in is just fine
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723306690598142053/2020-06-19_00-41-13.mp4
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wtfű
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the ones a bit right of spawn kinda worked for me. there were 3 quads that had their middle point on the exact same spot tho, so im not sure if that couldve been a editor bug
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the middle points are quite odd in this map yeah
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i could stream my broken ones in the voice channel
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh what an odd way to put quads
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's generated though
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thats everything i could find broken for me, the corners not matching up with the texture
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723307559800275014/2020-06-19_00-44-15.mp4
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ah.
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> good laggy shit computer cant handle anything
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for some fucking reason
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> jesus christ next time imma prepare improving my graphic settings
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Learath2 i'll leave it as that for now, tmr i'll try to demonstrate the bug with more information in hand
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga the corners not matching up is odd though
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> trying to find those with my parser rn
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yours looked a bit weirder tho
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> isnt the scale on yours wrong?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the more I messed with it the more it went off the corner
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> scale?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah no
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that looks just fine
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually could it be that at the start of the position envelope it's not at 0?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aaah
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ye
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that would make sense
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, removing the position envelope fixes the position
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the x is 0 in the position envelope at time 0
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i feel like im trolling all of you but this was not the case, i found it. the POS to window does that
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723309284011671613/screenshot_2020-06-19_00-52-09.png
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723309418422468748/screenshot_2020-06-19_00-53-16.png
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :monkaS:
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats... still emberrasing
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually forgot what Pos TO is
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but that's what's offsetting the corners 😄
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> time offset i think
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the envelope
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> aha that explains it
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why teeuniverse exports these quads so weirdly
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> these are quite trivial even
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> teeuniverse does some weird stuff
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it really messes up grouping
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the main problem is still on
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well when you can show the main problem we can take a look 😄
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723310281626746930/hm.png
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> we need this feature to be improvised
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no way to save this in the teeworlds mapformat
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Groups don't save any precision
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well shit if nerco was here
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He could probably tell us what that actually does 😛
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> should i dare ask the official infection staff about it? :kek:
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> they dont do shit
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you save such an map in the editor and upload it?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how Qshar's server does it is still different
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i can dump all the saved information in the group data structure quite easily
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see anything interesting in qshars map tbh
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> qshar's server instead
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar is there any floating point magic in your maps?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :zzzz:
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I require sleep
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> good night :)
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> gn8
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> night
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Learath2 what do you mean xD
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> just tested the switchable freeze tiles. they **are** switchable using switches with the correct number.
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the delay value is used for amount of seconds the tile will freeze for
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the switchable freezes are used on "rocketiskey"
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> small test map
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723469987909468170/test_switch.map
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga TIL
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> same actually
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and now im curious if the delay also does some fancy stuff on some other tile in the switch layer
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm neither works on hearts nor the freeze turrets
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> neither on the bullet
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> guess freeze is just a niche special case
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Switchfreeze with delay 0 isnt freeze :feelsbadman:
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u always have to put ugly number on it
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i guess i could try to write an introductory article to ddnet for the ddnet wiki some day
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen that explanation is good, but we can do even better and add a "Learn" tab in the ddnet client
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there we can explain simple tricks
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from the wiki maybe
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is what dota 2 does, a game which kinda lacks a tutorial too xD
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723516560576348200/unknown.png
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well. our thing can be only text for now
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try adding it
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Could also just link to a website and provide some info on the wiki? Like Patiga suggested
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can do both
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should also mention the discord in the client imho
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the end, its the best way to get help
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the problem is that the name introduction text can only be seen once
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and maybe someone rushes in
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a learn tab is always there
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with useful links etc
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> True discord is huge help
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh it could be cute to have a learn tab with embedded gifs if those weren't such a pain to render
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about gifs
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would be awesome if player drawing could be decoupled from physics updating
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in players.cpp
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what a mess
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tee drawing*
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you can render tees without too much trouble
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im looking into it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We use players.cpp rendering for the scoreboard too
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but you have a net character there right
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cnetobj
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learn tab is offline
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can create CNetObjs np
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's ugly 😄
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723530898246467705/unknown.png
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to add subtabs
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it would look better with images
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we also dont have much text rendering stuff
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah text is quite awful
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> what deen wrote is rly good enough
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> nobody wants to read 10 minutes before playing..
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> nobody even reads irl manuals
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just add a link to the wiki/dc and if the guy is rly the curious type hes just gonna go there
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tutorial map would be best
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when new players join they just join a random server and usually get their ass handed to them on block or smth so they just rq
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that text looks familiar ^^
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723536979127435294/unknown.png
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate buttons
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet ui code :cammostripes:
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga ye its from the wiki
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if its gonna be text form anyways, you could try to somehow integrate the wiki. it does already support a kinda consistent video format and actually has the mentioned topics covered
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (and also is very extendable)
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with curl and some magic
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i could do it
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the wiki had an api
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even better
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rendering video is more complicated i think
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont even have proper links
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is OS dependent btw
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see its made out of markdown files
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe making a super simple markdown parser
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe just a link to the wiki
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> problem solved
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Looks nice Ryozuki 👍
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well that wont exist
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look my comment
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, probably some environment issue, interesting
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be awesome to document or make more functions for the UI Split things, for example, if u want to add something inside another rect and padd it u have to use HSplitTop(20, 0, MyRect)
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a bit confusing overall
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "split" makes 0 sense here
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0 is a nullptr
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm yeah we could probably add more things
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> HMarginTop maybe
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats confusing too
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it a margin inside
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or along it
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :P
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> MainView.HSPlitTop(20, 0, Box); this puts the box inside with a padding of 20 on top
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell a new coder
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to figure out this
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it took me 5 mins
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe im stupid
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Margin along?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> margin usually is for components that are that the same level
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> padding is when one is inside another
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not talking about margin here
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that are at*
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> english broken
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the way we render, does padding/margin even differ?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is vmargin
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmargin and margin
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but hsplit
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is its own world
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> vmargin, hmargin and margin all behave more like padding then margin
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .s/then/than/
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should mimic css imho
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just simple functions
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not split stuff
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mimic the box model? it'd be very hard tbh
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> especially if you want things like flexbox
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not that
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just want margin and padding
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not splits
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the issue is that we don't have a hierarchy
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> margin and padding only differ by how they influence their siblings
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the best would be to define ui design in a custom file or smth and hten have our own render engine for that
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its overkill
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always go to far
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /home/runner/work/ddnet/ddnet/src/base/system.c:3258:2: error: ignoring return value of ‘system’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Werror=unused-result]
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   system(aBuf);
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugh
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Splitting UI is much harder in our case, we have all our ui in immediate mode
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (void*) fixes that right
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (void) should be enough
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen are you planning on doing the steam release?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> Can i run the client on a Raspberry pi and how?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> raspian
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apt install ddnet
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You compile it, then you run it 😄
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we have it packaged for arm too?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ftp.st.ryukoku.ac.jp/pub/raspbian/pool/main/d/ddnet/
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it, or idk
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/d/ddnet/
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is more normal
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> ok thanks
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> i try it :D
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just apt install it
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 /home/runner/work/ddnet/ddnet/src/base/system.c:3258:2: error: ignoring return value of ‘system’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Werror=unused-result]
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   (void)system(aBuf);
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compilers are turning smarter
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u need void*
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember seeing it somewhere
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok no
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably because this is explicitly marked with warn_unused_result
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just don't ignore the result?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what should i do, i cant return it on the function cuz its diferent on windows
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe static_cast
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does that even compile btw? isn't res undefined?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i fixed that already
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah you pushed again
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reload
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no static_cast in c
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if (system(aBuf)) {} lol
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats rly ugly
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can return it too
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `return ShellExecuteA() > 32`
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `return system() == 0`
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and hope that warn unused forgets about it when you return 😄
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can explicitly do nothing when you call open_link I guess
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill just add a dbg msg
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> force pushed
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen is keeping secret what he is doing
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bigsecret
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows failed
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay

17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> 
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> I have tested this 2 Links but its doesn't work
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont use those links
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just do "sudo apt install ddnet"
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in temrinal
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> terminal
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I lost my steam developer badge because some people were scamming others using it 😦

17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> he can't find the package
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> im using a raspberry pi 3 b
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u "apt update"
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `. The return value is cast as an HINSTANCE for backward compatibility with 16-bit Windows applications. It is not a true HINSTANCE, however. It can be cast only to an int and compared to either 32 or the following error codes below.`
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u enable repos too
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you can safely cast the result to an int before checking >32 😄
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enable main contrib non-free
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u then can find it
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /etc/apt/sources.list
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (after apt update)
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> ok
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u on windows
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope, even worse macOS

17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hate windows
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wat...
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The cast is safe, I think you should find a way to suppress the warning
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine there being a devblog about something as trivial as this
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061108-05/?p=29083
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you can try casting the 32 to a `HINSTANCE` instead
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i have to cast the int
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> this is in my sources list:

17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> @Ryozuki
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u still dont get ddnet?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> yes
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we have ddnet on debian since buster, maybe you are on an old version?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is on stretch

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do `lsb_release -a`
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or `cat /etc/issue` if you don't have `lsb_release` for some reason
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, stretch is too old, you'll need to build yourself
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> No LSB modules are available.

18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> Codename:    stretch
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep stretch too old
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> ok D:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you've compiled anything before it should be simple enough with cmake
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KolpixTV> ok thx
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it compiled now
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> heya guys
18:13 <+Learath2> ayeh
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> how much does ddnet.tw/irclogs weigh?
18:14 <+Learath2> probably a lot
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> heh
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> okey thanks Learath2
18:15 <+Learath2> actually it's onl 30M I forget how little space text takes
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> 30 Mb?
18:16 <+Learath2> y
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> interesting
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> Yea its not too big i download them from time to time to grep something
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you can merge the 0.7 thing, then the color thing, then I need to do an extra commit and we can start testing
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> :(
19:57 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: y?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the patch for the color thing doesn't apply anymore
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll push it by hand
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if someone has windows, maybe you can test https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2281
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/suites/818269767/artifacts/8996347
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> direct download
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 would the 0.7 layer break teehistorian2demo btw?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> follow-up: is it at least easy to fix?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The input messages haven't changed
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, they still work
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it uses info for player names
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> easy to fix.
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on whether you want to do it right
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently it doesn't understand the 0.7 protocol at all
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As long as we can get something working relatively quick, we can fix it properly later
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides, we aren't saving entire packets and most of the breaking changes are on the lowest levels of the protocol
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if you merge mine, I'll merge yours 😉
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i managed to make it smaller and added the discord link too, it looks fine less on some resolutions
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723637746979307550/unknown.png
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 720x400 looks fine but 1024 doesnt
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which idk, but to me makes 0 sense
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4:3 has a scaling problem i think
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> nice friendlist
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works fine less on 4:3 resolutions
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well and 5:4
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we could/should move the discord link to the right with the small buttons and use an icon instead
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how we can get icons
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't know where we get icons and how we add them tbh 😄
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we craft a merged font
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im not a font speciallist
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone knows how to do it?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> me neither, so let's leave it out until we get a font specialist? 😄
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe we can add a link to the discord in the wiki page
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would be relatively painless 😛
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> moment of truth
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let's see if the 0.7 compatibility thing blows everything up
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw ucan merge it then
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless u want to make sure it works on mac
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which should
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the wiki has a discord link, but its a bit hidden
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe put it also on the front page
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga ^
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/resources/
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723639912993128478/unknown.png
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> discord wasnt even invented in 2014
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also there seems to be something wrong with the logo on the wiki. On firefox it show up a ghastly white and on chrome it doesn't show up at all
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats weird
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hugo-learn.js?1592515304:20 Uncaught ReferenceError: images is not defined
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     at hugo-learn.js?1592515304:20
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay ABORT
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did we forget that maps need converting
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why we were holding off on merging, I even had a tickbox...
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did you tick it
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no, but we merged before ticking it 😄
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😂
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how will we do the maps?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 actually how will we serve different maps at all? wouldn't the sha and crc change if we embed the stuff
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeeeeeeeh
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> load both maps?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki added direct links
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the left side?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it still feels like not visible enough
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think discord is where the community currently lives, pretty important
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe its enough idk
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 the firefox one is the correct one in theory, dont know why it doesnt work in chrome o.o

22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta fix that
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Gummibaer12345 | David LOL right as ryozuki was proposing that
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gummibaer12345 | David> lol xD ok
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could, but we have to fix resolutions or add a icon
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga btw logo on wiki is not shown on chrome
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/issues/350 apparently fixed recently, wanna update the submodule? ^^
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay reverted the servers to 7d428676e296cf2f50aea9feb3bf435cc6490c46 just incase
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga can you give me access
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i requested it on there
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or u prefer me to clone
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we generate 0.7 versions of the maps with everything embedded and add a _7 suffix
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fork
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 👍

23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga why do u have a hugo-learn.js when the theme ships one?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw it errors and its outdated
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki an update is welcome, only https://gitlab.com/ddnet-wiki/ddnet-wiki.gitlab.io/-/commit/a07cc13ba12a6ba1ad968080fbecb8fec22a92ee changes a few lines
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 oops, forgot about the maps as well. we have them in ~/servers7/maps. could you just take those for now?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga that's more than I expected 😄
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I like "idc'fkm8!"
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I guess I can symlink that as maps7
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm wondering whether I can crc32 the entire loaded map at once
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at once?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^^ kinda surprised that our candidate `(CC) BY-SA` is the most common one
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'll load the 7 version of the map into memory, than I need to take it's crc
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm wondering whether I need to chunk it up or zlibs crc32 doesn't mind it being a rather large chunk
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we discussed it before
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why it's the most common
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, interesting
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga curious u didnt see that makes an error xd
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u remove the images definition, so what does images.each reference? :p
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> uh, zwelf took care about that part, im not sure
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made a pr
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ill let zwelf merge it
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga https://gitlab.com/ddnet-wiki/ddnet-wiki.gitlab.io/-/merge_requests/12
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fixed
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> svg needs a size in chrome
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome :)
23:55 <+Learath2> and here I thought I'd go to sleep nice and early today
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man markdown limits my creativity
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki Including the fact of partially being able to use html in markdown?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im trying to find how to use html in markdown in hugo
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok it implements what i wanted anyway
