01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn are you using mingw-w64?
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/mirror/mingw-w64/blob/2b92dc939918246a28f616ae036e7fde2f5ea979/mingw-w64-headers/include/ws2tcpip.h#L228
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess not?
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd suggest to just use that
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So I have this old fork of ddnet but when i started developing it i started with a new git history. Any ideas how to get ddnet git history in there? I thought about taking ddnet repo resetting it to my fork starting points commit then copy in all content from the initial commit. commit. And then cherry pick all my history on top.
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Any better ideas?
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or any idea on how to find out which ddnet commit a given modified ddnet src has
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen are there any map scripts you would like to have right now? with my python bindings I would happily write some :)
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fstd, maybe pstd should be using longer random strings for the urls
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: i'd first find the commit your fork is based on, then just pull the master branch from the commit and put your changes ontop
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and instead of cherry-picking you can also rebase interactive and put all at once, but there are probably many ways anyway
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories `
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no idea if that triggers merge conflicts xd
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, can't really think of anything. For fixing stuff in map testing you mean? Could you automatically detect common map problems? ðŸ˜„
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> true that reminds me that I still had stuff I wanted to do in that area
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Could even ask testers for some things they are looking for, not sure how much is automatable
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I found https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/issues/18, but it don't know yet how complex that output format is
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> @Discord Mod
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga check the binary in libtw2, it outputs msgpack. it's quite easy
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and any idea on how i find the commit my fork is based on?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Jupstar âœª)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> look at last change dates i guess
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> does that really work? \:D
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not, i mean you atleast have the version dont u?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u mean like with ls?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so cant be that many commits
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to check
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh i'd look into your github repo
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or rebase against the first commit from that version and slowly add more commits until the diff is small

23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not sure if those dates are from me creating the project or from actual ddnet edits
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait wat
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah look in github, or where your fork is from
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sep jan
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that this year?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its today bro
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lmao
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea wtf
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so the dates do not help
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it on github?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there you have the dates
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just go to the first commit
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/storage.cfg
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that file was never edited
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but thats only the commit date hm?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but now you know the first version and an approx. date
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isnt that enough to work with?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its not approx date
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its when i switched to git
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nobody knows how old the code was already
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `#define GAME_VERSION "0.6.3, 9.0.2"`
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so just start there and end with 9.0.3
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea that i know
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> manually looking at the diff commit by commit sounds crazy
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i wonder if i could bisect with a few keyfiles
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd rebase your project against the first commit from 9.0.2 and just add the remaining commits until the diff is small
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe you can even add all commits from 9.0.2 to 9.0.3
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not sure if i understood that
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> merge yours with ddnet 9.0.2
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> okay so i take a ddnet repo do a hard reset to 9.0.2 then add my fork as a remote and do a merge from there?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but how can i merge unrelated git histories?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that even possible?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> --allow-unrelated-histories
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ye
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u wrote that already \:D
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but then wouldnt i get an initial merge conflict that swallows commits from after 9.0.3 ?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but then wouldnt i get an initial merge conflict that swallows commits from after 9.0.2 ?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yo guys, can i talk to somebody about protocol teeworlds implements?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are packets that large for netobjs?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hard to say chillerdragon
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea most likley
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since you only switched to git after a while it can certenly happen
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd suggest you take ddnet 9.0.2
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> add your files
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> commit
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then rebase
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or wait is it duplicating commits? \:D
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im a bit confused
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but thats def not the start commit
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dublicated commits should be rebased away
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if they dont add anything to the code, i dunno how you rebased or just cherry-picked, but yeah even then it can happen
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the code structure is too different
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think ill skim through the commits do a git show and then check my fork if it has the changes yet
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok troll
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its 9.0.2 release sharp
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hahaha
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok that was easy
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [timakro](https://matrix.to/#/@timakro:matrix.org)\: i love you for forcing me to use git 5 years ago \:D but would have loved you more if you told me to take ddnet repo and copie my code over as initial commit \:p
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes this is a merge for another weekend but thanks jupjapjop
