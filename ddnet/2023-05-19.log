08:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks
08:33 <+ChillerDragon> ryo wat is it w u and bevy ur so hyped about it?
08:33 <+ChillerDragon> u follow their tiktok or what?
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Bcs it's in rust bro
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://hecatia-elegua.github.io/blog/no-more-bit-fiddling/
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bevy is novel
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and rust
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses rust power fully
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should try it
08:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Guess was just a matter of time right? They use wgpu which is basically designed with webgpu in mind.
08:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I want to try it out tho, because I want to see how well the browsers already support it
09:15 < bridge> <Iza> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6417 hey @Robyt3 , will there be a fix for it soon?
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when vanilla 0.6.5 dissector support o.O https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684481242.png
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> 0.6.4 works fine i assume the tokens are not supported yet
09:41 < bridge> <deen> Thanks chillerdragon
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 is the IME now fully rendered by us? so fullscreen is no problem anymore for chinese?
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess we should tell tsfreedie or whoever controls the chinese community to not advertise changing to windowed anymore then
09:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109025269987160085/RDT_20230519_0950173520332368819004637.jpg
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie we need to, our chinese community manager
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie we need u, our chinese community manager
10:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ofc
10:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> once the steam version dropped I'll be sure to let everyone know
10:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym "control" tho
10:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> I haven't found a fix yet, unfortunately
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The chat groups
10:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€
10:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sure
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Or beginner guides xd
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok, you are our dictator let's face it
10:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> TRIVIA! How many wikipedia links did heinrich send in the ddnet and teeworlds irc channel combined?
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 666
10:27 < bridge> <deen> Maybe some people should try if it actually works
10:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, @FightFire is already on it
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> top50 rust enjoyers ranked by the amount of times they mentioned rust in this channel https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/dB
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> !rust ^
10:38 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why so many ryozukis?
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> irc enjoyer
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am catching up mentioning rust
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> !rust ryozuki
10:40 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u should more often mention rust
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> take
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> over
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rust
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rusty rust
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> !c what about vulkan?
10:41 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> jupsti u think you nmentioned vulkan or 0.7 more often?
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i like that even ryos second entrance is more often than my main entry xd
10:41 <+ChillerDragon> ryo is also just active
10:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks ur miles behind
10:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff i'd say vulkan
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> ryo is also in top5 people mentioning "porn"
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> yes u say vulkan more than 0.7 jupsti
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
10:42 < bridge> <deen> You should calculate the ratio of mentioning Rust per coment
10:42 < bridge> <deen> comment*
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think that would be high too
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> so amount of messages divided by amount of messages w rust?
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
10:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thanks to me, learath is also high on mentioning rust
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Bf
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> top50 vulkan enjoyer
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> epic
10:43 < bridge> <Vy0x2> @Jupeyy_Keks no
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im split between multiple ryos
10:43 <+ChillerDragon> split personality ryo
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeahfix u script pls chiller
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do a regex
10:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <...>
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> <..> ?
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/rV
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> ffs im not even top2 0.7 enjoyers
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> i failed in life
10:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bruv
10:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> better regex
10:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to not have dups
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> ok send regex
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> filter out + i guess
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> idk how to do match groups w fakin grep xd
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> write a script instead
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `<_?\p{XID_Start}[\p{XID_Continue} .âœª]*>`
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust regex
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it includes jupstar special symbol
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe XID_Start is not needed
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u know this is what rust uses
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for variable identifiers
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt know abotu XID_Start and xid continue before
10:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109040290880290826/image.png
10:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this allows chinese variable names and so

10:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this should work with ripgrep
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> ok jupsti won the heinrich wiki quizzle since his guess was the only one
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and what is the solution
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> my regex found 93 wiki links with like 2ish false posivitives and the highest repost was 4
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah no highest repost was 2 idk where that 4 came from xd
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> didnt know there was a quiz
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> sucks to be u
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> now all the prize goes to jopsti

11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u gotta exec that inside the console xD
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> watf is that
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it merges the users
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> similar users
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> annoying af to copy from irc
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> start matrix
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> omg
11:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bloat
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanted to make a irc bot to compete with chiller
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but too much spam
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> we we need more irc channels for spam
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> what field u wanna compete in?

11:12 <+ChillerDragon> i just copied
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the number of times ryo mentioned rust
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> from electron
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> could still remove the @ and +
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be even better xd
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> i also wrote like a 258 char sed but then rq cuz waste of time xd
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> omng now my vscode ded
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> because i close matrix with ``pkill -f electron``

11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why is dieing
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> it ratelimited
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> u sent 6k lines
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lol
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why does irc suck so hard
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i thought its master race
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> discord issue
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why does it resend a modified message
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> but indeed we should ditch quakenet
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why doesnt irc support editing
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :/
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> and switch to a unratelimited srv

11:20 <+ChillerDragon> !sh echo jupstar 
11:20 < chillerbot> jupstar
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> If i memcpy a struct
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> will the order of the fields be the same as in c++?
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wat?
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/network.h#L176-L186
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> memcpy a struct in which lang?=
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> trying to understand where the token will be
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> at the end or start of the header when sent over the network
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> because this looks weird
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it will stay at fron
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> is it really before the flags?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it will stay at front
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> rly?
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> c++ doesnt reorder
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L354-L368
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> but thats wrong isnt it xd
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> token is last
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the struct def has nothing to do with how u set its members
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe im too stupid for ur question soz
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/packet_layout.html#packet_header
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> when reading doc on layout written by genius pro who never makes mistakes
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> it says layout is "flags, ack, num, token"
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> how does that match the code?
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> the way i read the code it sends "token, res token, flags, ack, num"
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L171-L235
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> isnt this where the packet is prepared
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> ah tru
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> omg ye ofc i red that code often enpough to knpow xd
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> yeye ofc it never sends a struct
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> but thats how it would if it would send a struct i see
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> thank

12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Voxel for u
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109067034848919562/Voxel.png
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> join the club
12:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
12:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic
13:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Make a Jupstar one
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Jupstar is a bad name for this great art
13:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Jupeyy?
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that could work xd
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 ^
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen is there a reason u also dont make a release in the releases page? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/releases
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a neat feature i use usually, it tells u how many new commits there were since the release with a easy to click link
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i always forget how to compare otherwise xd
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (a release uses a tag, u can use a already existing one)
14:20 < bridge> <deen> One more manual step? Why can't it use a regex over the tags?
14:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess u can use tags for things other than releases
14:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so they dont automate it
14:21 < bridge> <deen> Yeah, but I want "automatically make a release for every tag with regex `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?`
14:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well u can use the api https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-release
14:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah, idk, api maybe
14:22 < bridge> <deen> I'm already bored enough of posting on forum, discord, steam, website, client, etc
14:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:22 < bridge> <-StormAx> did someome still using forum?
14:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cant automate it?
14:22 < bridge> <deen> Github is mostly used by developers anyway, so 99% of our players won't care
14:23 < bridge> <deen> They all have different markup formatting, have to click around in their UIs etc
14:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would make this workflow, put the release process in CI, trigger the CI on a release, this automatically makes a post to discord via a github bot, steam with api, etc
14:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well i guess listing the changelog is the manual thing
14:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which could be solved with https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
14:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah, too much work i guess
14:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:25 < bridge> <deen> Do you have permissions? Feel free to make it ðŸ˜„
14:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i only have perms to the github org
14:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:29 < bridge> <deen> You're in the core group for ddnet/ddnet which has admin rights, weird
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah if u mean on gh ye i have rights
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill look into it
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen ^
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it made the changelog automatically
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and listed contributors
14:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> looks neat
14:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we can simply make the ones in gh without the binaries
14:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just click release and generate notes and done
14:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway ill do it whenver i see a release
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> without binaries its kinda useless xd
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its nice to see a detailed changelog
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah true
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thats coolk
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thats cool
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe i can make a script
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to download binaries from web and upload
15:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets?apiVersion=2022-11-28#upload-a-release-asset

15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i figured the api
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109106741578321920/image.png
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> done
15:19 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 89% hungarian, guess imma translate that one too :justatest:
15:19 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109108125786701904/image.png
15:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks why no vulkan pfp on gh
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its has a trademark sadly
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in discord idc
15:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol nobody will say anything
15:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> make it with jupeyy
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i know nobody will say smth, but its not nice style if they care so much about it
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> me as a free human supports all who seek for freedom
15:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Cellegen | RiH dont add more text
15:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> than the translation
15:33 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
15:33 < bridge> <Voxel> LOL
15:33 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Skill issue
15:34 < bridge> <Voxel> i have become a shader
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Cellegen | RiH the text might be fitted for a expected width, and u are adding more text
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just stick to translating
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> word to word
15:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> also for errors, I just put the destination for further debugging, so it did no harm
15:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> tbh
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u dont understand what i mean..
15:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109111934877433936/image.png

15:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> But do whatever, if it's not acceptable, you guys have the power to change it xd
15:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pls change it urself
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u understand hungarian
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> remove the additional text
15:35 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> like the previous ones too? :kek:
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that might be ok to add, for example as a tooltip
15:35 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> at the tutorial translation too?
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> remove the additional text
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> from
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6624/files#diff-bac55514c76bcf893a36a725d85cf4c7da06ccad07d7864ae169c3a1fe8589acL1528-L1554
15:36 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> on the Graphic errors, anything with the () can go
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> looks nice
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just stick to translating
15:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> please do iturself
15:38 < bridge> <Robyt3> also you may have to rebase/merge master because the changed translations for 17.0 are not merged yet
15:38 < bridge> <Robyt3> and #6618 will add two more strings to translate
15:38 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6618
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 good, std::optional supremacy, rust brings good
15:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> java also xd
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 u dont need has_value
15:40 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @Ryozuki changed
15:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> would look a bit weird though because it's a bool
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in a bool context it works
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah true
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but to compare the inner u would do *myopt
15:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> `if(optional && *optional)`
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> .value() and *x
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> are the same too
15:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye that
15:42 < bridge> <Robyt3> checking if the optional is empty is usually bad style though, at least in java it's unidiomatic to do that
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust u are enforced to do it
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> via pattern matching
15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> `if(!Official.value_or(false))` would also work here I think
15:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> `if(!Official.value_or(true))` would also work here I think
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let x = Some(2);
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if let Some(x) = x {
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   println!("{x}");
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true but its harder to understand at first
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer current
15:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, current is more direct
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tested it in game
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> works nice
15:45 < bridge> <Voxel> Some(2) = Some(Some(2)) ?
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u need to understand what variable shadowing is, in rust its actually idiomatic
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> x inside the if is a i32
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not a Option<i32>
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the if let is pattern matching
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not assigning it
15:46 < bridge> <Robyt3> what if you join a non-official server while also having a race disconnect warning though? it doesn't show the non-official server warning when it shows the race disconnect warning first
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> didnt test that
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 maybe its time to add a popup queue xD
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> windows 95
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/meme-gif-26485637
15:48 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> oh no
15:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html
15:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> what if we just combine both popup titles and messages? :kek:
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just show the ip one
15:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if both show
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its the most important, and the user can realize he clicked by mistake
15:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and if its official the race one shows up anyway
15:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, that's better, I updated
15:51 < bridge> <Robyt3> you have to retry bors again
15:51 < bridge> <Voxel> mfw matching is the easiest thing to grasp in this language
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> !c
16:04 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a wireshark competitor
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109119541159657593/239459193-ef8252ef-c090-4544-a1b4-85c6cbf130c7.png
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> made with iced
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok its probs pretty far from wireshark tho xd
16:08 < bridge> <ReiTW> tf is that interface
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think the choosen font is bad
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it makes it look childish xd
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki closed src blog cring how to fix typos as contributor then
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let me make it open
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> ryo sniffnet name is nice but the logo is a dealbreaker
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> its so ugly
16:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> only reason i'd replace wireshark for is
16:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> if you have huge pcap dumps
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think it even competes with wireshark yet
16:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> It doesnt
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> seems like a competitor to netstat to me
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> or nload
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> or any traffic usage dashboard thing
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/edgarluque.com>
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there u have
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> pog pog
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u need https://www.getzola.org/
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> i dont rly wanna run ur blog actually 
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> i just thought it made sense to publish its content
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> also i trust microsoft more to keep the data forever than your own website :p no front
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wdym
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont trust microsoft
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> trust https://archive.org/
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> i do trust ms more than you
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ask it to make snapshot of my web
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> also thought about that will probably do before i link ur blog somewhere
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> its a bit non obvious for me where to put the code from the first example to get the result from the screenshots
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> could be nice for someone who wants to follow along exactly step by step
16:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
16:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nobo chiller
16:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not meant  for u to do exactly what i did
16:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more so to see how it works
16:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer if u link my alive and healthy website directly tho
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye idk where and how id even link it but i could see my self doing that some day
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> yes but would be cool if one could follow along to get the hands dirty
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> dont ya think?
16:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
16:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im lazy rn
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> okok
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> also add a try now button
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> that compiles code from text box to webassembly client
16:20 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
16:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> nice i finally found a pog matrix client!
17:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wowothe gh spam i go back to irc xd
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> !rust https://github.com/ulyssa/iamb
17:05 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
17:06 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> lol the next vim based discord
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> well vim based discord would be against tos
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> !:justatest:
17:06 < chillerbot> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/justatest.png
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> but vim based irc or matrix is legal
17:07 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> yup ^^
17:07 < bridge> <Voxel> maybe if discord didnt have the worst practices ever
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> one day ill write a ddnet client in vim script
17:07 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> debugging with vim :Chill:
17:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> multiline
17:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> test
17:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> multiline
17:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> test
17:11 < bridge> <Voxel> wow!
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> multiline
17:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> test
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> wtf happend
17:11 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
17:11 < bridge> <Voxel> chiller and his 70 bot accounts
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684509238.png
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> randomly put multiple lines into one irc message
17:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> without it, chiller wouldn't be chill <a:pepeD:759650467495018506>
17:15 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> did two instances sent it separately or just a bug with the client u use? xd
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> i have no idea what is going on here
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> i can also not reproduce it
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> but if someone does a line break on discord or matrix multiple irc messages should arrive
17:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen so no warning on connecting to a unoficial sv when double clicking a friend?
17:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont mind either way
17:36 < bridge> <deen> Isn't the symbol for official server enough?
17:36 < bridge> <Skeith> You can't verify if someone is your friend or not, I think the warning is very important, if we had accounts, then it would be fine...
17:36 < bridge> <Skeith> Accidentally joining someone will happen without the warning
17:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk, in any user facing thing, i always lower my standards of obvious
17:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 ?
17:37 < bridge> <deen> I don't like popups
17:37 < bridge> <deen> I just click them away mostly
17:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but it shows if its a verified server  with the icon
17:37 < bridge> <Skeith> We're lucky SP doesn't ddoes, but someone else will do it
17:37 < bridge> <Skeith> We're lucky SP doesn't ddos, but someone else will do it
17:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also if multiple ppl have the name, they are shown multiple times iirc
17:37 < bridge> <deen> Good enough I think to have the blue symbol
17:37 < bridge> <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109142903961419856/Screenshot_2023-05-19_at_17.37.44.png
17:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its true that, if u have the ddnet tab selected, u wont see unverified servers in ur friends anyway
17:38 < bridge> <Skeith> True, then it's maybe fine
17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also dont like popups
17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the popup when u double click and are in a run is nice i think
17:39 < bridge> <Skeith> Ya
17:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u play with this resolution? xd
17:41 < bridge> <Skeith> I could see myself accidentally joining even with the checkmark, but since it doesn't show people connected to non-official servers if I don't have the internet tab selected, then I guess that's enough
17:41 < bridge> <deen> I don't play at all, but I use my widescreen as 2 square screens basically
17:45 < bridge> <Skeith> Also I don't see "suppressing" unofficial servers as a bad thing, this game has its own steam page, its own reviews. Allowing people to get trolled by the game's lack of proper systems is probably not good
17:47 < bridge> <Skeith> I know the internet tab is potentially unsafe, new players don't, so that's also concerning
17:52 < bridge> <deen> I wouldn't even call the servers "official". KoG and noby are running their own thing, we as DDNet admins have no way of checking what they are doing. Calling it official sounds like the same people who are in charge of DDNet client are also in charge of the servers
17:52 < bridge> <Skeith> Fair I guess
17:54 < bridge> <Skeith> Accounts when
18:08 < bridge> <Vy0x2> The skins in the friend list is so awesome, thanks a lot
18:11 < bridge> <anderson_crypt0âœª> Iâ€™ll teach 10individuals to earn $30k within 72 hours but you will pay me 10% of your profit when you receive it. Note only interested people should apply, drop a message let's get started by asking (HOW)https://t.me/Andersonwatts1
18:39 < bridge> <bencie> new friendlist feels so hard to read for me, and i dont see skins in it
18:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> do you see the skins for the players on the servers?
18:40 < bridge> <bencie> names should be bigger than the clan and "playing"..
18:40 < bridge> <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109158723890466896/image.png
18:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> you should see the skins as long as the server provides the skin info
18:40 < bridge> <bencie> yes
18:40 < bridge> <bencie> ye
18:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> weird, maybe there is a mixup and the downloaded files are wrong
18:42 < bridge> <bencie> i think itd be easier to see whos on if the names were bigger and maybe even bold. before i could just glance at the friendlist and tell whos on, rn at first sight, i had to read every single persons name for some reason
18:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> not sure if we can render bold text at all, but could make sense to make the name bold
18:43 < bridge> <bencie> than atleast bigger
18:43 < bridge> <bencie> then atleast bigger
18:44 < bridge> <bencie> theres no emphasis on names
18:44 < bridge> <bencie> oh i think i dont have skins cuz im on nightly, not rc
18:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, you also have the "playing .. on .." text
18:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> it's changed in RC
18:45 < bridge> <bencie> lemme check rc then
18:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> updooot
18:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> oof
18:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> updaaate
18:46 < bridge> <bencie> ok well skins are realllyy good, so much easier to read
18:46 < bridge> <bencie> how does online clanmates work? does it take your current player_clan, or any clan thats added as friends?
18:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> any friends that have only clan and no name are clanmates
18:47 < bridge> <bencie> i see
18:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> here is how it looks with the friend name in the next larger font size
18:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109160787890675712/image.png
18:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> looks better IMO
18:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> uhm do clan box separate itself by clan names?
18:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> or it just solid block of all clan friends i have
18:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, all clan friends in one box
18:50 < bridge> <bencie> +1
18:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe clan friends should be grouped by clan name though
19:35 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i like it
19:35 < bridge> <cyberFighter> good addition
19:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109173172932194394/image.png
19:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> nvm
19:41 < bridge> <cyberFighter> is the number ping?
19:41 < bridge> <Skeith> yes
19:41 < bridge> <cyberFighter> can we get em colorised
19:42 < bridge> <Skeith> Would look nicer i- ya, what he said
19:42 < bridge> <Iza> What does the numbers mean on the friends list?
19:42 < bridge> <Skeith> After gametype? ping
19:42 < bridge> <Iza> Ah
19:43 < bridge> <Iza> Kinda seems like unnecessary information
19:43 < bridge> <Iza> Better would be the server region
19:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://tenor.com/view/what-do-they-mean-random-numbers-gif-10654449
19:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> ping and server region is the same
19:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> if the ping is known then it's shown
19:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> otherwise it shows the server region
19:44 < bridge> <Iza> I think just the server region would be better
19:44 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i feel like it would make more sense if it was the server first and then the maps name
19:44 < bridge> <Iza> With only the ping you canâ€™t always determine on what region that player is
19:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> server names are too long to fit in the beginning
19:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> why does the region matter when your ping is good?
19:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> and your friend is on that server
19:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> didnt mean server name
19:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> the ddracenetwork part
19:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> game type
19:45 < bridge> <Iza> Seeing your ping to the server on the friends tab just feels misplaced
19:46 < bridge> <Skeith> I wish the gametype was just ddnet :greenthing:
19:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no no, it can get mistook for ddfightnetwork
19:47 < bridge> <Iza> Dont talk about the ddfightnetwork
19:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i am THE cyber fighter after all
19:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ?
19:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> brush coloring
19:49 < bridge> <cyberFighter> what does brush coloring mean
19:50 < bridge> <Iza> Btw i think you could shorten the description by replacing Gores with KoG and DDraceNetwork with DDNet, since thats also their appropriate network names
19:50 < bridge> <Skeith> I think ping being there is a good thing, I would definitely make it use ping colors though, so it's more intuitive
19:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> btw, i feel like time checkpoint's description should mention that it can affect the menu camera
19:51 < bridge> <Iza> It being in the description like that feels misplaced tho, maybe it can be put in the corner of the player field, smaller, with color
19:52 < bridge> <Skeith> It's the description of what they're doing, it makes sense to be there
19:52 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> #announcements rc2, for me it doesn't show tees, even when I have the skins or when I already joined, in case it needs to gather the skins
19:52 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109176719824388166/screenshot_2023-05-19_19-52-00.png

19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (any rust semblance is pure coincidence)
19:53 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wtf
19:53 < bridge> <cyberFighter> time cp 19 is unused
19:53 < bridge> <BillionRay> Why would anyone use that language
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> because im making it
19:53 < bridge> <BillionRay> Oh. With llvm?
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my own compiler frontend for my own lang
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> edlang
19:53 < bridge> <BillionRay> Ah nice. Useless but nice
19:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> does it show the skins in the server info for that server?
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u have such a bad mentality
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like u already
19:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> nvm,
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> #announcements ~~rc2, for me it doesn't show tees, even when I have the skins or when I already joined, in case it needs to gather the skins~~
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> nvm, I pasted rc2 wrong, caused some files to not get overwritten
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109176719824388166/screenshot_2023-05-19_19-52-00.png
19:54 < bridge> <Iza> It just looks way to plain without context from a ux design perspective, a way better solution would also be having it set up like â€žMap | DDNet (30ms)
19:54 < bridge> <BillionRay> Im just talkin shit ðŸ‘´
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Nah, I fucked up pasting rc2
19:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> 1 is unused
19:54 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> linux issue xd
19:54 < bridge> <Iza> It just looks way to plain without context from a ux design perspective, a way better solution would also be having it set up like â€žMap | DDNet (30ms)â€œ
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i recommend reading this http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html to setup truly a good mentality
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (hacker != typical movie hacker)
19:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> such as yours? :kek:
19:55 < bridge> <BillionRay> I wanted to play around with the llvm stuff myself. What are u using for the parser / lexer?
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> indeed, one who does, not who talks
19:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> rust mentality :greenthing:
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im doing it in rust, lalrpop is my lexer, logos my tokenizer
19:55 < bridge> <BillionRay> I see
19:55 < bridge> <BillionRay> Good luck
19:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/edlang
19:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> source
19:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> agpl3-.0
19:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> syntax will probs change in the future, im just taking rust as reference
19:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @Robyt3 The friendlist only shows players with the current Tab (DDNet, KoG, Internet), is it intentional?
19:58 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> What about if you click on the friend in the list, then it highlights that server in the server list? Then you can see additional info, like ping if you want?
19:58 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Not sure if that's intuitive or easily implementable within the current UI structure.
19:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @Robyt3 The friendlist only shows available players with the current Tab (DDNet, KoG, Internet), is it intentional?
19:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, that's how it works
19:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @BillionRay how many ppl u know that made their own lang? :ez:
19:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> oki
19:58 < bridge> <Iza> @Robyt3 can I suggest something for the friend player tab description? I think it would look cleaner and more intuitive if the format would be "Map | DDNet/KoG (30ms)"
20:00 < bridge> <Iza> I mean thats how it already is
20:00 < bridge> <BillionRay> Well I made a little lang, but its for logging data not coding
20:00 < bridge> <BillionRay> But not many
20:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean a compiled lang
20:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah
20:02 < bridge> <BillionRay> Dont know anyone that made a compiled lang personally. But then again you didn't write the backend which is the hard part so settle down boi :p
20:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> I think it's good enough for 17.0, but we can open an issue for more discussion about improving the friends list. Ping could be somewhere on the right side and also colored like in the server list
20:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh, u think the backend is the hard part
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is not like web dev my friend
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the frontend is where u do type analysis, control flow analysis, and support higher level features, etc
20:04 < bridge> <BillionRay> I mean the optimizer, AST, whatever else a compiler does seems hard
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm is just a good portable assembly
20:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with lot of opts out of the box
20:04 < bridge> <BillionRay> How much does llvm do and how much do you do?
20:04 < bridge> <Iza> I donâ€™t think I will be the only one that would be confused about the formatting
20:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust is a big big project, and rust itself is just a compiler frontend
20:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the frontend is also what does for example, the stacked borrows analysis
20:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what powers rust at its core
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah both have merit
20:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Eeeeh, there is kinda a reason not many compiled languages were being made before LLVM was stable enough as a backend
20:06 < bridge> <BillionRay> Ah, it seems i have underestimated you. I see the true scale of what you have done my friend
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well i havent done much yet tho
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just added basic control flow analysis
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to add type inference now
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont even have structs yet
20:07 < bridge> <BillionRay> Will you add something like templates in c++?
20:07 < bridge> <BillionRay> ;)))
20:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why would i add the thing i hate most
20:07 < bridge> <Learath2> Metaprogramming when?
20:07 < bridge> <BillionRay> Yeah i wanna write compile time fibonacci
20:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true, both are big, the biggest value of llvm is the optimizer
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the big thing: https://polly.llvm.org/
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > LLVM Framework for High-Level Loop and Data-Locality Optimizations
20:08 < bridge> <BillionRay> @Ryozuki anyway goodluck with your lang. Ima head out
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Polly is a high-level loop and data-locality optimizer and optimization infrastructure for LLVM. It uses an abstract mathematical representation based on integer polyhedra to analyze and optimize the memory access pattern of a program. We currently perform classical loop transformations, especially tiling and loop fusion to improve data-locality. Polly can also exploit OpenMP level parallelism, expose SIMDization opportunities.
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its sad llvm is not gpl
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it allowed things like NVVM to be born
20:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ew
20:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Abstracts away the scary scary math from the computer people
20:09 < bridge> <Learath2> This is how it should be
20:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> indeed kek
20:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Imagine if you had to think about topography in 69d space when compiling your language. <a:painpeko:974639276753055744>
20:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i need a idea to make my lang unique
20:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> something special
20:13 < bridge> <Learath2> First class functions? Not very common in compiled languages
20:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I guess nowadays everyone has some type of closure, hmm
20:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh, allow array of struct <-> struct of array switch easily
20:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> before doing this ill add basic missing stuff
20:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont have  strings
20:16 < bridge> <Learath2> LOL
20:17 < bridge> <Learath2> Btw maybe try to limit what you have to do with builtins. If a string can be implemented with your language as is, then itâ€™s better to do that if there isnâ€™t huge inefficiency in doing so
20:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well i need to add arrays first too
20:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and structs
20:17 < bridge> <Learath2> If you have a struct and a vector you pretty much can implement strings
20:17 < bridge> <Learath2> Ok, array first ðŸ˜„
20:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and heap allocations
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:notlike02:701335073387053106>
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and as usual, i am met again with my lovely C functions
20:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Call out to jemalloc for those
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does it have a c api
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should go the ez way first
20:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use malloc
20:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Sure, I thought you might not want to link to glibc/musl/ulibc
20:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well i need to add io support too so
20:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and print
20:21 < bridge> <Learath2> You can technically do those with syscalls, but I guess itâ€™s not quite as portable
20:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Go does that iirc
20:23 < bridge> <Learath2> I donâ€™t remember what rust does
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109184918656925857/image.png
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not bad
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust uses glibc
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go doing that caused them bugs too tho
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and only on linux does it i think
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> windows abi is not stable  iirc
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kernel*
20:26 < bridge> <Learath2> But think about it, you can completely avoid C
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah but hard
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kernel devs decided to use C as a frontend stable  abi
20:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Ofc, best ABI, stablest ABI, ðŸ’ª
20:33 < bridge> <Voxel> i wonder if anyone rewrote a game like minecraft in rust yet
20:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There are minecraft client and server implementations but nothing feature complete yet
20:53 < bridge> <Voxel> if i were to learn rust id want to rewrite janky things in it that big companies made just to shit on them
20:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Ryozuki So #6594 was fixed now?
20:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6594
20:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> theorically yes
23:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> FPS ingame go from 1000 (capped) to 80 with this many online friends, creating and sorting the friend list alone takes around 9.6 ms every frame :justatest:
23:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1109238429453139988/image.png
