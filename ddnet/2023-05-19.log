08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bevy is novel
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and rust
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses rust power fully
08:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should try it
08:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Guess was just a matter of time right? They use wgpu which is basically designed with webgpu in mind.
08:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I want to try it out tho, because I want to see how well the browsers already support it
09:15 < bridge> <Iza> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6417 hey @Robyt3 , will there be a fix for it soon?

09:34 <+ChillerDragon> 0.6.4 works fine i assume the tokens are not supported yet
09:41 < bridge> <deen> Thanks chillerdragon
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 is the IME now fully rendered by us? so fullscreen is no problem anymore for chinese?
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess we should tell tsfreedie or whoever controls the chinese community to not advertise changing to windowed anymore then
