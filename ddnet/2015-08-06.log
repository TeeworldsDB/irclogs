00:00 < Savander> 10 thousand posts in map testing!
00:00 < Savander> it's more than 50% of posts! :P :D
01:39 <@deen> Savander_: haha, yeah
01:39 <@deen> lots of work with map testing on ddnet
01:41 < Savander_> yup

12:33 <@deen> looks like someone new is attacking
12:33 <@deen> single ip DoS
12:35 <@deen> filling the logs with stupid stuff
12:42 <@deen> ha, my commit from yesterday solves the lags with this kind of attack
12:42 <@deen> still 50 mbit/s incoming, but totally stable
12:43 <@deen> abuse mail written as well
12:44 <@deen> hope they react for once, russian server again
13:09 <@deen> Pretty easy to restart a server so that everyone with ddnet client gets auto-reconnected (everyone else gets a nice message instead): https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/restart-server.sh
13:12 < Savander> hiho
13:13 <@deen> hi Savander 
16:02 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vOHWT
16:02 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master f39b85a def: Add average time to /mapinfo
18:05 <@deen> ahaha
18:06 <@deen> So I wanted to try edis.at in chile again, because they're the cheapest hoster by far, every other one cost 4 times as much
18:06 <@deen> but they don't offer it on their website anymore
18:07 <@deen> but they only checked in javascript whether the server value is not chile. so i just bought a server, let's see if they can actually give me one^^
18:12 <@deen> yep, they got me a server =)
19:24 < o_be_one> deen, ahah nice :D
19:30 <@deen> so, now their installer is broken. after 1 hour i finally got KVM access
19:30 <@deen> have to install the os manuall i guess
19:43 < Nimda> Equity [Hard] by Pipou & 645654 just released on Solo at 2015-08-06 19:36
19:44 < o_be_one> -_-
19:44 < o_be_one> is there a way to block access to F2 console ? cause i can open rcon console anymore (maybe a bad key ?)
19:44 < o_be_one> i take a look on key config
19:45 < o_be_one> ok got it, F2 was removed in keymap
20:13 < Chairn> unbind f2
20:17 <@deen> Chairn: he wanted to enable f2 again, not disable :P
21:10 <@deen> so, the server has a terrible connection to the rest of the world, but the chileans say they get lower and more stable ping, so that's good i guess
21:11 <@deen> but the network is totally throttled. Initially I get 3 MB/s, and then everything goes down to 100 KB/s or lower
21:29 < Chairn> deen: i read block access, and understood forbid access to console when  pressing f2 ^^
