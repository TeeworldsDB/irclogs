00:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @heinrich5991 does your teehistorian will save names as well?
00:01 <@heinrich5991> yes
00:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it won't be problem in terms of law?
00:03 <@heinrich5991> saving pseudonyms? interesting question
00:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, because you can identify for example me
00:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> by my nickname
00:03 <@heinrich5991> nah, could be anyone else as well
00:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not like my problem
00:03 <@heinrich5991> but we also do that already, so I probably don't introduce something new
00:03 <@heinrich5991> see ranks on ddnet.tw
00:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I can ask my lawyer if you want
00:04 <@heinrich5991> if you want
00:04 <@heinrich5991> although as indicated above, we already save names
00:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it's more like saving every move of player
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right, ranks etc. Im curious how f.e google solve problems, about saving every your move
00:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for adverts for example
00:08 <@heinrich5991> they have ToS
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we don't have right?
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we don't have one
00:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so maybe we should have one, like "We are storing names to serve ranking system" etc.
00:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, meh
00:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then they should accept ðŸ˜„
00:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> doesn't sound desirable
00:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know
00:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im not sure to be honest
00:18 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I don't think anyone cares if you save their nickname
00:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You would be surprised ðŸ˜ƒ
02:07 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: but msvc still supports at least some c++14 features, why do you have to downgrade to c++11 instead of relying on the CI to prevent features not implemented in msvc from landing in master?
02:09 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14
02:09 <@heinrich5991> do we need some of these features? (I think this is ment as an honest question)
02:11 <+eeeee> there's nothing we absolutely require right now, but some of those might turn out to be useful. what's the downside of that?
02:12 <@heinrich5991> less compiler support
02:15 <+eeeee> like how much less
02:15 <@heinrich5991> unknowns to me
02:16 <@heinrich5991> but since you asked, I checked debian oldstable
02:16 <@heinrich5991> it has gcc 4.9, gcc 5 supports c++14 completely
02:18 <@heinrich5991> (according to wikipedia)
02:19 <+eeeee> ok i agree we should support building in oldstable
02:20 <+eeeee> at least for client

04:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> @nobody-mb since the "golden spike" entity is rather bright - same as the ones of blue & red - I bet it would look better if the sun would be also bright, instead of dark as now
04:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> but whatever, just my thought

13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Deathman> Hi,
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Deathman> I wanted to ask if it is possible to add a Texture change option to ddnet Client to change texture (game.png,  particle.png, emoticon.png and cursor.png) ingame. like in Allthehaxx client [ https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx ]. Would be nice, since you can personalize your client   an ingame experience in many ways with ddnet already (tee settings [name, skin (color),  ddfat and ddcat], menu <message clipped>
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Im not on my pc
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> But there are 2 texture folders
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> I believe once your in the allthehaxx folder with all files there is another allthehaxx folder
13:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Drop your textures in allthehacks folder
13:37 <@deen> @Deathman Yeah, sounds good. Someone can port the necessary changed to ddnet
14:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Can anyone help me to get my ghost updating in DDNet ?
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> played a map, and i am doing better times, but my time at ghost wont update
14:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ?
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Can anyon fix it
16:09 <+ochristi> have any of you seen political ads in useragent/web logs before?
18:04 <@Nimda> Stop Over 1.0 by N9mkOik just released on Solo at 2017-09-22 18:00
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ^ bugged
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> My Ghost isnt updating in teeworlds
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> You have the latest ddnet versions?
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ye
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> Server?
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> Official one?
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> im offline right now, but i was on a ddnet server
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> run_g6
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> cl_race_save_ghost on?
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ye
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i get faster as my ghost to finish, and the time isnt updating on the ghost
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> weird
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> working for me
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> hmmm... it does not happen on longer maps? sounds like a bug that has been fixed in version 10.8. and several people confirmed that it is fixed =\
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> hm
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> maybe some modified server that uses other finish messages
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> some things you could do:
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> 1. check again if you really have at least version 10.8
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> 2. try another server (official one)
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> 3. try another map
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> 4. check if demo recording works
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> 5. move your existing ghost to another directory and try again
18:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i will try and say you then
19:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> can ddnet add a invisiblemode in Race ? So that other guys cant spec
19:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> like  /unspec or something
19:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
19:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why would you do that
19:48 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> do you mean /showothers?
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Im playing race with a friend and a guy is every day joining us, and takes our tricks xD
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he's learning it's bad ?
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> no he can race
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> its had to explain
19:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> hard*
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't understand
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It sound like you want to be hidden
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> yea
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i don't see reasons
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> If i want to make a good time, that guy arent stealing my tricks
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> thats not fair
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> How it's not fair
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you know how to tripple ?
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> they have to find it out self
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> imagine now, that the guy who invented it
19:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> wont show it anyone
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and yes, tripple had to be invented
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i mean. the guy who is joining us,  knows how to tripple etc, but he steals our tricks what to do better in a run(race)
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> it's a normal thing in games that you copy others tactics, but you still have to have the skill to execute it properly
19:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> in Ddrace and other things ok
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but in Race its fucking up
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> nothing different
19:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Don't think so, that option will be implemented
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but if you want to try, github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or forum
19:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> let's discuss this.
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> I want to hear the opinions of other good race like cammo netherman or someone who is playing race often
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I was playign race for a ffew years
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And i can tell you
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I doubt deen or any other admin wants to implement this
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't care
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if anyone want to learn from me
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> fine !
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> He want to use my tricks? fine !
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> jeo me iether
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> jeo me either
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> jao, sorry ðŸ˜„
19:55 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ðŸ˜ƒ
19:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> But for guys, who wont get spectated, its a good cmd or not ?
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> If i want to race with out getting spectated all the time, then is a /unspec cmd good or something like this
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Then we should also make a command
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to save your nickname
19:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and disable spectating for you as well
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> and disable spectating for you means ?
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> that im visible ?
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Because I don't think so that anyone would like to be spectated by you if you don't allow them to watch your game.
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that you shouldn't be able to spectate
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> others
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Like, if i have the /unspec cmd on, that i cant spec others ?
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Thats fine
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like never
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because you are mean lol
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> hm. sometimes i spec netherman because i want to look at this nice run.
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜‰
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but then he can activate the /unspec
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> its fair for everyone
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> or just /unspec [name]
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> that a person cant spec you anymorre
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> like a blockfunction
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't like it, anyway
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Its ok
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> maybe i get some other opinions^^
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> One of message on DDNet
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> says
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "watch other people to learn"
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it would break that point
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> never saw that message
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was very often, don't know how now. Not playing much
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜‰
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> just saw like "if you dont know how to do a challenge, try to spec someone" or something like this
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> just saw this in ddrace
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> But i dont think, that everyone is activate the /unspec
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> the message can stay, but the function would be cool too
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> or just a block function
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ./block [name]
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> he cant spec, whisper you etc
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> you cant see his messages, he cant see  your messages
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Then the blockfunction isnt used often
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> block function for someone who you dont like etc xd
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> some reason, because he blocks you often
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> idk.
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if he blocks you often, then he will do it
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> that was just one of the reasons
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we cna't now check if the preson you blocked
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is the right person
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no auth system
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> yea, but i you dont want to write with the person, or something
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> like block function in skype or something
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Thats already in client
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but on skype you can verify is the person is actgually
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> jao where ?
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and yes , you can block nicknames
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Players tab and then mute
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it will restart every connect
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ah
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> can this be permanently ?
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Don't think so
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> and with the spec function, that he cant spec anyone
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Because it's done with client id probably
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> ok. it hasnt to be permanently
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but
20:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> With the spec function, that he cant spec you
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> That wouldn't be permanent either
20:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> y
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> thats ok
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but with the unspec
20:20 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> that wont happen lol
20:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> why not
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> uve already gotten an answer by jao and savancer
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> uve already gotten an answer by jao and savander
20:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i just saw, because they should look at the tricks or something
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> lets prevent ppl from learning by watching other ppl yay
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> u even admitted watching netherman urself to learn some stuff
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> and now u want other not to be able to spec u
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> and now u want others not to be able to spec u
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i just watched his cool runs
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> not to learn anything
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> its just an extremly selfish behaviour tbh
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> analyze what are you talking
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> jao perfectly stated it
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "i just watched his cool runs"
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> u can watch tricks but that doesnt give u the skill to execute it
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> so if ur scared about being beaten well then they just executed it better
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> im not scared about that
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> instead of trying to keep others lower than u, focus on pushing urself higher
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> wrong mindset..
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but i hate it, if the same guy is always spectating me to look at me, and steals my tricks
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> he does it every day
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> he is doing his start different as mine
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> and then i see he isnt moving, then he is doing the same shit as me
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's life lol
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> so u should be flattered
20:29 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Are you such a pro racer?
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> nah
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> btw u can also type /showothers and not notice him anymore
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but every day in the evening, i am playing with a friend some race, and then the over pro racer "rayman202" is following us, and tries to do the map
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> he has like 3 sec lower time as my friend and me
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Syltoox, please stop
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> then i see he isnt doing anything and is doing some runs and gets like 0,1 time better. i mean. i beated it then, but its just fucking up
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Savander xD
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you said that several times
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> y
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Idk
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just ignore him
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> no
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i cant
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> How is it fucking up? It's called competition
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> instead of pay attention
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> jao but not with him
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why n
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why not
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cmon man, look at the pro players races, and steal their tricks
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you can done it better
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then fine !
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no one will be mad
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> end of discussion
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Can there be a function, that a person cant follow me then ?
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> thats a other thing
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Lol? How should that work xd
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> like.
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> You are on the server and he gets banned by default? XD
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> im not showed at his serverlist
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> no
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> if he joins random the server its ok
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> but that he cant see my in his friendlist
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> My god xD
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> or if he searchs "syltoox"
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> Savander sry, but i hate him
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> man, it's open source game, without auth system
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyone can have your nickname
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just change yours
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Change your name, that's the only solution
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i got 1,5k pts xD
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> and i wont change it every race
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Are talk to him, maybe that helps
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Then you have answer, no there's no option
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> then deal with it
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> do u realize u are literally creating the problem
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Or*
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> u could play and not mind him
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> or compete with him
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> and i hate the message: rayman202 has joined the game xD
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> orhis time
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> i dk
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Syltoox> xD
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> do u have nightmares with rayman202 in it too?
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> btw thats way too offtopic for #developer
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not our problem actually, go to the doctor
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe he will help you with your angry
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's not sarcasm
