04:57 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ye still too laggy
04:57 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> A huge delay in touch inputs
04:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i just woke up like a second ago
04:57 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> :think_bot:
04:57 < bridge> <ItFreddie> :justatest:
04:58 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> just finished my lunch seconds ago
04:58 < bridge> <ItFreddie> healthy
04:59 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> :tee_thinking:
04:59 < bridge> <soulyvevo> hi @tsfreddie @forgottenabscat
04:59 < bridge> <soulyvevo> hiii
05:00 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Hi @soulyvevo
05:00 < bridge> <soulyvevo> hiiiii
05:18 < bridge> <ItFreddie> ihhh
06:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I have thought about it but never done it.
07:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good morning CET enjoyers and others
07:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sad that my old Mac canâ€™t run ddnet
07:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1734848588.png
07:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOLLL
07:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Nice images xd
07:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> On website
08:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 could i get another sms from you? Ill buy you two epic beverages when we see each other again o.O
08:18 < bridge> <ItFreddie> @0xdeen can we have a json version of https://ddnet.org/mappers/Pipou/ and https://ddnet.org/mappers/ like this one https://ddnet.org/maps/?json=Amateur
08:30 < bridge> <ItFreddie> im basically making a ddnet.org wrapper in twcn for use inside of tencent apps since the ddnet.org got banned
08:31 < bridge> <ItFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320292545862959174/Image_596004689513681.jpg?ex=676911c0&is=6767c040&hm=8c31fa4901cbad56a62ccac957b0176c5da92e37c5f4bb78e67bec2121a45fff&
08:37 < bridge> <Sans> I made something for `/mappers/*` but not for `/mappers`
08:37 < bridge> <Sans> if that helps
08:37 < bridge> <ItFreddie> like a webpage parser?
08:37 < bridge> <Sans> tho it's written in typescript and is only available in my npm package
08:38 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i can parse pages, i do want to ask deen if that's easy to do before i commit to a parser. it's just the regular chn bandwidth concerns
08:38 < bridge> <ItFreddie> json is just smaller
08:39 < bridge> <ItFreddie> thanks for the hint tho, i can check the npm package when i got there
08:39 < bridge> <Sans> alright, good luck :owo:
08:39 < bridge> <Sans> btw [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddnet)
08:52 < bridge> <ItFreddie> oh i guess i could just make it myself from https://ddnet.org/releases/maps.json
08:52 < bridge> <ItFreddie> :justatest:
09:21 < bridge> <0xdeen> Why did ddnet.org get banned?!
09:21 < bridge> <ItFreddie> idk
09:22 < bridge> <ItFreddie> it's just banned from inside tencent apps
09:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> ah, i thought in all of china
09:22 < bridge> <ItFreddie> well QQ
09:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> The difference is that the mappers thing is statically generated, so far we only have json for dynamically generated stuff
09:23 < bridge> <ItFreddie> got it
09:23 < bridge> <ItFreddie> i can probably just process it myself using that all map json i think?
09:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes
09:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> The only problem is probably splitting the mappers by `, ` and ` &`
09:26 < bridge> <ItFreddie> right
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat 2 days wo review am i burning you out? ._.
11:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: nah, sorry for not responding
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm i resized my main partition with fdisk hoping it would just work but seems like it corrupted my fs does someone know how to revert this before i wipe my system? -.-
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shit im back :D running ``testdisk`` just fixed it 
13:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> You can increase the size of a partition with fdisk and then later use resize2fs to increase it. Or vice versa if you're shrinking it. No idea what you did
13:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> There are graphical tools like gparted that automate that, might be easier
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i pressed e to resize in fdisk and it seemed to have broken the signatures
13:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried booting gparted first but i got stuck on boot so i went to a arch iso and tried fdisk :D 
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: hello, can u help me with this system message? i cant find anything about it in the docs nor the source code
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> here is the link for the full packet: https://twnet.zillyhuhn.com/?d=00+00+02+42+0f+01+01+8c+00+13+04+84+61+3e+47+87+87+f6+72+b3+83+5b+d4+b9+cb+92+39+e9+cb+49+a3+a4+1b+e6+7f+04+b4+d5+cf+a0+9a+02+44+44+4e+65+74+20+31+38+2e+38+00+41+07+02+03+30+2e+36+20+36+32+36+66+63+65+39+61+37+37+38+64+66+34+64+34+00+00&v=6
14:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1320376750500220989/image.png?ex=6769602c&is=67680eac&hm=bce0761ace14c28e1232b7e73040354e3117d31a4b83c0f00e52b68b6571461c&
14:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> and it is coming from the client
14:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> so i have no idea how to repsond to it xd
14:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think i have found something
14:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> uuid=8c001304-8461-3e47-8787-f672b3835bd4 type=65542 name=clientver@ddnet.tw
14:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> now i have to figure out what to send back
14:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> the client version
14:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> well thats obvious
14:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait
14:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> nvm
14:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> im just gonna ignore that packet for now
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato oh nice your using my webparser :D it doesnt support ddnet uuids yet i highly recommend libtw2's wireshark dissector have you looked at that yet?
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are implementing the server right? I never implemented a 0.6 server but I think all of the ddnet stuff is optional. You can just respond to the clients sys info with a map change https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/system_messages.html#NETMSG_MAP_CHANGE
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> iirc that ddnet uuid message sent with sys info should be the ddnet client version
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fc6b2e36bfb18f690de01ad93e36c737d93937e1/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L214-L218
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh you already figured that out. good job :) 
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea as you can see here the server does not respond to it just remembers the client version so it can unlock newer ddnet specific features later in the connection
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fc6b2e36bfb18f690de01ad93e36c737d93937e1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1497-L1515
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as a server you could send the capabilities but all of that should be optional for a basic connection you can worry about that stuff when you want to allow zooming and so on
15:22 < ChillerDragon> ok nice finally everything fixed! Running ubuntu live worked the best haha. It ships with gparted which is indeed more idiot safe than fdisk
15:29 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> Please add the history of completed maps and the date.
15:43 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> Please add the history of Played maps and the date.
15:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i have seen the wireshark dissector but never used it
15:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: yeah i am making the server, the goal is a fully working ddnet server, but for now i just wanna implement a teeworlds server
15:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright
15:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> thank you for the info
15:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> it will be more than useful to me :P
17:43 < bridge> <les1kk> sex
17:43 < bridge> <les1kk> sex?
18:34 < bridge> <zhn> @tsfreddie can you also add approximated cursor pos calculation in smooth zoom transition?
18:34 < bridge> <zhn> now it changes only on transition end
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if using nix on windows is practical via. WSL and mingw
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> for c++ dev at least
22:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait are you crazy people using Nix as a dependency management system for your software projects?
22:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i cant wait for #8959 to get merged
22:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8959
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> why wouldn't you
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> other than windows lol
22:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> yes.
22:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> well, i'm using NixOS(btw) - but i also use(d) nix on Arch and my dad's mac
23:23 < bridge> <kebscs> waiting for heinrich review ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€
23:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> gonna prank deen when tune lock gets added
