18:21 < necropotame> I can't access to the DDNet forum: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (111 "Connection refused") [2002]
18:21 < necropotame> ^ deen, heinrich5991 
18:25 <@EastByte> oh weird
19:37 < Pyrorca> Hey, anyone here ?
19:38 < Ryozuki> yo
19:38 < Pyrorca> yeah, you
19:38 < Ryozuki> You have a problem?
19:38 < Pyrorca> what is wrong with you ?
19:38 < Ryozuki> Nothing at all, why?
19:38 < Pyrorca> Why you follow me on the serv I go with my community ?
19:39 < Ryozuki> Why not? Is there some rule where it says im not allowed to join a server?
19:39 < Pyrorca> yeah continue to play that game
19:39 < Pyrorca> continue to fake your fault
19:39 < Ryozuki> so, tell me the fault
19:39 < Pyrorca> I explained you why I kicked the guys who joined my team
19:39 < Pyrorca> And you moved me on Spec
19:40 < Pyrorca> So I change serv, with my community, and you com again ? and say "I can do What I want"
19:40 < Pyrorca> for real ?
19:40 < Ryozuki> Yes, you didn't even told him to leave, and you could also move him to spec.
19:40 < Ryozuki> Pyrorca, yep i said that after you told me why i follow you
19:40 < Pyrorca> I asked jesus to leave, he didn't, I moved him to spec, he cam again, so I kick
19:41 < Ryozuki> It's not jesus the one you kicked :P
19:41 < Pyrorca> I have just 10 000 followers on twitch, I can stream in good condition with my community
19:41 < Pyrorca> If you do your rules
19:41 < Pyrorca> So there is 2 solution, 1) I can have a private server ( which is impossible for the moment
19:41 < Ryozuki> I don't really care about your followers if you understand me
19:41 < Pyrorca> 2) you stopped and you understand why I kicked the guys who join
19:42 < Ryozuki> You just can't random kick someone.
19:42 < Pyrorca> do you understdand the fact to "play with my community"
19:42 < Pyrorca> it's a premade
19:42 < Ryozuki> if you read /rules maybe it can make you understand it a bit
19:42 < Pyrorca> PREMADE
19:43 < Ryozuki> You can play with ur community or wathever, but following the rules
19:43 < Pyrorca> and how I play with my community if there is a lot of guys who join my team mmh ???
19:43 < Pyrorca> I will spend 50m to tell to every random who com "can you leave please ?"
19:43 < Ryozuki> Imagine a dude that joins a big team specting some fun, and then a random guy just kicks him with no reason, i would be disappointed
19:43 < Ryozuki> Pyrorca, yes
19:43 < Pyrorca> Oh and btw, nobody leave when I ask ! wow what a surprise !
19:44 < Ryozuki> Then you can vote him to spec
19:44 < Pyrorca> that's what I did and you removed me
19:44 < Ryozuki> No, you didn't do that
19:45 < Henningstone> That sounds like we'd need a feature to invite people into locked teams, like that no unwanted 'randoms' could join it 
19:45 < Pyrorca> I just can't stream
19:45 < Pyrorca> with my viewers
19:45 < Pyrorca> in this situation
19:45 < Ryozuki> Don't want to sound rude, but you think that is of our convenience? i think here none cares about that
19:46 < Pyrorca> Oh really ?
19:46 < Pyrorca> 90% of the french players on this game coms from me ?
19:46 < Ryozuki> Henningstone, yeah that would be a good feature
19:46 < Pyrorca> you don't care mh ?
19:46 < Pyrorca> You don't care about the players in this game ?
19:46 < Pyrorca> You prefer to let him diying I guess right ? and respect the "rules"
19:46 < Pyrorca> I try to make this game live and having some content 
19:46 < Ryozuki> Pyrorca, don't try to make you higher or something because "famous" if you don't want to stream or bring players don't do it. It's not my problem
19:47 < Pyrorca> Well you don't understand what I'm saying
19:49 < Pyrorca> So you stop making your stuff and let me doing mine or what ?
19:51 < Pyrorca> We were all on discord, we wanted to play in team, and you just ruined all
19:51 < Ryozuki> Sure, you didn't even went through start line
19:52 < Pyrorca> Cause of we can't find a server to play ???
19:52 < Ryozuki> ofc you can
19:52 < Pyrorca> I don't want to go on a server with players cause it's not fair for them to change map, so I join a empty serv
19:52 < Pyrorca> So my community will com, so the server will have 20 players
19:52 < Ryozuki> if you go to an empty sv and join fast, i don't see any probs
19:53 < Pyrorca> so randoms will com, that's not a problem, but com in THE TEAM that is the problem, and I don't have TIME to tell to eveyr one "oooh please leave we are premade"
19:53 < Pyrorca> So I kicked, there is 20 other server to play for them 
19:56 < Pyrorca> We can't join fast, there is more than 15 people who need to refresh to find me, coming, writing /team 8
19:56 < Pyrorca> So of course there will be random who will com until the last player com in my community
19:59 < hishikiro> why is he talking alone ?
19:59 < hishikiro> can someone just react ?
20:00 <@heinrich5991> Pyrorca: would a feature like Henningstone proposed work?
20:00 <@heinrich5991> or is that too much of a hassle?
20:01 < Pyrorca> yes
20:02 <@heinrich5991> which one? :D
20:02 < Pyrorca> but I don't have any abilities to work on the game to make this kind of "private invitation"
20:10 < Henningstone> meh rip bouncer ._.
20:11 < Henningstone> I imagined it to be like that you go ingame and write in the chat "/team 3", "/inviteonly (or whatever), "/invite someguy"
