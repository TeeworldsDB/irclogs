02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is there a way to make toggle-able solid tiles? This is the closest i got, but standing on top of it makes the prediction go crazy, so they only work sideways. but if you fall down along the side of such a block, it will be slow, because we need to set the velocity to 0, so the client doesnt predict anything.

11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Fuck
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> We do store the maps in the demo right? So maybe I fucked that up? But idk how
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut not without client modification
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but one should have a client modification for this stuff anyway
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> True, hacking arou
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nd with it is fun but not really a nice way
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki do you use a frontend css "framework"
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to get better at UI/UX design
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i used a lot, i hate material design tho, i recommend semantic ui, blueprintjs, bulma, bootstrap looks rly generic nowadays
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://uniqueclan.net/ is made with bulma css
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bulma.io/
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ew
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> use no frameworks
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> or use ur own
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> :d
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and spend 1 week on something that will look shitty
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u will abandon
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://ryozuki.xyz/ my own retro shit design xd
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there u can find more stuff i used
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> no xd
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i did many things without any css framework
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also did
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but css frameworks will alwyas be better
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are done by lot of ppl
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but sometimes theres a little shit that doesnt go well with what you want to do
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> semantic ui react integration is one of the bests btw
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> im doing my own ui kit for react xd
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see ya in 2 years
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its finished
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> in fact its not
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does ur toolkit involve making api calls
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but for what i'm using it for it almost is
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was making my website but i went to the part about forms
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wym by api calls
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forms are shitty even with a framework
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i am now coding in C
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a thing ill also abandon
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Ryozuki/SimpleGame
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its fun to learn sdl
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like sdl
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not even using opengl
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sdl renderer
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> luckily it got batched rendering not long ago
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its not that bad
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> C is another level
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A framework helps people like me who lack the creativity
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 There seems to be a bug with the `DONT_MASK_ENTITIES` flag. If I connect to a server that sends the flag, i have to connect twice, so 1 reconnect for it to work. Same goes when I was on such a server and go on another server, that doesnt send it, I need to connect twice to have it deactivated
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doesnt the client reset it?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> try debugging it?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the flag is only set in one or two places
