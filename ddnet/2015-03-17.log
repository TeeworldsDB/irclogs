11:52 < xRoThx> Any developer online? 
11:53 < xRoThx> http://prntscr.com/6hugfx
11:53 < xRoThx> And I can't get them to stop
11:53 < xRoThx> banning makes them return 
11:59 < xRoThx> Anyone any solution?
14:14 <@deen> i believe what xrothx showed is the problem you guys fixed already
14:14 <@deen> but the block server didn't restart yet because it never ever gets empty...

18:25 < Pwned> Can anyone handle those laggs on Royal? No one can play because some seconds the server start lagging for a short time
18:26  * Pwned slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
18:43 < guenstig_werben> XXLTomate
18:47 < guenstig_werben> Sry wrong chat
18:57 <@deen> Pwned: let me see
18:58 <@deen> hm, the server just has packet loss
18:58 <@deen> since when is this going on?
18:59 < Pwned> Yesterday
18:59 < Pwned> it starts to lag harder and harder
18:59 <@deen> that's bad
18:59 <@deen> i'll complain to our hoster
19:00 < Pwned> ok thanks
19:01 < Pwned> But the map Royal2 is lag free
19:01 <@deen> huh?
19:01 <@deen> which ports?
19:02 <@deen> are we talking about ddnet chl?
19:02 < Pwned> 8204
19:02 <@deen> that lags?
19:03 <@deen> there is no server with port 8204 in chile
19:03 < Pwned> ger server
19:04 <@deen> oh yeah, they've been ddosing the server for months
19:04 <@deen> not much i can do
19:04 <@deen> let me restart it
19:04 <@deen> maybe it helps
19:04 <@deen> we have some security stuff in now
19:05 < eeeee> speaking of, any news from oy? heinrich5991?
19:05 <@deen> restarted, tell me if it still lags
19:05 < eeeee> i put all my security efforts on hold until it's clear wth vanilla is up to
19:08 <@deen> hm, still seeing ping spikes
19:09 <@deen> not seeing anything suspicious in logs
19:11 < eeeee> network looks good: rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.171/1.268/1.761/0.095 ms
19:14 <@deen> they're just targetting this one server now
19:14 <@deen> that's better for the attackers and for us I guess
19:15 <@deen> cheaper for them, doesn't affect the real DDNet servers
19:16 < eeeee> i wonder if thats about cost or if they don't want to target the real ddnet servers
19:17 <@deen> cost I believe
19:17 <@deen> they didn't hesitate to ddos us properly before
19:18 <@deen> and I believe it's the same guys attacking now
19:18 < eeeee> makes sense
19:19 < eeeee> so why does that one server lag? can't process packets fast enough with one thread or what
19:19 <@deen> that's the good question
19:19 <@deen> they're also doing mass renames
19:19 <@deen> renaming everyone at once
19:20 <@deen> I'd guess it's just a lot of packets of some kind, yes
19:24 <@deen> Apparently the lags are over
19:24 <@deen> so no idea
19:24 <@deen> on block server nearly no one has ddnet client
19:24 <@deen> they all have some weird client based on an over 1 year old ddnet client
19:26 < Learath2> deen: I am away for a week or so will check in on irc regularly but wont have time to code 
19:27 <@deen> alright Learath2 
19:27 < Learath2> dont update dlls deen the current updater cant handle it 
19:28 < Learath2> when im back ill finish it up promise :P
19:28 <@deen> ok^^
19:28 <@deen> but new openssl version with security fixes!!!
19:28 <@deen> sigh, this is why i didn't want to bundle openssl
19:31 < Learath2> just to note the old autoupdater couldnt handle dlls aswell
21:34 <@deen> argh, all the new security stuff makes it impossible to use my udp-relay
21:34 <@deen> can't get 64 dummies on a server anymore!
21:48 < o_be_one> hello
21:48 <@deen> hi
21:48 < o_be_one> wtf who said that im the founder of TW ? many players talk to me about that >.<
22:06 < fstd> o_be_one: speaking of, i wanted to thank you for that, too
22:06 < fstd> you did a very good job at creating tw
22:53 < eeeee> who created tw
22:53 < fstd> o_be_one
22:53 < eeeee> really? awesome
22:53 < eeeee> o_be_one: can i haz authograph?
22:55 < eeeee> deen: should still be possible with a little h4x. you just have to make your client behave like an old client without tokens
22:56 < eeeee> i.e. not send the extended connection message
22:56 <@deen> eeeee: i tried, but only got 5 clients instead of 64 =/
22:56 < eeeee> weird
22:56 <@deen> I mean, I used regular vanilla client
22:57 < eeeee> you can debug 1 to see if it's really because of tokens
22:58 <@deen> huh, when you join a ddnet server with vanilla client, a "0" is broadcasted to you?^^
22:58 <@deen> oh no
22:58 <@deen> i just did something wrong i guess
22:58 <@deen> works with 64
23:00 < eeeee> i recall seeing "0" too. thought thats a feature
23:02 <@deen> huh
23:02 <@deen> i don't remember that being a feature
23:43 < Shorefire> eyoo deen 
23:43 < Shorefire> you there?
23:56 < Shorefire> deen: wake up
