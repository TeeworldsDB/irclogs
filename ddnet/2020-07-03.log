02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fearzy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/728406376845410414/Captura_de_pantalla_73.png
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fearzy> ðŸ˜¦
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> did u port forward
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fearzy> ye
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fearzy> nothing, I just solve it, just I disable the firewall
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> how can i fix it (chat) file based server o_O?

08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't points are not supported in file based records
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> dont work everytime o_O?
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> how work it on other servers x'd
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/728507469529219072/Screenshot_2020-07-03-09-07-21.jpeg

09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Average time broken for solo server ranks zaf?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @TearlessAbyss46 Maybe NovaShock is the only player that finished this map on ZAF server?
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> first screenshot is with ranks from all servers combined, second from ZAF servers only
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> Why would the average be 50mins then if the finish is 32mins?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> I finished two times but shouldn't it just take the players best time instead of each of their finishes then?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> because it shows average of the map itself (from all servers) I guess, and ranks per selected server
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> It should, there is (wasn't fixed already?) bug with showing all ranks instead of best only
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> about average time: hmm, that also wouldn't fit... then my guess is that it counts times of every single finish, not only player's best one
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Yami_x3 File based score system can not save points, only times for top5. If you want points you need to connect your server with a database
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> @fokkonaut this is no problem ðŸ™‚ how can i do that :D? i need mysql and phpmyadmin can i run the database on a other server ^-^/? and i need a sql file for this or generate the server the tables ^^?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry, no idea. i never did database stuff, need to ask someone else
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> do you know if there is a database file where the data for the database exists? ðŸ™‚
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Yami_x3 You need MariaDB 10.2 or higher, but that's all I know from simply reading older messages there
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> oh okay thanks ^-^/
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And I guess rest needed info you will find in https://www.github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/README.md
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 I do not really understand ur skin draft tbh but if you want a example then check if 0.6 skin is greensward then use 0.7 body part greensward and the other way around
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> also it doesnt build :/

14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> How can I add a member to IServerBrowser?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @HamidReza585 what do you mean by member? a variable?
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 found it and fixed https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/pull/2
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> > @HamidReza585 what do you mean by member? a variable?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> @Ryozuki 
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> I have an error during my code editing that says PAGE_HS is not a member of IServerBrowser

16:16 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 on my machine CTeeInfo::FromSixup() does not get called no matter what version I join with
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> haha nvm forgot to compile :/ long day 
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> writing too much ruby code latley forgot things like compiling exist
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 what color system did you use? Because when I try to get green in 0.6 or 0.7 numbers i get black
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is /map command broken on ger servers?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: It's still packed hsl, 0.6 color codes should be fine
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matrioszka> @heinrich5991 why is practice still disabled
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cause I didn't recompile the servers yet
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Refresh me, teeworld is coded in C++ ? I remember have looked on ddnet's code and thinked it was C++
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's C++
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's mostly C with classes and some inheritance
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Oh ?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what I mean is that we don't use much C++ features
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> No it's not all object program ?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does have some objects. objects are instances of classes and we do use classes
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Yeah, but what i mean, sry, because i learned only web programming, is like a all class with inherence and a main application, or just some class that are called ?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think out of those, it's classes that we wrote that get called from a main function that we wrote
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Okay ðŸ˜®
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> So yeah, it's like a all-object application
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no (?) just a lot of the parts are encapsulated in classes
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> For someone who start, where do you think i should start to understand teeworld / ddnet's code ?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the first thing you could do is try to add a little chat command
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. try to react to a player saying a specific word, maybe by displaying "you win" or similar
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Hum okay i will looking to that, thanks
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Hm okay i will looking to that, thanks
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> is it working to create a database for DDRace on a external server?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> give it a help for a external database ^-^/?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#importing-the-official-ddnet-database
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i dont want to install the database on the same Server, but i know only the local database xD
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says `localhost`
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> put your server address there
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @heinrich5991 help i can hook through edges between blocks, pls fix bug
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a central element of ddnet physics
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> yeah but it isnt running on linux or windows i rent a databse ^^
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you can just put the server IP there
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @heinrich5991 so why did u apply for a fix for it years ago :O
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't as far as I'm aware?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> oh
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I thought it was u
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> But someone did xd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean in 0.7?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no in 10 years ago teeworlds
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> can i import all 3 sql files in the same databse oO?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> I remember the time of edging was too much hard for me. I see those who did like alien.
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Now i look those who do aled like alien.
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is ddnet rlsing on steamM?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if so, what date
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no known date
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it will go out on steam
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve is reviewing ddnet according to heinrich
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ddnet was greenlit like 3 years ago
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> nvm it was 5
