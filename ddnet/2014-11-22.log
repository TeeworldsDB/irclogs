02:25 <@deen> back after killing ddnet.tw unintentionally^^
02:41 <@deen> now i have to rescue the records made in the downtime on EUR and GER2
04:28 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
04:29 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
04:55 < eeeee> deen: what's the ping from ger1 to ger2?
04:56 <@deen> eeeee: 0.8ms
05:02 < eeeee> woah nice
09:10 <@EastByte> eeeee: NET_MAX_PACKETSIZE = 1400, there should be atleast enough space to transmit an ip address+port safely
09:56 < eeeee> yup, gre overhead is 24 bytes
09:58 < eeeee> would totally work! just need a bunch of iptables and ip trickery
09:59 <@EastByte> well deen doesn't like complicated solutions :P
10:00 <@EastByte> also ddos currently doesn't seem to be problem
10:00 < eeeee> its the least complicated solution in terms of coding
10:00 <@EastByte> yea maybe
10:00 <@EastByte> and I like it
10:00 < eeeee> because no coding is required (unless you count bash scripts :P )
10:00 < eeeee> doesn't actually solve ddos either
10:01 < eeeee> is mostly for self-gratification
10:01 <@EastByte> in some way it does
10:01 < eeeee> not really. if e.g. GER1 is ddosed then everyone gets dropped off it, no matter if the were connected directly or through GER2
10:01 <@EastByte> ips often are affected badly by ddos mitigation
10:02 <@EastByte> yea ger1 needs to be hidden then
10:02 <@EastByte> how would it make sense otherwise?
10:02 <@EastByte> better routing?
10:03 < eeeee> well if you have a hidden ger1 and then ger2-ger9 then i guess it could help vs ddos
10:03 <@EastByte> "eeeee | could hack the client to send packets to/from both :>"
10:03 < eeeee> yeah, deen was complaining about how routing is sometimes better to ger1 and sometimes better to ger2
10:04 < eeeee> or sth like that
10:04 <@EastByte> that might solve it
10:05 < eeeee> anyway, i feel like we have to go deeper
10:05 <@EastByte> deeper?
10:05 < eeeee> and actually implement some kind of distributed server
10:06 <@EastByte> yes! :D
10:06 < eeeee> i was thinking about using the same principle antiping does
10:06 < eeeee> except implement it in servers
10:10 <@EastByte> serverside prediction?
11:40 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/emscripten/blender_exp/

12:45 <@deen> nice EastByte 
13:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/ybdXSA
13:18 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 197ed5d def: Use 0.6.3 server crash fix since the other seems not to work with GCC 4.9.2 with optimizations on
13:24 <@EastByte> deen: "since the other seems not to work with GCC 4.9.2 with optimizations on"
13:24 <@EastByte> how is that?
13:24 <@deen> coffee says so, i didn't check
13:24 <@deen> he uses gcc 4.9.2
13:25 <@deen> when he compiles with optimizations and my fix => still crashes
13:25 <@deen> no optimizations => no crash
13:25 <@EastByte> sounds unlrealistic though
13:25 <@deen> I've had to deal with many compiler bugs in the last months^^
13:25 <@deen> but don't really expect this from gcc, would have to test myself
13:25 <@deen> let me do that
13:25 <@EastByte> deen: btw. where is ger2?
13:25 <@EastByte> (provider)
13:26 <@deen> EastByte: http://gametekk.de
13:26 <@EastByte> did you mention gametekk before?
13:26 <@deen> yes
13:26 <@EastByte> ah okay
13:26 <@deen> they say to have link11 ddos protection
13:26 <@deen> which i'm really curious about
13:27 <@deen> i think it's interesting that nfoservers has great ddos protection but doesn't advertise it anywhere
13:28 <@EastByte> yea it is
13:30 <@EastByte> maybe they can't stand too much ddos
13:30 <@deen> indeed
13:30 <@deen> total bandwidth they have is 20 gbit/s at each location
13:30 <@deen> if they got a few attacks it would go down
13:34 <@EastByte> wooow, I never saw that before
13:34 <@EastByte> some prediction failure
13:37 <@deen> i can confirm
13:37 <@deen> gcc 4.9.2 wrongly optimizes that and removes the "Offset < 0"
13:38 <@EastByte> that's horrible?
13:38 <@deen> seems so
13:38 <@deen> I'll try to make a minimal example
13:38 <@deen> and bug report
13:38 <@deen> we noticed because a guy was crashing blockZ server again
13:38 <@deen> with the same exploit^^
13:39 <@deen> but he couldn't crash ddnet
13:39 <@EastByte> ^^
13:40 <@EastByte> deen: https://eastbit.net/public/videos/predfail.webm
13:40 <@EastByte> ever seen this before?
13:40 <@deen> nope, really weird
13:40 <@deen> maybe your map file is broken?
13:40 <@EastByte> oh shit
13:40 <@deen> same checksum, but different map
13:40 <@EastByte> I forgot that I removed the mapcrc check for a test
13:41 <@deen> haha
13:41 <@deen> didn't get any fuzzy testing working yesterday =/
13:42 <@deen> american fuzzy lop was only for file reading programs, not networking ones
13:42 <@deen> and zzuf seemed weird and unmaintained
13:42 <@EastByte> what's fuzzy?
13:45 <@deen> you use normal inputs and they get manipulated in some ways to find security bugs
13:46 <@deen> would have found the server segfault i think
13:46 <@EastByte> oh
13:47 < laxa> deen: did you remove nealson's time on AIB Quest 4 ?
13:48 <@deen> which?
13:48 < laxa> the best
13:48 < laxa> he was first
13:48 < laxa> his rank is gone
13:48 <@deen> huh?
13:48 < laxa> just wondering why
13:48 <@deen> i don't remember doing that, no
13:48 <@deen> are you sure?
13:48 < laxa> how come his rank just disappeared then ?
13:48 < laxa> yes I am sure
13:51 <@deen> database replication problems again
13:51 <@deen> will fix
13:53 < laxa> ok
13:55 <@deen> ah, RUS server totally crashed and lost part of its mysql binlog
13:55 <@deen> should be fixable
13:56 <@deen> it's a wonder that this replication ddnet has even works at all
13:56 <@EastByte> because of fastdl?
13:56 <@deen> really need a proper solution for this
13:56 <@deen> fastdl?
13:56 <@EastByte> fast map dl
13:57 <@deen> ???
13:57 <@deen> what because of fast map dl?
13:57 <@EastByte> oh I misunderstood "replication ddnet"
13:57 <@EastByte> nvm
13:57 <@deen> ok
13:57 <@deen> database replication i mean
13:57 <@EastByte> okay
13:58 <@deen> basically we have 7 database servers  connected in a circle, all acting as master and slave at the same time
13:59 <@deen> I would want a system where the database servers are independent, and each sends the new records to every other server
13:59 <@deen> but haven't found a way to do this so far
14:00 <@EastByte> hmm
14:16 <@deen> Ha!
14:16 <@EastByte> HA
14:17 <@deen> Have it down to 20 lines
14:17 <@EastByte> hwhat
14:17 <@deen> that's a fun bug
14:17 <@deen> the minimal gcc bug
14:18 <@deen> When you check "Chunk < 0" before it optimizes wrongly, if you leave out the check it's fine
14:18 <@EastByte> ah
14:20 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/minbug.c
14:21 <@deen> gcc -O2 -o minbug minbug.c && echo 100000000 | ./minbug
14:21 <@deen> compared to
14:21 <@deen> gcc  -o minbug minbug.c && echo 100000000 | ./minbug
14:22 <@deen> oh, same bug with 4.8
14:22 <@deen> luckily 4.7 is fine
14:22 <@deen> which is in debian stable^^
14:25 <@deen> oooh
14:26 <@deen> "As signed integer wraparound (overflow) is not defined by C/C++ standards, GCC sometimes optimizes expressions with the assumption that wraparound does not happen, even though the CPU very well does perform wraparound. This can lead to cases in which the behaviour of a program depends on the optimization level that was used to compile the code."
14:26 <@deen> Great!
14:29 <@EastByte> haha
14:29 <@EastByte> maybe overeflows should be prevently manually?
14:30 <@deen> how?
14:30 <@deen> you want to check the size of the current integer datatype, check if the values are small enough and only then do the multiplication?
14:31 <@deen> haha, fefe once found the same bug: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30475
14:31 <@deen> and i think i even remember reading that back then...
14:32 <@deen> "PLEASE REVERT THIS CHANGE.  This will create MAJOR SECURITY ISSUES in ALL MANNER OF CODE.  I don't care if your language lawyers tell you gcc is right.  THIS WILL CAUSE PEOPLE TO GET HACKED."
14:32 <@deen> Well predicted fefe
14:32 <@EastByte> fefe!!
14:32 <@EastByte> ist fett
14:37 <@EastByte> it's cool to help noobs who can't rocketjump, by rocketflying them up
14:38 <@EastByte> I'm a helper!!!
14:39 <@deen> oh yeah, he found that while writing his bignum library^^
14:39 <@deen> for the CCC talk
14:40 <@EastByte> :D
14:57 <@deen> So, here's how to properly do it: https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/INT32-C.+Ensure+that+operations+on+signed+integers+do+not+result+in+overflow
14:57 <@deen> Love the code examples where you have to write 20 lines for a simple signed multiplication just because of this
15:14 <@EastByte> ^^
15:14 <@deen> and somewhere in one of the many discussions a gcc developer suggested that average programmers should just not use c and c++
15:15 <@EastByte> haha
15:15 <@EastByte> security expert level++
15:15 <@EastByte> I will treat multiplications different in the future
15:15 <@deen> how?
15:16 <@deen> I still haven't understood how to do it properly
15:16 <@EastByte> I'm just saying the next time I'm searching for vulns, I will care about signed multiplication^^
15:16 <@deen> Even if there is a check that the value is within bounds
15:17 <@EastByte> optimization might kill it
15:17 <@deen> Basically, as soon as you have a signed integer overflow, you do not know what your program will do from then on...
15:17 <@EastByte> okay right
15:18 <@deen> on another note: the http://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate (and so on) pages are getting too long. I would like to split them up into multiple pages
15:19 <@deen> But then links like http://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate/#map-42 will stop working
15:19 <@deen> any idea how to fix that?
15:19 <@EastByte> js would be the only way I guess
15:20 <@deen> how would you do it with js?
15:20 <@EastByte> you can make the list more dynamic
15:20 <@EastByte> (filling up while scrolling e.g)
15:20 <@deen> but then you can't use ctrl-f anymore
15:20 <@EastByte> and check the url of #
15:21 <@deen> that's what i hate about these dynamically loading sites
15:21 <@EastByte> add a search bar there :P
15:21 <@deen> oh god^^
15:21 <@EastByte> you can't ctrl+f players either
15:21 <@EastByte> since there are too many ranks
15:21 <@deen> yeah
15:21 <@deen> you're probably right
15:21 <@deen> the site is turning too dynamic for my taste
15:22 <@EastByte> I prefer 100% dynamic or completely static
15:22 <@EastByte> don't like both
15:22 <@deen> i prefer 100% static
15:23 <@EastByte> html has changed btw :D
15:23 <@deen> what?
15:23 <@EastByte> I think there is no reason for the webserver to generate a page
15:23 <@EastByte> the client should do that
15:23 <@EastByte> html5
15:23 <@deen> ah, you mean you should just send the data and javascript
15:23 <@EastByte> yea
15:24 <@EastByte> no one would notice since html5+js runs everywhere
15:24 <@deen> but then I can't use links as my browser anymore
15:24 <@EastByte> you can handle them using js
15:24 <@EastByte> or make a static and a dynamic version of the site :P
15:24 <@deen> hell no
15:25 <@EastByte> I like that^^
15:25 <@EastByte> for my own project I would make a retro static/simple version and some weired dynamic/floating html5 stuff for the kids out there
15:27 <@deen> I'm really not a big friend of javascript
15:28 <@EastByte> doing layouts and stuff using jquery is really cool
15:54 < Nimda> FWYS 2 by Ama just released on Moderate at 2014-11-22 09:53
15:54 <@EastByte> FWYS 2 yay
15:58 <@EastByte> laxa: :>
15:59 < Nimda> HDP_run_gay25 by Kaestchen & Kuadmair just released on Solo at 2014-11-22 09:58
16:01 <@EastByte> nobody wants to play
16:54 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
16:54 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 489
16:54 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
16:54 <@deen> doesn't look that way EastByte :P
17:07 <@deen> EastByte, eeeee other idea to get low ping and ddos protection with multiple servers!
17:08 <@deen> Use anycast: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast
17:13 <@deen> (That's how 8.8.8.8 has low ping everywhere)
17:13 <@deen> we could do anycast with GER, GER2, EUR, and redirect all to a strong secret server without ddos protection, also located in Frankfurt
17:15 <@deen> hm, but on a ddos attack would the packets move to another node?
17:16 <@deen> or even when the ping suddenly increases
17:16 <@deen> meh, maybe we need to roll our own anycast after all, like you suggested
17:24 <@EastByte> yea, don't be so complicated deen 
17:24 <@deen> ...
17:24 <@deen> anycast would be simpler because it's working already
17:25 <@deen> don't think you get anycast anywhere cheap though
17:29 <@EastByte> not an option for us I think
17:30 <@EastByte> how does gre actually work?
17:31 <@EastByte> looks like tun/tap tunnel but a little bit deeper
17:32 <@EastByte> so the idea was to send all udp packets twice to two different servers
17:33 <@EastByte> and eeeee wanted talked about server distribution and antiping serverside
17:33 <@EastByte> -wanted
17:34 <@deen> interesting, but you didn't write that in this channel, did you?
17:34 <@EastByte> he did
17:35 <@deen> starting at 09:10 today?
17:35 <@EastByte> oh you weren't there
17:35 <@EastByte> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/7463550
17:36 <@deen> weird, why didn't i receive these messages?
17:36 <@deen> aaaah, ddnet.tw was down, right
17:36 <@EastByte> 02:29:21             --> | deen (~deen@ddnet.tw) has joined #ddnet
17:36 <@EastByte> 02:29:21              -- | Mode #ddnet [+o deen] by Q
17:36 <@EastByte> 02:29:57           @deen | back after killing ddnet.tw unintentionally^^
17:36 <@EastByte> 02:46:29           @deen | now i have to rescue the records made in the downtime on EUR and GER2
17:36 <@deen> yes yes
17:36 <@EastByte> yeaa
17:37 <@deen> Note to myself: Don't blindly copy /etc files from other servers
17:38 <@deen> I don't understand how that would work exactly
17:38 <@EastByte> Note to myslf: Prevent deen from blindly copying /etc files from other servers
17:38 <@deen> "DNAT them on each other"?
17:38 <@EastByte> I'm not sure eithre
17:38 <@deen> and doubling the traffic is also not ideal
17:38 <@EastByte> why?
17:38 <@deen> traffic is already pretty high
17:38 <@EastByte> not for eur :D
17:39 <@deen> On a full server with /showall and /showothers you receive 15 KB/s
17:40 <@EastByte> players are not using showothers afaik
17:40 <@EastByte> showall*
17:41 <@EastByte> argh dunno which one
17:41 <@deen> haha
17:43 <@EastByte> hmm how hard is it to sync a tw server over multiple servers
17:43 <@EastByte> we shouldn't have any packet loss there soo..
17:43 <@deen> impossible?
17:44 <@deen> but yeah, synced servers worldwide would be cool
17:44 <@deen> ^^
17:44 <@EastByte> worldwide^^ yea
17:47 <@deen> ew, i lost 1 packet to GER2
17:47 <@EastByte> OH CRAP!
17:47 <@EastByte> you need to find it
17:48 <@deen> But I think the server is under attack anyway
17:48 <@deen> Often incoming traffic is higher than outgoing
17:49 <@EastByte> ah
17:49 <@EastByte> I think eur is attacked everyday
17:49 <@deen> probably all servers
17:49 <@EastByte> often have laggs ang longtime highpings
17:50 <@deen> it's too bad that there is no interface for getting information about attacks =/
17:50 <@EastByte> we can make staticics about client network stability
17:51 <@deen> nah, i want to see when it's protected, how strong the attack was
17:52 <@EastByte> maybe the provider doesn't even have information ddos protected nodes :P
17:52 <@deen> yeah, i think so too
17:53 <@deen> probably his entire line is just behind one protection and that's it
17:53 <@EastByte> yea
17:54 <@deen> there is too much magic happening in routers
17:54 <@deen> icmp ping can be 120 on GER for me, meanwhile ingame 20, and the other way around...
17:55 <@EastByte> I still want to test to use multiple ips for one gameserver
17:55 <@EastByte> like one gameserver binds to multiple ips
17:55 <@EastByte> which are routed to the same host
17:55 <@deen> I think we should make the teeworlds protocol look like voip-packets, they usually get the best treatment :P
17:55 <@EastByte> haha
17:55 <@deen> i bet you can reduce spikes and ping like that
17:56 <@EastByte> only because chileans were able to use laxa's ts?
17:56 <@deen> no, because I read about it on heise :P
17:57 <@EastByte> ah
17:57 <@EastByte> hm would also be a funny project
17:57 <@EastByte> a lib which implements all kinds of protocols
17:57 <@EastByte> for own use
17:57 <@deen> just make a wrapper
17:57 <@deen> i mean, wrap the actual protocol inside a voip-protocol
17:57 <@deen> ^^
17:57 <@EastByte> yea sure
17:57 <@EastByte> but the voip-protocol needs to be rebuild
17:58 <@deen> here it was: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Netgear-Switches-mit-10GBase-T-und-AVB-2461190.html
18:01 <@EastByte> hm, the fact that switches use a higher priority for specific protocols leads to misuse of them
18:01 <@EastByte> a game developer just would use a voip protocol for his game
18:01 <@deen> exactly
18:02 <@EastByte> I don't like the idea of the manufactures
18:06 <@deen> i like the tunneling solution
18:09 <@deen> i'm trying DNAT now
18:09 <@EastByte> do that :)
18:12 <@deen> can't get it to work
18:14 <@deen> home connection ddosed again
18:45 <@EastByte> you should take care about you home connection
18:45 <@EastByte> maybe telekom doesn't like it
19:20 <@EastByte>  eur isn't really playable 
19:22 <@deen> EastByte: ddos or why?
19:24 <@EastByte> I'm not sure
19:24 <@EastByte> it laggs sometimes
19:24 <@EastByte> mitigation statistics look normal
20:49 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:50 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!

21:10 < laxa> long nap :)
21:11 < laxa> deen: HDP_run_gay_25 is 3 stars imo, not 4
21:11 <@deen> yeah, changed already
21:11 <@deen> just didn't update servers
21:17 <@deen> eeeee: any suggestions how to setup the dnat/tunnel?
21:21 < Maple> sight
21:26 <@deen> hi
21:27 < Maple> deen i have a problem
21:27 < Maple> i have people ganging up on me and banning me
21:28 < Maple> its really annoying 
21:28 <@deen> names?
21:28 < Maple> TheProXD
21:28 < Maple> he keeps voting
21:28 < Maple> i dont know who f3's
21:29 < Maple> he keeps voting me each time he sees me
21:29 < Maple> i got banned twice in the last 10 min
21:32 <@deen> i think they just kick everyone
21:32 <@deen> i joined and they tried kicking me
21:37 < laxa> deen: you have a faker online
21:42 <@deen> where?
21:42 < laxa> GER:8326
21:42 < laxa> unless it's you
21:42 < laxa> with bra flag
21:44 <@deen> yes, it's me
21:47 < coffee> lol
21:47 < coffee> humph, sry, hello :) good luck
21:47 <@deen> hi. what?
21:48 < coffee> The story about your faker. It's just funny, sry.
21:51 < coffee> .. or not. Anyway I Found the right way to configure Miranda IM. It's a nice IRC client. There are tons of features.
21:51 <@deen> o_be_one: I made Maple mod
21:52 <@deen> coffee: happens all the time that people think i'm a faker
21:52 <@deen> like 3 times in 5 minutes now
21:52 < coffee> Your account system will fix that :)
21:54 < eeeee> deen: creating such a tunnel is quite a hassle, not sure if you really wanna deal with it. you'd have to use iproute2 to set up gre tunnel and conditional routing tables, and then add a couple rules to iptables to make conntrack mark the packets which belong to connections incoming from the tunnel so that the would use the conditional routing tables
21:56 < eeeee> with tunnel tw server would see the real client ips
21:56 <@deen> hm =/
21:56 <@deen> i thought it would be easier
21:56 < eeeee> dnat is much easier to set up but tw server will see ger1/ger2 ip as client ip
21:56 < eeeee> so you cannot ban anyona
21:56 <@deen> and people can connect with 64 clients
21:56 <@deen> and votes don't work
21:58 < eeeee> well otoh tunnel isn't actually that hard. theory behind it is quite involved but setting it up is just like 5 or 7 commands
21:58 <@deen> tunnel sounds better
21:58 <@EastByte> and do we even have gre kernel support in openvs?
21:59 < eeeee> thats a good question
21:59 <@deen> openvs?
21:59 < Axomar> Deen, r u there?
21:59 <@deen> hi Axomar 
21:59 < eeeee> i was assuming you're on kvm
21:59 <@EastByte> openvz*
21:59 < Axomar> Hi :)
21:59 <@deen> the relevant servers are KVM and XEN
21:59 <@deen> should work i think
21:59 < Maple> accounts
21:59 < Maple> damn
21:59 <@deen> Maple: what?
21:59 < Maple> no more faking :(
22:00 <@deen> yeah, make accounts EastByte !
22:00 < Maple> wasn't that what you were talking about?
22:00 < Axomar> Deen, i send u a pm :) have u Time to read this?
22:00 <@deen> Maple: no
22:00 < Maple> oh oups
22:00 <@deen> Axomar: i read it
22:00 <@deen> Axomar: then Saavik should tell me that herself
22:00 <@EastByte> I'm too depressive right now :/
22:01 < Axomar> She Talk to me that he Talk to u this ;OO
22:01 < Axomar> "She
22:01 < Axomar> xD
22:01 <@deen> Axomar: i don't know why you want to be an official tester so quickly
22:01 <@deen> all you get is access to download maps
22:01 <@deen> you can test perfectly fine as it is
22:02 < eeeee> there's actually another problem: how are you gonna register the tunneled endpoint on masters
22:02 <@deen> all maps are on test server already
22:02 <@deen> and there are maaaaaaany maps that need to be tested right now
22:02 <@deen> eeeee: with some hack
22:02 <@EastByte> eeeee: one option, ddnet client only with ddnet tab
22:03 < eeeee> mh, in any case it won't be a zero coding solution anymore :/
22:03 <@deen> with ddnet tab it is
22:03 <@deen> you can have GER1 and GER2 and connect to either
22:03 <@EastByte> and we could extend the ddnet tab without much work
22:03 <@EastByte> (multiple ips for one gameserver)
22:03 <@deen> yes
22:04 < Axomar> Deen this is the Problem, when i come online, i Look firstly i in the Forum to Check out it, then i go on the testserver and the Map WHO i will Test, isnt online :( and it makes me Fun to Test the Maps, but it gives user who didnt post the Maps in the Forum :/
22:04 <@EastByte> If we would want to add masterserver support like that
22:04 <@EastByte> favourites cannot work anymore
22:05 <@deen> Axomar: on test server use change_map in rcon, it works better than votes
22:05 < Axomar> Sry my Tablet :/
22:05 < Axomar> I know deen
22:07 < Axomar_> This fucking LAN -.-
22:29 <@deen> I'm pretty sure the lotto numbers were hacked on 2014-07-30
22:31 <@heinrich5991> deen: why?
22:31 <@deen> the numbers were 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 37
22:31 <@deen> successive numbers, ok
22:32 <@deen> but ending in 1337 is funny
22:32 <@heinrich5991> there was a 123456 or similar once
22:34 < coffee> 1234561337
23:20 < eeeee> oh yea, all of i wrote above requires a spare ip for each server
23:21 < eeeee> you could make it work using only one ip but that would require bridging together physical interfaces and tunnel endpoints and then using ebtables to decide what ports should be handled locally and packets for what ports should be sent to remote endpoint via the bridge
23:22 < eeeee> could actually perform better than conntrack
23:22 < eeeee> but you'd have to hardcode the ports in ebtables
23:23 < eeeee> also bridging the tunnel endpoint to the underlying device is kinda mindblowing
23:23 < eeeee> but it totally works!
23:24 < eeeee> bridges are much easier to screw up though, i wouldn't try that on production system
23:25 <@deen> eeeee: you should make a guide for this^^
23:28 < eeeee> yeah maybe i should
23:28 <@deen> i don't have any experience with that
23:28 <@deen> would like to try it out
23:28 < eeeee> i had a lot of adventures in networking while playing a small isp when i lived at university
23:29 < eeeee> we had ridiculous prices for internet back then, but if you bought in bulk it was order of magnitude cheaper
23:30 < eeeee> so i set up a dusty pentium 3 computer and set up some internet sharing there for my friends
23:30 <@deen> i only have networking experience in openbsd, not linux
23:32 < eeeee> 3 years later i had 30 subscribers, supported 4 types of tunneling with nat for ipv4 and native ipv6 passthrough. ipv4 was also connection load-balanced over 8 uplinks.
23:32 < eeeee> and some of said uplinks used this bridge-tunnel-to-underlying device technology
23:39 <@deen> nice
