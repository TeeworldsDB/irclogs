00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where exactly?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uff, been too long since I last debugged it, had to write a custom tool to keep track of the allocations ðŸ˜„
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jupstar absolutely hated the idea of trading off a bit of performance for 32 bit compatibility, he should remember
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Azulflame> steam reports that 1.93% of people game on a 32 bit computer
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Azulflame> so it's a very reasonable stance
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Having an issue with dilate, my checkpoint tile seems to have the undeep above it leaking into it? Don't think this should be happening

07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Bottom is after dilate
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the driver also allocates this huge chunk of memorycould just default 32bit to gl1.x, and chrain needs a different solution then xd
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Skeith\: what is the original tileset?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Pogggers

14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Azulflame> I run both windows and linux on the same pc, how do I keep the same settings / account synced between the two?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The settings file should(tm) be portable, so you can copy it over directly. Two concerns would be sensitivity and gfx settings
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> there are programs where you can have a shared cloud folder between systems, something like windows onedrive
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> buy a vps or setup a home server
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and use rsync
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> obviously with linux ðŸ˜‰
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> linux supremacist
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> (i use arch btw)
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make ~/.teeworlds on Linux a symlink to the Windows partition's %APPDATA%/Teeworlds directory, not sure if there are newline problems etc
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-February/136040.html
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The GNU C Library version 2.35 is now available
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the first bug i see is a race condition
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > [12889] nptl: Race condition in pthread_kill
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that looks serious xd
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @Jupstar âœª
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/938834630738591864/almostd3faultntxtz.png
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It seems fine without being dilated, but when dilated the checkpoint tile gets messed up
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u shouldnt dilate i hear it was fixed so u dont need to
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im not sure
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Even if I left a miscolored pixel somewhere, why would dilating it make it so much worse?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ah?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ha!
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u dont need to dilate anymore
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dilating was used to fix a bug in the rendering, well, not fix, but outplay it xd
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you're referring to tileset_borderfix
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes sorry
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I recently saw a setting about the editor automatically dilating imported images
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it sounded familiar in this context, because this is a border issue
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 btw, it seems like when my server is being attacked for example it looses connection to ddnet master and can not get it back afterwards
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i didnt take a dump yet tho
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in which scenario do i need to take the dfump?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/938838774400553040/unknown.png
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah wait, wasnt ddnet http only on master 1?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and 2
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mhhh no, it should fetch all servers i think
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> take the dump now when you're not listed on the master
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how long?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a couple of minutes
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your server IP address btw?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 45.144.246.102:8303
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or fokkonaut.de
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Skeith\: yeah it probs happens bcs there is only 1 pixel gap between those, we have an implementation that respects each indivindual tile, but it is currently only used in the mapoptimizer bcs it requires to know if the texture is used as tileset or quad
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can disable it in the config for this single image and just fix it manually
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you even use it in the editor xd
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I see, thanks
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> someone wanna explain me how to excute a python script on my raspberry pi?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> https://github.com/alexellis/phototimer/find/master
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i found this timelapse code for my raspberry and i would like to use it, but i fail to execute it i guess
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> nvm i guess i found a way to get it.
