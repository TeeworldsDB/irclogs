04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I've got a 0.6.5 vanilla server to support both 0.6 and 0.7 clients. https://github.com/timakro/teeworlds/tree/sixup You can play deathmatch right now, there's a lot not working right now e.g. chat, spectate

07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro any plans to get this into official ddnet?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Do you know why ddnet is still stuck with this other token system and isn't using the one you did for vanilla? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/a263185571903ead01f6b351a91ea219ac9d215f
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because no one added it
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not compatibility?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Any reason you didn't put the notifications thing into a class?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 didn't really make sense as instances IMO
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's essentially one global variable
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you think?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, we have everything else in classes, it just looked awkward, the code is full of singletons anyway
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I don't mind either way
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> want to have it in a class? if not, I'm going to put a comment there that it's fine as it is
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> :q
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> does anyone had already this issue?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/693526229826928750/unknown.png
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's fine
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @ReiTW is your project a git repo?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sure
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does the file exist?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the .git/index?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> weird
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/693558882655797408/unknown.png
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ok I got the error
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yep that was it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @ChillerDragon it's because in french we have some special characters like "Ã©"
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> just to make sure it's not me, vanilla 0.6.5 clients don't work with ddnet servers, right?
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> are they even not working with older vanilla servers because they expect token support? @heinrich5991
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i thought we added support for 0.6.5
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> last time i tested it worked
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> some people on vanilla 0.6.5 cannot connect to my server either
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i patched the server and i thought it was fixed because i could connect with it
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but the same is not true for all people
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @timakro  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c7750f36
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thanks @ChillerDragon I was missing that patch in Unique Race
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Fuck the ddnet netcode is not getting cleaner xD
