01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :sendhelp:
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :saddo:
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut which change are we trying to get in?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/605856068828004353
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I have a feeling this isn't the proper fix
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why shouldnt it be?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this needs a new gameinfo flag
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just said that
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I didn't see the discussion below
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll quickly add a flag for it
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is no discussion below :p
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just that message
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks!
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I didn't look at which specific message you sent
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just clicked on the issue I saw after clicking the message link ðŸ˜„
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut when should we render the unused tiles as a fallback?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the server isn't sending gameinfo
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then always I think, but I am not surr
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How is it right now?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Right now it will never render unused, right?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with the pr jao added it's the old `IsDDNet` match
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that is not too good
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well idk what this is fixing so idk the best fallback ðŸ˜›
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It fixes that custom entities on custom mods work
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So I think, if Gameinfo is not sent, it should always render unused
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well that wasn't the old behaviour, do you happen to know why not?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think timakro made that change
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, he made it so that we cannot fake entities
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For ddnet
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fake entities?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It happened that there was many floating hookable blocks in entities, or unhookable, but placed with front layer, because they appear to be empty in the entities
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe you are right, the ddnet check should be applied as a fallback
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, just mappers messing around with players? ðŸ˜„
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, on IsDDNet servers, you should not render unused
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But if we send gameinfo, then let the server decide
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I pushed, can you take a look?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut commited to jaos pr
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be fine
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen merge jaos pr and then release ðŸš€
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Quite the long changelog. Thanks to everyone for contributing!
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It feels like DDNet 12 is much better than the other versions
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> better how?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn whenever you have some free time, can you make ddnet clients predict projectiles so we can get this in? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1822
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 We should also predict all other tunables, shouldnt we? I dont know the impact of not updating tunes on viewpos in pause, but that is needed for the pull request. Is it only used for projectiles? Then its all good
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen idk, just the feeling :D
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updated aur to 12.6 ðŸ˜Ž
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aur?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux things
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u windows nobo
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddnet/
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ðŸš€
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw the update to sdl 2.0.10 is a windows thing, on arch i was already using sdl 2.0.10 xd
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Ryozuki update ddnet-git too
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not needed
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> Ok then xd
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it fetches from last commit
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -git packages only need update when we change the way ddnet is installed
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nuborn writing the bible
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nuborn always needs 100 hours to write something xD
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But give him the time
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He is better at writing code
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut is the resetting of projectiles done to fix things on ddnet client or vanilla clients? I don't think it would be necessary for fixing it on ddnet clients, if we instead add tunezone prediction. (and a way to get tunes, either from the snapshot or from the maps). I think that might also be easier wrt prediction
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Of course it is for vanilla
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DDNet just needs the prediction
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I'm writing on a phone:p
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Me too
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Ok, I see, so once I add the prediction this is just for vanilla?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or lets say, for every non-ddnet client
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since tunes are stored in the map now, we can predict it
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the projectiles tunes are based on where it spawns, not where it is currently
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It can spawn in tune zone 1, with speed 100, go to tune 2 with speed 10, and it would still be speed 100
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I see. I started working on tune prediction some time earlier. might have time to look at it in the weekend
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Tunes can in theory be changed in rcon I think, but none probably ever does that (and shoulnt)
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For modding it would maybe be even better if we dont use the tune zones, but instead tell the client the current tunes of the projectile when creating it somehow
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that doesnt matter too much I guess
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Yes, that would be nice for modding. Although it would be easier to send a tunezone than all the tunes
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, but the client should have the tunezones
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> They are inside of the map
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Yes, I only meant for modding purposes:p (different tunezones based on projectile instead of position)
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn please use of the extrainfo, and only if extrainfo is sent predict the projectiles, otherwise is would completely fuck up moddingggg
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> The extrainfo ones could work like before, and ddnet clients wouldnt get the other ones (that reset), so I think there wouldn't be a problem
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> for new clients at least
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> does the afk emote works when the tee is spectating?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> nope
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hm
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its kinda "afk"
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i didn't add it cuz it would be messy but i can if community wants
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> bcz now a lot of ppl seem to be afk and i dont see any zzz bubble
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/606179891922206761/unknown.png
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> needs server side update too
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah ye
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> forgot that
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok nvm then xd
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> is there any ddos ? second time i'm being timeout
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hugo> somebody there
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hugo> i cant download ddnet
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hugo> idk why
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hey guys, i have a mod (for example it's named as <evening>) so if i put entities of this mod to data/editor/entities_clear and name them "evening"
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> they dont change when i go to server with gametype "evening"
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> but if i go fng
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> they change
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> why?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> im bad sry
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Arseniy Zarche the code only looks for specific gametypes
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to display entities in your mod, you'd need to add it in the code
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I have a feeling that bors r+ didnt work
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks good to me, I see the bors logo in the checks
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Email didnt wamt to send the newline
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> @heinrich5991 so thats unreal to make that check clear_entities and check gametype of server yep?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't exist today, yes
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/606228168357052449/unknown.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> tee overlapping text when not spectating
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> actually forgot the spectating thing
