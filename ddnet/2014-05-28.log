21:49 < goo> hi
21:52 <@deen> hi

21:55 < alebrije> o.O
21:56 <@deen> hi
21:58 <@deen> goo, alebrije ?
21:59 < alebrije> <----- Zary
21:59 < alebrije> xD
22:01 < alebrije> sup deen !!!!!!!!!
22:01 <@deen> hm?
22:05 < goo> uhm, afrigamer wants [AƒG] AfriGamer - on the server names
22:05 <@deen> Alright^^
22:05 <@deen> I told you it's better in the name
22:05 < goo> xD
22:05 < goo> my fault
22:06 <@deen> And I made a mod password for south africa
22:06 <@deen> ok?
22:10 < goo> ok
22:37 < goo> deen: when can you change server names?
22:38 <@deen> aaah, i forgot
22:38 <@deen> Right now^^
22:38 <@deen> How should it be goo?
22:38 <@deen> DDraceNetwork South Africa - Brutal [AƒG] AfriGamer
22:40 < goo> ￼<22:40:23> "Chris": DDraceNetwork South Africa [AƒG] AfriGamer - Brutal
22:41 <@deen> But then noone can read the Brutal
22:41 < goo> if that isnt possible, you can pout it in front?
22:41 <@deen> Because it's too far right
22:41 <@deen> Where in front?
22:43 < goo> [AƒG] AfriGamer - DDraceNetwork South Africa - Brutal
22:43 <@deen> Then still noone can read brutal
22:43 < goo> or  AfriGamer: DDraceNetwork South Africa - Brutal
22:43 <@deen> when Brutal is that far right with 5:4 or 4:3 resolutions you don't see it
22:43 <@deen> I want brutal more at front =/
22:43 <@deen> so players know what difficulty they're joining
22:43 < goo> yes, i understand
22:44 < goo> just trying to see what is acceptable to sponsor
22:50 < goo> so is AfriGamer: DDraceNetwork South Africa - Brutal
22:50 < goo> alright
23:01 <@deen> Eh, Brutal is still at the end^^
23:01 <@deen> goo
23:12 < goo> sorry, im back
23:15 <@deen> hm
23:15 <@deen> Now we have AfriGamer in the front like it's the most important thing^^
23:24 <@deen> AfriGamer at the end is not ok for them?
23:25 < goo> DDraceNetwork RSA - Test |AfG|
23:28 <@deen> will people find it with that name?
23:28 <@deen> or are they used to South Africa already
23:29 <@deen> I didn't even know what RSA means until a few days ago =/
23:30 <@deen> But well, South Africa isn't perfect either
23:30 <@deen> I think many south americans go there because they can't read
23:35 < goo> lol
23:41 < goo> DDraceNetwork |AfG| RSA - Test
23:41 <@deen> maybe some more abbreviations
23:41 <@deen> DDNet |AfG| RSA - Brtl
23:41 < goo> lol
23:42 <@deen> So, that's the final decision?
23:42 <@deen> I will have to explain to everyone what AfG means, and to 50% what RSA means
23:42 <@deen> DDraceNetwork AfriGamer - Brutal
23:43 < goo> you could always make binds for that xD or broadcast it if its asked in full server, but most local players will know
23:48 <@deen> So, any decision?
23:51 < goo> yes
23:52 <@deen> |AfG| RSA?
23:55 < goo>  DDraceNetwork AfriGamer - Brutal
23:58 <@deen> alright
