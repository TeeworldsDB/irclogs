10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Hello, what is the best way to organize the child elements in the elements, with each element must be initialized because its unique key is the name? Maybe there are knowledgeable people here? I have several options for using operator overloading and(or) meta, but in all cases i can't find an option that will be easy to use
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what exactly do you mean with elements?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> A class (object) that has a static hierarchy
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what problem are you trying to solve?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is this some educational thing
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xyproblem.info/
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> A class (object) that has a static hierarchy, the same objects as himself
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so basically like a linked list?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linked list bad
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> array
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you usually use a pointer
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```c++
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> class C {
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> C* m_pOther;
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> };
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> // initialize
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> C* c1 = new C();
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> C* c2 = new C();
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> c1->m_pOther = c2;
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> c2->m_pOther = c1;
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe he/she is using python or java
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont know kek
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1020975862092410992/unknown.png
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like this description from rust collections std
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes in huge lists, linked list can if you e.g. don't iterate over them be faster^^
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> take a shot every time element is used in this
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we also use a linked list for entities, bcs the "iterator" stays valid
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also a bonus of lists
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still prefer vec
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd use vec as much as possible too yeah
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and modern ecs use packed arrays for entities etc
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I don't use the Node linked list. I have already organized a list that stores a list of items (I want to organize something similar)
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> 
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I create an element 
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> ```Elem* pE = CreateElement("SomeElem", size, flags);
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> pE->RegisterCallback(somecallback);
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> (*pE)("Daughter")->RegisterCallback(somecallback2);
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> (*(*pE)("Daughter"))("Daughter")->RegisterCallback(somecallback3);```
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> 
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> but I have to initialize the mandatory size fields and flags when doing this. What pattern for initializing and using these child objects might be more correct. I mean the usage itself (which pattern would be more correct). I'll implement it myself.
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It's really hard for me to understand what exactly you want, and it seems you use some library, but smth like this to initialize child object:
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (*pE)("Daughter") = CreateElement("SomeElemOtherEl", size, flags);
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I want to see a use case that is more correct, just the option i provided seems ugly
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no more correct, if it works, its correct
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> here operator() overload and either returns the item if there is one, or creates and returns the item.
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u could start to create all elements u want
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then build the list afterwards
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its well documented, just rely on the auto initializing i guess
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in fact it would probs be unsafe to not rely on it, except there is some function like `addChild(<name>, <obj>)`
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thank you for your help will you be able to show the use case?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Is it something like that?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Elem* pE = CreateElement("name", size);
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Elem* pE2 = CreateElement("some2", size);
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> pE->addchild("some2", pE2);
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thank you for your help will you be able to show the use case?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Is it something like that?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> ```Elem* pE = CreateElement("name", size);
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Elem* pE2 = CreateElement("some2", size);
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> pE->addchild("some2", pE2);```
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes smth like that, but since the name is already in createElement, u can probably skip it in addChild
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Then the calling variant can be used if the name is a unique key, something like?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> ```pE->getchild("some2")->RegisterCallback(somecallback);```
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just use operator overloading
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u prefer less typing
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (*pE)("some2")
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like u did before
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thanks, i will try to implement your version, it looks more understandable when using it
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thanks, i will try to implement your version, it looks more understandable when using it. 
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Yes, and in this case it is possible to implement ``getchilds()` more clearly
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thanks, i will try to implement your version, it looks more understandable when using it. 
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Yes, and in this case it is possible to implement `getchilds()` more clearly
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Thanks, i will try to implement your version, it looks more understandable when using it. 
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Yes, and in this case it is possible to implement `getchildren()` more clearly
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My Teehistorian archive is now getting large to be backed up to the largest available 2.5" disks:
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> /dev/sda1       4.6T  4.5T   58G  99% /mnt/backup2
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Grows ~50 GB per week, so will be out of space next week. I don't like 3.5" disks, they are so loud and power hungry
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 50 GiB per week? oof
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should check my backups
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I had trouble last week and didn't complete the backup because of that, not an exact measure
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use stronger compression xd
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <VerteZzo> hi
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> buy 8tb ssd for 600€
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hey, whats up
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <VerteZzo> nothing)
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <VerteZzo> i just wanna to say "hi"
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but now you said more than hi
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm yeah, it's actually `xz -0`, but `xz -9` recompressing everything would probably take a few weeks, I'll check how much it saves
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I prefer 5TB HDD for 65 €
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well lets face reality then, how much is 3.5'' more engery really in energy costs? & if its too load, can you not simply buy a case that blocks noise?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or put it where ur washing maschine is xD
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No LAN connection in my bathroom 😄
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> What, i didn't know hdds were so cheap
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it probs doesnt have the highest read/write speed
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for long term storage i guess ye
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant find any for 65€ on amazon tho
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://diskprices.com/
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not worth it, saves 20%, but takes much longer to compress
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 20% sounds like lot tho
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> zstd maybe?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might give better compression with less of a performance hit
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> better probably not, does it?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just tried to google
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either way, we should find a better solution, should we just archive the oldest 1TB to some non-live storage that doesn't use power or make a sound?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> zstd -19 is about equal to xz -0, just a lot faster
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lzma2 on max is good for tw demos at least 😄
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 23gb into 2gb
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks Phoronix with Vulkan coming: https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/issues/675
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> NICE
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Want to see those 15k fps numbers 😄
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> haha, well i disabled most of the HUD, that already saves 1-2k fps
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe rtx 4090 and ryzen 7000
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I think text is expensive
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1TB of amazon glacier storage is 4$ per month. Access to it is 0.1$ per GB, so as long as we don't access it storing a tb or so of it in there might not be the worst idea
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `mom I need some stuff for a test`
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `sure if it's a test`
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ` : troll`
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard nvidia is limiting stock of 4090 on purpose
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1021011097270091838/unknown.png
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://wasabi.com/cloud-storage-pricing/#three-info
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is how i archive over 10k rn
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so only fps and time visible
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there you can even download it (6$ per month, no extra charges)
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's even better
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if they wouldnt do it on purpose they couldn't scale probably
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its really around 60% faster... ppl are too rich, i tell ya xD
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> L
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> whoops
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or if you have access to a tape drive we can put a TB or 2 into tape, though access would be pretty annoying 😄
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> backblaze has 5$ per month, I *think* it's also okayish with egress fees
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another $ for unlimited egress sounds better
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "unlimited"
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the storage part of the ddnet donations?
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it was limited to ~the size of the stored data per month or so
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> currently it's stored by deen and heinrich, from their own pocket
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, well i have around 6TB free at my server, but dunno for how long
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that wouldnt solve the problem, only give an extra backup
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this looks sane, when would we ever want to download the entire thing again 😄
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1021012821250682992/unknown.png
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just use telegram or discord, there is no total size limits & 2gb per file xDDD
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i know TOS
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think all online/cloud solutions will be expensive. I might just get another 18 TB drive
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 250€ for 14TB
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats okish i assume
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 16tb for 250 too
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, are there even 2.5" drives with 18tb?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, max 5 TB
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, there are SSDs, but I don't want to pay 30k €
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why not, all for ddnet
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i sold my soul to ddnet
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, just 4.5k nowadays: https://www.klarsicht-it.de/Intel-Solid-State-Drive-D5-P5316-Series-Solid-State-Disk-verschluesselt-30.72-TB-intern-2.5-6.4-cm/16638528
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Is there an option that allows you not to close the voting menu (which is called by the ESC button) after selecting an option? Since some mods use voting as a server menu, I think it would be a useful option
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cl_show_votes_after_voting 1`
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Where is it implemented? I can't find it for some reason, it doesn't work for me
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> press f1
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Where is it implemented? I can't find it for some reason, it doesn't work for me
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> `I found where it is implemented`
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I mean in the code itself
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> search for `ClShowVotesAfterVoting`
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I found where it is implemented

17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> where can i get list of all ddnet maps
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I think from here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i need to fetch them from js code
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> do you use unix (linux/macos)?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> nop
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> :|
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> xD I can send you the list then let me download the repo first
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> i have wsl o.o
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1021076995842527304/listofmaps
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> it's a txt file
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> find . -type f | grep '\.map' > listofmaps
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> the command
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `find . -type f | grep '\.map' > listofmaps`
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `find .` is to list files in the working directory.
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `-type f` is so it will only list files not directories
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `|` pipes it to another programm (in this case grep)
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `grep '\.map'` only prints the files which have the .map extension
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `>` redirects the standard output to a file (in this case)
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> `listofmaps` the name of the file to save the list of the maps
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> hope it helps
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf? just use `find . -type f -name '*.map'`
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn https://xkcd.com/1053/

18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I found tldr and tldr++ which is better
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I use arch btw
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hackermans
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> how come you don't use this one https://github.com/luthfianto/rust-tldr ?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont use outdated software
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i live on the edge
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> oh didn't see it had to update since 2016
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it native wayland @nori ?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> wdym by native wayland?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> it is not xwayland u mean?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> SDL forced to wayland with GLES backend
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its also the opengl backend
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan still too bugy for u to test?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> opengl sadly has almost no control over what happens under the hood with the glGetRGB command to fetch framebuffer content
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yes i get way lower fps on vulkan + more fan noise
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but thats not yet a bug is it ^^
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just some weirdness nobody can explain
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> other games works fine way better on vulkan tho, it is just weirdness happening on ddnet :d
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> example?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> like dota
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does run in native wayland?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> hmm true
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> probably not on wayland xD
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but IIRC i tried vulkan backend wtihout forcing sdl to wayland too
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> fps was still low
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well thats indeed weird, but can be unrelated 😄
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean i have the same GPU generation as you
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> but it is igpu
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i think for me on wayland fps are even higher than x11
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah right
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> maybe works better on opengl no idea
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah weird, bcs android is like 100% faster with vk xD
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so mobiles generally also profit
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> also smth weird, i get way more fps on igpu than dgpu :D
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> like 1000 on igpu, 400fps on dedicated
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tf
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well thats possible if u also have something like nvidia optimus, just the AMD variation of it
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u could e.g. monitor if both GPU have usage, when u use the dedicated one
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then its clear it copies data from one to the other
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yea it is called amd switchable graphics
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rest in peace
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i switch to wayland now, it better dont working for me 2 :toptri:

19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> FPS ARE OUT OF HOUSE XD

19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am trying to get curl to work in my project, this is not DDNet @Not Keks
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @nori well for me vulkan works fine on wayland xD
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know why it doesnt take the bundled curl
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then find_package failed
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it should take the bundled version from ddnet-libs
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does so for freetype and sdl2 too
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as an example
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does it find the CURL_INCLUDE_DIRS tho?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think yes, at least the include works in my file, and i get the defines and shit
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> lol
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> so nori exclusive bug?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, but i rendered with vulkan too
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Any ideas Jupeyy?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i usually debug it by looking what find_library inside the FindCurl.cmake tries to search
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but there is defs a better way
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> FindCurl? 😄
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should be in /cmake
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in ddnet source dir
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aha, I dont have that in my project.
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is that something generated, or can I simply copy it?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> simply copy
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aye, it worked!
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Hello. Sorry for "wrong channeling" but I'm asking as a dev. Do we have some kind of new master server registration (which requires some new impl on the server side)?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Namely, yesterday the size of `https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json`  was 513K, today it is 285K. My server is not visible in DDNet client but in the server logs I see `[register]: server registered`.
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they is a new registration, but it should still fetch the old servers
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably the tool cannot access the tw master servers or smth like that
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is a new registration, but it should still fetch the old servers
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since GER3 uses the protection from my host now the attacker gets a little mad over it, and tries to find other ways to make the game unplayable.
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He makes the servers that use the old registration method unavailable in the list.
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can still join, but they wont show up anymore. You need to implement the new method.
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I think you changed something yesterday with master?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and I switched to a new outgoing ip because chn wasn‘t reachable from old
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen, its an attack that the servers arent visible
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He does so for KoG, bombay, my server, and others that he randomly finds, as they all use the old method
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> What is the 'new registration'? A link to PR would greatly help.
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5064
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5326
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah my server isn't visible either
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Thanks @fokkonaut ♥
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what if we dont see these as attacks but rather professional bugtesting
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, so at least not a mistake from our side
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nope. They reappeared some time ago, and then at some point were gone agai :D
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> > The game servers do not support the old registering protocol anymore, the backward compatibility is handled by the masterserver.
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Aha. It means that vanilla teeworlds clients won't see the servers?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Not like I'm very disappointed but time to time people point me to some new incompatibilities with the vanilla client (0.6) and until now I fixed all the issues. Hm.
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they will see it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 will see them
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 0.6 too I believe
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you register via https -> the ip will be inserted to the old masters so that clients can fetch the serverinfo from these ips :)
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Does the DDNet master server has to spoof IPs for that?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Does the DDNet master server spoof IPs for that?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The old protocol worked in this way:
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Server registers it's ip in master
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Clients fetch ip list from master
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - clients ask every server about their serverinfo
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> New protocol works like this:
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Server registers via HTTP including it's own serverinfo.
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Clients fetch one big list from the HTTP Master without leaking IP to all servers
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Master server will add registered ip to the old master list
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Old clients receive that ip from the master and can manually ask for the serverinfo
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> - Old servers registering in the master will lead to the master getting serverinfo manually from that server, so it can be taken into the new list that is provided as json
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It would be cool to have an option to enable the old method for the clients. Someone might not care about leaking the IP but want to have the full list.
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh, the real solution would be adding your mod to the kog/community list
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for trusted ppl that contributed to ddnet it should be possible IMO
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> sp someone contributed to ddnet :)
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> go add his srv
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> ip is 127.0.0.1:8303
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is he a ddoser?
20:36 <+ChillerDragon> no proof
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Anyways, that wont fix this issue.
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1. Leaking IP address is not good and helps the attacker to specifically make you unable to play.
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 2. You can ping all servers manually, but that wont help if the attacker abuses the old protocol, so that your server wont even be registered.
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I believe the profesional testing is over

22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Good that I used demos that already have very low fps for DDNet standards, otherwise they would complain about going from 5k to 6k 😄
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how can u write in their forum
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do i need to wait some days?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If they have spam problems as DDNet's forum does, first time posters need to be approved manually by a moderator
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too bad
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd like to explain why igpus are not a good meassurement for vulkan, vulkan is meant to decrease the CPU overhead, but these iGPUs rather run into a GPU bottleneck or close to it 😄

22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2209181-NE-DDNETJSTA39
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my results show a complete different picture 😄
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more than 100% more fps
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Interesting that there are some frames that take multiple ms to render,
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well vulkan also has much better frame times as u see in 2nd graph
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> almost no jitter
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the server list is the full list; it only doesn't contain old servers if something is getting attacked
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, as fokkonaut pointed out, leaking your IP address to the attacker helps the attacker
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The list size changed from  513K to 285K, so %45 of the servers were not listed.
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> >  it only doesn't contain old servers
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The said 45%.
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, there were attacks today
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The list size changed from  513K to 285K, so %45 of the servers were not listed.
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> >  it only doesn't contain old servers
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The said 45%. The "new servers" are DDNet, the "old servers" are 95% of other mods.
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the old masterserver held up a lot worse to attacks
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The list size changed from  513K to 285K, so 45% of the servers were not listed.
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine>
