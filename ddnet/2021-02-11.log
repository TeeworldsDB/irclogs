00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what is this error and why did it randomly appear without me changing anything?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on GitHub Actions
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Computers know it better than humans, so warnings are nice
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut looks like a false positive
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i fix it? why does it only happen in my repo?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk why it only happens in your repo. you can do something like this for -Wstringop-truncation
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/b14dfcd679a623596220a6f7565622fbbd0a048c/src/base/system.c#L2533-L2536
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well ddnet hasnt pushed since 3 days
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nvm prs
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe vanilla also has this
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> internally it resizes the skin, and if you resize an 8k image to 4k and display it on a full hd monitor you dont notice it^^
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> however a resize is always interpolation, so its better you export it in the correct format ðŸ˜„
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> i really like zoom in u know ðŸ˜‚
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> i like when i see every pixel on right place xD
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can make your skin arbitrarily large
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you just have to ensure that you can divide the width by 8 with no remainder
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> I already figured it out
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> ðŸ™‚
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie if you want to share the vanilla skins under CC-BY-SA 3.0, just create a PR or send the SVGs to me
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been playing with the rc for a while now and it seems to be working quite well
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon: your grass doodas are 0.7 btw, ddnet and all the maps(which require compability) use the 0.6 version ðŸ˜„
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> imagine using 0.6 stuff in 2021 i was thinking about the future!
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1613030311.png
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> recreation of what? Should we note that its from teeworlds? or is that covered in some root license already
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah the root license describes everything
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh no also no ref to teeworlds there
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a ref to ddnet, bcs i thought its the 0.6 version
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh it refrences another 
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> ye
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure about the format
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what format
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> the license
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1613030453.png
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> thats what i went with in my tw dbs
09:01 <+ChillerDragon> it can be parsed easily
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just made it as simple as ddnet's/tw's license
09:02 <+ChillerDragon> i mean the "author:\nnote" part
09:02 <+ChillerDragon> if we get more authors and mapres
09:02 <+ChillerDragon> but yea probably fine for now and easy to refactor on demand
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah i made it just compatible to CC-BY-SA 3.0
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it requires to name the original license and what was changed
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> oh no i talk about a different file than u i think
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/blob/871cba4a2fac00fe5f517b31805d2e688b1f9662/mapres/license.txt
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that mentions everything needed, the license in root already says that everything that isnt named explicitly is SA 3.0
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and gives a link to the original license
09:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea im not talking about legal perspective but about readability consistance and parsing support
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ok, but i guess the repo isnt meant as database
09:05 <+ChillerDragon> indenting the line that is not the mapres would already support grep '^mapresname:$'
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it tries to recreate all data content
09:05 <+ChillerDragon> sure
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah idc, we can always change it later
09:06 <+ChillerDragon> yea
09:07 <+ChillerDragon> empty readme gives me anxiety ur draft looks fine so far it can always be extended later
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ^^ i'll wait until we decided rather we convert to PNG or use SVGs directly
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> maybe a smol note about licenses
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> github has a license section
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> i mean for contributors
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809335091188465694/unknown.png
09:08 <+ChillerDragon> that if they pr they accept using ccbysa3.0 if not specified otherwise
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> in the readme
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well sure, could do that
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> maybe we need to sign them shit when they pr :D
09:09 <+ChillerDragon> otherwise they copyright strike us later
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no, they grant us the right when they pr
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> without specifying the license
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> where is that guranteed?
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> in the license.txt?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> and putting it in the readme is just nice of us to inform them?
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> ok yea lets go then
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah lets still wait with the readme
09:10 <+ChillerDragon> brr
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> maybe some standards or recommended resolution of the svg?
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u are vanilla fan, is any of ANY art public as SVG somewhere?
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> i mean ik its a svg but i tried to create my svg in the vanilla scale
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> no
09:11 <+ChillerDragon> vanilla sucks when it comes to art
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> they have their secret art circle with a secret dropbox 
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think we dont need to recommend anything, the script will use standard resolution * scale factor
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> might ask some of the insiders like @Zatline
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> k
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> i think preview on github might be consistant then
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> of the svgs
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah would be nice if he shares it, else someone has to recreate it ðŸ˜„
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> share what
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> SVGs
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> no
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> thats why i recreated
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> im not an artist man i did that as last resort
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, anyway, we have good ppl, and tw graphics arent complicated, so i guess its just a matter of effort
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> sok graphic license closed src sok
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> yea its just we might end up with new bugs and different shapes
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> which is weird for true fans and looks like a chinese rip off
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> no front china
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think most important are the 0.6 mapres
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> game
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> emoticon
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> particles
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and entities
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ravie has vanilla skins
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> well my motivation is making movies
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh, it should fit the original file as close as possible ofc
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> so i focus on the things i want in my movies like doodads assembling it to a mapres is then just another smol step
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you create a new teeworlds movie or what?
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> sure always
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cool^^
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> made 3 already
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> well lets not call it movie
09:16 <+ChillerDragon> but animation
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8A37_MHxmg
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> stuff like tha
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> u can see pixels everywhere
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whhaaat USK 18
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> sure teewoods is a war game
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but they renamed teewars ;D
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> :D
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> just to hide it and sell it more family friendly
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> was pr move
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> the red one is bot
09:20 <+ChillerDragon> no its @Sonix
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> idk who that is
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> doesnt tag anyone
09:20 <+ChillerDragon> omg souly

09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> im also a serious pro gamer
09:22 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do we skip 15.3? ^^
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, I'm releasing it now
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad #3599 isnt fixed
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3599
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess gores players will be confused ^^
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or is that not inside 15.3?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have no fix and no one seems to be working on it
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we could have reverted the fclient support i guess
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can try that I guess but fokkonaut won't be happy
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut can you patch the bug, or is it to hard for you rn?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which bug?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut  #3599
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3599
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that has nothing to do with the F-Client support, that is just about the new time messages from heinrich
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you would only need to revert them
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its all in one pr?
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but they are not even in F-Client yet
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heinrich just added it on top
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, @heinrich5991 do you have time to patch that bug above?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its ok, didnt know heinrich added so much stuff to it @fokkonaut
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont see how it could not work tho
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i havent reviewed it, but 14.x worked without any problems
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 15.x doesnt work ever
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i see
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 15.3*
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me fix it
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> revert all back pls
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not reverted on mastr
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just create the patch and we are good to go
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im not sure if this is the problem: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/9e520c0a9848...22e16f9badec#diff-163e7ab2ecaaf272730a420a0e54ca8fab7bdf39417ec86c01556f3e8850302aR880-R882
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but you see, there is this legacy thing
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats the old one
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it gets casted to the new one
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the extended msg
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Sv_Record is now the new, extended one and the legacy one is the old one
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe thats why
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i've no idea sadly ^^
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me try it
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just join kog with master?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways its sad that qshar doesnt update at all
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is so much new and good stuff
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> especially for gores the spec char
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, its a bit annoying to always have backward compability, but rn we cannot change it
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> First of all the backward compability, but secondly just good missing features
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i told qshar like 20 times to finally go open source
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but he ignores it
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only top time affected?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, but thats the most obvious one, so i found it ^^
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> what about dropping support for closed src mods? :p
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it also affects DDNet++
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :P
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon: the ddnet servers also have closed source
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> antibot
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i would love antibot for my server
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right now i need to rely on sv_banned_versions
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i grabbed the ones from ddnet and got some from noby
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mabye noby can give u compiled versions, if you use the ddnet sub
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mabye noby can give u compiled versions, if you use the ddnet stub
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> cool then look at ddnet++ src to fix it :D
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats that?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like the API to it
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> no
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> i wont run compiled noby virus on my vps
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im not talking about urs ðŸ˜„
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i discord answered fokko
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> i answered for him :p
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok ðŸ˜›
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon so mean of you
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then i will move to my own vps again :P
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> no mean of noby to not share src
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its OBVIOUS
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not to share a antibot library
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats an endless discussion again ^^
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well it would not make sense
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> if noboy does not trust me why should i trust him
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> botters code go around it more easily
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could*
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> if noby think i will use the src to build a bot for fng that just hurts
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, you also use other closed src programs
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> like?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> do you have a phone?
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> yes sadly
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> i barley use it tho
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> basically everything on thee
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> true
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fokko, pls create the patch, so deen doesnt need to wait for the release, if he didnt already ^^
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye i am already checking
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not a problem with this pr at all
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I reverted it and that fixed it
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you arent sure what causes it, lets delay it for 15.3.1 fokko
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait look
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay no diea
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idea
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does not make sense to me
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I'll just release 15.3 without the f-client support?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i could try removing the extended msgs that are not part of the f-client support first
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but well
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you could also just release without, F-Client isnt ready yet anyways
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have a weird bug in there which i seem to be unable to fix
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah its better if heinrich reviews any patch anyway
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good, I reverted it in pr-15.3 branch, it stays in master so we can fix it for 15.4
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen did you just use `https://ddnet.tw/ddnet.svg`
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as the ui logo?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just scaled it with inkscape and then ran that through zopflipng -m
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow i did not know we have so many svgs o.O
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ravie already made the vanilla skins, insane ðŸ˜„
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> yes awesome
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if we have game.png as svg and maybe entities we already have enough for a testing release ðŸ˜„
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I had them for a long time :p
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ravie god
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> did you fix brownbears ear tho
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: didnâ€™t you make the first replay bot?
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I did actually :justatest:
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> nice
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 yea im somewhat guilty for the replay hype. Im sure there were prior attempts but i havent heard of a working version when i made mine back then. For a school project^ :D
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> then i accidentally posted it in ddnet and the replay concept started to spread
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> hilarious story ikr
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> still got the best grade in class :D
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> yo btw @Learath2 do you have github notifcations on or do you just ignore my quality prs?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> hello
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> i'm try add C++14/17 library for interfacing with the discord api
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> i'm try build my teeworlds server
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> but have error
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> g++-7: error: unrecognized command line option â€˜-fstack-clash-protectionâ€™; did you mean â€˜-fstack-protectorâ€™?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> g++-7: error: unrecognized command line option â€˜-fcf-protectionâ€™; did you mean â€˜-fstack-protectorâ€™?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> i'm try find at google but nothing
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Noob> cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-7 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 .. && make
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i assume ur compiler is too old
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe a missmatch between cmake and g++ version
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: I just didn't check my computer in a while. ddnet PRs?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have a svg repo now
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh nice, for all the assests we didnt have svgs for?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well rn its only a 0.7 mapres and vanilla skins + greyfox
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah, thats the idea ðŸ˜„
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 oh why that :/ nah ur dissector has 2 prs
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what the licensing on those would be, we are basically recreating assets that came without a license, no?
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> ccbysa3.0
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have all licenses for skins rest is ccbysa3.0 ðŸ˜„
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> infecous license inherited
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this dicussion again
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind infectuous licenses for art
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where did you get the license for 0.7 mapres btw? I don't even know who would own that license
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Saw your PRs, trying to motivate me to work on the dissector? :D
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> license.txt vanilla repo
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> sure!
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to talk to some wireshark devs about stateful dissection
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I couldn't find a wireshark dev community except a mailing list
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> #wireshark
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iirc it was quite dead, but I'll check tonight
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let us revive the dissector project
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1613053452.png
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> such active
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> What the f happened with google search algorithm??
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is it bad for you too?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's been bad for years for me, just shows some random results totally unrelated to what I search for. So I put every word in "" and then it's a bit more usable
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> When I search something it gives me good results like I am used to get, than it immediatly updates to very weird stuff
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809470886796329010/unknown.png

18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> The bottom one is what I get, after a second I get the top one
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> The bottom one is what I want to get, after a second I get the top one
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> just use duck duck go or searX
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I actually like that google tracks me
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and searches are relative to me
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but now the search results is just useless
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but now the search results are just useless
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its fine for me tho
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> its fine for me in incognito
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Eh, that seems more weird than what I'm used to. Maybe you have some malware on your system?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Its one of my extensions, I just disabled all
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems quite weird for google to reinterpret ddnet to d-netz...
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Need to figure out which one now
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Lol it is this one
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809473638930710548/unknown.png
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flfgnikpbnkalibambfjdnfdambpmfcj
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Also got removed from the extension store
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Browser extensions are a huge security problems. The authors regularly get great offers to add some malware
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Example: https://sponsor.ajay.app/emails/
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah I got that experience now too. You also keep it as an extension after it got removed, which is dangerous
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Removed like 8 extensions now ðŸ˜„ Only known companies are left, which should be fine?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah I got that experience now too. You also keep it as an extension after it got removed from the store, which is dangerous
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Bitwarden and uBlock Origin is all I need, personally
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I use a lot for web development, makes life much easier
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> google recommendations become bad months ago on my phone
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> now i can't quick check what is popular in my country
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Additionally to ublock origin and my password manager I have decentraleyes (https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes) and ClearURLs (https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) installed
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> httpseverywhere is also good for security
