19:59 <@deen> EastByte: did you set up the letsencrypt stuff?
20:04 < Ryozuki> what you think about enabling hyperlinks on the game, but only from server side (not from players)
20:05 < Ryozuki> so people would visit forum, discord etc much faster 
20:05 < Ryozuki> or for all, with a warning
20:06 < Learath2> one question would be, wat do if player is in fullscreen
20:06 < Learath2> is switching to the browser on a missclick desirable?
20:06 < Ryozuki> thats why warning
20:06 < Ryozuki> and a option to disable it
20:06 < Ryozuki> on settings
20:06 <@deen> i think NOO
20:06 < Ryozuki> though idk how you would click it
20:06 < Ryozuki> since u dont have free mouse xD
20:07 < Learath2> well we don't really have a way to copy them out either
20:07 <@deen> let's just link to libchrome and have an ingame browser
20:07 <@deen> easy peasy
20:07 < Ryozuki> yeah
20:07 < Ryozuki> why not
20:07 < Learath2> i'd rather rewrite tw in unreal engine
20:07 < Ryozuki> why dont support opensource and use mozzila
20:07 <@deen> but when we have libchrome we can use html+css+js for maps
20:07 <@deen> better than the current format
20:08 < Ryozuki> also news and that stuff would be cooler
20:08 < Ryozuki> didnt you hate js deen ?
20:08 < Learath2> stop this madness pls
20:08 <@deen> Ryozuki: i'm joking obviously
20:08 < Ryozuki> xD
20:08 < Learath2> \o/
20:08 < Ryozuki> i don't get sarcasm usually
20:08 < Ryozuki> :c
20:09 <@deen> next thing we'll support websockets...
20:09 < Learath2> :)
20:11 < Learath2> teewebs.net no longer works btw :P
20:12 <@deen> not my fault (i believe)
20:14 <@EastByte> deen: yes, I set it up
20:15 < Learath2> eeeee: maybe thy fault?
20:15 <@EastByte> my fault, firewall wasn't adjusted for tw tcp ports, yet
20:16 < Learath2> letsencrypt stuff? don't we already use LE on ddnet.tw?
20:16 <@deen> yeah, but not on hookrace.net
20:16 <@deen> i want to use it there too and don't know how to set it up
20:17 <@EastByte> I do it manually using $ letsencrypt-auto certonly
20:18 < Learath2> i ended up using acme.sh, all the other clients felt bloated
20:18 <@deen> I'm confused, i don't see websockets support in our server binaries
20:19 <@deen> ah no, rus works fine
20:20 <@deen> just ger seems to be the problem
20:21 <@deen> should work now
20:22 <@deen> in chrome it works pretty well, but high cpu usage
20:25 <@deen> chrome pulled the plug on startssl btw, that's why i need to switch
20:28 < Learath2> pulled the plug?
20:28 < Learath2> y?
20:32 <@deen> they did some shenanigans
20:33 <@deen> https://security.googleblog.com/2016/10/distrusting-wosign-and-startcom.html
22:17 < eeeee> sounds like a great idea, if you have an ingame browser you can visit teewebs.net there so that you can teeworlds while you teeworlds
22:54 <@deen> turtles all the way
