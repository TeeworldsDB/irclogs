00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <♪♫> what's the static generator used ?
00:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <♪♫> alright i got  a semi-working copy i'll try
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen worth looking around the osu website, they have one of those
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you should ask the website devs bout it
06:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <♪♫> Is it normal for me and my dummy to get deep freeze when passing the start of a dummy map at similar times ?

06:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Cellegen opensource kek
06:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @fokkonaut nice copy paste from ath
06:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Why people ruining it?
07:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FluffiexD what?
07:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @♪♫ yes
08:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @♪♫ wtf is that beep? xD i never had it
09:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <♪♫> @fokkonaut ddnet outputs the bell character on the console, dunno why some don't get it might be locale related
09:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @♪♫ the freezing happens, I never checked why though. I'm not sure if it's fixable though. It might break old maps
16:38 <+Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580 teeworlds being teeworlds again
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon remember what I said when you asked why we don't upgrade to 0.7?
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oy :feelsamazingman:
19:56 <+Learath2> As always with his disconnect from the community of the game he is developing but aiming for a "perfect" and "pure" teeworlds
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> entities off is not actually stable in 11.5, more often lags with bugs on it
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i know it is a bit exhausting getting the stuff back/implemented that would be nice for the modding scene but it feels like the vanilla devs are hurt by the ddnet mindest and i can understand that
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we just have to be nice to each other
21:33 <+Learath2> how did we hurt them exactly?
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> don't point with fingers and call the others dickheads.
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It is this "we are ddnet we are better" mindest
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "ddnet > teeworlds" some people spread these vibes and they reach out also to the vanilla devs
21:34 <+Learath2> i've never heard that mindset from anyone
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It is a fact that most of the vanilla devs simply hate ddnet and don't care about it and the other way around. And that is not good.
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Learath2 are you sure? I noticed that multiple times. People saying ddnet is bigger than teeworlds with this aggresive undertone agianst vanilla.
21:36 <+Learath2> besides, it's just fact, ddnet has a bigger playerbase now
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Let's just be nice all together and make everybody happy and get something in 0.7 that the most people agree on. Then ddnet and all the other mods can code stuff in 0.7 for the next 5 years
21:37 <+Learath2> how about we all stick to 0.6? 
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes there are more players on ddnet than on vanilla servers. But I have the feeling that some people think that ddnet is something better now. And ddnet would be nothing without the teeworlds base.
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Sticking to 0.6 is like creating a fork
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It splits the communitys that is not good.
21:38 <+Learath2> there isn't a huge community that plays vanilla, nor is there mods that aren't BW or ddnet
21:38 <+Learath2> vanilla and other mod people will stick to 0.6 if we all stick to it
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tezcan> noone plays 0.7 currently, so which community are you talking about @ChillerDragon
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I can't mention it often enough because i love the idea. We can stay in 0.6 as long as we want but it would be nice to have some basic 0.7 servers aswell that share some simple database stuff like times and points aswell.
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Tezcan when 0.7.1 will be actually released with downloads on the official page and steam all the new tees will arrive in 0.6 and if they can't find ddnet there we could loose some newcomers that were advertised by tw
21:40 <+Learath2> we weren't getting new players for a while, nothing will change tbh
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I am tired of having my own opinions alone all the time and speaking against walls ._.
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fuk me i will leave this conversation for today but my hope is not lost yet
21:43 <+Learath2> well you'll have to convince the people that your idea is worth investing their times in if you want everyone behind you
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess i suck at it i am trying to convince people since 4 years or more lul
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> There are newcomers but not much*
22:44 <@heinrich5991> yes, and having no newcomers means that the game will die eventually. I don't like that, I like playing ddrace
23:23 < ***> Buffer Playback...
23:23 <+bridge_> [23:22:10] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a good way to solve newcomer problem for people that want to keep ddrace alive is making it standalone and releasing on steam
23:23 < ***> Playback Complete.
23:24 <+breton> wtf lol, tw is going to die for the last 10 years
23:28 <+breton> there is a huge lag between release and people who start playing it. I will not use 0.7 until it appears in my distro. And it will appear in ubuntu only in 6+ months
23:30 <+breton> and this is the case with a lot of free opensource software. Available releases and forks lag behind a lot, and 1-2 years is not a big term
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> we will improve in the future, only matter of time usually
23:47 <+Learath2> people won't play 0.7 if the mods aren't ported, vanilla simply doesn't have enough traction
