00:12 < bridge> <timakro> i thought maybe to indicate that a player is invincible we could not render the feet and instead render a ufo so that it looks as if the tee is flying in a ufo
00:19 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 can we bump the masterserver payload size? 16k doesn't seem to be enough for 128p
01:00 < bridge> <totar> this won't cause issues for clients?
01:01 < bridge> <learath2> Clients should(tm) not be reading more than their serverinfo max
01:01 < bridge> <learath2> Which is already 128

01:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon, can you send me an example of how you configure the tournament servers?
01:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> aka league servers
01:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> the final file where everything comes together, port, execs etc
11:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi developas
11:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> rewrite ddnet in rust when
12:05 < bridge> <matodor> never, because our developers do not play "developers", they do not chase trendy languages ​​and technologies, their main goal is to support and develop new interesting game mechanics, and not to chase refactoring and performance
12:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, rust in the code base seems to indicate the opposite.
12:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, rust in the codebase seems to indicate the opposite.
12:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> u not a developa and i was joking
12:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> its a meme to say rewrite it in rust
12:27 < bridge> <matodor> guys....... don't you understand irony? :troll:
12:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> iron
12:32 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> i dont think they will:playingtee:
12:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok serious question now for developas, if i submit a new feature that can reduce performance a little bit will i get beaten to death or not?
12:36 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> both
12:40 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> <a:vibing:1189292583671840878>
13:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rewrite ddnet physics in rust
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then your dreams come
13:17 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> real
13:18 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> would be cool if moderators will have the banhammer ingame to strike ppl:trollking:
13:19 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> <a:ragouis:772535680785317908>
13:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> great idea
13:21 < bridge> <timakro> any idea who could make a flying saucer sprite for the game?
13:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> me turning it on and chasing people on linear 💥
13:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's funny
13:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> visually punish people
13:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> reminds me of the (fictional) middle ages
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> I used to play an ancient game where a game mode like that was a common event on private servers. In GunZ private servers, 2 admins would take 30 people into the lobby and shoot at them with rocket launchers that kicked the person they hit. The last person remaining would get a reward
13:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1290637563832565853/image0.gif?ex=66fd2f66&is=66fbdde6&hm=79309395539ec98ca9fb11fab007f1ba2b7fcae5134789f17e521c3b11e0bdc7&
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> Not exactly the "banhammer" but "kickrocket" is close enough 😄
13:34 < bridge> <maybetheguywasrights> lol
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> But we have no cosmetics to give away
13:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> basically zCatch with extra steps
13:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._.
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> You can't kill the people hunting you though. You just have to run away
13:35 < bridge> <oxyzo.> the reward: "congrats"
13:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> ok
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> It was usually a colored name or one of the two weapon skins that were reserved as event rewards
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> reward is permanent ban?
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> would be even funnier event
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a madman im migrating my domain mail to mailcow
14:21 < bridge> <timakro> where have you been before?
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> fastmail
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> not self hosted
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> im self hosting again
14:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> again
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> if china cant receive my emails is not my problem
14:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think i don't know how to log stuff

14:45 < bridge> <timakro> @ryozuki i'm also self hosting https://tschumacher.net/self-host-email/
14:46 < bridge> <timakro> basically just postfix + dovecot + rspamd on a debian vm
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye i got a cheap vps
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> and mailcow is all that autoconfigured with docker
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> its dope
14:47 < bridge> <timakro> i'm not having any deliverabilty issues
14:47 < bridge> <timakro> it might be a gamble with the ip you get idk
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> it tells u if ur ip is clean
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> it told me it is
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho i sent a cleartext mail to gmail and i appeared in spam xd
14:49 < bridge> <timakro> that's nice
14:49 < bridge> <timakro> it checks if your ip is on any blacklists i suppose
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
14:49 < bridge> <timakro> you can check in gmail if you find the right button why it was put in spam
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.mailcow.email/
14:50 < bridge> <timakro> and you can see if dmarc/dkim/spf worked
14:50 < bridge> <timakro> https://www.mail-tester.com/ is also great for testing - although i suppose mailcow would do everything correct there by default
14:50 < bridge> <learath2> Deliverability is a huge issue from Hetzner, so I can never self host my mail, atleast not the outbound smtp
14:51 < bridge> <timakro> hmm i am on hetzner since two years self hosting
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> I might set it up again one day using aws as my outbound
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> Though it has been almost a decade since I tried, maybe with all the new dmarc spf dkim stuff it's now easier to be trusted enough not to directly land in spam
14:53 < bridge> <timakro> i've just checked my ip on https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx (the first google result) and it says i'm not blacklisted
14:53 < bridge> <timakro> fwiw
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> I'm on one blacklist and I've owned this ip for a decade now. There is no way I sent the spam, so it's just a subnet thing :/
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess u got unlucky
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> I also tested it a decade ago when most of these security things didn't exist yet
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> on the second email it got delivered to main box
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its cuz i removed it from spam
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to use it for my services
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> mailcow has dkim and all
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and arc

15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> indeed it does everything perfekt
15:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wow, you can send!
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

17:27 < bridge> <kdaniel> If I want to build the execution file locally with custom Dockerfile then it works but with github workflows it always fails at the checksum this has never happened to me until I downloaded the latest version.

17:27 < bridge> <kdaniel> 
17:27 < bridge> <kdaniel> this is cutout of the Dockerfile (some double like install rustc and the rustup but this shoudl be not the problem)

20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> email security features are quite involved and easy to get wrong
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It was so annoying to setup email, that I decided to use gmail for acc testing xd
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I really hate these 500 step guides
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> anyone pro in tree-sitter?
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I was trying to make highlighting for `this` keyword so it should be of type `@variable` if it's used in a function or `@keyword` if it's inside a method. I tried using `has-ancestor?` predicate and.. it did nothing, here's the whole thing:
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ((this) @variable
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     (#has-ancestor? @keyword method_declaration))
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
20:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/tree-sitter-meraki/compare/master...feat/this-highlighting
20:51 < bridge> <teero777> i bet you could paste it exactly as it is into an llm. gtg i cant help
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use mailcow
20:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just did and it wrote nothing useful
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i canceled my fastmail 5€ subscription which only lets you have 1 real domain as sender to a hetzner vps at 5€ with unlimited mails
20:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant host it on my main server because MX records and smtp itself leaks ips, its not covered by cloudflare
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://migadu.com/pricing/ is a small email hoster btw
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 20$/y
21:02 < bridge> <avolicious> 20 out/day, is this for emails?
21:03 < bridge> <avolicious> This sounds pretty much useless if you can only send 20 mails out a day
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is for a single person's mailbox
21:03 < bridge> <avolicious> oh 😄
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 20 emails per day sounds fine for that, and it's not a hard limit
21:03 < bridge> <avolicious> I thought for the account thing
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that would be way too little
21:03 < bridge> <avolicious> We are sending roughly 200 to 400 mails out a day
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gmail allows 2000 xd
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in the final impl, we'll probably want to not depend on google
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It doesn't depend on anything. U can configure it
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just hope whatever mail we'll choice is not landing in spam
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> In my humble opinion, we should probably send accounts emails through aws or maybe cloudflare has something. We will be sending a lot of mail, if we set up something wrong we'll end up in a google blacklist where we can't easily get out and support won't tell us what's wrong
21:23 < bridge> <totar> Cloudflare has emails?
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I think we should send them from our own domain, even if we use a third-party service
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, from our domain but maybe through someone elses outbound smtp
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. AWS
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the cool thing is, u can even use steam for acc login, but then switch to a non-steam client
21:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds fine unless someone wants to do the email server setup and maintenance dance
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hope steam is simply the most used xd
21:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess it'll be
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we can outsource it to @ryozuki 😄
21:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I already have nightmares about account recovery requests
21:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we should probably think about a strategy beforehand
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i could but i would be target of ddos
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> mail is rly hard to protect from ddos iirc
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, why would it be a problem? Lost access to email?
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for email or generally?
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise i wouldnt mind
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or steam account
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think that happens often enough
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> But yeah, doesn't hurt to have a strategy prepared
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @avolicious do you have info on the above? how often do players lose access to their email accounts and have a problem with the kog account due to this?
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe we could try to detect temporary email addresses and warn players prominently that this is their only chance of account recovery
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and that they should consider using a non-temporary email provider
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> well u detect that with a email confirmation
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe a one time static recovery token? If that's also lost shit out of luck
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> They can get the confirmation mail even if temporary
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean its their fault
21:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. that doesn't mean they won't cause support requests
21:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if that'd improve the situation for the people who'd lose access to their email accounts tbh
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i have no opinion on this, if u want a mail sysadmin i can offer myself to help
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least we'll never here that they lost their password :lol:
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but that mail server would be a cheap vps hosted by ddnet
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least to the acc
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> not mine cuz i dont wanna get ddosed
21:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds fine
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if it's worth paying for a vps for outbound smtp when we can just pay for AWS SES
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> we also maybe should have a china dedicated vps mail server maybe
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> AWS also probably penetrates the great chinese firewall easier than us
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i assume we need a chinese acc server anyway xd
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the benefit would be handling the data in a non-US country I guess
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> although I guess we already route all our website traffic through cloudflare 🤷‍♀️
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> 100% btw is your implementation of the account server easy to multi-home?
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it does that out of the box yeah, but tbf i haven't extensively tested it
21:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unencrypted, even
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> Many of these big hosters offer gdpr compliant services too. We can probably opt into that
21:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there cannot be a US company handling data in GDPR-compliant manner
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> They can and probably do have an eu subsidiary that owns those servers
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't help
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the US has access to all data, even by subsidiaries of companies inside the US
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the US has access to all data, even by subsidiaries outside the US of companies inside the US
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by the cloud act, I think
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act
21:38 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, what if it's all encrypted until the final destination?
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> our emails can't be encrypted to the provider
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unless you want to make it unusable for the common person by using PGP ^^
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU–US_Data_Privacy_Framework there's a "framework" for US GDPR compliance every couple of years until it gets invalidated by the european court of justice
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I wonder how this is handled by big companies. What if an eu company sends a mail to my gmail? Google is a US company
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because of the obvious illegality wrt. the cloud act
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like the above. the EU commision pretends there's a way, then it gets invalidated a couple of years later
21:40 < bridge> <exen9_11> This channel has probably got every single person on the planet muted and online, i cant get my msgs cleared :feelsbadman:
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds great
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ❓
21:41 < bridge> <exen9_11> You know where i got all my msgs checked? Impossible :cammostripes:
21:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's obvious problem is also why there's a small push towards creating european alternatives that would be able to comply with the GDPR
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym?
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there a strong filter here or smth? xD
21:43 < bridge> <learath2> So I guess we can also just ignore gdpr I guess 😄
21:43 < bridge> <learath2> Atleast for this unsolveable case
21:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as long as we route our web server stuff through cloudflare, I agree
21:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cloudflare is the worse problem wrt. data privacy
23:06 < bridge> <learath2> Isn't this fixable? Shouldn't we issue a origin certificate and start encrypting all the way?
23:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cloudflare always MITMs all traffic
23:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's their modus operandi
23:15 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, I guess they kinda have to for cleaning traffic purposes
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> would it be possible to add tclient to DDNet's steam listing as a beta 🤔
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> or would it need its own store page
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it is a different client but it would be very convenient
23:39 < bridge> <learath2> I would not feel comfortable shipping anyone elses code in our steam page
23:40 < bridge> <louis> why not add the good features to ddnet main
23:40 < bridge> <Ewan> because they don't want them
23:40 < bridge> <louis> people can replace the .exe in steam if they want tclient
23:40 < bridge> <Ewan> of course they can
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> but that is not what im asking at all
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> they would want to replace the DLLs too
23:41 < bridge> <learath2> Again, at least I personally wouldn't be comfortable with it
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> but sooner than any of that, add a non steam game
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> makes sense
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't like that there is a rift like this
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> tclient is a complete game changer for gores
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs of fast input?
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it's somewhat volatile too
23:43 < bridge> <Ewan> but when it works it's great
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i know
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's sadly also refresh rate dependent
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> monitor hz too
23:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wonder if we could simply publish other clients as mods on steam 🤔
23:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mods exist on steam, and aren't really related to the main game
23:46 < bridge> <learath2> This I would be fine with. Idk how mods work and if they are allowed to straight up replace an executable or ship an executable at all though
23:47 < bridge> <learath2> This I would be fine with. Idk how mods work and if they are allowed to straight up replace an executable and/or ship an executable at all though
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we are getting competition from vanilla :lol:

23:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: i'll get timed out hard, but what do you think about that he used main branch
23:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems either private or deleted, I'm getting 404
23:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah probs he didn't know the GH bot posts his commits xD
23:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, it does seem like a bug that is posts commits to a private repo
23:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> private
