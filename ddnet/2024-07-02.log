00:04 <+bridge> <learath2> I could perhaps be convinced to drop ogl1 if we keep server support for the last version that supports ogl1 indefinitely
00:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think Jupstar isn't against properly engineered backcompat
00:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but what we have isn't properly organized
00:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's all over the codebase
00:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> instead of inside a backcompat module
00:18 <+bridge> <jxsl13> @gerdoe
00:19 <+bridge> <jxsl13> oops, unintended ping
00:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's on my to do list, but not very high. quic/accounts are definitely higher
00:23 <+bridge> <totar> How would a backcompat module work if the code is scattered everywhere as it is.
00:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it would take the network traffic and translate it to old network traffic
00:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I built a 0.6-0.5 using that pattern
00:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the code almost entirely resided in one module
00:29 <+bridge> <totar> 0.5 😯
00:29 <+bridge> <totar> Anyone uses that?
00:29 <+bridge> <jxsl13> past tense
00:30 <+bridge> <totar> ?
00:30 <+bridge> <jxsl13> he did that most likely 10+ years ago, I'd guess
00:30 <+bridge> <totar> ah I guess maybe
00:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/blob/eedc8065b0340ad5659fab2b91b09b8f94354336/src/proxy/proxy/0.5-0.6/proxy_cl05_srv06.cpp
00:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 10 years ago seems correct
00:32 <+bridge> <jxsl13> I should gamble
00:32 <+bridge> <totar> The massive debt of backcompatability already in the codebase makes me uncomfortable often but it's not my issue I guess.
00:33 <+bridge> <totar> Massive is a little overstatement
00:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think it's a debt of backcompat, I think it's a debt of spaghetti code ^^
00:34 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Anyone want to submit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8538 ? It currently breaks nightly build
00:35 <+bridge> <totar> Well I don't think this is in small part due to back compatability requirements. Huge refactorings need to preserve old functionality
00:36 <+bridge> <totar> Also the nature of open source dev where most people don't want to take long term responsibility for large sections of the code
00:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> done
00:44 <+bridge> <totar> I actually don't know of any other multiplayer games that keep compatability for mismatched server/client versions. Does anyone know of any? 
00:44 <+bridge> <totar> 
00:44 <+bridge> <totar> I guess it is very nice that you can have a 4 year old client and be confident you can play on any server in the list.
01:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki I just stumbled upon this very old commit of mine: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/commit/76355d4a34870b336d3adb48cf61689a5281d504
01:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `IpAddr` would only become stable in rust 1.7.0 😄
01:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol
03:36 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> The minecraft community is big on version translation. But I guess that is because the actual official game it self just breaks versions all the time xd
03:37 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @totar: it’s just sad that latest ddnet does not even have the full list :P
03:39 <+bridge> <totar> Minecraft is quite interesting but that's a unique situation where only the server is controller by the developers so they can't control the client at all.
03:40 <+bridge> <totar> In a way ddnet is the same but we still add plenty of client features that depend on server functionality so it's not really the same
03:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Was that proxy ever in use? How does it work? Does every user need one to connect to a server? Or can a server Hoster slap it in front of a server? If every user needs it it’s a bit annoying. And I guess servers have no full proxy support so they would think all players joined through the proxy are coming from one ip address.
03:53 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What was the accident xd
04:02 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> Amazing thanks
04:08 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> We test the cuirect and stuff like that logic already in unit tests right? So what’s missing is probably generating a screenshot and doing a image diff.
04:11 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> What why? ssh is great? I don’t get it

04:17 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> Oh that’s good to know! Thanks for sharing. I never had the problem that the WiFi website does not pop up but it might happen some day. Makes a lot of sense never thought about it.

09:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> im not sure it's an issue w my flake necessarily
09:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> <https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-flakes-nix-store-source-no-such-file-or-directory/17836/16>
09:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> ppl seem to have a similar issue with obrcene fixes
09:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> ppl seem to have a similar issue with like 3 different proposed obscene fixes
09:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> i tried any that were applicable and had no luck
09:42 <+bridge> <meloƞ> So ist seems to be an issue with git beeing annoying lmao - maybe mv out the .git folder to be sure its not that, i dont remember running into that issue tho.
09:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> nop
09:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> need git metadata for the flake anyway
09:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: both worked. no, the proxy was compiled into the server, but it roughly only had one intersection point

10:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: ssh had a "anyone can log in as root" vulnerability yesterday. patch your server!
10:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> wb heinrich
10:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks
10:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> holy moly. does debian even have patches for that?
10:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I already applied them yesterday
10:37 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> `OpenSSH_9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u3, OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024`
10:37 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> LGTM
10:37 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> is `systemctl restart sshd` enough?
10:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ssh -v localhost
10:38 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> smart
10:39 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ye lgtm
10:39 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> the 3 in the end is the fix i assume
10:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
10:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it sounds like they just disabled some code xd
10:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably better to update as soon as they apply the real patch
10:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> sounds good to me
10:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257617137892069446/image.png?ex=66850ebb&is=6683bd3b&hm=cedb9d0759defd09869c87b56496602266dbc5f91efaea287e99faf612274815&
10:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> my laptop is vulnerable
10:56 <+bridge> <learath2> My servers ssh version is before the regresshion, so it's safe without upgrading 😄
10:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> "safe"
10:58 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> xxxxxxxxD
11:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> oh boi 4k players online right now
11:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> i basically didnt open my client this year didnt know the game is still very much alive
11:14 <+bridge> <learath2> safe from this one specific critical bug, to be more exact 😄
11:14 <+bridge> <wurpi> i just realize
11:15 <+bridge> <wurpi> our company really like pushing releases when i'm not at work
11:15 <+bridge> <wurpi> maybe whenever I'm at work thing are always not ready
11:15 <+bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 when you get around to looking at atleast the teehistorian files local to that server, I can finally consider upgrading and rebooting that server
11:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> local to what server? learath2.info?
11:16 <+bridge> <learath2> yes
11:16 <+bridge> <learath2> it has full disk encryption with a handrolled initramfs script, there is a chance that if I upgrade it and something goes wrong I might lose all the data on it 😄
11:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the script I sent you was buggy, right?
11:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> u didn't quit yet?
11:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I updated my server, but sshd doesn't restart anymore. I started sshd manually again. but I'm also scared of rebooting ^^ @learath2
11:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes, I think I gave you a full log. It crashes for some reason and dumps just a list of all the files
11:48 <+bridge> <learath2> It works just fine in a smaller folder though
11:51 <+bridge> <learath2> ah thanks

12:59 <+bridge> <zhn> wanna listen one
12:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> How long is it
12:59 <+bridge> <zhn> quite a short
12:59 <+bridge> <zhn> half an hour

14:07 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ok, voting can happen yea
14:07 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I think masterserver needs to allow larger json @heinrich5991 ? `2024-07-02 14:00:02 E register/6/ipv4: error response from master: 400: Request body deserialize error: EOF while parsing a value at line 1 column 16383`
14:07 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Happened with ~110 players online
14:07 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 110 again right now
14:08 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and it works nice
14:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> server disappeared
14:09 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Found it, fixed in the PR
14:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> from list only
14:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh, cool
14:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ty!
14:10 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Please fix the voting crash though, it seems to happen with a 0.7 player because of the playermapping
14:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yes, on it
14:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8542/commits/db16907d8cff79958f42e1c0dedfc7361b5e7b0c
14:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen If u want u can set the mapupdaterate to 5, will be quicker to update the map
14:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but i think for performance it can stay at 15
14:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dunno
14:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> or 10, whatv
14:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why does it even have a update rate?
14:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz why would you run it every tick
14:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> useless
14:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why doesnt it update based on e.g. player movement
14:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> why dont u make ur own xd
14:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have my own
14:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> is it based on e.g. player movement
14:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's see, havent read that code in \~6 years
14:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
14:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> then probably not
14:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: to find out which license to use, where did you copy the code from? probably teeworlds 0.7?
14:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems it simply checked the player distance on the fly
14:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was enough for 256 players on a cheap vps
14:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> so u have ddnet code
14:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
14:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was for fng vanilla based
14:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/af04025138549ef64d70a9b0b748b18654571fec/game/shared-game/src/entities/character/pos.rs
14:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this would be even better
14:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> could directly also be used to solve the O(n²) problem
14:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without breaking physics
14:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> rust is so ugly
14:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
14:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> c++ ftw
14:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess porting 165 lines of rust code to cpp isnt the world
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `Pool`
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not trivial though, I'd say
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure, pool is just to save heap allocs, would also work fine with heap allocs or stack allocations (esp. if max. number of clients are known at compile time)
14:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> linkedhashmap, i dunno why i used that xd
14:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe at some points i was iterating over the entries
14:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt look like i still do that
14:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and for ddnet physics it would make sense to use a btreeset instead of hashset to keep the ID order correct
14:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (which is only interesting when to emulate the for i \< MAX\_CLIENTS loops in the gamecore)
15:02 <+bridge> <learath2> How does a hashset solve the O(n^2) issue? Do you use a position hash that hashes nearby people in the same bucket?
15:03 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> yea 0.7 I think and a bit of huffman-py and TeeAI xd
15:03 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> And then what? I just copy the license?
15:04 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> Huffman-py is also bsd and TeeAi is  gpl
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically:
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i calculate the tile of the tee (a tee is *almost* 1 tile, so that fits quite nice) and add its id to a hashset
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> later in character core:
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i get all ids in a certain radius (so basically all tiles in that radius)
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the "real" radius calculation is still done
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just for fewer entries
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since the tile based radius check ofc isnt perfect
15:06 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 I also took the packer code 1:1
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> whats the problem here?
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im ootl
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> when quadtrees?
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think that approach is better
15:06 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> And swarfy also looked at the TeeAI code for his type script Huffman
15:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah the grid approach, where does a hashmap come in?
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs updating the quadtree isnt really cheap
15:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> simply the tile index
15:07 <+bridge> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 you just wanna merge licenses together or what? At which point is a rewrite enough to decouple the license? What license is teeworlds even? Isn’t that bsd like too? How would I give proper credit?
15:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah to get what character is on the tile
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in "normal" case this is very fast, since tees usually dont stack
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in worst case it's as bad as the current O(n²) plus the overhead of this idea
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so in practice even a bit worse
15:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: teeworlds has zlib license. I just used that instead of your bsd license, because you wanted a simple solution. you're allowed to look at other code, preferably only to figure out how it works. copying the code requires you to stay with the original license (or a compatible one) though. you could e.g. create a new implementation by just looking at docs, e.g. libtw2 docs (this is one reason I created them)
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is TeeAi mine?
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gpl pog
15:11 <+bridge> <learath2> (btw you are right, a grid works much better than a quadtree with the amount of moving things we have)
15:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes you said assume it’s gpl
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true
15:11 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It has no license file
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ill add the license
15:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> done
15:12 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess I need this license in a bunch repos too now
15:12 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Took me two days to rewrite Huffman-py to get rid of gpl in twnet\_parser
15:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:13 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> And now heino says I’m violating licenses again -.-
15:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is twnet_parser closed source
15:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no
15:13 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No but I want it to be bsd
15:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design
15:13 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s on Gitlab
15:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> woops, wrong link, but also good
15:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/
15:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why not use gpl
15:14 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I want freedom for my users
15:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> GPL is good for users, bad for devs
15:14 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Freedom includes closed source and mixing with other licensed code
15:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats what gpl does best for users
15:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> closed source removes freedom for users tho
15:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > MIT/X license, BSD licenses (in the three-clause and two-clause forms, though not the original four-clause form), MPL 2.0, and LGPL, are GPL-compatible.
15:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0BSD, best for devs, good for users, but can be bad if used in closed source
15:16 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> The users of a network protocol library might want to build a closed source project. If they can not do it because it’s gpl they are less free.
15:16 <+bridge> <learath2> He wants freedom for HIS users, not his users users 😄
15:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> only best for devs wanting to create closed-source projects
15:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> for devs wanting to create open-source software, gpl can be better
15:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they have to know about limitations of GPL
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but if you want to support devs wanting to create closed-source projects, then gpl is indeed incompatible with it
15:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that alone makes it worse
15:17 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I like code with no strings attached. Free to copy paste, edit. No obligations what do ever.
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then why do you use the bsd license?
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess we value different things
15:17 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I like code with no strings attached. Free to copy paste, edit. No obligations what so ever.
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that requires some things
15:17 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought that’s the one xd
15:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller use 0BSD
15:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Finally something I kinda agree with chillerdragon on
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use C0
15:18 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Lmao
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
15:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CC0 sucks bcs europe rights xd
15:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0BSD is my new love
15:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> agpl is my love
15:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://opensource.org/license/0bsd
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also coolest logo
15:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also an accepted open source license
15:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> reference? I don't think so
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257686941105651763/AGPL-1.png?ex=66854fbd&is=6683fe3d&hm=b85ab9619f6d953afd90fefd52b5f34b8f620372a326b65da0861b04294e244f&
15:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> CC0 is compatible with europe's right. are you referring to "public domain" maybe?
15:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uhrheberrecht
15:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you cannot really do public domain
15:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> urheberrecht
15:19 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 0BSD lgtm might use it in the future
15:19 <+bridge> <learath2> bsd 3 clause is do whatever you want but keep this notice, and don't use my name as marketing ALSO YOU CANT SUE ME IF THIS DESTROYS THE WORLD
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> CC0 is not public domain fully but its like public domain
15:19 <+bridge> <zhn> use llvm license
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ew
15:19 <+bridge> <zhn> the llvm dev live reaction:
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the only thing i hate about llvm is the license and that they provide a C api on usage effort only
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it must also go into the binary and you cannot remove attribution
15:20 <+bridge> <zhn> llvm's license actually the only thing why it got so popular
15:20 <+bridge> <learath2> "keep this notice"
15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> already way worse than teeworlds' zlib license
15:20 <+bridge> <zhn> we could have many gcc based compilers if not gpl
15:20 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 0BSD or Apache license for me
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well it got popular because apple uses it
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its funded by apple too
15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and because gpl was anti-extensions
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also because the code is more readable
15:20 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> No way you tought of licenses while creating docs xd
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and modular
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> than gcc
15:20 <+bridge> <zhn> i mean its more popular than you think
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gcc u mean
15:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, gcc
15:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I did. I wanted libtw2 to be a clean-room implementation
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm is rly popular yes
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a good piece of software
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> compiler wise its the epitome of research imho
15:21 <+bridge> <zhn> like you can't make proprietary software if u set gpl as license
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> specially MLIR
15:21 <+bridge> <zhn> llvm would die at its start
15:21 <+bridge> <zhn> or someone would remake it
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think its true
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gcc is gpl and its widely used
15:22 <+bridge> <learath2> "way worse" is very subjective, the zlib license only allows binary distributions to not include the notice, that's all that's extra
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gcc is gpl but u can compile propietary software btw
15:22 <+bridge> <zhn> i don't really see many gcc extensions made by companies
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the compiled stuff has nothing to do with gcc
15:22 <+bridge> <zhn> im talking about tooling, not about compiling foreign programs
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nvcc uses gcc
15:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nothing subjective here. chillerdragon said he wanted the least restrictions for users. I'm not sure what you're talking about
15:22 <+bridge> <zhn> intel's compiler is moving to llvm
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz intel suxs
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ofc companies will prefer llvm now
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but u can get success with gpl
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> blender is GPL
15:23 <+bridge> <zhn> blender is not llvm xd
15:23 <+bridge> <learath2> The "way" is what makes it subjective. It is worse, exactly 1 clause worse
15:23 <+bridge> <zhn> im talking about llvm and only llvm compilant tools
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that wasnt the point
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then let's say "it's obviously worse"
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fair. then let's say "it's obviously worse"
15:24 <+bridge> <zhn> did i say gpl kills every software it sticks to
15:24 <+bridge> <zhn> i said llvm would die if used gpl
15:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm license allowed stuff like nvvm to be born
15:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nvvm is propietary blegh
15:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/
15:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like amd tends to be more open
15:25 <+bridge> <learath2> I kinda doubt this. Have you ever touched the gcc codebase?
15:25 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine there was some bullshiting going on about antibot being closed source because teeworlds was super infectious lgpl++ which if linked against a struct of same shape statically or dynamically or even just through a reverse proxy forces you to publish source code as rom disk on request within 24 working days
15:26 <+bridge> <zhn> ye and it stinks i know
15:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm is easier to contribute and use thats the simple reason
15:26 <+bridge> <learath2> I think only 10 people on earth would be able to do anything with that codebase, in comparison llvm is very pretty 😄
15:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and its made to be used for other stuff than C based langs
15:26 <+bridge> <zhn> could be prettier though
15:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think the effort can be commended
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do u know how big llvm code is
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its insane
15:27 <+bridge> <zhn> ye i know
15:27 <+bridge> <zhn> thats why im saying that xd
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and they do various techniques so the code isnt that big
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like having special file formats to describe CPUs
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and tablegen
15:28 <+bridge> <zhn> i think somebody currently makes llvm like clearer source behind the curtains
15:28 <+bridge> <learath2> 0bsd is the no clout version of bsd licenses. I don't think there is any point allowing people to use my code without so much as a credit, but that's just me
15:28 <+bridge> <zhn> that uses llvm ir
15:29 <+bridge> <learath2> Someone should make a hosting aware version of bsd like agpl is to gpl
15:30 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I appreciate credit. But if it’s legally forced it’s cringe. I prefer credit on a nice to have basis. Crediting is imo worth more and more fun to receive and give if it’s not something you MUST do.
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok chiller
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> all software you made
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is made by me
15:32 <+bridge> <learath2> then 0bsd/cc0 are what you want
15:32 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> So it’s gpl?
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ?
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xD
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u require no attribution
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so all you made
15:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is made by me
15:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> All software you make is gpl
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and ill make a web
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> saying its made by me
15:33 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If you claim mine is yours will it become gpl?
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not technically true
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can u imagine it?
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can appropiate ur software
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> claim its mine
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and make it gpl
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if u want to give all rights then u should give me the right to relicense
15:34 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Im scared of being unable to access my own because I went to permissive xd
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i take ur all rights given software and make it my own, any changes and make it agpl
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why u scared, u wanted all freedom
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u dont want to take away my freedom right? xd
15:35 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I would also like to have the freedom to use my own code however I want and claim it’s mine xd
15:35 <+bridge> <learath2> I actually don't know what happens if you take 0bsd/cc0/mit0 licensed code and release it under a more restrictive license
15:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can always take any piece of open-source software (minimal restrictions apply) and turn it agpl for modifications
15:35 <+bridge> <learath2> you are certainly allowed to do so, but idk what happens then 😄
15:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance
15:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then it's just released under both licenses
15:35 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Well that’s why I just try not to think to hard about it. Xd
15:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my freedom is to make stuff agpl :TrollDespair:
15:36 <+bridge> <learath2> How do I prove that my 0bsd copy of it is actually released before the agpl version and that I didn't steal the agpl version?
15:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also i would always use a license that protects from patent trolls
15:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> aplg and apache do it iirc
15:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the same way you prove that something is your work and not someone elses
15:37 <+bridge> <learath2> I see
15:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and who defines where tolerance starts and ends?
15:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Deciding whether to tolerate an item involves a balancing of reasons, for example when we weigh the reasons for rejecting an idea we find problematic against the benefit of accepting it in the name of social harmony, and it is in this balancing of reasons that the paradox of tolerance arises.[9] Most formulations of tolerance assert that tolerance is a reciprocal act, and the intolerant need not be tolerated. This necessitates drawing a limit bet
15:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats the paradox jupstar
15:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure, but i bet you and me are also intollerant.
15:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Most ppl seem to be ok with closed source software, we defs arent
15:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so should we be excluded? xd
15:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ill go live in a cave

16:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I use a different pw for my account
16:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> vulkanGaming69 is guest password
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was hot, spc
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was hot, spicy and porn
16:04 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> when add forgot password button
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that was the most secure pw ever
16:04 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Uff
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when add ssh login support
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> key auth
16:05 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> when add voice channels
16:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Eeeee
16:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am interested in 120fps livestreaming

16:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 🤩
16:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @patiga good job on the map lib looks crisp
16:34 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> i see you are doing 128 player server
16:34 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> what makes it difficult to raise size from 64?
16:35 <+bridge> <patiga> thx! :)
16:35 <+bridge> <patiga> Python or Rust?
16:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Lots of statically sized stuff and the fact that the client only supports 64 tees
16:36 <+bridge> <learath2> So lots of code needs to be modified to change mask sizes and array sizes + there is a complex layer that is needed to decide which 64 tees will get sent to each player
16:36 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> wow thx
17:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i am once again compiling llvm
17:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257716236930912379/image.png?ex=66856b06&is=66841986&hm=465b9f558c1390269202728915249a068748fc7782f13a9a368f4fe33e77ec99&
17:33 <+bridge> <timakro> how about arbitrary player count support?
17:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Would be even better, but harder to support properly, especially if you want to keep stuff close by in the stack
17:37 <+bridge> <timakro> Maybe compile time configurable
17:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> is this a way for you to stress-test your pc every month? :kek:
17:41 <+bridge> <learath2> A little less hard to support properly. Ideally it would only be changing `MAX_CLIENTS`. I think eeeee implemented this once upon a time for ddwar but it's been so long I'm pretty sure the implementation is lost to time
17:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
17:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> clientside ddwar ?
17:46 <+bridge> <learath2> No, the clientside is the code that ddrace inherited later, ddrace64. Iirc ddraceN mapped down to 64
17:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
17:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well, the serverside implementation of mine works for n tees
17:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> supporting more than 64 players is not a problem on the server side.
17:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Just the player mapping is required. Client needs more work, of course.
17:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But I am also hoping that there are no fixed 64 arrays in the server
17:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> in F-DDrace all of them have been set to hold MAX_CLIENTS
17:54 <+bridge> <learath2> I seem to have lost some irclogs somewhere 😦
18:01 <+bridge> <learath2> Ok I was curious but it seems the ddwar source is indeed lost to time, unless @heinrich5991 managed to snag a copy for his archive. Sadge
18:01 <+bridge> <learath2> I wanted to check how the client mapping was done, I remember it being pretty simple and pretty decent
18:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Ok, I found it again, it wasn't as I remembered. We did have client support and we just crashed clients that couldn't handle more than 16 tees. @jupeyy_keks would be proud
18:20 <+bridge> <zhn> on purpose? like `CrashThisClient(...)`? xd
18:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @jupeyy_keks: is proud
18:23 <+bridge> <learath2> No. We'd just send a snap with more than 16 clients and it'd just die
18:24 <+bridge> <learath2> I think then we added an rcon command specifically stating >16 support `crashmeplx`
18:24 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't remember what we did to clients that didn't send it though
18:25 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm using "we" rather loosely there btw. fstd and eeeee were doing the work and they graciously let me watch and pretend I'm being useful
18:25 <+bridge> <zhn> you was just collecting mana
18:26 <+bridge> <learath2> I was absorbing C/C++
18:26 <+bridge> <zhn> don't be so critical about yourself xd
18:26 <+bridge> <zhn> you were just collecting mana
18:29 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm talking about like 13 years ago. I was truly a burden to everyone around. So glad they still let me do stuff even if it meant they had to fix it up afterwards 😄

19:45 <+bridge> <egyt> ^
19:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> IMO it's only bad for devs who want to produce closed-source software
19:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> or those that want to support devs who want to produce closed-source software
19:49 <+bridge> <zhn> its bad when you want to monetize your project
19:49 <+bridge> <dekael> Pol servers are gone cause nobody paid for em?
19:49 <+bridge> <dekael> if yes then i can pay but idk how much for 1 year
19:50 <+bridge> <dekael> who i can contact in this case
19:50 <+bridge> <dekael> @robyt3
19:50 <+bridge> <egyt> MIT-0 FTW
19:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> only if you don't want to share the source ^^
19:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mostly yes, but it's also about younger devs that aren't aware so much about licenses
19:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additionally in theory you could not even test some stuff with friends without always providing source
19:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you only have to provide the source if someone is asking
19:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if your friends aren't asking, you don't have to provide the source
19:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also you cannot use GPL in permissive licenses
19:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you have to be careful there too
19:53 <+bridge> <learath2> I love how some companies will send it to you on floppies in mail just to be vein
19:53 <+bridge> <egyt> No, "YOU CANT SUE ME IF THIS DESTROYS THE WORLD" is part of BSD 3-Clause No Nuclear Warranty
19:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what this means. you can license your own code however you like. you might need to *also* allow people to use your code under the GPL
19:54 <+bridge> <learath2> GPLs biggest issue is it's poisonous incompatible nature. It basically forces all derivatives to be gpl too
19:54 <+bridge> <learath2> So any gpl code is instantly a no-go for someone wanting to release under something less restrictive
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes if i depend on GPL libraries my code will need to use GPL too
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can still *also* release your code under less restrictive licenses
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you quote that in the GPL license?
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code **or can get it if you want it**, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
19:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (from the preamble)
19:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if i create a closed source program using GPL code and die, what then?
19:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then you can't provide the source code anymore?
19:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so if you promise something and die, what then?
19:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't happen anymore
19:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am not sure about that anyway
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this hinges on the fact that there's something wrong with the GPL. if you agree with all of GPL's restrictions, there's no problem that it "forces itself" onto all derivatives. note that even BSD licenses "forces" attribution on all derivatives
19:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the FAQ for AGPL for example says:
19:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "A company is running a modified version of a program licensed under the GNU Affero GPL (AGPL) on a web site. Does the AGPL say they must release their modified sources? (\#UnreleasedModsAGPL)
19:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The GNU Affero GPL requires that modified versions of the software offer all users interacting with it over a computer network an opportunity to receive the source."
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > an opportunity to receive the source.
19:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this says the same. you have to provide it if someone asks
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well you "asking" sounds like i open a chat and ask him
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt that is meant by that
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm pretty sure that's okay
20:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> otherwise there would be more concrete provisions
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i provide you this... just give me 100 years
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm sure the judge will grant you a reasonable time frame for this, which 100 years is not
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and now you understand why it's not dev friendly
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no?
20:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> suddenly a dev needs to know about what judges think
20:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no?
20:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> just apply common sense
20:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> "ability to receive the program"
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> k
20:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if someone asks, give it to them
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> GPL is really cool and it's super easy to understand, every dev understands what it stands for. really great
20:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably not how I'd word it
20:06 <+bridge> <egyt> I am probably too late, but Ryozuki is just trying to scare you. AFAIK claiming other's work as your own is illegal even if the work is in public domain. I am not a lawyer, of course.
20:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmmmmmm. got any source for that?
20:07 <+bridge> <egyt> Unless it is incompatible with AGPL :P
20:08 <+bridge> <egyt> Ukrainian law, but I am almost sure that it is quite the same in other European countries (iirc chillerdragon is in Germany, right?)
20:10 <+bridge> <egyt> At least I know that by European law you MUST give attribution, as it is a moral right which doesn't expire
20:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd like to see a citation on that
20:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if that is/were the case, then CC0 would not work in europe
20:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Zero,_public_domain
20:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the wikipedia article doesn't mention conflicts with european law, at least
20:12 <+bridge> <zhn> ye imagine if you ended up making specific compiler optimizations for your compiler that makes code running faster ~5% on your hardware for each but it can be used on another hw and give ~2% improvements
20:13 <+bridge> <zhn> no one will buy your hardware if its better only because of software improvements that you share with others in this worlds
20:13 <+bridge> <zhn> world*
20:13 <+bridge> <egyt> On Wikimedia Commons I saw something like "I put this work into the public domain, but if it is not possible in your country, then I allow you to use it to the maximum extent permitted by the law)
20:14 <+bridge> <egyt> On Wikimedia Commons I saw something like "I put this work into the public domain, but if it is not possible in your country, then I allow you to use it to the maximum extent permitted by the law"
20:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> "public domain" is not a concept in europe AFAIK, but that doesn't say anything about CC0
20:15 <+bridge> <egyt> Well, CC0 provides such a workaround for countries with less permissive laws about PD
20:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sooooo. you claimed that I cannot use CC0'ed works without attribution in europe. do you have a source for that?
20:23 <+bridge> <egyt> Well, I guess no 👀
20:24 <+bridge> <egyt> Although wait...
20:25 <+bridge> <egyt> Yeah
20:25 <+bridge> <egyt> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you should just be careful with releasing CC0 software by your own
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CC0 tries to actively remove your copyright
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CC0 is also currently not a approved open source license

20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://opensource.org/faq#public-domain
20:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "CC0 was not explicitly rejected, but the License Review Committee was unable to reach consensus that it should be approved, and Creative Commons eventually withdrew the application. The most serious of the concerns raised had to do with the effects of clause 4(a), which reads: “No … patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.”. While many open source licenses simply 
20:29 <+bridge> <egyt> Because it is mainly meant not for programs :P

20:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> laws are and will always be subjective to a certain point

20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> egyt: could you accept that you have no free will?
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or do you dislike that concept
20:31 <+bridge> <egyt> Define "free will"
20:32 <+bridge> <egyt> A nice idea for a video: "Is forced freedom still freedom?"
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that you have a will that is not controllable, and thus not (not even in theory) calculatable.
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for example arguments for a free will are flaws in math
20:34 <+bridge> <egyt> Mi ne kompreni vin...
20:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm struggling with a cxx.rs problem 😦
20:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `Pin<UniquePtr<T>>` should be `Unpin`
20:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, I think I need to update `cxx`
20:43 <+bridge> <egyt> excuse me?
20:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vulkan is hot
20:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gaming is spicy
20:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 69 is porn
20:45 <+bridge> <learath2> How? 😄
20:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> unique ptr is unique xd
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I should be able to move a pinned pointer around
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `Pin` just says that I shouldn't be able to move out of the inner pointer
20:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so did cxx upgrade fix it?
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> needs cxx 1.0.75
20:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc
20:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> new is good
20:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
20:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see
20:48 <+bridge> <nouaa> what are the average perf for RUS2 (128p srv) ? also what specs?
20:48 <+bridge> <learath2> You are saying the pinned pointer should be moveable. Why did I even think you'd say the inner should be unpin 😄
20:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2: r u still learning go?
20:54 <+bridge> <learath2> I think I know pretty much all there is to know about it now. It's not a very deep language. I'm only missing internals and some reflection magic still escapes me, but that's about it
20:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I want to be able to call a rust function from go, natively and without cgo. what do I need to do?
20:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> go has some weird calling convention, I can certainly implement that from the rust side
20:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how do I link it in? do I need to produce go assembly from my rust crate or can I somehow link object files in?
20:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow heinrich took that personal xd
20:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Check out that one blog post I sent a month or so back last we talked. Sadly it's not very easy it seems
20:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your rating [0-10]?
20:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, we already talked about this. sorry, I seem to have forgotten
20:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess what remains in my memory is parts of that conversation
20:57 <+bridge> <learath2> You can link objects in that part is trivial, you should probably use the stable ABI0 that go has, but the problem is I don't really think there is a way to get go to use that convention when calling out to the linked in function, that's the part you'll need someone with more go knowledge than me for
20:57 <+bridge> <learath2> Usually you use ABI0 when writing inline assembly in go, so you put an annotation that marks your function as ABI0 then go knows how to call it
20:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > You can link objects in that part is trivial
20:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah nice
20:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, so I could achieve it with a wrapper that simply jumps to the rust function?
20:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, so I could achieve it with an inline assembly wrapper that simply jumps to the rust function?
21:00 <+bridge> <learath2> I think it should be possible somehow
21:01 <+bridge> <learath2> I'd have to think about it a bit more 😄
21:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> cool. I'll put that on my "future cool big projects list"
21:04 <+bridge> <learath2> Actually let me give it a quick go without the rust part, see if I can get it to call some assembly properly
21:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> do report back 🙂
21:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how is that working out?
21:47 <+bridge> <learath2> Not very fun :D, but I did manage to call some extremely trivial assembly
21:49 <+bridge> <learath2> So any `.syso` file you drop into the folder of a go module will get linked in automatically
21:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what's .syso? .o, but I promise it's from the system?
21:50 <+bridge> <learath2> `.o` but just don't mess around with it and link it pls
21:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds cool 🙂
21:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you go from .a to .o?
21:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think rust was somehow unable to emit object files
21:51 <+bridge> <learath2> However, when telling you about ABI0, I kinda forgot that you can't really implement ABI0 without help from the go compiler, it uses pseudo registers
21:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what are pseudo reigsters?
21:52 <+bridge> <learath2> So I think your best bet would be to emit go assembler somehow, which can just then be compiled by the go compiler, then you'll have access to the pseudo registers
21:53 <+bridge> <learath2> e.g. there is a register called `SP`, it's not a real register, it's just where the compiler decides to put arguments and the assembler will resolve it when assembling go assembler
21:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. and it doesn't always go to the same register?
21:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so I'd have too emit some go asm shim around my rust code, I guess (if I don't want to emit everything as go asm)
21:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then I need to hook into the go runtime a little for stack support
21:56 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes, or maybe someone more acquainted with go internals can come up with something better
22:09 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think we might also have to improve the client performance for 128 players. Although this is the debug build, I have 1800 FPS without the 127 debug dummies :justatest:

22:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yep, in fact, the snaps are heavy on the CPU
22:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> The snap lookups are soo much
22:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how much in release? xd
