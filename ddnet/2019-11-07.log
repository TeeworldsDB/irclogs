14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> do you guys know if the player limit/ip was ever lower than 4?
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> cause i remember in like 2015 i couldn't play with my brother
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> was 2 before
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i remember the same
14:32 <@deen> shortly after adding dummies we bumped it to 4
14:32 <@deen> but according to git blame that was > 5 years ago: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blame/master/servers/ddrace.cfg
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> ye so 2014
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boci> thanks anyway
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi , how to set Client Updater on my own host ?
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why would you host an update server?
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 for his own client probably
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc https://update4.ddnet.tw/update.json is the important file that directs the client to download resources
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that makes sense
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TcTc> @deen  I don't know how the update system works if you can explain more
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> tune jetpack_strength isnâ€™t predicted with ddnet character
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc it checks the json file to see if there is a newer version, if so it shows in client and will download the files when updating
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> the update server is just any web server with tls
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what are you trying to do?
