01:41 < bridge> <blazulite> wait so you're telling me you can compile ddnet using rustup instead of cmake???
01:41 < bridge> <blazulite> that could solve the problem where i just cant compile on windows
01:41 < bridge> <blazulite> cause
01:41 < bridge> <blazulite> windpws fucking sucks
01:42 < bridge> <Teero> what the fuck are you talking about lmao 😂
01:43 < bridge> <blazulite> idk why i cant compile thru cmake on windows
01:44 < bridge> <blazulite> also i realized melon said an *idea* and not something that's already a thing (i didnt read the end of the msg)
01:44 < bridge> <blazulite> :justatest:
01:44 < bridge> <blazulite> also i just realized melon said an *idea* and not something that's already a thing (i didnt read the end of the msg)
02:04 < bridge> <louis> hes saying the readme should tell ppl to use rustup to install ddnets rust dependency
02:05 < bridge> <louis> cause rustc in package managers doesnt work as nicely
02:06 < bridge> <louis> where does ddnet even use rust
02:07 < bridge> <kebscs> the client doesnt even use it 💀
02:07 < bridge> <kebscs> but its there to keep rust users happy i guess
02:07 < bridge> <kebscs> the rust bridge is completely unused
02:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, does it only compile the Rust bridge or does it compile actual cpp files as well?
02:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ...oh
02:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hey dont be unfair
02:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> heinrichs quic pr which has been inactive since w henever uses it !!!
02:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 😔
02:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Perhaps someone could make the server send a system message about the team still being in practice mode if the team fully respawned.
02:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ur issue has a lot of words and is multiple issues
02:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i havent had a problem with /practice
02:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You didn't comment on it throughout the days it was open
02:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont look at issues xd
02:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and its alot of words i wouldntve commented even if i saw it
02:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Then don't expect to recognize your rant
02:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> as you don't mine here
02:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 👀
02:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Anyways, kebs also mentioned that it should have at least a system message present, thus why I mentioned that the second problem of #10925 should be like this
02:41 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10925
02:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Otherwise as stated, it's very risky to implement a system around it
02:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ this minus practice shouldnt enable /spec
02:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1417671929753632830/image.png?ex=68cb555f&is=68ca03df&hm=e3cad5c0da5fcd3b77b1d2e8eee9388bac0f40b19bc5e50213610cc09b662e8f&

02:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i dont think its that much of an issue
02:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not wanting people to run in /practice and try to avoid using it is fair
02:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bing bong
02:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, it's not really about always starting a run with practice mode on, you can still do that ingame. However upon wanting to not use it with the team, it gets a little more confusing when there was no system message telling you that you are still in practice mode.
02:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I was a bit skeptical about the top-left UI, since you cannot hover over it with your mouse to see what the icon really indicates.
02:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The 100% clarification would be a system message being sent to the client (or just bake it into the client if we don't care about custom clients xd) that your team is still using Practice Mode
02:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And since with most maps, you mostly spend multiple minutes, if not, hours into finishing a map with a team (pros on Brutal / Insane maps) where it's very crucial to know if your team is still on Practice Mode or not, since there was no tutorial about the top-left UI, as in what icons do what.
02:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @teero777 what r u doing today?
02:48 < bridge> <Teero> Idk, in bed. I was working on my renderer earlier
02:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh right
02:48 < bridge> <Teero> But vulkan is hard
02:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it's 2am in germany dude
02:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 💀
02:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (almost 3am)
02:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when i tried to render grids in web the fastest way was a single pass shader which is possible without interacting with vulkan at all
02:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which u can do with sdl
02:49 < bridge> <Teero> I need to make it render to a texture to use that with imgui to make a proper viewport window
02:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think sdl has any other stated graphics tho
02:49 < bridge> <Teero> Yea but I already have a 2k loc vulkan backend
02:49 < bridge> <Teero> And I'm not using sdl
02:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sunk cost fallacy
02:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> glfw
02:50 < bridge> <Teero> Also this is what I want. I could've just used opengl and everything would be easier but I wanted to learn vulkan
02:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fair enuf
02:50 < bridge> <Teero> Btw robyt I got animations to work thanks to tater discovering a sign bug in my shader
02:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is it ever gonna be able to connect to servers xd
02:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet-based
02:51 < bridge> <Teero> It will run on different physics so it doesn't make much sense lol
02:51 < bridge> <Teero> I was talking with tater about possible multiplayer tas editing which would be funky
02:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> u could make it a ddnet-rs physics module
02:51 < bridge> <Teero> Yes I will probably eventually
02:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that would be fun
02:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> imaigne a tournament but you ahve full tas tools
02:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think that would be allowed
02:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well different physics and the editor is server side maybe
02:52 < bridge> <Teero> Fastest run after 2 hours wins
02:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> time to go eep
02:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> u should too

04:23 < bridge> <blazulite> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
08:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller is #10924 about cmake or what
08:07 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10924
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or what makes it limited to only few source files
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What have you cooked again
08:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why isn't robytes PR much better
08:09 < bridge> <blazulite> yo,
08:09 < bridge> <blazulite> is there any ddnet map parser library?
08:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> arent there like 20 now 😂
08:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what exactly do you want to parse
08:11 < bridge> <blazulite> I want to do a silly attempt at A* pathfinding
08:11 < bridge> <blazulite> so
08:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> <https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap>
08:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This is the most useful map parser yet. it also has python bindings
08:11 < bridge> <blazulite> oo
08:25 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^^
08:25 < bridge> <Assa> twmap even allows you to convert a map in a map-directory, which I find very useful, since every layer is just a json file
08:26 < bridge> <Assa> and you can even reconvert them. This is how i programmed the snow in my map
09:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ wdym about cmake
09:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ which robyte pr? Its hardcodet to 4 files because we only have 4 files that pass the lint.
09:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I don't like that robyte writes reviews asking contributors to change how they write float values.
09:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?xD
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What does order have to do with floats
09:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sorry the order is alter käse for me already
09:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it now also checks floats
09:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 2 annoying nitpicks that clang cant enforce caught with one epic external tool
09:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was so hyped
09:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I cba to fix the cmake build anymore now that there is so much backlash
09:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** guess we have to stick to waiting 2weeks for a rob review saying "plEasE cHanGe YoUr FlOaT FrOm `0.f` to `0.0f` Or iT WoNt bE MeRgeD" forcing the unpaid contributor to undust this old branch and doing another push

10:02 < bridge> <Assa> As far as I know this is just a counter?
10:03 < bridge> <Assa> I think I found a bug there, but I have no idea what the consequences of a wrong number there are
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's used for load balancing
10:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Assuming all render calls take similar amount of time
10:07 < bridge> <Assa> it's currently wrong for grouped quads, because it's only 1 render count. But if you say it's for load balancing, I assume this draw call takes a longer amount of time, does it?
10:07 < bridge> <Assa> it's currently wrong for grouped quads, because it's only 1 render call no matter how many quads are rendered. But if you say it's for load balancing, I assume this draw call takes a longer amount of time, does it?
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Simply assume they take all same time
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> One quad group is one call
10:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon i want it to be automatically enforced so we can stop the fakin nitpicks and merge faster
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> then I'll push a fix soon
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 is it possible you forgot to merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10813 ?
10:19 < bridge> <learath2> It is very possible
10:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just hard to resolve two conflicts and rebase the prs that already were based on it <:pepedead:773232467658145822>
10:21 < bridge> <learath2> You don’t understand chiller at all. All he wants is things to be merged

12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller i dont see any linked pr in your description
12:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is there some like tutorial on making an actually decent profanity filter?
12:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> Anything
12:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> it seems hard
12:56 < bridge> <pilonpl> Maybe just ban the most obvious stuff and replace banned words with "DDNet" or something like that
13:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ its in my meta comment below description
13:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i try to separate description from discussion
13:10 < bridge> <Assa> idk, that's a very DDNet idea, why not use stars `****` ?
13:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> Stars are less fun
13:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> "DDNet hell" > "******* hell"
13:11 < bridge> <Assa> idk if it's a good idea to change every bad word to ddnet. Your mother is a ddnet, go ddnet yourself, please fix that ddnet map part ?
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> I am starting to like it 🙂
13:13 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah i am just not sure how to make it false positive free
13:14 < bridge> <Assa> with smarter context dependend AI checks and not just keyword replacement 🤷‍♂️
13:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> AI is a good idea
13:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> But surely someone would have made the perfect system already?
13:18 < bridge> <Assa> well, there is no perfect system, I can still insult your m0m or use similar utf16 letters, insider language, invent new words, ...
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> if there is a zensorship, people will find ways to circumvent it
13:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> What even is the goal of the profanity filter?
13:21 < bridge> <Assa> I guess having some automatic chat moderation, after all this game is played by younger children
13:21 < bridge> <Assa> imagine your child reading ingame chat and then running to you asking `Whats a deen?`
13:27 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it will never be very good anyways
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> Have you heard of the saying "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good"?
13:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
13:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> English is already tough enough and there are other languages too
13:42 < bridge> <melon> Amen
13:43 < bridge> <Assa> _puts in a russian dictionary as blocklist_ /s
13:45 < bridge> <pilonpl> The issue with having a whitelist is that it bans typos
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> a whitelist would be just worse, don't do that
13:47 < bridge> <melon> Can't wait to talk to you ***a
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> is Assassin then `******in` ?
13:48 < bridge> <melon> a**a**in
13:48 < bridge> <melon> :nouis:
13:49 < bridge> <melon> ackthually it would just be `*********`
13:49 < bridge> <melon> Cuz ass is sexual and sin isn't allowed on our Christian channel
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> maybe then there's a trick again in beeing unpingable :brownbear:
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> It'll probably just have slurs in there not `ass`

17:06 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny do you know what the hook does if it has multiple teleouts?
17:06 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny do you know what the hook collision line does if it has multiple teleouts?
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> hmm I think it might ignore it :justatest:
17:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it does nothing
17:08 < bridge> <Assa> so it just ignores it, does the hook still teleport?
17:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well yeah the hook teleports but theres no prediction
17:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it cant no cuz its random on the servre side
17:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it cant know cuz its random on the server side
17:10 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently reworking all of this line segment creation logic ...
17:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> waht u have is fine if it compiles
17:10 < bridge> <Assa> maybe we should have a color until the teleport for "unsure"
17:10 < bridge> <Assa> yeah for it to compile i just need to add a compare function, but this thing calls std::find multiple times for no reason
17:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres not a map i can think of that even uses multiple hook outs
17:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the maps i can think of are just teleports for swinging and funny aha you hook up but u actually hook sideways or down
17:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which are very much aided by the hook line tp, its a shame its not on by default
17:12 < bridge> <Assa> the hook line shows the direction switch?
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yar
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait can u even direction switch with hook tps
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think u can

17:23 < bridge> <Assa> Hook Collision lines probably don't work, if you hit a hook-teleport without tele-out followed by a hook-teleport with tele-out
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> as far as I can tell
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> time for the next gambling map?
17:32 < bridge> <soulyvevo> 🤑
17:33 < bridge> <melon> ⠀⠀⠀
17:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like one of the japenese gameshows, either you hook twinbop or buttee
17:33 < bridge> <Assa> or you hook a solid and push yourself into a deathtile
17:33 < bridge> <Assa> that's a bad monty hall problem

18:21 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny do you know why the collision line segments are searched for duplicates?
18:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nope!
18:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think its a bit islly
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> I think it's very silly! 😄

20:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> CI jumpscare
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you mean javascript jumpscare
21:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) W CI don't let heinrich or jupstar see it

21:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also also @chillerdragon 
21:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > I do not have the energy to work on this if there is already a discussion.
21:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
21:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what does this mean, does this mean "i hate this useless discussion which achieves no purpose apart from stopping me from saving 30m of build time" because i am very interested in having a faster-fast-build.yml 🥺
23:07 < bridge> <Assa> I keep finding shit with that hook teleports <.<

23:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: there is only so much ddnet maintainer bs I can take. If it’s already controversial during the issue stage the risk of getting a stale pr or no merge at all is quite high. I rather not spend my time on that. Even the discussion it self is a waste of my time. Because eventuell Heinrich will stop responding anyways.
23:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> contribute to tclient because theres no maintainer bs!
23:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fr
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or rather i still play the game
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> deen accepted my fwen request ><
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think roby and hein are the only 2 people i havent seen in gmae
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think roby and hein are the only admins i havent seen in gmae
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think roby and hein are the only 2 admins i havent seen in gmae
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> admins*
23:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why i cant edit
23:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have seen hein play Stronghold irl xd
23:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wow
23:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> robi never played he just spawned as ddnet admin
23:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> huh
23:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or something like that
23:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He basically already quit when he moved from Teeworlds to ddnet and I never saw him in CTF either
23:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: Right? Or did you ever tryhard ctf?
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when admin ctf session (also invite me)
23:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> deen played in the official tournament
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have seen a deen
23:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anyway new tclient release time
23:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I didn't play much vanilla
23:38 < bridge> <louis> deen is a huge pro
23:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea deen used to be pro gamer
23:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And less ddrace? Xd
23:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So my statement „spawned as admin“ was factually correct, ez
23:55 < bridge> <learath2> I used to play quite a bit with heinrich, don't think I've seen him recently though
23:58 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think i saw all admins in game at least once
