00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trailer from 2013
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8SBp4SyvLc> trailer in 2020
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a true early access success
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: pls make next blog post about tw UI code i never understood vsplittopleft right label magic
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> also what is the least intrusive way of coding custom ddnet client menus? I had to edit menus_settings.cpp to add my settings page which already got me multiple merge conflicts. Also the max of ui_settings_page is capped and would require yet another conflict edit in variables.h
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u didnt look into ddnet code since long right?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i documented those functions some time ago
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> in the header
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> yea i think i even saw that but forgot it
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> which header 
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/ui.h#L25
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> ui.h
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> ye got it ty
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i did a p good job
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> ok fuck reading docs sok xd
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont understand then u dum
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> you should make yt videos
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> with samples and voice
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> so hard to follow text
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would i had good english accent
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or were native
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if*
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> if i could read text i could also just read the code^^
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> then make video and write voice script and buy a voice on fiver
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> or hire me
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> my english sok but idc
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would i hire u for something i wouldnt even get money myself
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> who said hiring includes money
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> and why u dont get money
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> thats a bad excuse
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hiring always includes money
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u meant a partnership
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> omg language nazi
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i offer myself to do the job
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i do not think "getting a job done" always implies getting paid for it
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> whatever ofc i wouldnt take money to read a text lol
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a legit job
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reading a script
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon just gotta wait till https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon, go donate ur voice
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mozilla is actually doing a rly good job at machine learning voice stuff
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon u will get a website read by a natural voice
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine a weeb voice reading articles for u
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the future is promising
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> xd
13:51 <+ChillerDragon> yikes after so many days of uploading through the slow ftp conenction the hoster deleted all files cuz 220gb is too much. TIL infinite disk space ends somewhere around 200gb.
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > i still expect the lifetime of the company to be long enought that its the cheapest option for a server with strong cpu ram and infinite disk
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that didn't age well, the lifetime of your account seemed to be a lot less, at least
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> yea yikers i got bamboozeld
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> any idea where I could host my minecraft server then? Seems like I have to delete my windows partition to squeeze a few gb out of my laptop and keep running it there
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get a rpi 4 with 4 or 8gb ram
14:06 <+ChillerDragon> i need 16gb ram and a 3.8ghz cpu min
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u only have 7ppl in ur sv
14:06 <+ChillerDragon> i want more than 4 players
14:06 <+ChillerDragon> vanilla minecraft performs poorly
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use papermc
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hosted a sv with 10 ppl in it on my vps with 4gb
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and worked well
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> yea idk how to convert the world tho
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont lol
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just copy the world folder i guess
14:07 <+ChillerDragon> it resets playerpositions
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea and can u slap 1tb of disk on a raspberry easily?
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355290296947499013
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yikes google
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25964226
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
14:08 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon google a fcking tech corp doesnt know element is just a frontend for a network
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> or they do
14:09 <+Ryozuki> its like banning google for having links to a website with offensive  stuff
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> and dislike it
14:09 <+Ryozuki> yeah they sure do
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> its just an assumption 
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> hopefully it will get some pr for element
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel this every time i chat with chiller
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> no u
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> »A fool can ask more questions then 7 wise men can answer«
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> why?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> :D
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder how long my laptop will life if i keep running it as a server 24/7
14:12 <+ChillerDragon> i never understood the difference between server and non server hardware
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: not sure if a rpi can handle a minecraft server
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that stuff is really resource-heavy

15:09 <+ChillerDragon> looks like an ad im scared to click the fishy link xd
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> or is it deleted on discord already?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> already banned and deleted on discord
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> yea thought so ty for info
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> i can fit a m2 drive in every laptop right?
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> might be a bit late to ask i just ordered one xd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: newer laptops do tend to have m2 slots, higher end ones even empty m2 slots
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But older laptops usually only have sata
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Worst case you can get one of those m.2 to 2.5 inch hdd "adapters"
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> the laptop already has a ssd in there i think and its from 2017+ ish
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> yea sounds safe ty Learath
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> just gotta find em screwdrivers
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> i used to go to some pc repair shops for stuff like this but all closed :/ send halp
15:27 <+Ryozuki> 2017 doesnt sound like it will have m2
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Man coming up with a backup expiry strategy which supports rules like keep 30 minute backups for a day, daily backups for a week etc. is really hard to get right
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I tried two strategies so far and both produce either kind of irregular backups or gaps
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What password managers are you guys using? I went from lastpass to keepass to firefox lockwise and finally to pass, and I never want to leave again. For firefox/chrome use browserpass. And for android sync your passwords with syncthing and use android-password-store.
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i use keepassxc + syncthing
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> keepass is great but i keepassxc is just not made for tiling wms
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> keepass is great but keepassxc is just not made for tiling wms
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why is that?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I couldn't get the thing running without having the window open and i can't have that
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you mean you don't want to enter the password each time, but leave the window open?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I mean I couldn't start the app in the background
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro what twm u use?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> xmonad
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you i3?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i3 gaps yea
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use firefox to keep my passwords
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah so lastpass
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i use i3, but im not sure in which usecase you need your keepass open in the background
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah no
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I mean lockwise
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you elaborate?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Patiga are you using the browser extension?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> no o.o
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> browser extension that works with keepass?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sounds nice
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well if i want to fill a password i need the app running
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> for autotype to work
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> just looked it up, there are browser extensions for keepass but they're not really encouraged, you are supposed to use autotype
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> which makes sense
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Patiga You gotta have keepassxc running in the background somehow, right?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki are you using firefox sync?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I had my own firefox sync server for a while but they never added support to the mobile lockwise app for that -.-
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just add a master password
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it encrypts all
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 2 lazy to do anything else
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I didn't like the whole firefox sync thing I'm not using it anymore, seemed fiddly sometimes the tabs didn't sync maybe it was because I was hosting it myself
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont sync often anyway
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since im always on the same pc
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can't tell, but somehow the idea of logging into my browser annoyed me anyways xD
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Now I could switch to any browser which supports web extensions at least. Maybe chrome some day if I can live without tree style tabs
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew chrome
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not chrome but ungoogled chromium or some other chromium based more privacy/foss minded browser
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Idk screensharing, mic, webcam on linux it constantly gives me trouble and on chromium it just works (tm)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works for me
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro i use pass https://www.passwordstore.org/
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's not like it wouldn't work in general but try zoom, jitsi, discord on some of them it won't work or some features like sharing a specific monitor don't work
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And it even changes over time, zoom used to work and just stopped working some day
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ChillerDragon: yep me too now, that's what i was saying, it's awesome!
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what firefox u use btw
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ChillerDragon: are you using a browser plugin? if so which one?
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> oh i didnt read the full message sorri
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> pacman -S firefox
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use firefox-developer-edition
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses a rly recent version
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe it has fixes
19:03 <+ChillerDragon> no i use pass from cli plain
19:03 <+ChillerDragon> i also have the otp extension for 2fa logins
19:03 <+ChillerDragon> i have a bunch of helper scripts and never feelt the need for browser extension
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> copy to clipboard via cli or the dmenu thing?
19:03 <+ChillerDragon> cli idk what dmenu is
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think the dmenu thing is nice
19:04 <+Ryozuki> chiller is a gnome normie
19:04 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ChillerDragon: launch `passmenu`
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah
19:04 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon r u on arch rn?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess it won't work on gnome
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well idk if dmenu works on gnome
19:04 <+ChillerDragon> ye
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> dmenu command not found
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but might be not your thing, dmenu is kinda twm focused
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> im sure there is some gnome extension for that
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> but cli so good
19:05 <+Ryozuki> there isnt 
19:05 <+Ryozuki> dmenu is a simple menu to launch apps
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can probably just install dmenu
19:05 <+Ryozuki> like when u put ur mouse top left
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but it will look rly out of place on gnome
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> i spend most of my day in terminal anways so there is more effort using the gui
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> so whats ur issue now @timakro?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> none :D
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> u want autocomplete in browsers?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> since i switched to pass the world is awesome
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:06 <+Ryozuki> how is it more awesome
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> how do u handle things on ur phone?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> There are two browser plugins: passff and browserpass. Browserpass is the less used one but it's much better
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I sync with syncthing and use android-password-store
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> interesting so its a different password manager using the same data?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And my phones android version is recent enough to have the password manager api so that hooks right into that
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> crazy
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Even shuts up samsungs default password manager
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> thats so much better than my solution
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what's yours?
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> none xd
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> i just avoid using my phone at all times
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah I don't use it too often
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sometimes I use it to login to my uni sso to check something if i'm not home
19:09 <+ChillerDragon> maybe ill use pass one day if i get a proper linux phone
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The problem is you need your gpg key on your android phone and I can see why you wouldn't want that
19:09 <+ChillerDragon> my phone is currently mainly a clash of clans gaming console xd
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But actually the android gpg thing is also pretty elegant because you use the OpenKeychain app for storing and decrypting your key and that also provides my key to k9mail
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My dad pre ordered the librem 5 from puri.sm ages ago and is still waiting on it. He's the kind of guy who doesn't have whatsapp
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm looking forward to him getting the thing and and figuring everything out. I'm sure it will be painful but tbh some people need to start with linux phones
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The puri.sm guys are constantly sending patches to gnome, gtk and gtk based apps to make them responsive
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Firefox on mobile is shit anyway. Apple wont let anyone use js acceleration and on android it performs like ass
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, scrolled up again
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The stupid discord app on ipad is so bad
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hm, I'm using firefox on mobile for lack of a better idea
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My phone is super new so I guess it's just fast enough to cope ^^
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> On my previous phone it was unusable
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just caved and used chrome, they already track me so much, they can have a couple extra data points
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox mobile works fine for me
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But my previous phone also still shipped with a native browse app (they don't do that anymore but instead google replaced it with chrome to push that)
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Native browsers usually are outdated stripped down versions of chromium anyway
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe on my next phone I’ll have the privilege of using firefox ;P
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i use a redmin 9 iirc
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so china spies me anyway
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> redmi
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, xi is probably watching you right now
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> o/
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> \\o
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Regulations are currently so far behind of technology that they can get away with almost anything anyway
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Okay my backup expiry algorithm is done, prototyped it in python and checked it with matplotlib. Spent way too much time on this.. Now I just wanna translate it to posix shell
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have  u seen the new blog about number parsing?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on apple m1 they can parse 1200 mb/s
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> over 1gb
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I saw the headline
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What exactly are they doing
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lemire.me/blog/2021/01/29/number-parsing-at-a-gigabyte-per-second/
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> parsing numbers
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka numbers in string form
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to real numbers
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but fast
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love the idea of the M1 chip. Such a simple yet elegant improvement
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can u explain ELI5 why m1 is so good?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i havent read anything about it
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One day RISC will get good enough for us to have an open version of the same idea
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> M1 uses a little core large core architecture
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is on par with the original c++ impl of fast-float
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/805141698241626132/unknown.png
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it has small cores that do small tasks keeping the experience smooth and using very little energy and large cores that handle the beastly tasks
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i see
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> right, is also heard about the idea of efficient cores for non time critical tasks and fast cores for time critical tasks
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk if it is taht
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk if it is that
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They also introduced a new x86_64 compatibility mode of sorts into the ISA so it’s extremely efficient to emulate x86_64
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> right, i also heard about the idea of efficient cores for non time critical tasks and fast cores for time critical tasks
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh yeah i remember now it was that, i was reading the post from mozilla about porting firefox to M1
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fck i forgot another interesting blog post that praised rust
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my duty to share it failed
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the most important part of integrated architectures like this is actual distance
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no matter how fast the machine, sh will always be slow as fuck
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The GPU is very tightly coupled so it has things like direct memory access, the ram is wired directly so shorter traces squeezing out even more performance
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A true law of nature
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro did u know a blog post i made was featured in this week in rust
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2021/01/27/this-week-in-rust-375/
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try to find it
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish vulkan was a thing before apple decided to invent metal. Would have finally ended this api debate
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki did you know someone basically made one of your posts into a video (not saying they copied it xD) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQa9mveTSV4
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki which is yours?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/805143618351923291/unknown.png
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the first
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> paypal-rs? Is that rust bindings for paypal api?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a project im doing
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> got 2 sponsors
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 10€ month
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first time i get money
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing open source
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> that stupid frog
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the api is rly big
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what does it mean
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro it means hype
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the frog is cool
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 first "vulkan" is btw older than apples metal
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Mantle
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ nein nein!
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> du bist stupiden!
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A couple more and you’ll be set for life. Credibility is the only thing you need in the open source world to make money
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they say the first 3 is the hardest
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Or just invest into the right stock for a week
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i invested in doge before it went down today
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> got 40€
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> whats doge?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dogecoin
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I set my limit sell wrong so I lost 10e on doge ;P
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dogecoin.com/
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki what is stupiden xD
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a meme coin literally
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ im just making fun of u for sharing a german website
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I made 600e on bitcoin and 120 in ethereum tho
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hm i'm just holding all my money in msci world etf
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wats that
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> just a big huge frickin large etf
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> so lot's of spread no risk
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> at least thats the idea
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ryo being funny 🤡
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds much safer than messing around with btc anyway 😄
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah sry @Ryozuki maybe korean is better
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%A7%A8%ED%8B%80_(API)
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i even waited out the corona crash
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only made money on btc because I bought alot to pay for my vps then I stopped caring about that vps
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 where u bought it?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the vps
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was a seedbox on feralhosting
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tsmc the most valuable semiconductor company, i think they are bound to rise
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there arent other companies besides samsung iirc
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> able to make this stuff
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well intel has their own fabs
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but no one cares about intel rn
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think i suck at investing, i suppose i would hold even if it was going straight down to 0 always hoping for it to go up agin
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Qualcomm and foxconn also make their own chips iirc
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only tsmc existing is why there is short of stock on amd and nvidia gpus
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + covid?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are customers of TSMC,
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro well investing and day trading are very different. Holding is a valid strategy in investing if you believe there is reason for a stock to go up
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> invest in gold
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the other hand I have friends day trading bitcoin making 10e here and there trading on very small changes
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well, the past showed that you never made a loss when you were willing to wait like 2 years or smth so that's my reason to believe
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but is that a good reason? idk
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/805145868931956786/OO_4z_v2Iu65Lcz-Fg7PaHhmM-rYeBg7Fok-mSsUP0.png
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 53 million usd today
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I ever get some money, I’ll invest in whatever the finnish pension fund invests in
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They seem to keep making money over and over in all kinds of situations ;P
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd love to see a well designed RISC vs well designed CISC at same transistor width
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found a crypto where u code smart contracts mainly in rust
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ARM should he RISC enough to compare
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://near.org/
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all these cryptos have such fancy websites
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im ok with ARM, but is x86 really the best CISC? xd
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho ARM isnt really RISC anymore
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think x86 has an unfair advantage having the entire world catering to it
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well ARM is probs more used nowadays isnt it?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with all these mobile platforms
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes but never in high performance until apple decided to try it
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but even that thing is only mobile
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to see they best possible desktop chip
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they can produce
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to see their best possible desktop chip
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s a first attempt tho. We’ll need to wait a couple more years so ARM (and maybe even RISCV) matures a bit on high performance applications
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhhhhhh the question is, why shouldnt anybody have tried yet
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it not scalable enough?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Microsofts ARM laptop was abysmal, so the actual mobile chips out there are shit ;P
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can it be scalable enough 😄
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not many people out there willing to try different things? It takes a metric fuckton of investment to look into this stuff
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i agree, but now that apple made the transition, apple has no excuse not todo it for desktop
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should they wait, except they have problems with scaling
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only a handful of companies even produce chips and a lot of them are heavily invested in either x86 or are constrained within the mobile world with arm
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They did release an M1 desktop (not very great) and I think they are looking into a second gen in a year or two
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this is as fast as innovation can go in an industry that has extraordinary barriers to entry
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too bad
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how many people even have the skills to do microarchitecture design in total
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd be totally ok with only having like 50% x86 performance if the native performance is atleast 25% over the "best" x86 chip
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> especially single thread is not really getting better, too bad 😄
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho my understanding is that CISC always has the potential to outperform RISC, so i wonder if there is no effort into trying to make a better CISC than x86
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how important single thread performance will be in the future. Multi threading really seems to be key to extracting all the performance we can get out of the silicon per cm
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 but games rly rely on single thread perf
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if there is a way around iot
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even that has been improving with consumer cpus getting more and more cores
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is alot that requires single thraed perf(or other non scalable stuff), else everyone would use some 128cores ARM processor probs
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think intel limiting consumer cpus to 4 physical cores really hindered research and development in that area
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amd is going full blown at threads
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> threadripper 😎
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is true, but u have to note that they had 8 threads, and 1 x86 core is not really 1 arm core, its more like 1.5x ARM core
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 64 cores 128 threads at 2.9ghz
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs of hyperthreading etc
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not bad
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc, I meant more as in “past a certain point”
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t think we’ll need a single thread performing much better then what we have right now on x86 anytime soon. Atleast not for consumer usage
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho, it seems apples M1 single thread perf outperforms x86 counterparts at same enegery level, so i wonder how well desktop chips would be(if they scale at such energy levels)
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only apple knows at this point. I bet they had a couple experiments already
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it wasn’t promising, I don’t think they’d invest in it this heavily
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but its kinda risky, since intels 10nm is probs still a bit worse than TSMC 5nm or whatever they call it
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i assume intel will get another 20-30% perf increase soon
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if apple could already scaled, they should have done it quickly
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (from a companys perspective atleast)
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An idea I’ve had with massively vectorized cpus would be ai agents e.g.
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was used in later PS3 games with it’s cell architecture being perfect for this
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i kinda finished https://github.com/edg-l/teestatus
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit dirty but it does its job
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only 0.6 protocol tho
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant find docs on 0.7
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah not very documented the 0.7 protocol
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can it do both ddnet extended 0.6 and vanilla 0.6?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For 0.7 you need to do the handshake to get a token
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you use the token in a standard serverinfo request iirc
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe someday
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lazyness kicked in
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and 0.7 is not exciting anyway
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The best starting point is heinrich’s PR adding the token protocol
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you want to take a look at it 😉
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😀
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple’s emoji font makes the winky face look so condescending
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😌

20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🥺
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon what are u drawing this year on ur contribs
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have been useless for so long, learning about stupid infinite dimensional vector spaces
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel a crazy amount of excitement for rust
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i dont think its sane
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just love it to much
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant look at other langs rn
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im crazy
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s a common symptom of rust addiction
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We see one every day on ##C
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone coming in with a “question” only to talk about how good rust is
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also since there is so much uncharted stuff in rust
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its easy to get discovered
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never expected my blog post to reach frontpage
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s like mormons or vegans trying to convert us
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good fellas going to #CC
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ##c
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure the ppl in there reply by citing some hideous standard
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to make ppl scared
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and go away
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we don’t quote the standard unless needed
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even dare to talk in ##c out of fear
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sometimes some fools come in asking a question and then showing us some online tutorial as proof that our answer is wrong
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That’s when you pull out the standard
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s much friendlier now that Zhivago is gone
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🧐
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That guy would call you a retard (rightfully so but it’s mean) to your face ;P
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I find it very disappointing that people are defending things like they are religion nowadays
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Technical things shouldn’t have fanboys
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u say nowadays
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it always has been that way
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for lot of things
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even outside tech
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has been very calm for a decade in the tech sphere atleast
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had no one trying to sell me Hack or ruby on rails
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well probs cuz c++ never had a competitor
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was always the c++ is shit side vs the c++ is the only good language side
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For a brief moment Java zealots took off after the release of minecraft with fresh 10 year olds learning java to mod minecraft
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also learned java thanks to minecraft
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😐
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discovering new emojis
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I too embarked on the java journey, but I had been informed I should probably bring along a puke bag just in case
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I must say modern java while performing awfully and having a cancerous focus on OOP actually is quite pleasant to work with
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With it’s new functional style interfaces and all
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always have to search how to go from Date to sql.Date and then viewing Date has been deprecated and lot of stuff
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, java is sadly full of that stuff
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kotlin looks a little better in most regards and still runs on the JVM if you want to check out something javalike
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried kotlin 5 mins and got bored
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i dont have the will to learn another lang when i can use java
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kotlin is like Scala but better ;P
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, if you have a language to cover all your needs, learning another one is generally just for lulz
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust seems to cover a lot of ground, so it’s normal you don’t care for much more
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😎
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there seems to be no channel binding defined for tls 1.3, and thus neither for quic
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> channel binding AFAIK means that you have a random number that is guaranteed to identify the connection
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can use that to securely send password hashes, (roughly) by seeding the hash by the random number from the connection, so that it can never be reused
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> such a scheme can even defend against MITM of rcon passwords, even without TLS certificates
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11871
