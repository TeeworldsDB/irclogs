00:00 < bridge> <oxyzo.> they acutally never existed its your imagination
02:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Made this popup make more sense
02:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> A dot means it's index 0
02:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> An X mark means it's checking the `NOTINDEX` of the current position
02:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> An ellipsis means there's more than 1 index for the current position rule

08:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks do you have any ideas?
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno maybe your PC power management
09:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but then my fps would also be bad, no?
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe your pc can't handle good internet and gpu usage at the same time
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have no other explanation for this. Sounds completely unrelated
09:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fixed by using ethernet üò¨
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am thinking about implementing anti bot using social engineering detection
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is a surprisingly high amount of players that when asked which client they use they happily name cheat client names
10:13 < bridge> <teero777> What if say ooga booga client as a joke?
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you are legit
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> but how does it know that I'm using sarcasm
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> That's some pretty advanced algo
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you are being sarcastic to antibot and name a known cheat client then it is your fault you get kicked
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same as they never understand my bomb pranks at the airport
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> I think if your bots regularly whisper the Russians asking if they're using Voldemort client and you're saying that you're using Voldemort client yourself I think most would confess xdf
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> Since they think they can play with you
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its like the good old are you are terrorist checkbox in some goverment forms
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> yea xddd
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never know what it was for
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i know now
10:18 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1339888457098596352/20240529_211735.jpg?ex=67b05bde&is=67af0a5e&hm=954d3bd411bd718c395b26e53422e2a2826b4758d051c7b3dbfc1974e38b3e81&
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imagine the trouble you can get into for fat fingering the wrong one
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats much harder to not get wrong than not naming a cheat client
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Imagine reading tourist
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boi
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea there system is clearly flawed
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mine is better
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> teerrorist
10:20 < bridge> <teero777> I'm real teerorist
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hello Sir, would you like to get banned for using cheats?
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Indeed
10:21 < bridge> <teero777> Nooo it should be like "Hii in using Voldemort client wbu? I need someone to test the features with"
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> —á—Ç–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç ¬´cheats¬ª, —è –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞
10:22 < bridge> <teero777> ** in russian ofc
10:22 < bridge> <teero777> @gerdoe translate for me xd
10:22 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think deepl can do convincing russian
10:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its deepl generated xd
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure if you guys understand the effectiveness
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this guy just told me in game that he found a good tactic to not get kicked by me. And it is turning off cheats when i join.
10:33 < bridge> <teero777> Tbh voting them out on kog is impossible. On 64 rus server there are at least 10-20% botters
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> botters vote botters on my servers
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the botters that complain the loudest about other botters
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kick votes pass on my server and it requires 80% yes :D
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we improve the censorlist somehow?
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like add confusable support
10:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``"Upgraded" == "Upgrad–µd"``
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is ``False`` according to python
10:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i want to censor one if i added the other to my censorlist.txt
10:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> well are these two the same string? or does one have a different unicode character
10:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> unicode normalization should do the trick
10:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> unicode normalization should/could do the trick
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> huh
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> >>> "Upgraded" == "Upgrad–µd"
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> False
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> >>> str("Upgraded") == str("Upgraded")
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
11:07 < bridge> <Assa> unless you are doing some utf8 bullshit with me
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> that `e` is weird
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> ```
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> >>> str1 = "Upgraded"
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> >>> str2 = "Upgrad–µd"
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> >>> for i, c in enumerate(str2):      
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> ...     print(str1[i] == c)  
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> ... 
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> False
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> True
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> ```
11:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> cryllic e instead of latin e
11:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> first e: 'e': U+0065
11:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> second e: '–µ': U+0435
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> I guess banning by name doesn't make sense anyway
11:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> banning by name?
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> or censoring, every measure you'll take sb. will work around
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why the baseline should already filter out confusables to make the cat and mouse game less annoying
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> I guess your best bet would be an offensive-name-AI which is trained and maintained by others
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
11:20 < bridge> <Assa> and hope it catches the edge-cases you normally wouldn't with generalization
11:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im pretty sure filtering invisble unicode and supporting confusables would go a long way
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> what is your goal? silent renames?
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> avoid ads for bot clients spreading
11:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah that can be done with pattern-matching around certain keywords and unicode normalization
11:22 < bridge> <Assa> I guess filtering for https: and www would already do much
11:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there isnt a single http or www
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its all domains and telegram channels
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and they dont change
11:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> we handled that on Blockworlds with that - works decent, tho you get false positives sometimes, but since we log that on discord its easy to catch
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> e.g people just trolling by making troll whispers etc.
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> false positives?
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay only troll tho right
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> because we just matched on "bro, check out this client" - without the last part
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i sent that a lot 
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its funny af
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> based
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> cammodude does that on copylovebox constantly
11:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> bro, check out this client: ddnet.org
11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good one
11:25 < bridge> <Assa> "bro, check out this client github.com/ddnet/ddnet"
11:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> "stop sending me malware links"
11:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxax
11:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> chiller, the most german dude living somewhere on beach laughing in russian

11:30 < bridge> <Assa> I wish to send you a scammy looking url just sending you to ddnet.org, but I can't find the service anymore, it was amazing üò¶
11:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> [h](https://ddnet.org)[ttp://get.a-virus.today](https://ddnet.org)

11:34 < bridge> <Assa> lol
11:34 < bridge> <Assa> nice dc feature
11:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The way I made that fake link was actually sending two links, one with [h] and the other with [ttps://blah]
11:34 < bridge> <aegisub> <http://urlify.io/> maybe
11:36 < bridge> <aegisub> but I think the one I remember was different
11:36 < bridge> <Assa> take a look at the "trumpify" option ü§£
11:36 < bridge> <Assa> service seems not to work btw
11:46 < bridge> <Sans> how are custom colors applied to a skin? I'm trying (again) to make a tee renderer and I can't figure it out from the cpp code how custom colors are applied to the body/feet
11:53 < bridge> <totar> it's complicated, you kinda just have to read the code that does it
11:53 < bridge> <totar> there's very little logic to why it works the way it does
11:57 < bridge> <Sans> Im not even sure where that is
11:57 < bridge> <Sans> I get the general idea of graying the skin before applying color
11:57 < bridge> <Sans> but how to actually do it I have no idea
11:59 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp
12:25 < bridge> <Sans> the only thing about colors there is choosing random colors for the random skin button
12:30 < bridge> <totar> See "LoadSkin" method
12:31 < bridge> <zhn> @teero777 @chillerdragon do you still need it
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> wdym? The antibot cheater whisper message detector? xd
12:33 < bridge> <Sans> This part here?

12:33 < bridge> <totar> After that
12:34 < bridge> <totar> You'll need to check the convert to greyscale method also
12:34 < bridge> <Sans> ah the reorder thing, isnt that just converting it to grayscale?
12:36 < bridge> <totar> no this is all pretty much "for fun" changing the values afaik but you'll need to copy it
12:36 < bridge> <totar> I think ``ConvertToGreyscale`` does what it says

14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also missing a sizeof intrinsic

14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and I finally understood how to generate `idiv` instruction üò¨
14:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im yoinking llvm ir and making it worse
14:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and i could figure out how to generate code for `%p = sdiv %lhs, 5`, because on x86-64 rhs has to be either a register or a memory
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat this is for ur backend right?
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> is the backend api in rust?
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it have or u plan on having like a builder api
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> like inkwell
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u get smth working im up for making a mini lang using it
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact if it does have enough stuff i could add as a backend for this lang xD
14:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill use it for meraki :gigachad:
14:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if i ever finish it xd
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> gl ü´°
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact if it does have enough stuff i could add as a backend for the lang im making xD
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact if it does have enough stuff i could add it as a backend for the lang im making xD
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat do you know GEP?
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> gep is how u index a pointer in llvm
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> it calculates the final address
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> from type sizes and offsets
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can do it at comp time or runtime
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a llvm ir instruction
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> probably the most important
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> since it also is used to know about aliasing
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/GetElementPtr.html

15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> do you know DWARF?
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> who is the genius that named both as some mythologic stuff?
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> elfs and dwarfs
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> what would be the hobbit
16:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> I ama dwarf and I'm digging a hole
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> Hierarchically Optimal Block Backed Intrusive Tree
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> Go forth and spread the word of the HOBBIT pattern
16:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> waiting for GOBLIN or CHIMERA format to come out
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> does this exist
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 oh llvm jit is named ORC
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> No it does not, I just made it up. We need to develop it and spread it
16:16 < bridge> <aegisub> afaik elf was a coincidence and dwarf was specifically chosen to match elf
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> anyone interested in giving some feedback for #9670 :justatest: ? I have some time on the weekend to work on it
16:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9670
16:32 < bridge> <kebscs> squash commits, remove unncesessary comments like "old buggy shitty spaghetti behavior" :15Socialcredit:
16:34 < bridge> <kebscs> better comment for old tile than "Very buggy"
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> This comment was really necessary, not for the code, but for me to keep sane
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> 
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> I'll cleanup and squash üëç
16:39 < bridge> <kebscs> also can explain in explainDdnet func why the new tile is better
16:39 < bridge> <kebscs> since it still has bugs like the one i sent in the pr
16:41 < bridge> <Assa> What would be your way to explain this? I am aware of ~ 4 bugs this fixes, 4 videos?
16:42 < bridge> <kebscs> idk with old hookthrough all its done is just "outdated" sprite for it so whoever implemented that didnt have an idea either
16:47 < bridge> <Assa> The sprites are yet another topic, I am in touch with maptesters, who want to rework the look of speedtiles fully anyway
16:49 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @essigautomat i love these new speedups

16:49 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i was able to make some fun hookstrength specific stuff
16:56 < bridge> <kebscs> @essigautomat also tiles have names with _ instead of spaces so it should be BOOST_2
16:57 < bridge> <kebscs> but 2 is bad name, "new" or smth would be better i think
16:58 < bridge> <kebscs> fng has `FNG_SPIKE_NAME` and `FNG_SPIKE_OLD` for example
17:04 < bridge> <Assa> I crunshed everything to 1 commit, the new text reads `"OLD SPEEDUP: Gives tee defined speed. Arrow shows direction and angle. Deprecated."` I guess this is professional enough
17:05 < bridge> <Assa> So you'd like to rename the internal mapitem from TILE_BOOST to TILE_BOOST_OLD and TILE_BOOST_NEW ?
17:05 < bridge> <louis> probably
17:05 < bridge> <louis> how is it done for hookthrh
17:05 < bridge> <Assa> @soulyvevo is that second clip with old speedtiles?
17:06 < bridge> <Assa> @soulyvevo ~~is that second clip with old speedtiles?~~ no its not, the other tee just doesn't move üòÑ
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> I don't understand what you're doing in the clips xD
17:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> no its just air_friction 1 0 and -1 on tune zone
17:08 < bridge> <Assa> oh interesting
17:10 < bridge> <zakharkosh> have problem?
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> no, i make the problems
17:11 < bridge> <zakharkosh> amm
17:12 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ai generated replies
17:12 < bridge> <Assa> its done like TILE_FNG_OLD1, TILE_FNG_OLD2, ... and the new ones are name TILE_FNG_BLUE, TILE_FNG_RED, ...
17:13 < bridge> <Assa> Guess I'll rename them, TILE_BOOST is also a strange name
17:13 < bridge> <zakharkosh> have any problms or what

17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> this guy actually looks like a ai chatbot or smth
17:17 < bridge> <zakharkosh> You are a stupid person
17:17 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place @kebscs refactored/renamed/replaced all TILE_BOOST tiles (and the new ones as well)
17:17 < bridge> <louis> okey nice
17:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> bro really throws arrows
17:18 < bridge> <louis> @essigautomat hopefully maintainers will merge it
17:20 < bridge> <Assa> If they do I'll add more features I have in mind for speedups üôÇ
17:20 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
17:20 < bridge> <louis> wdym
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had an idea
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> a delayed speedup
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> 2 other speedup related tiles:
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> - max-speed tile, just slowing you down to max-speed in any direction, a speed limiting tile, or in trackmania similar to cruise control
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> - a speed setting tile. Set max-speed into direction immediately, just SET
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> u pass the speedup tile and the velocity is applied after X seconds
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> cool parts
17:23 < bridge> <louis> trol tile
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> no u
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> 2 other speedup related tiles:
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> - max-speed tile, just slowing you down to max-speed in any direction, a speed limiting tile, or in trackmania similar to cruise control, no force is applied here
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> - a speed setting tile. Set max-speed into direction immediately, just SET
17:23 < bridge> <louis> id stray away from too complex stuff
17:23 < bridge> <zakharkosh> You are a stupid person and dancer
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> these are less complex then the current one
17:24 < bridge> <louis> after all ddnet gave mappers spinners and pullers and look what mappers made
17:24 < bridge> <kebscs> i think should be kept boost instead of speedup, since theres plans to add new tiles
17:24 < bridge> <kebscs> and speedup is the name of entire layer
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet gave tune zones and up and down happened
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> when speedup is the name of the layer, then speedup_tile is the tile of the layer
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> this is exactly why I named it like this xD
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> why does the game layer have game-tiles?
17:25 < bridge> <kebscs> it has tile_hookable tile_jump etc not tile_game
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> what about TILE_TUNE?
17:26 < bridge> <kebscs> tune has no other tiles
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> speedup currently doesn't either
17:26 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean if you want to add new tiles it shouldnt be named like entire layer
17:26 < bridge> <kebscs> for future
17:28 < bridge> <Assa> why is it named speedup layer anyway, if it can slow you down? :nouis:
17:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn i am not sure i understand your "do you still need it" message
17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> i would keep it boost since it boosts
17:29 < bridge> <Assa> scientificly it would be an accelerator, like in a particel accelerator, but for Tees, so it's a TILE_TEE_ACCELERATOR
17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> and to not confuse when it was called boost before
17:30 < bridge> <Assa> I mean in the end I don't care, these are just semantics

17:34 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs what about `TILE_SPEED_BOOST` so we have `THING_DOMAIN_INSTANCE`
17:35 < bridge> <kebscs> :15Socialcredit:
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> because slowing down is just speeding up in the opposite direction üß†
17:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``ETile::SPEED_BOOST``
17:38 < bridge> <Assa> Speed is always relative to the observer. You, as a player, never have any speed, you just move the world around you
17:40 < bridge> <Assa> I guess we need a developer-important channel, where we can post but have a slow-down mode so we can put important stuff there and keep illuminating us here
17:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good
17:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh wait no. If you want stuff to not be forgotten open an GitHub issue, problem solved
17:42 < bridge> <Assa> Oh yeah, like my github issue from 4 years ago, that totally wasn't forgotten. You may ask which one, ...
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> At least the discussion isn't lost on github. Here it's pretty much gone without insane search skills
17:43 < bridge> <Assa> I must say I open a lot of issues, some of them got "won't fix", every crashlog I ever send was solved like immediately
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> Don't take wontfix too personally. We can't just say yes to everything, we also have a vision for the game
17:47 < bridge> <Assa> I don't take that personally at all, I am just a villian pointing out gamebreaking issues that can't be solved without breaking backwards compatibility
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> The one nice thing about having a discussion here is the real-time back and forth. You can figure out stuff that would take like 10 github comments with hours inbetween within minutes
17:52 < bridge> <Assa> Also it's not like nothing comes around, the elasticity tuning was merged so now we have cool bouncy tiles with other side effects
18:09 < bridge> <chairn> no it's not in general relativity
18:16 < bridge> <alw5> somone merge #7729 for real
18:16 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7729
18:21 < bridge> <learath2> Let's implement proper physics at relativistic speeds
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing everyone is scared of introducing cheats üòÑ
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> I'll think about it over food see if I can spot an exploit. If not I guess I can merge it
18:31 < bridge> <Assa> I guess having max speed behave like speed of light would't be that bad opposed to ramp, _but the backwards compatibility_
18:33 < bridge> <alw5> there are no cheats
18:33 < bridge> <learath2> Eh, I've thought about this before, there is just not much value to fixing these quirks about movement. Most movement happens slower than the weird part of the curve and the other side of the curve is usually only used for weird glitches for parts
18:33 < bridge> <alw5> its the same as if you had your team unlocked
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> However, there is a way to fix it. We just fix it for new maps and for new clients, old clients just won't be allowed to join when those maps are being played
18:40 < bridge> <louis> well you hit the curve on some maps
18:40 < bridge> <louis> run_blue type maps
18:40 < bridge> <louis> you can also tell that you can't move <- -> as easily when you're falling real fast
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> I did say most üòÑ
18:42 < bridge> <louis> i wonder how they even did the curve
18:42 < bridge> <louis> isn't the easier/more intuitive way to implement air resistance somehow?
18:44 < bridge> <louis> also unrelated but it'd be cool to have the jump button jump less if you tap it quickly
18:44 < bridge> <louis> also unrelated but i would have the jump button jump less if you tap it quickly if i made teeworlds for the first time
18:50 < bridge> <chairn> you can use sg bug after finish and restarts with weapon or whatever other path you could achieve with this
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> you can already
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> do that by unlocking the team
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> every finishes except 1 tee
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> someone in t0 goes to a spot
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> last tee disconnects
18:51 < bridge> <alw5> someone in t0 goes to a spot and someone in the team goes to the same spot
18:52 < bridge> <alw5> and they can sg bug
18:52 < bridge> <alw5> last tee disconnects, putting the team in t0
18:52 < bridge> <alw5> so merging this doesnt really change much
18:52 < bridge> <alw5> except for making it a little bit easier
18:52 < bridge> <chairn> oh true
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> you can stack one more tee than without
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> but then you could just finish the map x times
18:53 < bridge> <alw5> yea
18:53 < bridge> <chairn> well, whatever, game has been a mess since start üòÑ
18:54 < bridge> <louis> can't you much easily more stack like 40 tees in a single block with that change
18:54 < bridge> <louis> if everyone just goes /team 0 sequentially
18:54 < bridge> <alw5> yeah but you can already do that
18:54 < bridge> <alw5> just makes it easier
18:54 < bridge> <louis> yeah, like 40x easier
18:54 < bridge> <alw5> true
19:52 < bridge> <learath2> Well teeworlds physics have no concept of acceleration/force in the traditional sense and the natural way to describe drag is in terms of a velocity dependent force
19:53 < bridge> <Assa> example: friction only applies if the player doesnt move
19:54 < bridge> <Assa> *input moves
19:56 < bridge> <louis> i mean friction doesnt apply to a rolling bicycle in the same way it does to a braked bycicle
19:57 < bridge> <louis> i mean friction doesnt apply to a rolling bicycle in the same way it does to a braked bicycle
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> So you can just apply the drag to velocity instead by first integrating the drag force to figure out the change in velocity. After that I'm guessing most game developers would just pick some curve instead of doing that integral üòÑ
19:58 < bridge> <Assa> most game devs: if speed > max_speed: speed = max_speed
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> I probably would have picked the logistic function as my curve, but then it's not very cheap to calculate
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps something like x/sqrt(x^2 + 1) is cheaper to calculate and can be molded into the shape needed
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> or if you want proper drag I guess that could be had too, the integral of the drag force depends on the previous velocity though, so it wouldn't be a function of the new internal velocity as it was previously
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> That also could be why old games never really bothered with proper drag when it can be mimiced
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> I guess this is also an option, a partial function is not too bad perhaps even behaves better than what we have right now üòÑ
20:16 < bridge> <learath2> I guess this is also an option, a piecewise function is not too bad perhaps even behaves better than what we have right now üòÑ
