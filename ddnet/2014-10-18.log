03:58 <@deen> Oh, and another suggestion: Since people change clans often, should the friend search exclude clans maybe?
08:57 < ochristi> deen: maybe make that optional [x], but I would like that
12:48 < laxa> Most people wouldn't care of clans I believe
12:48 < laxa> but maybe I am wrong
12:57 <@EastByte> yay, english oral exam over

16:59 <@EastByte> (meta language)
16:59 < Savander> em
16:59 < Savander> ye

17:00 < Savander> btw.. i have to go lol
17:00 < Savander> so bye :c
17:00 <@EastByte> cya
17:45 <@deen> BeaR: nice work
17:45 < BeaR> hey (:
17:46 <@deen> hi
17:46 < BeaR> thx
17:51 <@deen> ddos on GER
17:51 <@deen> 400 MB/s
17:55 <@deen> oh, it's Captain Teemo attacking
17:56 <@EastByte> that's one of the vali guys I guess?
17:57 < Savander> hi
17:57 <@EastByte> wb
17:58 <@deen> hi Savander 
17:59 <@deen> At least the server doesn't go down so far
17:59 < Savander> server got ddos?
18:00 <@deen> yes
18:01 < Savander> ahm
18:04 <@deen> EastByte: he uses the same botnet as vali, but they don't seem to be friends
18:05 <@EastByte> yea I heard stories like that
18:06 <@deen> i thought it's Captain Teemo since exactly the server he's on is targetted (port), which hasn't happened for the first time
18:06 <@deen> he claims it's probably vali
18:06 <@EastByte> yea sure
18:09 <@deen> definitely different attack than yesterday
18:10 <@EastByte> well, we can compare further attacks with the material we have
18:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #67: Add support for ingame map sounds (DDRace64...pr_sound) http://git.io/Mda56g
18:46 <@deen> so much code! I will need to take a closer look at it later
18:46 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
18:46 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 25 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/c1So1w
18:46 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 90975fb BeaR: Start adding UI for loading sounds in the editor
18:46 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3098956 BeaR: Correctly load sound in the editor on add
18:46 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 d968b42 BeaR: Add support for sound layers
18:47 < BeaR> yeah editor eats pretty much :d
18:47 <@deen> more ddos attacks on RUS and GER
18:47 < Learath2> deen: you happy with kimisufi server ?
18:47 <@deen> Learath2: no
18:47 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
18:47 <@deen> Learath2: I'll stop paying for it as soon as possible
18:48 < Learath2> assuming you don't get ddos'd ?
18:48 <@deen> we have a new FRA server with better ddos protection
18:48 <@deen> Kimsufi currently only hosts the website
18:48 < Learath2> i'm thinking of switching my Hetzner vps for a kimisufi dedi which has way more resources for the same price
18:49 <@deen> hm, this time upnp devices are attacking again
18:49 <@deen> with http inside of udp packets
18:50 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, the performance is great and really cheap
18:50 <@deen> but ddos protection isn't the best and harmony hosting was cheaper
18:51 <@deen> 400 MB/s on GER again
18:51 < Learath2> wasnt harmony hosting the guys you were complaining about the downtime ?
18:51 <@deen> yes, they had a lot of downtime just when we bought them
18:51 <@deen> none since then
18:52 <@deen> afk
18:53 < Learath2> wow harmony hosting is cheap
18:53 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
18:54 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
18:55 < BeaR> finding a good hoster seems like to be the horror :D
18:55 < Savander> !help
18:55 < Savander> !twp Captain Teemo
18:55 < Nimda> Captain Teemo is currently playing DarkCore 2 on server : DDNet GER - Oldschool [DDraceNetwork].
18:57 <@EastByte> well atleast we know who the attackers are
18:59 < Savander> Captain teemo?
18:59 <@EastByte> we cannot know whether its him
19:00 <@EastByte> but the attack is the same as back then
19:00 <@EastByte> so one of the vali guys :)
19:00 < Savander> Ahm, okay :)
19:00 <@EastByte> we still can begin d0xchallenge v2
19:01 < Savander> d0xchallanege?
19:01 < Savander> challenge*
19:01 < Savander> btw. one server is a bit bugged xD
19:01 < Savander> ehm, one map (because ddos? maybe;o)
19:01 < Savander> join to me, and try to spawn
19:01 < Savander> :P
19:02 < Savander> impossible, instantly you die
19:05 < laxa> it's a bug from teeworlds
19:05 < laxa> not cause of ddos
19:06 < Savander> but, it's not
19:06 < Savander> solo??
19:06 < laxa> it is
19:06 < laxa> bug spawn point checks for collision
19:06 < laxa> even in solo
19:06 < laxa> well
19:06 < laxa> I guess
19:06 <@EastByte> deen: is it so?
19:07 < laxa> you spawn before being in solo zone, so I guess collision apply for that short period of time
19:08 <@EastByte> I thought solo is a server setting
19:10 < laxa> yeah
19:10 < laxa> but even though with that, it's bugging
19:10 < laxa> deen: one server is completely blocked, if you are there, you should do something about it :)
19:36 <@deen> EastByte: yes
19:36 <@deen> it's like that even in solo, which is why we tell the mappers to set multiple start points, all above ground
19:37 <@deen> i looked at the code and it seemed a bit hairy to fix, didn't want to break anything else
19:37 <@EastByte> okay
19:38 < BeaR> hm can I check server-sided if a player has a specific ddnet version  ?
19:38 <@deen> yes
19:38 < BeaR> how (: ?
19:38 <@deen> in CPlayer m_ClientVersion
19:38 < BeaR> ok, thx
19:38 <@deen> and there's a list of the new features and their corresponding versions in engine/shared/protocol.h
19:39 < BeaR> ah cool
20:00 < Savander> LLOOL?
20:00 < Savander> i found bug in zCatch TeeVision i guess
20:01 < Savander> ./ti 1345345 tgert
20:01 < Savander> it send message to "id"
20:01 < Savander> but don't know why it crashed serveR?
20:01 < Savander> too big number?
20:01 <@deen> probably too high id
20:01 < Savander> but its weird, when i type
20:02 <@deen> and they forgot to check
20:02 < Savander> ./ti 999999999 tger
20:02 < Savander> tthen it didn't work
20:02 < Savander> soo?
20:02 <@EastByte> what's /ti
20:02 <@deen> you just have to overwrite the right memory
20:02 < Savander> it's smth like
20:02 <@deen> to trigger a segfault?
20:02 < Savander> t./w or ./c
20:02 < Savander> on ddnet
20:02 < Savander> it send message to id
20:03 < Savander> hmm
20:03 <@deen> check the source code?
20:04 < Savander> i checeked
20:04 < Savander> checked..
20:04 < Savander> but my skills in c (or c) is really low
20:05 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/2WQJa0GU
20:06 <@EastByte> int i = str_toint(recipientStart);
20:06 <@EastByte> if(m_apPlayers[i])
20:06 <@EastByte> Savander: guess what's wrong
20:07 < Savander> so i should check if it's more than 16
20:07 < Savander> and if yes, return 0 
20:07 < Savander> or smth :p.
20:08 <@EastByte> the highest id is 15
20:08 < Savander> aahm
20:08 <@deen> and best use MAX_CLIENTS instead of a magic number
20:08 < Savander> ah, yes
20:08 < Savander> i forgot
20:09 <@deen> had to search for all 16s in the source code when doing the 64 player transition^^
20:09 < Savander> :]
20:10 < BeaR> good to know that atoi also allows input like "1223 help" (:
20:10 < Savander> ok, thanks
20:10 < Savander> fixed :)
20:10 < Savander> but on TeeVision
20:10 < Savander> it still works
20:10 < Savander> i should make pull
20:10 < Savander> or issue
20:10 <@deen> is it in the regular zcatch repo as wlel?
20:10 <@EastByte> I guess the source is full of stuff like that
20:10 <@deen> are ddnet zcatch servers affected?
20:10 <@EastByte> it's from teelevision
20:10 < Savander> no
20:11 < Savander> from teelevision
20:11 <@deen> ok, good
20:11 < Savander> okay bad
20:11 < Savander> i can't make issue
20:11 < Savander> https://github.com/Teelevision/zcatch
20:12 < Savander> because he don't support issues
20:45 < Savander> i heard once about top5 and max number
20:45 < Savander> 99999 or smth?
20:45 < Savander> in ddrace
20:46 <@deen> don't know anything about that
20:46 <@deen> should work fine with any number
20:49 < Savander> ah sorry
20:50 < Savander> It wasn't it
20:50 < Savander> http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50046
20:50 < Savander> nvm ;]
21:14 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
21:14 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 372
21:14 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
