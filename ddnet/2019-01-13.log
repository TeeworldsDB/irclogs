00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki gfx_resizable 0 helps?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it fixes it
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's only enabled on linux
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i really like resizing the window dynamically
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would still be nice if you could figure out why it goes wrong
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe the wm sends some different resolution during alt-tabbing
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> If i alt tab it takes atleast 1 second. And if i write while screen is frozen all letters come multipletimes and scrambled.
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Alexander dunno, the server mod seemed to be mostly named ddnet: e.g. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen no, that's just one more data source
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Alright
06:15 <+Testing_> test
06:15 <+Testing_> Anyone online?
06:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> if someone was wondering if my problem is fixed yet in newest client
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b>

13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so maps are broken too @n000b ?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Depends if it is turned on or off
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> One doesn't show all letters
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Other doesnt render maps well
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you have a compiler?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @n000b i just looked back in discord searching for the last time u said that:
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/533990283822759956/unknown.png
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you tried a nightly, probs posted by deen
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tbh i am not sure if deen was even setting the nightly build to the right git branch
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when you have time please try this client:
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heinrich5991/ddnet/build/1.0.1683/artifacts
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or if you have a compiler you can use this:
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/text-try
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dᴀɴʏ~> One question, how can I create a map? c:
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Roon> c:
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> strg+shift+e
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or press the editor button in the up right corner
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> corneum new school style xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :tee_thinking:
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/534017793197080616/unknown.png
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq is this 44
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stap using hax clients jao
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Jupstar ✪  hey, the link you send works if i enable gfx_opengl3
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not the map render rightr?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> map rendering looks good
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah wait
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> the characters rendering doesn't work
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait that all makes no sense xD
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that makes sense xD
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well to understand why i am confused:
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> opengl 2.0 doesnt allow the character rendering
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 3.3 does allow it, but they are both the same thing
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's why i want to try some GL version to see, if your driver only fails for a few versions
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. 3.2 might work, but you can't compile it, so i need to ask deen to change it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well to understand why i am confused:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> opengl 2.0 doesnt allow the character rendering
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 3.3 does allow it, but they are both the same thing(at least in this case)
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Roon you know where to find the editor?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> nvm lol
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> well yeah
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i don't know how many people got this problem like i have so. but if you want me to test more just ping me
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok 😃
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> if it is not to difficult ^^
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen 
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you replace the 3 lines 2394+ in backend_sdl.cpp in the branch text-try with
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_COMPATIBILITY);
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 3);
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 2);
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Jupstar ✪ by the way, the version of 11.1.3 isn't as stable as 10.8.6 so i downgraded again. I had a few crashes when joining the server and 1 map or server manipulated my ping really bad.
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just for testing, 11.1.3 is outdated anyway
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Roon> SOMEBODY THAT I HAPPEN THE .MAP OF THE BLMAP4 FOR MY SERVER? XD
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> ddnet server output after clean build https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YXVXWM97yb/
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> any idea?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe no perms to remove
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> nope perms are normal
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mir> on my home directory
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ and then, run it on my pc? i don't think i have the graphics problem, do i?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen send it to me after that?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b for windows?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just use the ci builds
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Too late, building already 😄
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I merged master into text-try and made the change, hope that's fine
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Tbh I don't have high hopes that this will change, but if. I well write a patch that allows setting gl versions manually
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b there you go: https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-builds/
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Will try it tomorrow evening i guess
