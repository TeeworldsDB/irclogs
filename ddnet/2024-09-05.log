02:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs/twgame
02:43 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And the ddnet repo has basic integration tests that make sure that a tee gets a finish time when spawning and being pushed by speedups into the finish line
04:19 < bridge_> <triki> how turn off hot reload?
04:20 < bridge_> <triki> while saveing
05:24 < bridge_> <kekomonter> Looks strange, but cool xd
05:31 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> is there a way to debug shader
07:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> npo i prefer to use my time coding the emulator
08:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 im thinking about changing variable declaration syntax
08:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> because I tried to move checking if variable exists from parser and I fucked by `ident * ident` again
08:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> because I tried to move checking if variable exists from parser and I got fucked by `ident * ident` again
08:55 < bridge_> <learath2> What expression are you having an issue parsing?
08:55 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> `a * b` vs `Type* ptr`
08:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> without type table(which I don't use), I can't know whether it's a type or multiplication
08:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i wanted to allow using structs which are declared after a function it's used in
09:37 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think changing the syntax fixes this
09:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah maybe it could work
09:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Something like
09:38 < bridge_> <learath2> `let x: i8 = 10`
09:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> If you have `let a: Type = 5;`
09:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Yea
09:38 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Then you know what's the type and what's the variable name
09:39 < bridge_> <learath2> ITT @learath2 and @milkeeycat keep discovering why modern languages look the way they do and not like C
09:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Do you like rust syntax or you have better ideas? :Dd
09:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Do you like rust syntax or you have better ideas? :DD
09:50 < bridge_> <learath2> You can use a different symbol for dereference 🙃
09:50 < bridge_> <learath2> I think the rust syntax is fine
09:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @ :justatest:
09:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Like, AT that location xd
10:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yes @ is way better than & or \*
10:05 < bridge_> <kekomonter> Maybe "RenderDoc"
10:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 thoughts on variable immutability by default
10:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 thoughts on variable immutability by default?
10:57 < bridge_> <furo> There will be an option for it in the next nightly in the editor settings tab.
11:08 < bridge_> <learath2> Eh, imo no point, it makes sense for rust because  there can only be one mutable reference
11:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my riscv emu now can run a fib program
11:24 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> true, borrow checkers for people who don't know what they're doing, I certainly do :clueless:
11:24 < bridge_> <learath2> Exactly, be brave
11:25 < bridge_> <learath2> Perhaps implement a proper `const` for your language
11:26 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> first I'll have to know how it works xd
11:50 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> elp, what syntax would make sense for `int arr[] = {12,3,4};` in rusty version, in internet i found you can omit the type and it infer it automagically(about rust)
11:50 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> elp, what syntax would make sense for C's `int arr[] = {12,3,4};` in rusty version, in internet i found you can omit the type and it infer it automagically(about rust)
11:51 < bridge_> <learath2> `let arr: int[] = [12, 3, 4]'`?
11:51 < bridge_> <learath2> `let arr: int[] = [12, 3, 4]`?
11:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ok, I didn't use my noodle at all :\ Here's new goal btw
11:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1281190357744484446/image.png?ex=66dad100&is=66d97f80&hm=21cd0454d694cb1b844d365a49cf0f2a737c16f8b6df8c453f5cabc3fa3b8962&
11:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Btw, maybe it's easier to just go with the C way, just `{}` for all initializer lists. Special casing arrays to use `[]` seems like a pointless exercise
11:56 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> should the `*` be before the type name or after :thonk:
12:05 < bridge_> <zhn> nop :troll:
12:15 < bridge_> <learath2> idk up to you, I'm more used to after but again it's your language 😄
12:16 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1281196227555229797/image.png?ex=66dad678&is=66d984f8&hm=99677cb037cc0a0293177c45a4cc6c3815f00ccb64af4b628f865510676189ef&
12:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Your language is turning out like a rustish version of go
12:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's turning out like a bunch of stuff I can think of in one lang xd
12:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but I'll ask your opinion about the thing first xddd
12:34 < bridge_> <0xdeen> The modern version of rolling dice? 😄
12:35 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> that's what chat gpt was made for
13:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I'll also yoink `->` after `()` in function because `let foo: fn(u8): u32 = ...;` looks bad xd
14:11 < bridge_> <learath2> It makes more and more sense 😄
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hello frens
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> today was a weird day
15:34 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Why
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i won a argument in rust reddit defending cpp having 1 feature rust doesnt
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1281246113688588350/image.png?ex=66db04ed&is=66d9b36d&hm=ca796f5d5ffd12dcbd5123ccf55c2fce248ce0b15eca93b801ea255973e2d148&
15:34 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> LMAO
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know i won cuz the guy deleted his comments xdd

15:36 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Catto you are lucky Heinrich is in a coma
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> heinrich agrees iirc
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he mentioned it too iirc
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but im happy if heinrich proves rust has placement new, cuz then it means rust has it
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and im rust maximalist
15:37 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But he would not approve posting gifs I mean
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah ok
15:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> he definitely would
15:37 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> he's just not here to say it
15:37 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Where is that guy
15:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think milkeey is whitelisted for GIFs
15:37 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Woah
15:38 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Am I whitelisted for Russian then?
15:38 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> priviet ruski jest?
15:38 < bridge_> <learath2> What has the world come to? Ryozooki defending C++
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my rysk emulator can run a fib function
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im proud
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> soon a entire os, aka xv6
15:38 < bridge_> <meloƞ> he is kept hostage
15:38 < bridge_> <meloƞ> #freeryo
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im a defender of reason, it just happens that rust is better 99% of time
15:39 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Also I assume Heinrich is on vacation
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tbh llvm probs optimizes the moves but its not a guarantee
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in rust case
15:39 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Vacation from ddnet :justatest:
15:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Is there no unsafe placement new of sorts?
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nope
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the box keyword
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its nightly whitelisted keyword only for std internals
15:40 < bridge_> <edrub> i looooove reddit
15:40 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I would have assumed you to be a 4chan enjoyer keb
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe it doesnt even exist anymore the box
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27779
15:41 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> no
15:53 < bridge_> <jxsl13> "reddit"
15:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 changing the syntax made parsing so much easier xd
15:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Probably why tooling for modern languages are so much faster. Context free languages are trivial to parse
16:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yep, and it will also solve my tree sitter problems
16:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> :poggers2:
16:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but i have to rewrite rules :pepeW:
16:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ryo wats slower? emerge or brew?
16:25 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Eh no portage is what it is called
16:26 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I run brew upgrade like 4 times a year and it always takes forever apt just feels so much faster

17:06 < bridge_> <shibastik> How it working?
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #questions
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or even better:
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1277345584080097320
17:08 < bridge_> <shibastik> I'm asking how to do this
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You can ask in the right channel
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> this is #developer
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you develop something, tell exactly what you develop
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do you ask how that server side bot works?
17:09 < bridge_> <shibastik> Yes
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then don't ask on ddnet generally
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> see rule #7
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ask chillerdragon in PM
17:10 < bridge_> <shibastik> Ok ty
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what video was that?
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ 
17:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller some on your block servers
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since when are server side bots against the rules?
17:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems perfectly on topic for #developer
17:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> #7
17:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats client side 
17:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you can keep that discussion in your servers
17:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
17:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @shibastik the code and even the downloadable executable is here https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP if you want more details come to https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/ 
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> You ignored me once when i asked whats going on @Jupstar ✪ we trash talk here all day and suddenly you are being super rude to all ppl that join 
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deleting a question about legit ddnet based development is a bit intense don't you think?
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you are aware that i dont have any rights on this server i hope
17:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 😏
17:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1281274059954323476/image.png?ex=66db1ef4&is=66d9cd74&hm=99dd84ae8d5ad3873d90133e6473569c926e45237dd432173087eb0e61070641&
17:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ yea thats what i thought but you responded and someone deleted it
17:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least you seem to agree so my question still stands
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and how is that my fault
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i kindly asked him to keep this dicussion somewhere else
17:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why?
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> because if one person is allowed to discuss it all are
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and then the ppl with flawed arguments come here all day
17:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes and all should be
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wdym what ppl what flawed arguments
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as for why i try to keep russian speaking ppl out here:
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> very simply, i get a ntf on dev channel and can't read it
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not rude, simply bcs this chat isn't for russian
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay fair 
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about the questions and the bots?
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> those ppl that argue with bad intentions
17:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with arguments that might logically make sense, but clearly have a bad intention
17:28 < bridge_> <shibastik> How do I write my first script for my server? What do I need to learn for this?
17:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C++
17:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB_aSIOmdu4&list=PLhJkqAQmOh5LyYOfnMy4PJB6CSZltQyTc
17:28 < bridge_> <shibastik> Tty
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: about the questions: i generally have nothing against it, but other ppl from the community also answer in #questions but not here
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's simply better do keep in where it makes sense
17:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> often these questions are newbie questions anyway
17:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i also often answer them directly
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ans say next time ask in questions
17:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> except when i dunno the answer
17:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so next up you will send all the devs saying "norming :coffee:" to #off-topic because you get notifications o.O ?
17:30 < bridge_> <AssassinTee> yes it is, I already did this with ctf maps by using an automapper, painting methods inside a 512x512 solid gametile canvas and a minimal spanning tree connecting points of interests, for race this will be harder and also for ddnet maps, others already genereate gores maps
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think you dont get my point
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> newbie questions will often not be answered here
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so they get lost
17:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> part of your point are notifications no?
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> since the discussions here are more about trump than about teeworlds
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
17:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well the ntfy was about russian perticually
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like a two class society
17:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
17:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> give me 50% of your money
17:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then we have 1 class society
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> developer insiders that can post off topic gifs ping you with pointless content such as "monring" and can discuss their latest TAS bots
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and non developer normies who cant write at all
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but what kind of discussion is a question:
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how can i make an aimbot?
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that is no discussion
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that is simply a request for a cheat
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just bcs it's server side, what does that change?
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its legitness
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chiller
17:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> pls
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i see how the same stuff can be applied client side
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if he knows c++ on a high level, contributed to ddnet and has a question about smth in that direction, i'd say that it's more about the question
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i dunno this dude
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the intentions are good server side and its not illegal it does not cause unfair gameplay advantage on the server side
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he plays on mobile
17:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of discussion should this create
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol the mobile shots
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with that i meant, he most likkely isn't a coder
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not that mobile playing is bad
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mobile coder
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if he is not a coder he also wont code a bot
17:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then he also doesnt need to talk about them here
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe he just wants to run a ddnet++ server
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> fine
17:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i assume you have a README
17:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: i have a question. Do you know these moments where you want to fix a small bug, and then rewrite 50% of your code base xd
