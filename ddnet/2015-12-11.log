04:13 <+o_be_two> oops unscheduled maintenance on ger2, back in 5 minutes, sorry for this inconvenience ..
04:15 <+o_be_two> back
04:30 <@deen> o_be_two: well, ger2 is not running anyway. as EastByte and I said, you can't even see it in serverbrowser unless you connected to it over ssh
04:31 <+o_be_two> what ?
04:31 <+o_be_two> curious, is it a problem from my side ?
04:32 <+o_be_two> there's no rule in firewall, weird that its blocked in server browser
04:33 <+o_be_two> no game firewall too, no arbor profile
04:36 <@deen> 19:59 <@EastByte> o_be_two: WolfAlex told me you need to set the gamefilter  rules on the tw ports to the rule 'other'
04:37 <+o_be_two> sure i can do this, but its not the reason on why the server is not shown in serverbrowser until you ssh
04:48 <+o_be_two> found loss time on ddnet canada vps, let's see if it happend again
04:58 <+o_be_two> so cool ! http://ddnet.tw/www.ddnet.tw.png
04:59 <@deen> haha
05:46 <+o_be_two> lol ... 4.5go for 2015-08-25_23-25_blmapV3ROYAL.logs
05:46 <+o_be_two> no problem, no issue x) ...
05:46 <+o_be_two> just "[null 9]" in the file, so curious
06:15 <@deen> heinrich5991: oh damn, there's a limit to how often you can submit answers, then it takes longer. now i have to wait 5 min
06:26 <@deen> and that was another one that would have been faster by hand^^
14:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: I decided to sleep instead, was too tired :/
14:33 <@heinrich5991> haven't looked at the problem yet. should I try to solve it by hand and measure the time? ^^
14:34 <@deen> heinrich5991: sure
14:34 <@deen> heinrich5991: if you start with a good random seed, like i did, it should be possible in 3 min by hand
14:34 <@deen> but i wanted to program, not solve puzzles by hand =/
14:40 <@heinrich5991> ok, third time wrong answer, I give up :D
14:41 <@heinrich5991> cqkkaabc
14:41 <@heinrich5991> was my try
14:41 <@heinrich5991> ah fuck
14:41 <@heinrich5991> cqkaabcc
14:42 <@heinrich5991> probably
14:42 <@heinrich5991> ok, neither that solution
14:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: I'm bad at doing this by hand :)
14:44 <@deen> ^^
17:05 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: "GAME restriction will be activated. UDP traffic will be authorised on defined rules only."
17:05 < WolfAlex> this is why you need the other rule OR disabled GAME-Firewall
21:32 < laxa> ddnet's TS3 has been updated
21:32 < laxa> all client needs to have 3.0.18.2 to be able to connect
21:32 < laxa> (this is for security reason)
21:32 < laxa> just so you know if someone is saying anything
21:33 <@deen> laxa: no one knows how to contact me, so no one will say anything :P
23:03 <+o_be_two> hello
23:29 < Learath2> o/
