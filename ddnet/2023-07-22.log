00:18 < chillerbot> <@&252523225810993153> send help to chiler by clickin on this link ddnet://176.9.114.238:8348
00:22 < bridge_> <murpi> Chillerdragon: don't do that please
00:29 < ChillerDragon> what=
00:29 < ChillerDragon> can you please finally send some?
00:29 < ChillerDragon> Kei and Dropix spawnblock the whole server
00:29 < ChillerDragon> and i shouldnt call mods?
00:29 < ChillerDragon> @murpi fr?
00:32 < bridge_> <murpi> login into your discord account and create a ticket like everybody else
00:33 < ChillerDragon> ticket?
00:33 < ChillerDragon> since when
00:33 < ChillerDragon> is this kog?
00:33 < ChillerDragon> also what is @mods for if not to ping mods?
00:34 < ChillerDragon> @murpi you are kidding right?
00:34 < bridge_> <murpi> We disabled `@moderator` mentions on the entire server
00:34 < bridge_> <murpi> No, im not kidding
00:34 < ChillerDragon> i didnt get the memo
00:35 < bridge_> <murpi> that's why im telling you know ^^
00:35 < ChillerDragon> i dont have discord
00:35 < bridge_> <murpi> now*
00:35 < ChillerDragon> and i do need help in game
00:35 < bridge_> <murpi> I thought heinrich set one up for you
00:36 < ChillerDragon> oh yea true
00:36 < ChillerDragon> i technically have discord
00:36 < bridge_> <murpi> liar liar pants on fire
00:36 < ChillerDragon> before i use that account i risk a lifeban on irc
00:36 < ChillerDragon> im not using discord to request help
00:40 < ChillerDragon> This is unbelivable im doing a serious report and you talk about discord tickets 
00:40 < ChillerDragon> meanwhile a 60 player server is trapped on spawn
00:41 < bridge_> <murpi> lets make a deal, i'll come and check and if the report is legit then i'll allow the pings
00:42 < bridge_> <murpi> if not, you'll start using discord to report like all the other people
00:42 < ChillerDragon> good night
00:46 < bridge_> <murpi> people seem to be racing just fine
00:47 < bridge_> <murpi> someone did unintentionally block apperantly, but people managed to solve it themselfs
00:47 < ChillerDragon> do you need a demo?
00:47 < ChillerDragon> Kei and Dropix were building towers for 10mins to block the unfreeze
00:48 < ChillerDragon> then sp someone solo blocked the whole server and got vote kicked a bunch of times
00:48 < bridge_> <murpi> No, people already confirmed that someone was blocking
00:48 < ChillerDragon> i am really pissed tbh that you consider me doing a "not legit" report
00:48 < bridge_> <murpi> I didn't say that your report isn't legit
00:49 < ChillerDragon> you hinted it
00:49 < bridge_> <murpi> No I didn't
00:50 < bridge_> <murpi> I even told you the reason why you shouldn't ping moderators via IRC
00:50 < ChillerDragon> > lets make a deal, i'll come and check and if the report is legit then i'll allow the pings
00:50 < ChillerDragon> that is you having to "check" if my "report is legit"
00:50 < bridge_> <murpi> That has nothing to do with me telling you not to ping moderators
00:51 < ChillerDragon> Yes 
00:51 < ChillerDragon> That is you having to check if my report is legit
00:52 < bridge_> <murpi> No, thats me having to step out of bed for your report since no one else did
00:52 < ChillerDragon> Thanks
00:52 < ChillerDragon> thats not what i got from that
00:54 < ChillerDragon> sorry you got out of bed but after 20minutes of getting spawn blocked i already rage quitted
01:24 < bridge_> <murpi> sorry you had to deal with sp someone past midnight 😄
01:25 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Honestly sp was the least of my problems. The way Kei did it was way more annoying. And you telling to use discord gave me the rest
01:26 < bridge_> <murpi> Whats stopping you from using discord anyway?
01:26 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I hate it to the core
01:26 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> There should be a foss way to call for mods
01:27 < bridge_> <murpi> they give you the option to not having to download a client to use it
01:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> So?
01:27 < bridge_> <murpi> whats the difference between irc and discord?
01:27 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I am already compromising by using the bridge
01:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> irc allows custom clients
01:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> irc does not randomly ban you and force phone number on you
01:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> irc is free and open source
01:28 < bridge_> <murpi> Aha, so you're holding a grudge against discord for randomly banning you? 😛
01:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ofc
01:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But they banned me after I left
01:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s just some nice example on how fucked it is
01:30 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Do I really have to argue why ddnet needs a foss way of calling for help?
01:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Also besides the ideological reasons it’s not very practical
01:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I can do !mods in seconds. While joining discord takes on average 5min plus or is not possible at all
01:46 < bridge_> <murpi> chillerdragon we have to disable the mentions on the bridge eventually at some point
01:47 < bridge_> <murpi> since this can be done by anyone, anytime
01:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yea that makes sense but if you do please allow contacting mods via something other than discord
01:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Or give me rcon back and I kick the spawnblockers my self
01:51 < bridge_> <Iza> You should’ve bought nitro
01:52 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> hiii
01:53 < bridge_> <murpi> chillerdragon Have you been removed from staff due to abooz?
01:53 < bridge_> <Iza> https://tenor.com/view/suit-slideshow-man-in-suit-sitting-man-wearing-suit-sitting-slideshow-man-wearing-suit-meme-gif-25275395
01:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> No
01:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I was removed from staff because I was using to little
01:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Not representing a proper staff by not enforcing all rules
01:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I just used when I really had to
01:56 < bridge_> <murpi> An rcon for you would be an option then, i'll let you know
01:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I haven’t changed and will not change any time soon
01:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I refuse to enforce all rules ddnet has
01:57 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I prefer only using rcon against people who actively try to interrupt the game for others
02:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?p=66598&hilit=moderator#p66598
02:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It’s not like I held that back in my application
02:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But still it seemed to have taken some by surprise
02:01 < bridge_> <murpi> > My plan is to ban some spawnblockers like jao.
02:01 < bridge_> <murpi> :justatest:?
02:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It was a 2018 joke
02:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> jao was one of the most active spawn blockers back then
02:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> not to be confused with the vanilla legend jao who uses the same name
04:10 < bridge_> <louis.place> send rcon
04:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> xd
05:27 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> 🔥
08:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> that me
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> dont we have 20 issues for that already lmao
10:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> IDK
10:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> what u want from me
10:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'm not a guy that knows stuff
10:17 < bridge_> <learath2> I like the idea of a foss way to report, but not sure if it's worth spending the very little dev time we have on it
10:31 < bridge_> <Iza> A long time ago, I once suggested to re-add a /report command ingame, but only users who have linked their ddnet client with their discord account are able to use that command
10:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Won't help memerdragon
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 it now uses a virtual list, no pages https://ddstats.org/
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i havent tested on mobile
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh and need to fix the g o up button xd
11:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nais
11:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> wdym virtual list
11:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> and can u still paginate xd
11:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> go to top don't work
11:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> .
11:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ?
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also visually, if u didnt notice yet
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1132239025198071880/image.png
11:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> sry didn't see
11:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean it's  a really long list, maybe u still want to paginate
11:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do u see a scroll?
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> some forums have this as an option
11:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i made the browser smaller 😄
11:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> man, i did this before, but heinrich said me several times he wanted no paginatio nXD
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> xddd
11:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah z index
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> i like the execution but honestly having info mapped out in a list like this seems odd... def should have it in a table like the ingame server browser
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> much more dense info
11:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> but modern UX doesn't favor tables like that for whatever reason
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wont do tables
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> each server is its own
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not convinced about the virtual list
11:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk things
11:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> every time i think i know something i stop knowing it
11:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no virtual list for now
11:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and button works now
11:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also didnt know how to do the button up with virt list
11:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> im not on the same page with ur virtual list thing
12:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> whats so bad about virtual list?
12:44 < ChillerDragon> country flags were squeezed on ma phon
12:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: yo hi wazzup, long time no hear

12:50 < ChillerDragon> and rewrite mc in rust
12:50 < ChillerDragon> oh yes pls tw in java
12:50 < ChillerDragon> so we get speeds of the blazing jvm
12:51 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> best i can do is 3D teeworlds unity
13:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> no idk what it is
13:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> just items being added/removed as they’re scrolled to/from?
13:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm this feels like the perfect place for a table ngl 😄
13:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s what I said
13:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> :puuuuffff:
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill trhink about it
13:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> u can make tables look good u know
13:25 < bridge_> <learath2> Doesn't have to be an ugly html table btw, you can do cutting edge css grid too 😄
13:25 < bridge_> <learath2> But in general I like it, cool project
14:01 < bridge_> <teero777> (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
14:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
14:02 < bridge_> <teero777> # (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
14:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah so its faster, bcs browser doesnt need to prepare all items at once
14:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Can you generate a current version of this? i'd like to see how much stuff changed in ~1 year 😄
14:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thanks xd
14:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i fixed the z-index and the image and pagination on mobile
14:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also now 1 page shows 100 servers instead of 10
17:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1132333948408709161/image_from_ios.jpg
17:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can someone merge #6900 so Marmare can continue working on #6885?
17:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6900
17:31 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6885
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i look into it
20:22 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> 6900 funny number
20:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> road to 6969
20:56 < bridge_> <japado38> soo i need help
20:57 < bridge_> <japado38> someone say to me use "unbindall"
20:57 < bridge_> <japado38> now i can't do nothing in the game
21:02 < ChillerDragon> get troled xd
21:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> since you should be able to still configure ddnet with your mouse, you firstly got mad trolled (better than the alt+f4 joke), but go into your settings and sadly.. rebind every key, or dump it all and reinstall lol
21:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol got rekt
21:03 < ChillerDragon> i guess moving settings_ddnet.cfg to backup.cfg resets them
21:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> joke joke
21:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its the new killall; name from sp someone?
21:03 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
21:03 < bridge_> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> Have you closed the game since running that command? If you haven't, you can do `cl_save_settings 0` and restart the game :)
21:03 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lmao
21:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> which someone? sp someone?
21:04 < ChillerDragon> some people someone
21:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> love that guy
21:05 < ChillerDragon> me too
21:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> hes a raging 12 year old
21:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> LOL
21:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> he’s quite old
21:05 < ChillerDragon> he is a misunderstood genius
21:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> ^
21:07 < bridge_> <japado38> i closed the game
21:07 < ChillerDragon> F
21:07 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> F
21:07 < ChillerDragon> goto file explorer
21:08 < ChillerDragon> type in %APPDATA%
21:08 < bridge_> <japado38> i wanted a bind to hammerfly and someone tell me to use that
21:08 < ChillerDragon> goto Teeworlds or ddnet folder
21:08 < ChillerDragon> then rename your settings_ddnet.cfg to backup.cfg
21:08 < ChillerDragon> the client will egenrate default settings on next boot
21:09 < bridge_> <japado38> how?
21:09 < ChillerDragon> which step are you stuck at?
21:10 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690053067.png
21:11 < bridge_> <japado38> here
21:11 < ChillerDragon> ?
21:11 < bridge_> <japado38> i not understand what i need do
21:11 < bridge_> <japado38> i don't understand what i need do
21:11 < ChillerDragon> did you manage to open file explorer?
21:12 < bridge_> <japado38> yes
21:12 < bridge_> <japado38> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1132389703149170759/image.png
21:12 < ChillerDragon> looks promising
21:12 < ChillerDragon> at the bottom
21:12 < ChillerDragon> it says settings_ddnet.cfg
21:12 < ChillerDragon> rightlick
21:12 < ChillerDragon> rename
21:12 < ChillerDragon> to backup.cfg
21:12 < ChillerDragon> then open ddnet again
21:13 < bridge_> <japado38> ok
21:14 < ChillerDragon> did it work?
21:15 < bridge_> <japado38> it's work
21:15 < bridge_> <japado38> ty so much
21:15 < ChillerDragon> :)
21:16 < bridge_> <japado38> :>

21:28 < bridge_> <japado38> someone have a bind to change body color
21:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> i do
21:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> unbindall
21:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> general interest in binds can be found at www.wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Binds
21:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 
21:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> for body color you can use player_color_body or player_color_feet
21:31 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> VOXEL
21:31 < bridge_> <japado38> ...
21:31 < bridge_> <japado38> ty
22:12 < bridge_> <murpi> why do we even have unbindall? ^^
22:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> troubleshoot
22:22 < bridge_> <japado38> soo...
22:23 < bridge_> <japado38> I need help on one more thing,I changed the jump button from space to W, how can I get back to normal?
22:27 < bridge_> <murpi> There is a control menu in the game, change it there.
22:27 < bridge_> <murpi> There is a controls menu in the game, change it there.
22:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> to unbind all
22:50 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @ryozuki whats the way to have a "" in a "" in a bind
22:50 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> u said it before but i forgot what it was
22:50 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use \
22:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> \
22:51 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> where
22:52 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> \ alone? left or right of "?
22:52 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> bind x "command 1" \ "command 2" \
22:53 < bridge_> <Iza> @chillerdragon i think you have a fan

22:53 < bridge_> <Iza> how am i even supposed to ping a bot
22:53 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh wait nvm "command 1 \ "command 2"" (closing off the first command with another " at the end, not before the first \
22:54 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wait is it possible to have 3
22:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> atleast that bugged it out for me once so i did it that way
22:54 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> using deep fly cfg as an example: bind x "bind mouse1 \"+fire; +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0\";cl_message_client_color green; echo Deep Fly ON; bind x \"bind mouse1 +fire; cl_dummy_hammer 0; cl_message_client_color red; echo Deep Fly; exec deepfly.cfg\""
22:55 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ignoring the ;, these are just for the cfg file iirc
22:59 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you are using it in a cfg file or ingame?
22:59 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i am confusion rn
23:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ok thx i made my own 1 cfg df bind
23:24 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> lmao
