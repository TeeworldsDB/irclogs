06:18 < bridge> <Ewan> spreadsheet deserializing lib
06:20 < bridge> <zhn> sounds like office routine that was rated as 2 hour task but in reality will take 1 week due to some really fhnny circumstances
06:28 < bridge> <Ewan> that is what it has turned into
06:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a dilemma
06:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think there's a way for me to deserialize directly into my struct for every field i need
06:30 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs the in memory copy would have some more structs nested within it but serde flattening doesn't handle duplicates of the same key like would happen with any 2 flattened fields of the same type
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> so i think i need to keep an intermediate struct and then maybe skip some fields & populate manually
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but the person writing these spreadsheets is old so ive basically been told i can't rely on any set scheme for these xd
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they want dynamic spreadsheet deserialization scheme switching from configs
06:31 < bridge> <Ewan> like pls im a rust noob
07:31 < bridge> <zhn> you can specify de/ser and make it dynamic, i think
07:32 < bridge> <zhn> check serde documentation, i don't really know what you need to do xd
22:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is it just me or my crosshair is transparent? xd
