00:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> chillerdragon, you getting weird emails lately?
00:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> moderate your discord ._.
00:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> for even more mails
05:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did not get any mail. What did you get?
05:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt like moderation or discord. So I am not planning to do so.
05:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
05:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oldest anarchy server in discord!!!
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> how out of touch are u xD
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> have u never played w homebrew stuff
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> a friend of mine ported Cave Story to the DS
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> 2d game but some of the original code is so bad it‚Äôs more about optimizing for cpu
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> iirc unmodified organya alone (the music system it uses) will take essentially the entire cpu with decoding and playback
09:03 < bridge> <Ewan> also hard to get working with the audio hardware

17:22 < bridge> <learath2> I figured out something very nice about my ipad. If you have macOS you can just move your mouse from your computer screen to your ipad seemlessly
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> it's really so hard to beat the ecosystem apple has created it'd take me hours if not weeks of work to make the same work with just an android tablet
17:23 < bridge> <reitw> tbh that feature is mostly useless
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> For your workflow maybe, it's quite nice when I'm doing my kanji for the day
17:24 < bridge> <reitw> I really liked samsung's tablets, would have been better than ipad if it had procreate
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> and I can then turn it into an extra display afterwards where I can have documentation open
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> Samsungs new tablets are pretty good, but I wouldn't even want to think about the process of making it work as a second display for a linux laptop
17:25 < bridge> <reitw> apparently you can with vnc
17:26 < bridge> <reitw> but samsung is mostly working with microsoft
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> I did it once with my phone. Let me tell you, it's not a pleasant experience to set it all up
17:26 < bridge> <reitw> having a second display on windows works out of the box
17:34 < bridge> <headshotnoby> not fully, can't move yet
18:55 < bridge> <furo321> Something like this? <https://ddnet.org/skins/skin/skins.json>
19:35 < bridge> <louis> ye apple integration is so easy
19:35 < bridge> <louis> too bad it requires u to own every idevice

22:02 < bridge> <teero777> hehe do you aim with the pencil thing? xDDD
22:26 < bridge> <teero777> anyone have the link to heinrichs map archive?
22:26 < bridge> <teero777> quick!
22:28 < bridge> <syrinok> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/web/
23:07 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i lost my dsi's stylus (the pencil thing) so i can only use my finger, but you just tap the screen to move the aim
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> xddd
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> nice
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.> Hi, i have questions i want to simulate win in bots for my map, i'm in js and what i use, 
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.> ```js
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         let x = time * 1000;
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         let s = String(x);
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         console.log('test1')
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         var packer = new MsgPacker_1.MsgPacker(NETMSGTYPE.SV_DDRACETIMELEGACY, false, 1);
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         packer.AddString(`${s}`);
23:36 < bridge> <neiky.>         this.send(packer);
23:37 < bridge> <neiky.>         console.log('test2')```
23:37 < bridge> <neiky.> But the bot don't have time ?
23:37 < bridge> <neiky.> I also tried AddInt(x)
23:59 < bridge> <furo321> I'm not sure what you mean. You trying to set the time for a player? You can't do that from the client, it's handled by the server.
