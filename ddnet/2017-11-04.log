17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> is there any reason why you cant load a GER save on a RUS server?
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> prevents cheating
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> how could you cheat with that?
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> People cheated
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> they loaded on few servers in the same time. especially when mirroring failed
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then you could do it
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> dublicate a save by loading it simultaniously on both servers or so
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> database mirroring failed*
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> duplicate a save by loading it simultaniously on both servers or so
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's not the database mirroring that failed but the mirroring being slow
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we'd need a way to remove the save without delay and also lock the save while the loading is taking place to ensure noone else starts a load on another server
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was shorthand
