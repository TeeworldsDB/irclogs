00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone here who is good with iptables? Somehow I fail to even do a simple rate-limit on udp on specific packets... (not by ip)
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> http://prntscr.com/u47oud
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> updated the client, rip now
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> help
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen 
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```sudo iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 -j newchain
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sudo iptables -t mangle -N newchain
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sudo iptables -t mangle -A newchain -p udp -m limit --limit 50/s --limit-burst 100 -j ACCEPT
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sudo iptables -t mangle -A newchain -p udp -j DROP``` 
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> except instead of -s 1.2.3.4 u choose whatever way u wanna  match packets?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @Virus2k help with what
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you are started ddnet-server instead ddnet client
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you started ddnet-server instead ddnet client
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> i see i see
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> thought its the "new" exe
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> since i dont have one anymore after the update
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> it just killed my whole client somehow
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> can someone give me the starting exe?
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just download it again
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> wew
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> just give exe
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does anyone know why my server has "trouble" with 0.6 masters? i mean, it works, it registeres, but these messages are quite spammy...
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746878772455800949/unknown.png
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @noby @deen  instead of -j ACCEPT there's also a suggestion to use -j RETURN, which will just exit the created chain and continue to check with the next rules
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Is something wrong with the "synchronized" button, when used on a local server?
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Cuz i cannot seem to make it work on any version.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby why would you ever use the mangle table for filtering?
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it is called first before input
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I havn't benched it so I won't be too assertive but I highly doubt that makes a significant difference
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> even if it makes only a 1% difference
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theres no reason to not do it this way right?
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and specifically its because  mangle table has prerouting chain
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and input doesnt
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't bother with an extra chain either for a single rule in it
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746982010358333470/FW-IDS-iptables-Flowchart-v2019-04-30-1.png
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> prerouing comes first
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one side effect to it that you might not think about. The packet is not routed yet so it might be just passing through and you'd ratelimit that too. But it would indeed work
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> passing through to where exactly
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Virus2k @ReiTW thanks
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. you might have a tunnel running
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or this could be a load balancer, where all the packets are just passing through
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i see
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but on a server where the only thing running is teeworlds it shouldnt matter right
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I take it back, cloudflare did bench it, it comes with a near 120% improvement
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didnt think routing and passing between chains had that much overhead
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 😄
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh, so one should use prerouting mangle table?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen dunno if you read it yesterday, but if you got the laptop again from ur gf, and can try the new pr, it should even fallback with a fresh config(hopefully)
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and render images correctly xd
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's on my todo, but I don't have the pw, so have to wait for her to wake up 😄
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alright 😄
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone having experiences with SSH's ConnectTimeout not working reliably? Seems to sometimes not time out at all
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> should auto switch weapon on pickup be enabled by default?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> everyone has to enable it at some point
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby do you have a minute?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hm
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need an example connect packet
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> from what version
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i will send ddnet connect sequence pcap in dm
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Lady Saavik I thought about that too. But it can be super-annoying when a part has shields and then gives you weapon, right?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but for newcomers it's definitely more intuitive
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I don't understand what part? shields and weapon next to each other so it gets noisy?
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> personally I never had it on, so I don't know
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> everyone uses this setting + almost always you have to use the weapon right after picking it up, so why additional step (mousewheel/numbers) needed
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can just press 4 and then when you pick up a grenade launcher, it is autoswitched too
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, and the cl_autoswitch_weapons is not immediate, while pressing the number before picking up is
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because it sets the preferred weapon on server
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Lady Saavik not everyone uses that setting, I don't e.g.
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I prefer selecting the weapon I want to use. by pressing 1-5 it also works before you have the weapon
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I didn't know
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I guess newcomers don't know this at all, so it might still make sense to change the default. I had to explain mouse wheel to quite a few
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> keys are easier than mousewheel
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats a setting for vanilla not ddrace
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> im used to it too from vanilla
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> > I prefer selecting the weapon I want to use. by pressing 1-5 it also works before you have the weapon
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @heinrich5991 but you still have to use the weapon you just took
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> talking about ddrace ofc
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Lady Saavik yes, but I prefer that to the weapon I currently have changing
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when I accidentally pick up a new weapon
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yea I often change back to hammer too
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> but on brutal and insane there are even parts that rather requires it
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, apparently we should change it (#announcements) but it really irks me when people say "everyone does it"
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's almost never true
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> even on a mod or was it even novice map? there is a part like:
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> 
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> shields
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> rocket
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> shields
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> rocket
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> shields
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> 
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> and you have to go up and just shoot the wall
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> we should have one settings for all so it's equal xd
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it work with "switch weapon on pickup"?
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think "switch weapon on pickup" is client-side
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> indeed
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 maybe that would be the best fix, to make it a setting that is sent to the server. Setting the wanted weapon to -1 to indicate always switch to picked up weapon?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good, needs a way to know about server support though
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm yeah. Do you want to look into it?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does steam support only shipping a percentage of ppl a new version?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think so and I don't want to do that
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you have a huge game they might not update everyone at once
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Why exactly does ddnet not have a update button in the server explorer?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Why exactly does ddnet not have an update button in the server explorer?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fin are you using the steam version? Steam version can only be updated in Steam
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well for testing purposses its quite nice
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you start with 10%, look if theses 10% have any bugs and can revert it
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without destroying everyones experience
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> No @deen I use plain old binary in a directory.
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> @Jupstar ✪ but then you can ship a test version for a group of ppl who wanna test. Then release it couple days later?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fin from ddnet.tw? operating system, version?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @b3z random is always better.. Bcs hardware differences
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> @deen Downloaded from ddnet.tw, MacOS 10.15 19A558d, tw 0.6.4, ddnet 14.0
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fin mac never had an autoupdater
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ah. why?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hard to do
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could use steam to get an autoupdater
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are we messing around with the teamrank table?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This entire mysql update is losing us quite a lot of desirable features quite quickly
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what functionality has been lost and not restored?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the current teamrank stuff is a mess, and leads to us not storing old ranks e.g.
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have random savecodes now
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we also lock the db when trying to insert a teamrank
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are losing replicability soon
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are about to trade O(1) lookups to O(n * k * t) lookups
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you do realize that the operations we perform on the table are much worse, right?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ones we currently do
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one lookup you cant optimize
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you looked at our sql statements?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it is one
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can but it's absolutely horrendous, you can hand build an index
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, have you looked at our currentl SQL queries?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't in a while but I don't remember any huge offenders
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well then do it if someone suggests you do it to understand what they mean…
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> None that can't be optimized further by choosing nice index columns
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please look at the sql queries
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay whatever, change it however you see fit. It's quite obvious no one really cares what I think
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I suggest you look at the SQL queries
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you say no
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what should I do?
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You say we have shit queries, how about you show the shit query and not send me on a goose chase through the entire sql code on a phone?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then tell me that
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead of "no, won't look there"
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you did that now, thanks
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sec
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never said I wont look there, don't put words in my mouth. I said I haven't seen them recently but I don't remember any offenders
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, srory
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I complained the first time zwelf proposed the group concat aswell
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, you're right that the current sql queries don't look so bad (team top5, the worst one):
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                         "SELECT Name, Time, Rank, TeamSize "

11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                                 "SELECT TeamSize, Rank, ID "

11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                                 ") as l1 "
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                                 "ORDER BY Rank %s "
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                                 "LIMIT %d, 5"
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                         ") as l2 "
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                         "INNER JOIN %s_teamrace as r ON l2.ID = r.ID "
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>                         "ORDER BY Rank %s, r.ID, Name ASC;",
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is from after the SQL rewrite though
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> before we had:
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> SELECT ID, Name, Time, rank FROM (SELECT r.ID, Name, rank, l.Time FROM ((SELECT ID, rank, Time FROM (SELECT ID, (@pos := IF(@previd = ID,@pos,@pos+1)) pos, (@previd := ID), (@rank := IF(@prev = Time,@rank,@pos)) rank, (@prev := Time) Time FROM (SELECT ID, MIN(Time) as Time FROM %s_teamrace WHERE Map = '%s' GROUP BY ID ORDER BY `Time` ASC) as all_top_times) as a LIMIT %d, 5) as l) LEFT JOIN %s_teamrace as r ON l.ID = r.ID ORDER BY Time 
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as ugly as you can get, procedural SQL statements
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that's one improvement from the new SQL code already
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> another one is that you can run a full-featured ddnet server without a mysql database now
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and that we don't have race conditions in the code anymore
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's great, but maybe we should have been more conservative in changing behaviour or atleast planned this out more
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd say this is almost the same as the steam release
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Schema changes are just not the greatest thing to do on a production system. There are still unrecovered ranks
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it wasn't happening for a long time and I'm happy that we finally have thread-safe sql
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Needs to be very well planned out
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm happier that Zwelf stayed with us and provided fixes rather than scaring him away by not merging this for a long time
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we'd still not have threadsafe sql without him
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'd agree with that in almost any part of the code but I think this part was rather critical for us to have merged so quickly
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, because ranks
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree that ranks are quite fundamental to us
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess this goes to show that our codebase is fragile
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we'd had more of a discussion beforehand we'd have known the teamrank issue and we could maybe devise a nice schema without any time pressure
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what teamrank issue?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely, we need extensive testing. We are breaking far too much
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast we are fixing quickly
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can design a nice schema without any pressure right now, I think
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless I'm missing something
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the schema wasn't changed by the sql update
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aren't we losing teamranks we want saved?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what that issue is about, at least
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm aware of a recent db misconfiguration that had us thinking we lost ranks
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (unrelated to the sql update, maybe that played into your impression)
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't find Bacon's teamrank anywhere
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, yeah, that could be why I  connected the two issues together in my mind
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I'm stupid. sorry for being rude to you
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I don't know why, but I was really trying hard to force my point of view to you, thanks for staying level headed
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe it's social isolation, but I feel like I'm behaving more antisocial recently 😦
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dw I'm having a lot of trouble with it aswell
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For me it's having the same people around me for a long time
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, another breaking change I'm thinking about right now
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> renaming ddnet-antibot back to antibot because I'm moving it into /usr/lib/ddnet instead of /usr/lib/
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdyt, not worth it?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rename, not the move
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that's fine we are the only ones who use it and symlinks can make the transition smooth
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't quite remember but are linux .so s aware of their own name?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only for linking
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This would be a breaking change on macOS because dylibs are loaded from their exact install name and directory
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. an .so can specify what to link to
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> makes people who link to -lcurl link to libcurl.so.3.0.0 instead
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great so it's fine
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have free ten minutes, could you test the steam player name PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2615 on mac?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > You can put a `steam_appid.txt` next to the executable containing just the number `412220`. Then the real `libsteam_api.so` (or similar for other platforms) will recognize your built executable as DDNet.
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As soon as I'm back on shore. I go out on sundays to learn boating
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have fun
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Captain is pretty mad I dropped the anchor too fast so it's not much fun today :P
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Dont forget to blast the horn 👍
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He would throw me overboard
12:22 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Learath2, heinrich5991: ftr, I introduced two teamrank bugs: With the first one teamranks weren't updated: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2560 and https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2570
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we should store these normalized
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Joins are not that bad for performance and with two indexes we get very good lookup
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or we can bench the wildcard lookup, though even if it has acceptable performance it will always have bad asymptotic performance
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just to be clear, I'm not blaming Zwelf for those bugs. The refactorings he did was great and these kind of bugs happen because we don't have automated tests.
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not either if it came across like that. If it's anyones fault it's us for not having tests for this
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We all break things, it's hard to avoid when we aren't testing, especially on massive changes like this
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen client-side switch weapon on pickup would be great, me looking into it, dunno. I am finishing the steam integration first
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 you mean let's just get the client-side one in? and not wait for a proper solution with communication to server? I mean the new players still need to find out how to change weapon anyway, since they'll need hammer
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Captain Learath
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oof that price for GER
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1 year is now like 2013-2017
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1046 € ger alone
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we'll ever cover that
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that srv rly good
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeeeh, it's a great server but we didn't get very lucky with our neighbours
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *@deen yes
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> boys boys
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> i talked with lea about my problem that tw isnt starting and freezing everything. he said its my comps fault so i searched abit and found, that my norton caused this problem since yesterday.
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> Anyone here with norton ? im not even sure what blocked it.
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Virus2k> I just deactivated auto protect, intelligent firewall and activated silend mode - then i could open tw 🤔
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @deen 
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> > Anyone having experiences with SSH's ConnectTimeout not working reliably?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wdym by that, if you're using putty on windows or any other OS, you can enable TCP keepalive to maintain the session open
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> oh well looks smth completly different, never touched to that var
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what is this sorcery? it shows up on demo too and is still there after rejoining server
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747102845815357511/screenshot_2020-08-23_16-36-32.png
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> the answer is in chat

16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> some guy is dragged a long way
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and hook only renders to a certain extent i think
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> perhaps the default server sort could take into account both server ping and number of players? (if there is something like a default)
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Ravie what nouis says
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> At a very long Dummydrag the hook dont get fully rendered even with /showall 1 and also for the player who owns the hook
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I see a guy below the map now
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I wonder who dragged him THAT far
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 so how do I test this?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> figured it out, it works
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zwelf: Why is top5team such a complex query anyway?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i ask again if anybody didn't notice, does syncronized function work on local servers?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if not, please explain why
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes it does for me
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747137075932954704/screenshot_2020-08-23_11-51-49.png

18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oops
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> synchronize = envelopes start on server time @Cellegen ?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/xH I think the above query is both easier to understand and should work better
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @louis yes
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so it must restart the animations from 0
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but it doesn't even restart it
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's only sliiiightly faster
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I guess maybe to keep it uniform?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 and the ids would be random, right?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @louis nothing from autoexec.cfg and no commands which lead to syncronize, also i've tried with sv_solo and didn't work at all
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because one of the reasons I didn't normalize the db was that we wanted replication to keep working and then I can't just increment ids
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Cellegen did u check synchronize on all envelopes and check the map too
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i did
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> + latest ddnet vers
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nothing works from local
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ your change worked fine on the old laptop btw
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> went back to OpenGL 1.1
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> was always local servers don't have the synchronized function?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen aren't the IDs already random?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> syncronize is broken since ddnet 10 or so
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1318
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen is there an issue with that?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, should be fine
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao doesn't envelopes work client side?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why synchronize with race time when you can have predictions on whenever your timer started or not
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and let the client render it for you
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> server side i think
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for what reason
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> doesn't it take much more load, than client side?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or it just sends a message whenever a player touched start?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This was an interesting read about ids, though their design requirements arent the same as us
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Nice
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ so your change is ready for review?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah would like some ppl to test it
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anything specific to test?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I could just download the automatic builds, and make an announcement on Discord for people to test
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah and maybe win32 for the people with white square
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Anything that works is good actually, if it doesn't work GPU and console output is nice
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ should they expect higher fps or same?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well in 2.1 context the buffering is enabled.. But depends on CPU if higher fps
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Not as much as 3.3 because didn't get map borders to buffer
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The shaders aren't powerful in older gl version
20:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> @Learath2: First we need to find the rank number for each teamrank, filter out only the requested range (max 5 teams, either forward or reverse) and select all players for each team. I didn't find a less complex way of doing this query. GROUP_CONCAT was there to reduce the complexity, but it isn't standard SQL and not compatible with sqlite.
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zwelf: which query are we talking about? Top5team?
21:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> yes top5team
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, neither yours nor the one I proposed has a group concat
21:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> yes, I removed the GROUP_CONCAT in the SQLite PR (which proposed sql query from you are you referring right now?)
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/xH
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has one less derived table and I think its more readable. Though I think you did yours so that it's uniform across all the queries
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just noticed GER & GER2 had powersave CPU frequency governor set... Can't believe they default servers to that. Tested quickly and ingame latency is 3 ms lower with performance
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747212634398392331/screenshot_2020-08-23_16-55-42.png
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lfieban? with no mod in tab?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Usually a global ban
