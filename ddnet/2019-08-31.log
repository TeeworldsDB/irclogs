08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @noby Does your client connect tool also works for 0.7?
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The one with the proxies, so you can connect 64 tees to one server
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hardcoded for 0.6 protocol
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet with websockets on gets frozen on startup, i think it might be that recv blocks now for some reason?

12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> run with strace
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we set recv to be async, maybe it's not workign anymore
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen with strace it works
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to much output
