10:04 < bridge> <gamelord0845> Hello, I wrote the code for support. Can a discord bot be made for my own ddracenetwork server (which map will be shown to how many people etc. on the server)?
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> What
10:57 < bridge> <gamelord0845> ?
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is „the code for support“
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you want to make a bot or use an existing one?
11:02 < bridge> <kekomonter> I think he asking for help with discord bot integration in server
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which bot then
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t feel super inclined to help him when he can’t even figure out how to ask the question in a way that makes sense
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Discord or tw server?
11:13 < bridge> <gamelord0845> discord
11:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You only answered one question .\_.
11:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can access the "how many players, what map" info at https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought same xd but in that case i simply dont say anything cuz they dm me then
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Grammar in other language sometimes leads to such weird sentences, but I agree that they could extra check if a translator gives a similar sentence or something
12:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> asking questions can be hard
12:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please don't talk about GameLord here as if they weren't here
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki i miss your contribution to the multi threading bug in #bugs 
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can't take any issue serious anymore without your voice in my head
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And i don't even know your voice
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Brainwashed
12:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u want me to say, its obvious if it was all rust with only rust deps this would 98% havent happened
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
12:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> today i made progress on my pascal mlir compiler
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well i havent done anything fancy yet, im making the lr parser and the ast
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> following the iso spec :Sakusweat:
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> from 1990
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/iso7185.pdf
12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> luckily its 100 pages
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how long is C
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For work or for fun?
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> c99 is 550
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> for fun and flex
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i will put it in my resume
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and in the future it may help me get compiler related jobs
12:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Object Pascal is still pretty much used in Germany in form of delphi
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> also MLIR is a niche in niches
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i may get paid a lot 😬
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds nice
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i know 0 pascal XD
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i seen the learn pascan in y minutes
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I should also specialize more xd
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> delphi is a compiler right
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You'll find some stuff similar to rust
12:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i choose pascal cuz its not stack based or functional
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Esp syntax wise.. but some stuff is also extremely stupid
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> and simple
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> "simple"
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> String array access is 1 based not zero
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> also it supports multidimensional arrays
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> funny excerpt
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Use this information only for go o d; never for evil. Do not exp ose to re. Do not op erate heavy
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> > equipment after reading, may cause drowsiness. Do not read under the in uence of alcohol (although

12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> stupid pdf
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> it puts spaced
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> framework
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1184825040705962094/image.png?ex=658d614e&is=657aec4e&hm=a2aedc7998cb34a22fc94b2af69ca1edc5357aeefa79212c89589896e94d6b13&
12:52 < bridge> <Ewan> any percy jones enjoyers
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> what dat
12:53 < bridge> <Ewan> bassist
12:55 < bridge> <aegisub> vegatables
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> also being able to say i made a pascal compiler is nice
13:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will also improve my standard-reading-skill
13:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> (this is all big copium i hope i finish this project)
13:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i think this is a really good project
13:11 < bridge> <Ewan> I can not get 3d accelerated virtio guest gpu drivers to work
13:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> f
13:11 < bridge> <Ewan> virtio video device can only be used with spice display device and both of them need the 3d acceleration explicitly enabled
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this linux specific
13:12 < bridge> <Ewan> libvirt
13:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and it’ll run after some finagling
13:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but the only spice display clients i have just give me a black screen
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have no idea about this stuff
13:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and spice only provides a GTK widget which all of said tools use
13:13 < bridge> <Ewan> virtual machines
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvidia?
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
13:13 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe related
13:13 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like abandoned libvirt bug tho
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GPU_passthrough_with_libvirt_qemu_kvm
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> irrele
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> vant
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> f
13:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: got home
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> here u basically pass through pci device to guest as if it had the device connected directly
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> virtio drivers expose a layer that just interfaces with the hypervisor and then the host calls whatever interfaces from the gpu
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> so with passthrough you just install oem drivers
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Hello fred
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh its late
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> 20
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> see u when u wake up

13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> mostly video games stuff
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or rhythm game
13:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or random shit youtube recommended that i saved

13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw upc is the uni i went 1 year xd
13:21 < bridge> <Ewan> Cool
13:21 < bridge> <Ewan> wish i could go to school
13:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
13:23 < bridge> <Ewan> do you only listen to music at work ryo
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @gamelord0845 you still on it? Are you coding a new bot? or do you want to connect a finished bot to your server?
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> how
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo always works
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> why synthwave
13:28 < bridge> <Ewan> is it fulfilling or is it just noise
13:28 < bridge> <gamelord0845> a new bot
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> 🦛
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Okay if you want to build a bot your self @gamelord0845 then the link heinrich sent will come in handy.
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
13:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here you can get information about all servers and players currently only as easy to use http endpoint with json
13:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> assuming you write the bot in some high level scripting language such as javascript or python reading that json will be very smooth :) 
13:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> s/only/online
13:50 < bridge> <gamelord0845> It's very complicated, I don't understand what should I do?
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which language are you using to write the bot?
13:53 < bridge> <gamelord0845> I was normally using node.js and can you share the infrastructure directly so I can just change the token and start it?
13:53 < bridge> <kekomonter> Step by step instruction:
13:53 < bridge> <kekomonter> 1. Open eyes
13:53 < bridge> <kekomonter> 2. Turn on brain
13:53 < bridge> <kekomonter> 3. Read how json works
13:53 < bridge> <kekomonter> 3. Write auto-fetcher and parser for this json
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what token?
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> have you ever created a discord bot?
13:54 < bridge> <gamelord0845> yes
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay nice
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are just missing the teeworlds info part right?
13:54 < bridge> <gamelord0845> Yes, I once set up a Discord bot connected to the server, it was Minecraft.
14:10 < bridge> <Bota> Chillerdragon ur Rest Client can send data to the bot
14:10 < bridge> <Bota> In theory
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @gamelord0845 https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/O3
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Bota wot?
14:12 < bridge> <Bota> Depends how he implements bot
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh you are trying to sell gamelord my ruby lib? :D 
14:12 < bridge> <Bota> Wekhooks :owo:
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea dont think that fits his usecase
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> using the http master should be smoother for him
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the http master also contains data for all 0.7 servers btw
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (and 0.5 ^^)
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, it seems the last 0.5 server died
14:15 < bridge> <Bota> https://tenor.com/view/%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%87-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B1-gif-4507635777139313792

14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does this preview on discord?
14:18 < bridge> <Bota> Yes
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
14:18 < bridge> <Bota> My eyes hurt
14:18 < bridge> <Bota> Javascript :cammostripes:
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> said the ruby dev
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxaxax
14:19 < bridge> <Bota> Im using typescript
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is typescript 
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kinda xd
14:19 < bridge> <Bota> Thats big diffraction
14:19 < bridge> <Bota> Diffrence*
14:20 < bridge> <Bota> Later it gets compiled to js yes but in ts you have somewhat of a propoer language
14:20 < bridge> <Bota> For thins i give props so Microsoft
14:20 < bridge> <Bota> This*
14:21 < bridge> <Bota> Btw im Angular dev
14:21 < bridge> <Bota> Not ruby
14:21 < bridge> <Bota> For ruby ill try make you all of it
14:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hehe i know
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > ah, it seems the last 0.5 server died
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when 0.5 support for ddnet?
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 
14:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ._.
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the future
14:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> stop thinking about porting 0.5 and 0.7 - go work on ddnet 2.0!
14:23 < bridge> <Bota> Its like you say debian is the future :lol:
14:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hehe
14:23 < bridge> <Bota> That says the arch user
14:23 < bridge> <Bota> Always has the newest stuff
14:23 < bridge> <Bota> Bit wants 0.5
14:24 < bridge> <Bota> But wants 0.5
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> when teewars compatibility?
14:25 < bridge> <Bota> For what?
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that was sarcastic
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot trolodragon?
14:25 < bridge> <Bota> Your smartfridge? :kek:
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> teewars 0.4 didn't have map download support
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oldman5991
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> back in the days we didnt have map download
14:25 < bridge> <patiga> teewars is the oldest teeworlds version I'm aware of, it was an exaggeration
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when did u even start playing @heinrich5991 ?
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aware of as in you played it already @patiga ?
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 0.5.1, I think
14:26 < bridge> <Bota> Heinrich donated 500 Euros hes playing pretty long i assume
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah oh so not 0.4
14:27 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: definitely not live ^^. I did open client and had a quick look at the map format. not sure if I was ingame, I think no
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah
14:28 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> good old 2008

14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deutschland
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is some 2008 tw ad in german? did your browser translate it or was that the original post?
14:31 < bridge> <Bota> :poggers2:
14:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> knuffig sounds untranslated
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> right
14:32 < bridge> <Bota> Agreed
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think teetow did some german web stuff back then
14:37 < bridge> <Bota> Next week ill have a lot of time for my project:)))))
14:38 < bridge> <Bota> Once the poc works, ill do a v2 🙂
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo321 for testing rcon flood if you feel motivated you could insert rcon login to this script https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/tree/master/examples/07/flood?ref_type=heads then host a server online with max clients 64 and run the flood script with 64 tees
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7650#issuecomment-1855873417
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> In con_ready i assume you could insert https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/fd7a93e76af72841465082d8692e36cca4a1b608/twnet_parser/messages7/system/rcon_auth.py

14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Whatever your conclusion will be. Please add this for local server. I hate to wait for rcon xd
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also would love that for remote servers
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i often join 3 servers in a row just to set sv_shutdown_when_empty and i always forget how to spell it
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mimimi use fifo
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I feel that
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> using fifo does indeed sound like a good idea in this case
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it doesnt have autocomplete at all
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> add fifo remote console
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its nice for the 3 times thing

14:58 < bridge> <Ewan> salt maybe
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> sry i went to eat and didnt see
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> not just synthwave tho but synthwave is nice as its like background noise not too distracting
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> without words
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> specially when i focus
15:02 < bridge> <Ewan> so it’s just noise
15:02 < bridge> <Ewan> wild
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> why wild
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> gotta focus for difficult problems
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> like making a compiler 😬
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes i also listen to game or anime OSTs
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOHZG74XIUw
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> nothing comes close to this when it comes to anime osts
15:05 < bridge> <Ewan> why u cannot focus with substance music
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> wat dat
15:07 < bridge> <Ewan> music that isn’t just noise
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So bass?
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:08 < bridge> <Ewan> what
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The only thing that isn't noise in music i can think of is bass
15:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Was just wondering about your comment
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean like
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> music that doesn’t exist just to fill the silence
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> to just be a lingering noise like the rain or traffic
15:10 < bridge> <Ewan> not anything like particular frequencies
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good idea, time for some rain asmr
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> it isnt noise its a nice symphony
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has motive and emotion
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> listen to it
15:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i can not sympathize with the synthesis
15:17 < bridge> <Ewan> if I enjoy a synth it probably has an amazing keyboardist behind it
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i bought a sony 80€ headset for work and street
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> bluetooth
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t usually like synth as the main component also
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i meant the anime ost
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea it’s orchestral it’s fine
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i’d just rather listen to a classical piece probably
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t like film soundtracks
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s all dynamics
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> kevin pekin is god
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess i also seen anime
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it reminds me of how good it is
15:20 < bridge> <Ewan> probably
15:20 < bridge> <Ewan> Idk the guy
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> eating oatmeal
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> pretty american
15:21 < bridge> <Ewan> is it
15:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just oatmeal
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk oatmeal reminds me of america
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess cuz it english word
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> in spanish its avena
15:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
15:27 < bridge> <Ewan> meal of oats
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i am still hungry
15:32 < bridge> <Ewan> need protein ghhmhmbnvnv
15:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> when oatmeal with protein powder
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> ChillerDragon: Cool tool, I didn't really receive any lag by doing this. So, instead I have tried to count the amount of `got msg 14` that get printed to see if both versions match up with the amount of commands received. I got the following results. My version seems to always land on the same values, while the original never gets the same value for each test. It seems to get either 338, 339 or 340.
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> 
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> ```
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> Original 1 tee - 340 msg 14s
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> Original 60 tees - 20298 (/60 = 338.3)
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> 
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> My version 1 tee - 336 msg 14s
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> My version 60 tees - 20160 (/60 = 336)
15:41 < bridge> <furo321> ```
15:49 < bridge> <Fussel> you badly mistyped ›metal‹ ^^
15:50 < bridge> <furo321> Maybe your tool is bugged, as I seemed to always get 336 when counting on a normal DDNet client with both original and my version.
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea there might be bugs with the resend logic in my code. The happy path should be all fine but not sure if i properly implemented the error correcting of the tw protocol.
16:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo321 but woah you got it running and actaully were using it? thats so cool to hear. And patching the rcon auth also worked fine? You are a pro coder!
16:05 < bridge> <furo321> I didn't change the code, I made the server send rcon commands to non-authed players instead :)
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah right thats what you also did for dbg dummies
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was it a local or remote server?
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it was remote that should please heinrichs concerns i think
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @furo321 ^
16:14 < bridge> <furo321> It was done locally, but the "flooder" was connecting through my public IP. Meaning it still went around the local network.
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
17:39 < bridge> <Bota> ChillerDragon when are you able to start implementing the features i requested? 😄 I kinda need data to develop my frond end

17:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks
17:49 < bridge> <robyt3> `QuadsDraw` draws the quad centered at the position instead
18:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure why it's called `Ext`, maybe `Impl` would be a better suffix
18:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> noted, thanks again :owo:
18:22 < bridge> <robyt3> It's the rect drawing code but without some wrapping code for starting and ending quads drawing
18:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im going thru it rn, seems like so xd
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> For some performance gains in some cases where many calls to `QuadsStart` and `QuadsEnd` can be avoided
18:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it will be in js, performance isnt my main concern :pepeW:
19:46 < bridge> <teero777> hey wheres the map database again
19:48 < bridge> <teero777> found it thx
19:51 < bridge> <teero777> @heinrich5991 how many terrabytes is https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/ big?
19:52 < bridge> <teero777> @heinrich5991 how many terrabytes is https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/ ?
20:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when will #7521 come into fruition
20:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7521
20:35 < bridge> <chairn> 18.5GB
20:35 < bridge> <teero777> so small?
20:36 < bridge> <chairn> exactly 18486077573
20:37 < bridge> <teero777> bits? xd
20:44 < bridge> <-StormAx> im trying to make rainbow text, can sobody send help pls pls

20:55 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> tick is not defined, col is never used
21:07 < bridge> <robyt3> The tick also doesn't advance on the client-side when offline, use `std::fmod(Client()->GlobalTime(), 1.0f)` for the H color component
22:27 < ChillerDragon> @Bota i can not gurantee any delivery dates if you need it soon you have to do it your self i might not do it for a few years 
22:28 < ChillerDragon> i dont think its even one terrabyte @teero777
22:37 < bridge> <-StormAx> col is used
22:37 < bridge> <-StormAx> `TextRender()->TextColor(col);`
22:48 < bridge> <Bota> years? :justatest:
22:54 < ChillerDragon> yeah historically it takes me years to finish some of my todos. 
22:55 < ChillerDragon> end of january i might have some time for it 
23:09 < ChillerDragon> omg new github looks like dogshit
23:09 < ChillerDragon> frontend gets worse with every updates
23:09 < ChillerDragon> in a few years and wont be any better than gitlab anymore
23:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is new for u?
23:10 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702591795.png
23:10 < ChillerDragon> i cant read shit with this fucked font
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah too bright
23:10 < ChillerDragon> https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-48474/images/help/commits/commits-page.png
23:10 < ChillerDragon> this looked so much better
23:11 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702591870.png
23:11 < ChillerDragon> its so much harder to read
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh k. For me it looks different. More like in the first picture
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh the last two
23:36 < ChillerDragon> last two ye
23:36 < ChillerDragon> very last is current and the other one is some image i found on duckduckgo from their docs how it used to look
23:36 < ChillerDragon> more bold and darker
23:36 < ChillerDragon> much easier on the eye
