01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> has anyone a invite link to the tw data discord?
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://discord.gg/pBZGAWVC
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> o.O whats a tw data discord
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has gameskins and skins and stuff
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> nice
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> irc bridge when?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> who runs the discord? and who made the gameskins?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the one who runs that discord doesnt even know what irc is bro
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> do i know him?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk they put all gameskins they find
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u find him finding him
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> sounds good
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> idea for a new game mode: CatchTheTee (CTT)
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one tee trying to escape the others, let's call this tee a rabbit
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - one or more tees trying to catch the rabbit, let's call them wolves
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - to win as wolves, you have to hit the rabbit with a hammer
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - to win as a rabbit, you have to avoid the wolves and reach a certain point on the map
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - wolves are delayed at start by a few seconds
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - rabbit can be chosen randomly at round begin
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - some special maps are needed probably
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what do you think?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> Isnt that like **xPanic** ?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> there were some zombie escape type mods already
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i've never played that one
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> does someone know a fast ftp tool to upload a lot of files at once?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> put the files into zip/tar archive, upload and extract
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> thats not an option
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> i only have ftp access
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> or can i extract using ftp?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> probably no
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> since i have multiple directorys i wonder if running multiple ftps uploads at the same time is dangerous
11:52 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon rsync?
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> it cant be run over ftp :/
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> i wish rsync is so nice and fast
11:52 <+Ryozuki> ftp nobo
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea irk
11:52 <+Ryozuki> u live in the 2000s
11:52 <+Ryozuki> or wut
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> my hoster does
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> i picked it because it offers unlimited diskspace :D
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> lifetime
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> pay one
11:52 <+Ryozuki> doesnt ssh have sftp or smth
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> i dont have sftp nor ssh
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> only ftp
11:53 <+Ryozuki> omg
11:53 <+Ryozuki> switch hoster
11:53 <+Ryozuki> why u dont have full control
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> other hosters are too expensive
11:53 <+Ryozuki> ???
11:53 <+Ryozuki> hetzner vps can go as low as 3€
11:53 <+Ryozuki> ur getting scammed wiht ftp stuff
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> but that wont run my stuff
11:53 <+Ryozuki> what stuff
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> mc server
11:54 <+Ryozuki> howmuch u pay
11:54 <+Ryozuki> for ur ftp
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> nothing
11:54 <+Ryozuki> xd
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> well i paid once
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> its lifetime server xd
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lifetime doesn't mean your lifetime, but the lifetime of the company, which can be dissolved when it's not making money anymore.
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> yea ik
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> i still expect the lifetime of the company to be long enought that its the cheapest option for a server with strong cpu ram and infinite disk
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> infinite disk? what's that? 😄
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Time to write a teehistorian to mc map converter
12:39 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cagent> @ChillerDragon
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 hi, do you happen to know if there is a reliable way to know if after a server info request, there may be "more" packets?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without having to do another recv obviously
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802935532232638534/unknown.png
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im using this magic number
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don’t have all the players yet
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The extra packets only contain players
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see that works
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho the server can always send more or less
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean in an adverserial situation
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean there may be a case where serrver will never send all players?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proper servers send either no players or all the players
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean a server with malicious intention can send more or less. You should account for that too
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you need this for?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im making a server info requester in rust
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know libtw may have it or not
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i want to do my own
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also been inspired by status.tw
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i want to do my own teeworlds spider/crawler
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well why does it matter if there is a next packet?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should always just recv everything you get, not like discarding the rest of the rx queue is cheap, nor can you know how much of the ex queue to discard without recving
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/802941452652511262/unknown.png
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> \\o/
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🙈
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know if the token is in big endian ?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have  to figure out this token stuff
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!ʎø1øʞıƝg> Hetzner has almost to none ddos protection i can be the judge of that
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!ʎø1øʞıƝg> it has basic ddos protection yes but Just needs ports closed
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what's that?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my program
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks cap
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually said what i want to do a bit more up
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > i also been inspired by status.tw
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > i think i want to do my own teeworlds spider/crawler
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh, cool
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> would it have more information about players?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will try ye
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the annoying thing is dealing with old servers
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont have all the fields
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are there many old servers?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> with players
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vanilla 0.6.5
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt have map src
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and map size
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is it necessary btw? xd
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so it's web api
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right now its just a rust library
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's just
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe https://github.com/edg-l/teestatus
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hacked it fast
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill clean it up somewhen
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Ryozuki best docs ever
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/serverinfo_extended.md
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> libtw2 docs really tell you all this stuff
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the token is indeed big endian
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was reading that for 4 hours
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt say the response token is big endian
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > token must be the token from the request. If the server info isn't sent upon a request, it mut be -1.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > token is an arbitrary byte chosen by the client which will be sent back with the server info. For the extended server info, the extra_token field needs to be included in the server info response.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> token is a single byte, there is no byte order in single bytes 😛
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but token is merged with extra token
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> extra_token is big endian
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > `extra_token` contains a 16 bit big-endian integer that should be shifted by 8 to the left and combined with `token`
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think this should give it away
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `extra_token << 8 | token` is the token you are sent back
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it never matches
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast for me
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try again tomorrow
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you go from big endian to host byte order?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what are you doing ryo?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro https://github.com/edg-l/teestatus
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i plan to make a better status.tw
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> backend in rust ofc
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You're just reading serverstatus or are you joining the server?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reading
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro what data would u get from joining
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> player positions? or maybe teams?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk nsa spy data
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will consider after i have a solid base
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So I guess you also need a handshake for extended serverstatus ^^
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I bet it's probably just not you swapping around the bytes before appending the last one
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wouldn't be cool to take a player slot anyways
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to go 😛
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i guess its smth like that learath
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill look into it more tomorrow
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since I'm obsessive I just had to check, the server doesn't swap it around
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does* 😛
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 😛
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or doesnt
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just made a typo
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw wdym by swap around bytes
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well a lot of code in teeworlds (incorrectly btw) assumes the host is little endian
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but network byte order is usually big endian, so when reassembling the integer you essentially swap around the bytes
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but C abstracts that away for you by defining bitshifts the way it does
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u send the link to the line
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where it does it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you only need to remember where you put things, when crafting the request, we generate a 3 byte token. The least significant byte we put in the last byte named `token` in the protocol
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L770
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The most significant byte we put in the first byte of the extra token, the middle byte we put in the second byte
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so overall the token is `extra_token[0] << 16 | extra_token[1] << 8 | token`
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L2186 this is where the server does it btw
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 when finish ur wireshark dissector?
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> i pay u 20 bucks when u get it merged in upstream :)
20:25 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: is teestatus 0.7?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the protocol hasnt changed then ye
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> it has
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> it has tokens now as far as i understood it
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> you could call it ddnet status orr teestatus deprecated :D
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> if i see "Request info about teeworlds servers." published in 2021 i expect it to support 0.7
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell me a 0.7 sv ip
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> 139.59.215.82:8704
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u sure its online
20:30 <+ChillerDragon> yes
20:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://status.tw/server/details/139.59.215.82/8704/
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt seem to work
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do they use tcp for info or what
20:41 < ***> Buffer Playback...
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> [20:39:05] wb
20:41 <+bridge> [20:39:05] [ddnet] <Learath2> One day i’ll finish it ;D
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> [20:39:05] nice :)
20:41 <+bridge> [20:41:14] [ddnet] <Learath2> Dissecting stateful protocols is not fun
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> [20:41:15] feel free to contact me when its merged
20:41 <+ChillerDragon> [20:41:15] u get free money
20:41 <+bridge> [20:41:15] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it free money if he has to work for it?
20:41 < ***> Playback Complete.
21:21 <+ChillerDragon> no he doesnt has to work for it because its something he wanted to do anyways
