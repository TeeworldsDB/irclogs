00:38 < Lady> Learath2?
00:40 <@deen> Happy european birthday, o_be_one 
00:43 <@deen> Lady: Nice that you waited until Learath2's birthday is over with asking for favors :P
00:43 < Lady> deen autoupdater is broken.....
00:43 <@deen> i know =/
00:43 <@deen> that's why i didn't want to release
00:44 < Lady> deen HMH not here?
00:44 < Lady> never?
00:45 <@deen> right, i think
00:45 <@deen> tell him to come here more often
00:46 < Lady> deen I don't want to spam you with more bugs
00:46 < Lady> so bye
00:49 <@EastByte> I guess it would have been a better idea to stick to a launcher/updater in the first place
00:50 <@deen> i don't like those at all
00:50 <@deen> i want to start the game and be in the game immediately
00:50 <@deen> not run some other program to run it
00:50 <@EastByte> a launcher doesn't need to be visible
00:58 <@EastByte> though I understand your point, I guess no one in the ddnet community would like that^^
01:21 < eeeee> what are you talking about, launchers are awesome! we should also add a couple minutes of unskippable logos and intros and then also nag the user to create a Teeworlds Gaming Network account and then also a DDNet account (credit card required)
01:22 < eeeee> remove http map download in favor of purchasing map packs as DLC
01:27 < eeeee> do that and all the console gamers would dig ur game
01:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/veThy
01:27 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 f17d705 def: Hopefully fix voting problems
09:47 <@EastByte> eeeee: I hope you got some sleep now :p
09:57 < eeeee> huh?
09:58 < eeeee> oh that, yeah
09:58 < eeeee> i just tried playing a game from steam a couple days ago and it annoyed the shit out of me
11:25 <@EastByte> deen: the playerflag bits 1<<5 and 1<<6 are still used by the zclient and some other botting client
11:26 <@EastByte> and they aren't updated anymore, so kicking them is easy
13:28 <@deen> EastByte: hehe, so what should do with that info?
13:29 <@deen> maybe if those bits are sent, reverse left/right?
13:51 <@EastByte> deen: that would mess a up the client's prediction :P
13:51 <@deen> ;)
13:52 <@deen> "omg, zclient is broken, I'll play with a normal client instead"
13:52 <@EastByte> that response would be awesome
13:54 <@EastByte> In average I see one zclient client user per server
13:57 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/screenshot_2015-04-03_13-54-11.png
13:57 <@EastByte> #(ef 3) <- 3 = bit 5, 6 set
14:03 <@deen> could also just add [BOT] to their name or sth
14:03 <@deen> ^^
14:05 <@EastByte> would be straigh forward
14:06 <@deen> not everyone uses zClient for botting, so shouldn't do anything serious to the users
14:06 <@deen> the client also has a few features i didn't want in ddnet client
14:09 <@EastByte> true
16:10 <@deen> EastByte: The name from your screenshot sounds familiar: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1280&p=12571#p12571
16:14 <@EastByte> funny
16:17 <@EastByte> must be a coincidence that he joined the forum one hour after I posted the screenshot
17:37 < Learath2> laxadedi: whats broken about autoupdate 
17:38 < Learath2> or deen if you know ^^
17:38 <@deen> doesn't work on winxp
17:38 < Learath2> is it the winxp thing ?
17:38 <@deen> yes, everyone uses xp
17:39 < Learath2> k ill finish it up when im back from dinner
17:40 <@deen> thanks
17:47 < laxadedi> Learath2: no clue, I haven't played tw in a long time
17:56 < fstd> simple solution: autoupdate detects it's running on winxp and autoudates windows before autoupdating ddnet
18:12 < Learath2> :D
22:09 < Learath2> deen: back 
22:09 <@deen> welcome back
22:39 < saman> hi
22:40 < saman> bzzz
22:40 < saman> bzzzzzzzzzzzz
23:10 <@deen> Looks like someone fell asleep quickly
23:11 < Learath2> im way too weak on winapi to finish this up i think
23:12 <@EastByte> what's the problem?
23:12 < Learath2> i do createprocess and let the child inherit a handle to the parent
23:13 < Learath2> then i pass the handle to the child with the command line
23:13 < Learath2> suddenly handle invalid
23:15 <@EastByte> what kind of handle is it?
23:17 < Learath2> its a handle duplicated from the pseudo handle i get from GetCurrentProcess()
23:17 < Learath2> the handle is duplicated inheritable too
23:19 <@EastByte> so you are passing the process handle of the child to his parent?
23:19 <@EastByte> meh, I don't get it
23:19 < Learath2> EastByte: https://gist.github.com/Learath2/89ade70707ee2ddea381
23:20 < Learath2> while creating a child process i just hand it a handle to meself
23:23 <@EastByte> unsigned char *ptr = (unsigned char *)&hnd;
23:23 <@EastByte> so ptr points to a null terminated string?
23:24 <@EastByte> I always though a windows handle is just some number
23:24 <@deen> Learath2: why not use the batch file trick?
23:24 <@EastByte> ^ :D
23:24 <@deen> that should work with any old windows version and microsoft won't break compatibility for it i guess
23:24 < Learath2> deen: feel free to put it back there im not putting that abomination back there
23:25 <@deen> hm, i thought that was the plan all the time
23:25 <@deen> i don't think it's possible to update an exe from inside the exe itself on winxp
23:25 < Learath2> that was what i was trying to get rid of it the whole time
23:26 <@deen> oh, i thought we wanted to get rid of the hand-written HTTP 1.0 downloader
23:26 < Learath2> well and that :D
23:26 <@deen> and the hand-written update file parser
23:26 < Learath2> btw i think that updater would have also failed on dlls
23:26 <@deen> i did update SDL once
23:26 <@EastByte> but it's possible to unload them
23:27 <@deen> Learath2: I'm definitely not going into WinApi =/
23:28 < Learath2> well feel free to do what you feel is appropriate 
23:29 <@deen> I'd hope someone can do it with winapi-magic
23:29 <@deen> if that's not going to happen, we'll go with the weird batch-stuff again
23:30 < Learath2> just need to figure out how to pass the handle
23:40 <@deen> good luck
