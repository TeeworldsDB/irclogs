00:04 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted to add something like crashpad with a post crash messagebox asking if you want to upload the dump
00:07 < bridge> <totar> we will get 100,000 device lost asserts
02:36 < bridge> <Peakies> .
06:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why ask the user @learath2 ? What’s the problem with just doing it?
06:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure how hard it is to even run code after the client crashed. Maybe this would require the launcher first.
06:42 < bridge> <animepdf> It can be post-run prompt, like "last time your client exited unexpectedly, do you want to report it🤓?
07:18 < bridge> <woidless> When will the community rules be ready?
07:38 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure all the privacy people here can give you at least 50 reasons we have to ask the user
07:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @animepdf oh yea that sounds easy
07:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i know its common but thinking about it i cant understand why. If we do not include the PC usernames in the logs there should be no sensitive information in it.
07:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont see the difference between sending game traffic to ddnet.org and sending crash dumps to ddnet.org
07:56 < bridge> <learath2> Well coredumps are not anonymized. They include stuff like binds and config variables which might contain stuff like rcon login information for other servers. That's one that comes to mind e.g.
07:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i see fair
07:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does windows even have coredumps?
07:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought we just have an assert line or a backtrace
07:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> configs should not be sent i have my credit card info in there!
07:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but just a trace should be fine
08:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @louis i managed to fix the mouse escaping the ddnet window issue! Switched from wayland to xorg.
08:03 < bridge> <louis> ah nice
08:03 < bridge> <louis> will that break other things :justatest:
08:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> of course
08:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
08:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but statistically xorg breaks less than wayland :D 
08:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so far i am gaming just fine on xorg since 6 minutes
08:04 < bridge> <louis> i dont know much about the differences but im not sure why wayland is the default, i had to do some fixes for chrome due to wayland as well
08:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the way i understood it wayland is the new shit trying to solve all the issues in legacy xorg. But OG xorg is battle tested! It might be a mess internally but it works for me the end user. While bleeding edge wayland is big troll sometimes.
08:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no coredumps or variable contents just filenames and linenumbers should be fine for everyone or what do you think @learath2 ?
08:13 < bridge> <learath2> Just the backtrace is probably fine. At least I can't think of an issue with it
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie i just saw your message in #off-topic i never check that channel sorry ._. in case you still need a stress test tool i think the official ddnet headless client can be compiled with dbg stress
08:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, i already forgot what i needed it for
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also have a 0.7 client written in 200 lines of python that can connect any amount of clients and you can decide which inputs to send here https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/56ac0ce540c0ad874369671f552b6b8c5dacd91a/examples/07/flood/flood.py#L112-123
08:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> abuse
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats my fav stress test tool atm
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you needed it to check CHN bandwidth
08:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> right
09:05 < bridge> <alw5> Thanks will use this against all DDRaceNetwork servers

11:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Read the error message, do what it says
11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Ideally the crashpad could already do some analysis of the crash dump to figure out if it went wrong because of the graphics driver and suggest all the common remedies and automatically switch to OpenGL 3/1 as a last resort.
11:52 < bridge> <huuge_> how to configure cmake?

11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro:
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. stop sending 240p screenshots, it's  disgusting
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. read the readme
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> properly
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-on-linux--macos
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "You can install all required dependencies and CMake on Debian or Ubuntu like this:"
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I assume you have ubuntu
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> resolution shaming
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true, but i could swear win95 had better screenshots 😂
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hello ddnet maintainers! I am on the edge of my seat since 2 weeks desperatly waiting for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9386 to be merged! Can you please hire a new maintainer the prs start to get stale for too long ._.
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for example kaffeine he is pro reviewer!
12:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8992 4 months 😬
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes that specific pr is of utmost tragedy
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bloat
12:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why have an issue for it then :p
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the issue is bloat too
12:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fair
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have 684 issues already
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just stupid
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should ONLY accept bug reports
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes we need to get it down to 666 again asap
12:40 < Mani_Master> Hi guys 
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ every time i try to reduce issues i create stale prs and even more issues -.-
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
12:41 < Mani_Master> Guys i say hi!!
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good for you
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mad
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller: i actually think for ddpg i'll only accept issues and discussions and features get an own repo just for that
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> similar to rust rfcs
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imo it's just bad to have ever increasing issues
12:42 < Mani_Master> Anyone can see my massage?
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, wazuup mani
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes ever increasing issues are unsatisfying
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i see how other repos have nice issue templates
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo templates are bloat
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where u need to fill out information before pressing submit
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> og
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on the issue ig
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and mixing bugs and feature discussions is fine for that we have labels
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if they have hardware problems and don't include any info that is super annoying
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao

13:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, it's in the DDNet client
13:09 < bridge> <deathgood> this is why you the goat
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> I spend an hour writing a netlink monitor so I can listen to battery events, turns out acpi does not emit events for battery charge percentage changing

13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Guess I know how netlink works now, so not a complete waste of time
13:21 < bridge> <zhn> chillerdragon: can you send health+armor info to spectators on ddnet-insta?
13:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no snapshots mentioned
13:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> :justatest:
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wowo robyte goes down to 666
13:43 < bridge> <robyt3> We also have 666 localization strings right now :monkaS:
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apropos.
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you think freecam should show the hud stuff or not?
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am bit divided in that regard
13:52 < ChillerDragon> @zhn i created an issue will do soon
13:55 < ChillerDragon> @zhn hm as far as i can tell in game it is being sent
13:56 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1735476963.png
13:56 < ChillerDragon> nice in xorg screenshots work again
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
14:02 < bridge> <zhn> chillerdragon: its sent only if you are following anyone
14:02 < bridge> <zhn> not in freeview
14:02 < bridge> <zhn> ye, at least i want it in my client
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but what hud should it even show as spectator in freecam
14:03 < bridge> <zhn> afair standard vanilla mods send everything in snap radius
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like does a spectator care about its own health?
14:03 < bridge> <zhn> its own?
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why xD
14:04 < bridge> <zhn> lemme send you something
14:05 < bridge> <zhn> ok nvm vanilla 0.6.5 crashes on dbg_dummies
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but does vanilla keep health information when you move to spectator?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i'd argue that showing a hud seems useless
14:07 < bridge> <zhn> eh it doesn't
14:07 < bridge> <zhn> too bad
14:07 < bridge> <zhn> but it should for proper demos
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Wow, xorg so good
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah, changing to freecam in demo yeah ok
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is kinda fair
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i think that is what my mod does anyway
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since it's not _real_ free cam
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's more like a forced free cam
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> didn't know 0.6 doesnt send any health/armor info to the clients
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> even spectators
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> ah no wait
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja
14:09 < bridge> <zhn> it does
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> seems im dum dum
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja jta
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> ah no. it doesn't xd
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> only if you follow
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i see yea thats a good idea
14:10 < bridge> <zhn> strange behaviour cuz character info is sent anyway regardless if you follow or not
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are there any possible exploits?
14:11 < bridge> <zhn> just don't send it to the players ingame
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's only sent when u in spec ig not really
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but even ingame.. realistically how good could u use that info in real time xd
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well or let's do it differently
14:11 < bridge> <zhn> stream sniping can be done on dm1 but its kinda stupid, pro players do count it anyway automatically in their head
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would the game be worse if all players know the health of others xd
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> they did afair
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> weren't there client that showrd u healthbars?
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno 😄
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> afair there were
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i only play vanilla against chiller the legend
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> even on 0.7 but its client+server bundle
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> knowing the health if your opponent does not is for sure an advantage
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no need to laser aim when the enemy has 1 hp can just gun spray him down
14:14 < bridge> <zhn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1322915674426834994/screenshot_2024-12-29_19-14-04.png?ex=67729cbb&is=67714b3b&hm=7de7ab76897c15ae0b13e802041fcb2c2004d177a47cc1a00535eb86cedfaa4d&
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hax
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sure but switching weapon and all shit at the same time is also not easy xD
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wth is that xD
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does ``sv_strict_spectate_mode 0`` help @zhn ?
14:16 < bridge> <zhn> aaand with healthbar

14:16 < bridge> <zhn> huh? ill check it on road
14:16 < bridge> <zhn> gotta go
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah no it would just make it even stricter
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't think i want to create git diff to ddnet just for custom clients ._. @zhn you can try getting it into ddnet :p 
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao

14:39 < bridge> <learath2> Add AI to console
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> `bind the a button to the action of running left`
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah extra verbose AI mode
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the old chatgpt versions that couldnt answer with yes or no
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but with a full text xD
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> Also add dictation, so you can prompt it with speech
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is actually even cool xD
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tho you could argue if you don't have eyes, playing teeworlds is probably not really your hobby xD
14:44 < bridge> <louis> add ai for editor plz
14:44 < bridge> <learath2> `create me a fun and engaging gores map`
14:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Make Linear v2

17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> welcome
17:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/issues/1645
17:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what's with opensource people butthurting about forks nowadays.
17:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it happens more frequently for the past few years i feel like
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> > Restrictions
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> > The user may not:
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> > a) Reverse engineer, modify, decompile, or disassemble the extension's source code.
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> Lol, isn't that illegal to forbid that ?
17:36 < bridge> <chairn> anyway, it's not enforceable at all
17:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i mean they had an apache license for this, idk 30 lines of theme code
17:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> then just force push nuked everything wrote a dumb license and going after people
17:39 < bridge> <eidderFsT> lol

17:40 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i don't think ddnet android like my phone
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have this too, in some beta it still worked lol
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is your cutout so big btw?
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and why is your phone 4:3 xd
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think what he tried was to first make his theme great, then change the license and delete any evidence of it xD
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and now he claims copyrights problems
17:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> foldable
17:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> its more 1:1 than 4:3 i think
17:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> although still not exactly 1:1 i guess
17:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> yes, the camera is on the corner of the screen

17:49 < bridge> <eidderFsT> although most fullscreen apps handles cutout by themselves during render nowadays

19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> start by learning to read
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> error: cannot convert ‘`int (*)(void*, int)’ to ‘const char*`’
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> function pointer to char pointer
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> but that’s not his code
19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> The function has the correct signature in the bundled wavpack 4 tiny encoder, so `-DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON` should fix this
19:42 < bridge> <huuge_> how do i fix this?
19:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeW:
19:57 < bridge> <zwelf2> meetup starting now. Please write me if you cant find us 🙂
21:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> Add `-DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON` in your call to `cmake`
21:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you know how a server can force a certain specmode?
21:54 < bridge> <EGYT> i am still waiting for «Ім'я/Назва» issue to become fixable 😔
21:58 < bridge> <EGYT> for sake of my sanity...
23:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i almost got snapshots to work
23:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> was not that hard to implement
