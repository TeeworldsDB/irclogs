00:04 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted to add something like crashpad with a post crash messagebox asking if you want to upload the dump
00:07 < bridge> <totar> we will get 100,000 device lost asserts
02:36 < bridge> <Peakies> .
06:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why ask the user @learath2 ? Whatâ€™s the problem with just doing it?
06:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure how hard it is to even run code after the client crashed. Maybe this would require the launcher first.
06:42 < bridge> <animepdf> It can be post-run prompt, like "last time your client exited unexpectedly, do you want to report itðŸ¤“?
