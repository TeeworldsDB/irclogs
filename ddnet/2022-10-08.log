01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-py/-/blob/6d556b62a7763a13c9a0befdebc5421bf85a7ef3/scripts/menu_background.py here it is :)
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I have released twmap-py 0.4.0 now. The biggest change, besides the license change to AGPL, is that 1 = 1 tile/100% everywhere now, so the fixed point numbers can be used intuitively now (quad position x = 1.5 is now 1.5 tiles right of the map origin, before you'd need to do `int(1.5 * 2**15)`)
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I also pushed two fun scripts I created :)
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `client-uptime.py` creates the client-uptime map that displays how long the client in the style of a digital display
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `menu-background.py` converts an image/gif/video into a menu background map
01:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Hey guys I just saw that when you click the button "Join Tutorial Server" on the welcome page it tries to join an ipv6 address
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i just wanna get this done with
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295908390956433410/1027702787041144902/Run_View.demo.mp4
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> is this run cycle ready to ship or is there anything else i need to attend to
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i 
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> -made the body bounce less
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> -fixed the foot going back too much
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> -made the heel touch the ground going to front
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> sad ending
03:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Looks great to me
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> daft punk
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways ill wait until @Not Keks reviews this once again
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Looks smooth, but need to test myself xd
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What you need to attend to is removing it completely /s
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well time to install gentoo
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just gotta remember to not delete my uefi partition this time
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dont forget to make benchmarks xdd
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have windows to benchmark against i guess
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want to know the diff between march native, o3, lto
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and default packaging 
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> OS wide
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lol
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> windows
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to benchmark
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pick 2-3 favorite games
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and apps
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and check if they run better
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 2 lazy i just wanna install gentoo rn -.-
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even have steam on nixos
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then at least check how long compiling takes
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that's what makes it most unattractive to me ðŸ˜„
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gentoo?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> compiling ROCM from an arch packages took like 1.5h
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lel
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> self compiling simply slow
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What cpu
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3800x
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have 5600x
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah gl
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what packages u use
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'd use smth like kde which already takes 1h to compile xD
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> firefox slow too
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u should at least estimate 2h i guess
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ohh
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gcc was also insanly slow i think
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> llvm is insanly huge too
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and required for mesa
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so maybe better estimate 3h
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Kek
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The compile time thing is only a problem during the initial setup imo
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can just compile single updates in the background
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gcc, llvm, rust are pretty slow though as they usually bootstrap all the way
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Boost is another one that's notoriously slow
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i hope its doing its thing
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I left it doing the new @world thing
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And went out xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I left it doing the new @world thing
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I left it doing the new @ world thing
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> When can we uwe c++23 ?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I need this :BASED:
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 I end up missing the generated files way too obvious. Any chance we can somehow trigger generation at the beginning of compilation at all times?
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> s/ovious/often
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> somtimes my brain just breaks
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> Can we get 10x faster snapfinditem pls? @Robyt3 u interested? github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/e6b8518b49c353963af35efad8465d9066fb819e
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> ou can discord do links without https:// ?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/e6b8518b49c353963af35efad8465d9066fb819e here u go then
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> go jupstar gotta increase those fps
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wont give much
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> 10 TIMES MORE FPS
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> pog
16:42 <+ChillerDragon> yea watever i managed to crack my pr done without it :D
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah give me 10 times more fps chillerdragon
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i sadly got none :c
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 100k fps is 1/10th million fps
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> but according to lordsk you can make findsnap 10 times faster in debug mode
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> he has good marketing in his commit message
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i approve
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah then do it^^
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> i dont get a single line of dis code
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> skill issue
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe it helps with enough traffic going on
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> 10times faster sounds like it could have impact on a snap spammed server
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we will not find out until you do it
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> i wont
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> well not before i got 0.7 working
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> im back to 1 step fordward and 2 back :D
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I think we already did a similar optimization
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast I remember reading about it, maybe when trml introduced switch states to the snap?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Most of the changes from https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2129 are undone again by fixing an issue with demos in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2216
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> ou
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how to hide emerge build logs and only show x of y lines etc?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I never tried it but there is a setting for it. It enables automatically if you enable parallel builds
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only have my phone with me so can't check, but you should be able to google around for it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe do `man emerge` and look for quiet
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> --quiet-build y
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Works
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how far is it
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> emerge --jobs --load-average 12
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> For best right
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Seems like yes
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im just finishing building kde
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lol, why did u even build it ðŸ˜„
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wanna try kde
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but anyway, it builds since more than 3h already isnt it?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I wasnt home
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so you stopped it?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And  think 20-30 mins passed
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whats a good load average to use full resources
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have 12 threads
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Make.conf has j12
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not so easy to figure out tbf, hyperthreading, ram limitations, how well the individual builds parallelize all make it really annoying to figure out
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 32gb ram
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> -pipe
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, so you have enough ram. If you donâ€™t mind emerge using your whole cpu then load average 12.0 makes sense
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it will make your computer pretty much unusable while things build
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i need to build this to hade a desktop
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, for the initial build thatâ€™s fine yeah
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> -pipe is nice too yeah, you have the ram for it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its there already
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Time to buy a threadripper
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I donâ€™t think I ever built kde or gnome. Lxde took me about half an hour the time I tried it
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iâ€™m honestly just too used to tiling wms now, donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever really go back
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> kde build is bit annoying bcs it doesnt build multiple (independent projects) at once, so u often waste time for the cmake .. command
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be nicer if they more CPU bound
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but maybe gentoo fixed that ofc, i just used kdesrc-build
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can easily add 25% of load
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with 12 cores, -j15 should be faster
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> with 12 cores, -j15 should be the fastest
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well he said 12 threads. And also tarhetting a load average of 12 in that config will run multiple makes with -j12 each
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Targetting*
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i already showed u can easily go much higher
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> without real effect
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except maybe more ram usage ðŸ˜„
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u also build gentoo with ninja?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, not all packages build with ninja
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one more thing that should be integrated into emerge imo, it should be actively controlling the total amount of jobs instead of total amount of builds
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Launching 3 make -j12's at the same time isn't exactly the sanest of things
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in summary
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i lost all day compiling, i got kde without any app
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tomorrow more
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im gonna play now xD
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i should ditch kde
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kde-apps are 300 things to emerge lol
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah kde games
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for kids
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> compile them
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill remove kde tomorrow
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> peace in rest
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you mean your build fails because the generated files aren't there? then some dependency information is apparently wrong
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Voxel nice, looks much more like running now gj
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thanks ^^
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now the non running even looks worse at the edge of where the animation changes xD
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the walking generally looks weird now xD
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i didnt do the walking tho, matricks did LOL
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i know
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think if i change the walking id be twice as flamed
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo if its well done its fine, u can get used to improvements
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think the running really looks like running now
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thats good!
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it indeed looks great!
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm going out for supper, but in the meantime, I want to think about what to do next.
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I want there to be a way where if you, say, scan a folder for images, it will also check its directories if possible. If you have a folder inside your skins folder that isn't accounted for. And the Readd function is kind of useless if you also have folders in that.

22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea and that is a reoccurring pain. And can stay undiscovered during development until the build folder is wiped. I find it quite tricky to then fix those issues months later when cloning the repo on a new machine.
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've never seen this before
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is your setup different from mine?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what OS do you use?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Only happend to me in the last few years since I switched to Linux
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I only ever compile on linux
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're talking about ddnet, right?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what distribution do you use?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But across repos. Seen it in ddnet++ and even in F-DDrace once.
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Itâ€™s a issue in the code base
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Not on the os
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If you are curious I can try getting my broken state from today to not work again
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im sure if I mix different issues but itâ€™s always the generated code
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im not sure if I mix different issues but itâ€™s always the generated code
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I got it in my vanilla protocol debug branch today. I probably messed up some c++ basics and includes but the end result was a missing include of generated protocol. I ended up doing random restructuring until it worked. But during that time I kinda wished that the could would be generated and linked as early as possible to avoid such issues but not sure how bad that would be
