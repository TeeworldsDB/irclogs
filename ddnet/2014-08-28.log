00:25 < Savander> good night ^^
00:25 <@deen> good night
00:26 < _KinG> what is ddforce?
00:27 <@deen> it was a new ddrace server
00:27 <@deen> but now it's vanilla servers i think
01:14 <@deen> Well, I guess worse things than a DDoS could happen during a tournament^^
01:16 <@deen> Like the streamer who got a SWAT team called to his house
03:26 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/status has a Teamspeak monitor now
03:37 <@deen> (since the server is empty, click show empty servers)
07:58 < laxa> deen: it's not working, I am always on the teamspeak :D.
08:18 < EastByte> deen: I'm just blind
08:18 < EastByte> "It's also possible to use from module import nil if one wants to import the module but wants to enforce fully qualified access to every symbol in module."
09:13 < laxa_work> Hello from work !
09:17 < EastByte> Hello from home :)
09:22 < laxa_work> Well, I am not unhappy at work, so enjoy your life at home xD, I'll enjoy mine at work !
09:22 < laxa_work> deen: ok, I know why you could't use serverinfo !
09:23 < laxa_work> deen: you need to use a server before doing so
09:23 < laxa_work> so after the "use port=9987" you can do serverinfo
09:23 < EastByte> how did he try to implement it?
09:23 < EastByte> using a php framework?
09:25 < laxa_work> no idea, but he failed xD
10:44 < bor> deen: have you changed the ssh port ?
11:10 <@deen> bor: yes
11:11 < EastByte> good morning deen 
11:11 <@deen> good morning
11:12 < EastByte> from zlib import nil <- is what I wanted
11:12 <@deen> I don't see how i failed
11:12 <@deen> EastByte: ok!
11:12 < EastByte> you just failed :D
11:12 <@deen> teamspeak status totally works
11:12 < laxa_work> deen: is that you ? https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-1/c36.36.448.448/s160x160/260168_101854019911699_6840332_n.jpg?oh=720fd339c0920019106f9ea33433a67e&oe=5471032C&__gda__=1416100960_ba3c1ffdcfdb4c8ebd50a7742bb5c7fc
11:13 <@deen> laxa_work: how did you find that?!
11:13 < laxa_work> facebook ?
11:14 <@deen> nice, i don't have facebook
11:14 <@deen> and that's probably not me
11:14 < laxa_work> ok xD
11:14 < laxa_work> Well, you failed the teamspeak status server
11:14 < EastByte> deen: ah specific channel are listed?
11:14 < laxa_work> at least, it's not working
11:15 <@deen> laxa_work: of course it's working
11:15 <@deen> laxa_work: i'm in one of the channels and see my self on http://ddnet.tw/status
11:15 < EastByte> deen: I don't see myself there
11:15 <@deen> EastByte: takes 2 minutes to refresh
11:15 < EastByte> ah okay
11:16 < EastByte> deen: is every channel of ddnet listed like that?
11:16 < EastByte> 105
11:16 <@deen> yes
11:16 < EastByte> 1-5
11:16 < EastByte> okay
11:16 < laxa_work> deen: wtf, I am on the TS and I can't see myself...
11:16 <@deen> laxa_work: not on a ddnet channel
11:16 < laxa_work> Ohhhhh
11:17 < laxa_work> I now understand what you did
11:17 <@deen> why would i monitor your other channels?^^
11:17 < EastByte> yay I'm listed
11:18 <@deen> also, i was using the python-ts3 library
11:18 < laxa_work> http://ljdchost.com/eZE08D6.gif
11:18 <@deen> still needed to do the use port=blabla by hand
11:18 < laxa_work> deen: serverinfo works after the "use xxx"
11:19 <@deen> yes, i know
11:20 <@deen> laxa_work: the other facebook profile pics for my name are better
11:21 < laxa_work> Are you denis or dennis ?
11:21 < EastByte> denis xd
11:22 < laxa_work> there is only one denis felsing on facebook, and I linked you his picture
11:22 < laxa_work> and you are not on Linkedin either :(
11:24 <@deen> hi bor, yes i changed the port
11:25 < bor> hi , can you pm me the new port ?
11:25 < laxa_work> put it here
11:25 < laxa_work> so everyone can try to crack it
11:25 < bor> tnx
11:58 <@deen> good morning CookieMichal 
11:59 < CookieMichal> Hello deen :)
12:03 < CookieMichal> Imma download TS3 ;>
12:10 < CookieMichal> Is it possible to check how many players are on server using terminal?
12:10 <@deen> on what server?
12:10 <@deen> teamspeak server?
12:10 < CookieMichal> Teeworlds
12:10 <@deen> you could write a script for that
12:10 < CookieMichal> But how should it work?
12:11 < CookieMichal> I have no idea how to do that from shell
12:11 < EastByte> it requests the server info and prints it
12:12 <@deen> for example like this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/teeworlds.py#L337
12:12 <@deen> and it's used like this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet.py#L352
12:13 < EastByte> you might also use this:
12:13 < EastByte> https://github.com/east/twstat/blob/master/twsrv.js
12:13 < CookieMichal> Thanks :)
12:18 < _KinG> deen: 
12:18 <@deen> yes?
12:18 < _KinG> deen: they are persian guys
12:18 <@deen> what?
12:18 < _KinG> tcomes to server and calls vote they don't want people to play in our servers
12:18 < _KinG> tu saw them
12:19 <@deen> did you tell them to stop?
12:19 < _KinG> voting just to kick
12:19 < _KinG> i told them but the "nane saied" told me that i won't let people to play in your sergvers
12:19 < _KinG> servers*
12:19 <@deen> so what do you need?
12:20 < _KinG> ban access
12:20 <@deen> you have that
12:20 < _KinG> but i used ban 3 and it said access denied
12:21 <@deen> oh right, you can't^^
12:21 <@deen> but you can call vote, and then force
12:22 < _KinG> i can't when i'm alone is server ^^
12:22 < _KinG> need 5 guys
12:22 < EastByte> xd
12:22 <@deen> ok, now it works

12:25 < EastByte> that is stil lonline?
12:25 < CookieMichal> Nope
12:26 < CookieMichal> What is it supposed to be? :D
12:26 < EastByte> a jump and run
12:26 < CookieMichal> But I can click and create blocks and that's all :D
12:26 < EastByte> I failed on physics :/
12:27 < CookieMichal> Oh :/
12:28 < EastByte> math isn't my thing xd
12:28 < CookieMichal> I have found a few days ago cross platform audio library which supports mp3 and of course there must be a problem ;-; It doesn't support HTTPS :c
12:29 < EastByte> audio lib? http? what?
12:31 < CookieMichal> Library called FMOD. It's cross platform. It can create streams (you don't need to download whole song) from the internet. It doesn't support HTTPS, only HTTP.
12:36 < EastByte> hm
12:36 <@deen> https radio streams, great idea^^
12:37 < EastByte> secret nsa channel D:
12:38 < CookieMichal> SoundCloud. Do you know it? :I
12:38 < EastByte> ya
12:39 < CookieMichal> https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#tracks
12:39 < CookieMichal> stream_url      link to 128kbs mp3 stream       "http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/3/stream"
12:40 < CookieMichal> but the thing is that even when I request http://api.... it redirects to https://....
12:43 < CookieMichal> Hai ho
12:44 < Savander> hai
12:44 < Savander> Who asking about my servers!?!!
12:44 < EastByte> CookieMichal: you can put a proxy in the middle which is doing https for you
12:45 < CookieMichal> Yea. I can do that with node.js, but I would really prefer to don't do that. I don't trust free hosts.
12:51 < CookieMichal> I have just downloaded 327.5MB/204.9MB xd
12:51 < CookieMichal> http://is.gd/bOJWPS
12:51 < EastByte> hm

14:06 < CookieMichal> xd
14:07 < CookieMichal> deen: I think it's because of web browser is ready for such things :p
14:07 <@deen> no, it's because EastByte is a webgl wizard

18:29 <@deen> yes
18:29 < Savander> so
18:29 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/map/tunezones/
18:29 < Savander> maybe we can add smth like
18:29 < Savander> %player_name%
18:29 < Savander> inside variable
18:29 <@deen> no, please!
18:30 < Savander> so when you go into tunezone
18:30 <@deen> next you want ifs and then whiels
18:30 <@deen> whiles*
18:30 <@deen> and functions
18:30 < Savander> :c
18:30 < Savander> :(
18:30 < Savander> but look!

18:36 < Savander> you have infinite sheilds
18:36 < Savander> and infinite walls
18:36 < Savander> too much walls make me crash
18:37 <@deen> can you reproduce in gdb?
