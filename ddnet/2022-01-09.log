11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki I tried your new change but the time looks wrong for me: https://ddnet.tw/releases/
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, actually my linux setup's problem
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems to work, nice
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try to make it prettier later by always padding with a zero if <10

12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do it by setting this in options to 2-digit
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (i cant code rn)
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki sounds like that should be set to the OS/browser default
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think some places are better using the 01 instead of 1 so it looks aligned and easier to read
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the finishes
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe thats me

15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> Hi, idk if it is a bug in code or something but whenever i press mouse1 which may fire instantly, it has a few milisecs delay. Could you please check if you didnt make any mistakes in code for version on mac? It has been happening since last update. Pls, i cant play my favourite game
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try turning off vsync
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> what is vsync?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> omg it really works, thx
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I had the same experience on macOS
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, maybe it was really my change that made vsync worse though: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4447
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hey,
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> have a question about coloring skins in Teeworlds. We don't quite understand it yet. 
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> So HSL is the mode you use to actually color skins right? But it seems like there is also a custom converter to handle boundaries, is that correct?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Applying either rgb or hsl to skins don't match in-game colors right now on our web-version :/
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://skins.tw/api/render/cammo/255,0,0/255,0,0 
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> e.g
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes there's a limit
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess to stop ppl from making completely black / white skins
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> exactly
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> would be nice to have a formular for that
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We re-map the L component of HSL so that's one thing you are probably getting wrong
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The second thing we do is making the skin greyscale then remap the greys so the average grey is rbg(192, 192, 192)
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The clamping you can find in color.h and/or a .h file in game/server
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen I have now extended the ddnet_properties binary of the libtw2 https://github.com/Patiga/libtw2/tree/pr-extend-ddnet-properties
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> extended it with some more tiles, grouped some tiles together
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Cool, let me run that over our existing maps
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why do some ranges have remappings, and others not?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its for some tiles which have equivalent purposes for sorting in this way
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> PR incoming?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> there is a tile to give endless hook and one to give endless hook map-wide
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sec
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> take your time
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just wanted to know if one is planned
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I forgot how to build it ðŸ˜„
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cargo build --release` fails for me with:
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> error[E0463]: can't find crate for `gamenet_teeworlds_0_6`
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>  --> tools/src/bin/dump.rs:5:1

23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't find crate
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> copy the file into an up-to-date version of my repo
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems to use the most recent version, but the repo is old
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, that explains it
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll rebase
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah wait
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's an unrelated tool
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do `cargo build --release --bin=ddnet_properties`
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also did a git reset --hard, and it's building now
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen what is the BONUS tile? the tile that removes time from your timer? (should be grouped with the add time tile?)
