10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 in OnInit, the skin loading fails (probably skins not yet initialized)
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, I guess we'll loop through all skins every frame
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe you could set it oninit of cskins?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> i have a cuestion if in server browser i have 0/64 players but in the server i have 13/64 when you see the server info i can get banned?
14:40 <+ChillerDragon> i think only the other way around is a bannable offense
14:40 <+ChillerDragon> faking player stats to increase the ranking is illegal for sure. But I doubt anyone cares about hiding players in master.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Okey ty a lot chiller
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> @ChillerDragon.*  you know why if i disconect my dummy i get crash in my server ?
14:42 <+ChillerDragon> run a debugger
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> dummy=bots
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> Okey i will check it
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> ty

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> what value is checking the players in the server ? :x
15:58 <+ChillerDragon> yikes https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1593179874.png
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i think u were right when pointing out that using printable characters doesnt help to debug
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1593175141.png
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> i thought if i run into any errors i can quickly look at the raw data and be like easy this went wrong :D
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Since after going out of `/spec` there are the spawn particles, maybe also keep the kill ones when going into `/spec`?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen idk if you get mention if it is added in edits, so... https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/issues/87#issuecomment-650188190 :c
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> this time I at least understood some parts of the code >.>
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that looks good
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <i0nut> for what is this chat?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> In i.e. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/releases.py#L76 (and 10 other files) there's `<span title="%dx%d">%s</span>` that creates title (showing up on hovering over mapname) with width & height of map, in a way that many wouldn't guess what it stands for, so: would be better to simply remove that info, as it's probably not much useful - if someone even knows it can be checked this way - or to add explainatio

17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @i0nut for people who are interested in DDNet development
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> improving the game, website etc
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <i0nut> oh
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <i0nut> ok
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so ddnet-scripts are not in sync with website, since there's no commit :f
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope üòÑ
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i heard someone use their tablets to us linux distributives
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i heard someone use their tablets to us linux distributives

19:56 <+Obito634> hello dear Deen
19:57 <+Obito634> I found some fakers, who faked me. I heard that there have no global ban system, but you can ban these 3 guys from ddnet fng?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> FNG is not DDNet's
19:57 <+Obito634> But they named: DDnet FNG
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @onby that's case for u
20:00 <+Obito634> Oh then i should to ask noby about bans, ye?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just wait there, just noticed there are actually "DDNet FNG2" servers, so my bad
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> depends on which servers it actually was
20:04 <+Obito634> on Rus ddnet and Ger
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> —Å—á–∞—Å –±—ã –æ–±–∏—Ç–æ —Ñ–µ–π–∫–∞—Ç—å :kek:

20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> why ban fakers
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can tell them stearnly not to fake you
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ is about the best you or we can do
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u know who they are u can fake them back :troll:
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Imagine being on DDNet 14.0 and update to 14.1 and then have to update again to 14.2
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> and again
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wtf only 1 pr on ddnet
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> right, looks so odd
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti because we had a problem with the autoupdater and the only way to fix it is by having to do 2 updates
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> imagine if emotes made sounds omg
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :greenthing:
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with the 0 emote delay :justatest:
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> :feelsamazingman:
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Bring back Emojis to DDNet client
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> With all Emojis that are on discord :troll:
23:49 <+Obito634> I talked with them, but they wont they playing stupid peoples and saying that they are NO faked me, and still faking
23:49 <+Obito634> and continiue*
