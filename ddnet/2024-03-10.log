00:00 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, if that's the case then you could either try adding a function to set the URL, or ignore the additional two lines of code which would be necessary if this function doesn't support varargs
00:00 < bridge> <zhn> yeah just was curious
00:00 < bridge> <zhn> thanks anyway!
00:32 < bridge> <zhn> i had two first arguments as `const char *` and used `...format(__printf__, 2, 4)...` instead of 3 (forgor about `this` passing as well in ctor)
00:45 < bridge> <nouaa> does anyone know how to contact the owner of this account?
00:45 < bridge> <nouaa> https://github.com/MyNewBie
01:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nouaa go here https://github.com/ChillerDragon/github-meta/issues/5 write "@MyNewBie i want to contact you my contact options are xyz" as a comment and hope he has email notifications on ping :D 
01:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nouaa why do you want to contact him? o.O
01:17 < bridge> <nouaa> I have an important request to make!
01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> delete code? :D 
01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am having a hard time finding a single commit from this dude
01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like all he has on his github is forks and copied repos from others
01:17 < bridge> <nouaa> no, not really, just sensitive information in a repo
01:18 < bridge> <nouaa> :PeepoStare:
01:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye go ping him
01:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in the github chat portal
01:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this guy is just an archive
01:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> should add his github to some awesome-teeworlds-mods list xd

01:26 < bridge> <sedonya> oh
01:26 < bridge> <sedonya> cool
01:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea idk whats wrong tho 
01:26 < bridge> <furo321> Aren't color options HSLA?
01:27 < bridge> <sedonya> huh?
01:27 < bridge> <sedonya> g_Config.m_ScColorLocalConsole == HSLA?
01:27 < bridge> <furo321> Try `color_cast<ColorRGBA>(ColorHSLA(g_Config.m_ScColorRemoteConsole))`
01:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ```void CGraphics_Threaded::SetColor(ColorRGBA Color)```
01:29 < bridge> <sedonya> work
01:29 < bridge> <sedonya> MACRO_CONFIG_COL -> HSLA
01:29 < bridge> <sedonya> bruh
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am not aware of any. But you should be able to go to src/game/client/components/camera.cpp and play with its coordinates a bit. Maybe do a random + and y in OnRender() and that should shake.
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> * and - for x and y mean \*
02:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf
02:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > Lua does not have regular expressions, mainly because a full regular expression library would be bigger than Lua itself.
02:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://stackoverflow.com/a/6192354/6287070
02:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> finally a non bloated language? time to switch from bash to lua
02:23 < bridge> <sporkington_> how does ddnet store tee colors?
02:23 < bridge> <peter44h> I wish gdb used lua
02:23 < bridge> <peter44h> CPython is so horrid
02:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use JPython then <:troll:490644344341135380>
02:24 < bridge> <peter44h> The only positive thing I can say about it is "it works"
02:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how often are irc logs synced? they are quite behind https://ddnet.org/irclogs/
02:31 < bridge> <learath2> I’ve been telling y’all for years. Lua is goated, if only we the software people hadn’t abandoned it
05:18 < bridge> <miguilim> the custom color values?

08:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nah it’s bug there is already an issue for it
09:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: if u ever feel like u have nothing to do, i have a challenge for you, you can fix ci for my ddnet server xDDD
09:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I will never have nothing todo lol but send error
09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ehm
09:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also since when do you do server dev?
09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i had to add a few lines to ddnet server
09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> which just writes `1` or `0` to shared memory xD
09:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what that means but sounds sus
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @miguilim thanks a lot for the hint that this is a snap single message i found my bug thanks to that :) !!!!!!!!!!!
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i am still starring at the same message being a bit confused
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon>
09:26 < ws-client> https://twnet.zillyhuhn.com/?d=08+04+02+9c+6b+cb+da+42+0e+07+06+00+40+27+6e+61+6d+65+6c+65+73+73+20+74+65+65+27+20+65+6e+74+65+72+65+64+20+61+6e+64+20+6a+6f+69+6e+65+64+20+74+68+65+20+67+61+6d+65+00+06+0b+0f+9a+51+9b+51+b3+92+ad+b9+0b+9f+01+00+03+00+06+00+00+00+00+00+14+00+00+01+0b+00+da+c8+f0+91+02+cc+b0+d0+b1+02+da+e8+d8+f0+0b+ff+ff+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+ff+fb+f7+0f+40+de+e4+d0+b1+03+ff+ad+98+a1+01+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+

09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The second message starts at ``06 0b 0f 9a 51 9b 51 ...`` right? Thats the snap
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because before there is ``67 61 6d 65 00`` which is ``g  a  m  e  \0``  so that the end of the joined the game message
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> That would make ``06 0b`` the chunk header right?
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``0f`` is NETMSG_SNAPSINGLE
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait ...
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye 06 0b is flags=0 size=107 that sounds about right
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am so lost in the mess of a setup that i have xxxxxxxxxxD
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710059493.png
09:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chillerdragon: your messages look so much like spam
10:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> spom
10:56 < bridge> <zhn> chiller can you encode it as base64
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn why base64 what base64? xd
11:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean in the url query parameter for compressing it? yea that sounds reasonable
11:06 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, discord divides your message in two everytime you send some packet
11:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yikes that sounds bad
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710068588.png
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what am i not getting here
12:15 < bridge> <kekomonter> Reversing open-source game xdd
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed
12:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :thonk:
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ehm what the fak
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ist the token!?
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at the end?
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and ppl hate on 0.7 xxxD
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710071385.png
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am just afk and the input always ends with 00 00 00
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the whole packet ends with 1b e8 96 48 tho
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> libtw2 says its the token. Is ddnet inserting its token at the end of every packet? For compatibility? 
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should rly look into the ddnet protocol one day :D 
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> siggraph exhibit tickets are $25
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> should i go
13:23 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller why are you doing this backwards? This is literally insane. Just look at the source??
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reading c++ is so annoying
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its ez af with heinrichs dissector
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> Then read the source of that?
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just got a bit side tracked in 0.6.5 support because heinrich does not support it. And then one of my tests used ddnet not 0.6.5 and it seems to be troll.
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 read the source of his dissector? nono i mean using the dissector to look at how it parses it is so much easier than reading code.
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Then i can verify
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I like working on the byte level it relaxes me 
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Everything seems to be working i did a new pypi release 🚀 now i can continue working on ddnet7 axaxax
13:27 < bridge> <learath2> I pray for you
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you guys think about cheat based anti ping? :D 
13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> admin only trust based client side physics
13:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if the connection is lost the client does everything locally and on reconnect informs the server of the new state. Basically like minecraft does it.
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> No
13:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> No
13:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> Nein
13:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But Minecraft mentioned
13:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I mean it should work without server edits. I might add it to chillerbot-ux then c: 
13:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: rewrite ddnet protocol in Minecraft's style
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea right
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ima add chunks for sure!
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and microsoft login
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont have any Microsoft login in  tlauncher :santatrollet:
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the ddnet protocol has the token at the end inside the potentially huffman-compressed payload. what do you mean with "compatibility"?
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> https://youtu.be/NzK11DrRdks I have to share this painful experience with someone
14:56 < suoga> anybody here?
14:57 < bridge> <kekomonter> Nope
14:57 < suoga> 0.0
15:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have a question, suoga? 🙂
15:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> protobuf is such a shit show, removing `.github` directory isnt that bad of an idea :pepeW:
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why's protobuf a shit show?
15:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (and what does that have to do with a `.github` directory?)

15:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can disable github actions in the repository settings if you'd like, I think
15:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have 3 god damn files and it's already a disaster. i have version `3.12` and everything works fine, it uses `optional` keyword and they removed it in some version of proto3 but then re-added it. `ubuntu-latest` runner has one error, `ubuntu-20.04` has different one and it just works on my machine
15:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 😦
15:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> could you simply not specify optional?
15:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think everything in protobuf 3 is optional
15:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why did they reintroduce it :pepeW:
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for compatibility with protobuf2, maybe
15:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it likely does not do anything
15:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill try to remove it

16:15 < bridge> <robyt3> You should apply that PR on your server. Or wait for 18.1, which should fix this crash client-side.
