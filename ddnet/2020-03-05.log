16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i ported ddnet dummy to 0.7, but hammerfly is slow, takes about 1-2 sec to re-hammer, an idea why?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> before starting or is every hammer late?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> every
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> calculations are the same of course, dunno why that happens
16:37 <@Learath2> is the rate correct?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym
16:39 <@Learath2> is it hammering at the correct rate?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you mean the interval?
16:40 <@Learath2> yep
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as said, there is like a 1-2 sec delay inbetween
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its 1 sec
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pretty exact afaict
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nah, more like 0.75
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nah, more like 1.25
16:44 <@Learath2> Hmm, idk how the dummy hammerfly works tbh, but it looks like it's supposed to be every 1.25s
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that doesnt make sense
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess you know how hammering works
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its like every < 0.5 sec
16:45 <@Learath2> does it hammer faster in ddnet6?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like a normal hammerfly guy
16:46 <@Learath2> this is why I hate magic constants in the code, who knows what that 12.5f is based on
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just set it to 1.25 for testing, and now it hammers faster (too fast)
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so no idea what else causes the hammer on 0.6 to be correct
16:48 <@Learath2> SendInput happens on every snap, which calls OnSnapInput, which increments m_DummyFire and sends a fire input if it's not close to a multiple of 12.5
16:49 <@Learath2> if it's close*
16:49 <@Learath2> maybe we are calling SendInput more in ddnet?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can be
16:50 <@Learath2> Are you sending input on both dummy and main tee snaps?
16:51 <@Learath2> and on CClient::Update
16:52 <@Learath2> actually on snap we only send it if there was an error
16:52 <@Learath2> so I don't see how you could be calling it less
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 btw you fucked up the client commands i guess
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in master i cannot use /w anymore
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On ddnet7 or on teeworlds?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> teeworlds client 0.7
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut is it only /w?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dunno, guess all client commands
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't be all client commands atleast /all and the commands registered by the server work
18:02 <@Learath2> it's just /w the argument list was wrong
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut hmm, how is /w supposed to work?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> from the code it seems it should only change the whisper target
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you write /w <name>, hit enter and then the whisper chat opens and you gotta write a message, hit enter again (COMPELTELY gay imho)
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Btw, what do you recommend now for my dummy hammerfly problem?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just decrease the 1.25?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean its still weird
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it is very weird, maybe ask deen? I think he wrote the original code, he might have a better idea
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut also, /w does seem to work just fine, are you sure it's broken?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it was supposed to be able to send messages instantly that's why I thought it was broken, but it's not
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you need to do it on a server that has the new stuff implemented, try out my server
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new stuff? you are running my pr?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my sevrer is up to date
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> your server has a 2mb map and we don't have http download ðŸ˜›
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll start downloading and go have dinner
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i increased the download speed.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should work in seconds
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it takes 55 seconds
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bad connection maybe? :P
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even more actually
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a 35mbit link, doubt it's the connection
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i really wonder why hammer doesnt work, well it seems like it works as expected, since the delay is pretty exactly 1.25s, but then why doesnt it behave like that in dnet?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it works just fine for me on your server aswell
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> latest client?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok well, dunno what was wrong, works now for me too
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @fokkonaut u nobo thats what is wrong:kek: :troll:
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut did you merge my commands pr in ddnet7?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dunno
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont htink so
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you didnt pr, but you can push them directly to mastr
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it needs the vanilla merge of arguments for it to work properly
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we should find a way to get it to work with 0.7.4
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe translating the argument lists to strip the things in []
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont care about supporting old clients
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you'd only support master, it's not a good idea no one is using master
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i would just not send the auto completion stuff to older clients, since they can have 22 cmds only
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyway
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't detect older clients can we?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we need a translator for the arglist anyway for the older clients
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course we can detect them, they send client version
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, we dont need to translate it if we dont send it. They can use the old chat system.
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The chat system needs to stay anyway (for binds)
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does it need to stay?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does it need to stay for binds?
