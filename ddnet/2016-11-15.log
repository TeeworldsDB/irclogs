08:37 <@deen> Fin, Ac1dBeef, nameless-tee: The hoster shut us down because of repeated DoS attacks
08:37 <@deen> The alternative would be to pay 400 € / month for each server location for better protection, which I'm not willing to pay
09:15 <+nameless-tee> Oh. This is bad. However, I haven't noticed this for the recent time on RUS server but on GER.
09:18 <+nameless-tee> Could we try another hosting without protection? I can help if so.
09:19 <@deen> They will just kick us out after a few days of DoS attacks
09:19 <@deen> Same story everywhere
10:53 <@deen> But sure, if you can show me a good and cheap hoster in Moscow, I'd be glad
10:53 <@deen> Same for Frankfurt and Chile
13:35 <+Fin> Yes i always used Russian Servers cause they had a better Ping than the homecountry ones...
13:36 <+Fin> Im from Germany
13:41 <@deen> RUS had better ping for you than GER even though you live in Germany? That's weird

13:59 <+nameless-tee> deen, maybe this one: https://en.ihor.ru/vds
14:00 <+nameless-tee> They also state: "Our data center is under Anti-DDoS protection" But I don't really know how good is it.
14:00 <@deen> looks cheap
14:01 <@deen> but you have no experience with it, right?
14:02 <@deen> their billing manager doesn't load, can't buy a server^^
14:02 <+nameless-tee> deen, No... But my friend mentioned them as a good and stable hoster.
14:04 <@deen> well, their website is broken
14:05 <+nameless-tee> weird. It works for me.
14:06 <@deen> buying doesn't, but i found out how to make it work
14:08 <@deen> I'm getting one to try for free for 3 days
14:08 <@deen> I'll set up a few DDNet servers on there then you can check how it works
14:08 <+nameless-tee> Yes, trial.
14:08 <+nameless-tee> Nice :)
14:10 <@deen> thanks for the recommendation
14:14 <@deen> Nice russian emails, I missed those already
14:15 <+Ryozuki> xD
14:16 <+nameless-tee> deen, No problem. Just ask if you need help with translation :)
14:16 <@deen> i have google
14:16 <@deen> works just fine
14:16 <+nameless-tee> Not always..
14:45 <@deen> nameless-tee: test it please
14:45 <@deen> should be running again
14:48 <@deen> Fin, Ac1dBeef You can try as well, and tell your friends
14:49 <+nameless-tee> deen, it works!
14:58 <@deen> servers in moscow are shockingly cheap
14:58 <@deen> 3 € per month for 1 GB RAM
15:00 <@deen> nameless-tee: now find me a new server in chile and frankfurt please :D
15:08 <@deen> also, will be interesting what happens on DoS attack
15:24 <+nameless-tee> deen, I have even cheaper server in Frankfurt, 1 euro (1.2 euro with VAT) with same amount RAM and ssd storage. Few sites, docker services and jabber server working on it pretty well.
15:24 <+nameless-tee> forgot the link if you are interesting: arubacloud.com
15:26 <@deen> but no ddos protection, right?
15:26 <+nameless-tee> nope
15:26 <@deen> then unfortunately useless in today's internet
15:28 <+nameless-tee> Sadly, yes. If you have some popular site/service.
