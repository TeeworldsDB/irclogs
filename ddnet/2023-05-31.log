07:35 < bridge> <Ewan> is it in the existing winapi bindings
08:43 < bridge> <Matodor> when crablang integration in ddnet?

09:20 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 https://quick-bench.com/q/hyy4fcz8FuGU_2HpTqHk3Uh8D9Y
09:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> completely ugly unoptimized shitty bad variadic template code
09:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> build like sprintf
09:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> still beats the c function easily
09:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so fuck the useless benchmarks in the outside world, if even this unoptimized, code using no SIMD can easily beat it...
09:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what is ws-client?
09:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> with gcc it's even better, i guess the constexpr simply sees through it or smth like that
09:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://i.imgur.com/e12F4KT.png
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragons super fast discord alternativeüòÇ
09:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wow
09:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> zileradreghuhn 2.0
09:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
09:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so naive variadic template code is fast, but stringstream is slow
09:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and lets be honest cpp standard manages to be slow no matter which feature
10:18 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> test
10:18 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> tf
10:35 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean you keep drifting further and further away from the initial claim, how is a bunch of constexpr templates anything similar to stringstream which uses runtime polymorphism and hopes the compiler is smart enough to devirtualize them. What you implemented is closer to `std::format` than sstream
10:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean it‚Äôs still an interesting benchmark, I‚Äôll give you that
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have u read ur own benchmark?
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Here it is faster in the second one
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So even the shitty CPP version is good enough
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the initial claim was something like "stringstream is slow"
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> Jupstar said "you could probably implement a fast version of stringstream"
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both seem to be true
10:43 < bridge> <Learath2> It tells you, with stream reuse and on that specific platform it is. On the first platform it wasn‚Äôt. I still don‚Äôt understand why one benchmark makes your case but doesn‚Äôt make mine
10:43 < ws-client> <Jupstar> anyway, if i said cpp's string streams are fast, then sry
10:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i still claim that streams are theoretically faster, except if both, formatters and stream implementations are evaluated at compile time
10:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar> then it probably doesn't matter
10:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Theoretically neither can be faster. Under the as-if rule they do the same thing they have the same optimal form for a sufficiently advanced alien compiler
10:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats the stringstream equivalent in rust?
10:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
10:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> std::basic_iostream is like a write read trait
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `String`
10:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rly?
10:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ye for strings
10:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its not utf8 right
10:47 < bridge> <Learath2> If the compiler sees through all the virtual calls, stringstream should end up being equivalent to a recursive template, if my inbrain compiler is correct that is
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want non-utf8, then `Vec<u8>`
10:47 < bridge> <ReiTW> simple question what's the point of &str if there's String
10:47 < bridge> <ReiTW> (I mean when using it)
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `&str` can point to part of a `String`
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what is std::string then
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `std::string` is like `Vec<u8>`
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> typedef basic_string<char> string;
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or `String`
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so many layers
10:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> inheritance boo
10:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the typedef isnt really inheritance
10:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its a named generic
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113388815143403590/image.png
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is
10:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
10:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> zero cost :joy:
10:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> üòÇ
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doubt
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we actually know it's not zero-cost in practice ^^
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> see `std::stringstream` vs `snprintf`
10:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah, it's the lie you get told about cpp
10:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> with static linking, lto, ofast, u might still get smth similar to zero cost
10:51 < bridge> <Learath2> It‚Äôs zero cost to a sufficiently advanced compiler
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `unique_ptr` is unfortunately also not entirely zero-cost
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `Box` is, though!
10:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pog
10:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> box is interwined deeper with the compiler in rust tho
10:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u cant implement ur own box
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not due to that
10:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no?
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> your own box is also zero-cost
10:52 < bridge> <Learath2> (unique_ptr is barely not zero-cost for an extremely specific reason)
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem with `std::unique_ptr` is the move constructor which runs code
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's almost zero-cost
10:54 < bridge> <Learath2> https://youtu.be/rHIkrotSwcc not a bad listen over breakfast
10:55 < ws-client> <Jupstar> cpp committee should go all in for performance
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "There are no zero-cost abstractions" lie!
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `Option<&i32>` is a zero-cost abstraction over C++'s `int32_t *`
10:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> click bait xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice nice
10:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/29/1.70.0-prerelease.html
10:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have yet again the urge to contribute to llvm
10:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and fix the c api
11:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but  i have time to think about my life choices when compiling llvm
11:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and end up not doing anything
11:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> is the c api also flawed? thought u worked with the cpp API xd
11:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i started working with the cpp api cuz the C api misses some features
11:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mainly the data layout api
11:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to get a type alignment and size, etc
11:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/DataLayout/
11:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this
11:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also cannot transform mlir to llvm ir via the c api
11:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but a project by the llvm author using mlir https://www.modular.com/mojo
11:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it looks pog
11:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sadly for the python syntax
11:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw* a project by the llvm author using mlir https://www.modular.com/mojo
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```python
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> struct OurBool:
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     var value: __mlir_type.i1
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     fn __init__(inout self):
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         self.value = __mlir_op.`index.bool.constant`[
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             value : __mlir_attr.`false`,
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         ]()
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can have low level ir in this lang
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR.html
11:05 < ws-client> <JStar> but pyson is evil and bites
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
11:05 < ws-client> <JStar> pyson syntax
11:05 < ws-client> <JStar> xd
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they choose python probs cuz scientists and ai devs use python
11:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > What we wanted was an innovative and scalable programming model that could target accelerators and other heterogeneous systems that are pervasive in the AI field. This meant a programming language with powerful compile-time metaprogramming, integration of adaptive compilation techniques, caching throughout the compilation flow, and other features that are not supported by existing languages.
11:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
11:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > And although accelerators are important, one of the most prevalent and sometimes overlooked ‚Äúaccelerators‚Äù is the host CPU. Nowadays, CPUs have lots of tensor-core-like accelerator blocks and other AI acceleration units, but they also serve as the ‚Äúfallback‚Äù for operations that specialized accelerators don‚Äôt handle, such as data loading, pre- and post-processing, and integrations with foreign systems. So it was clear that we couldn‚Äôt 
11:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the llvm dev is crazy
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he made llvm, swift, clang
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> etc
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why don't you like py syntax?
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like tabs used this way
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer brackets
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> {}
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11:09 < ws-client> <JStar> pyson is from hell. 100% sure about that
11:10 < ws-client> <JStar> in 10 years ppl see python, as ppl see php today xD
11:11 < bridge> <Tater> does anyone know what the point of demos saving most snapshots as deltas is? why can't they all just be "keyframes"
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> lower filesize
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> lower file size
11:11 < ws-client> <idinakhui> guys
11:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> same reason why videos don't save all frames as key frames
11:11 < ws-client> <idinakhui> stfu heinrich
11:12 < bridge> <Tater> but don't you still have to write the full size of the snapshot?
11:12 < bridge> <Tater> does it compress better?
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> go kill ur self nigger
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigger
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigger
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigger
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigger
11:12 < bridge> <Tater> :/
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigga
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigga
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> nigga
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> tater
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> ure nice
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> heinrich
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> go
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> kys
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> man
11:12 < ws-client> <idinakhui> fucking idiot
11:12 < ws-client> <JStar> chillerdragon: we have a small anarchistic problem
11:21 <+bridge> <Tater> this seems this is confusing I thought it can't deltete an item in the previous snap if that item gets changed in current snap
11:21 <+bridge> <Tater> this seems this is confusing I thought it can't delete an item in the previous snap if that item gets changed in current snap
11:22 <+bridge> <Tater> oh wait
11:22 <+bridge> <Tater> I understand
11:22 <+bridge> <Tater> ok thanks
11:23 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: why can't I set +n on this channel?
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in the client u need to snap even if it doesnt change so its not deleted right
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> server
11:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> *
11:23 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I kicked your ws-client btw
11:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the snap you produce on the server needs to be complete, correct
11:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the snapshot diffing is just an optimization, not visible to the game server code
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
11:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt know how it worked rly before, but some time ago i noticed this xd
11:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the snap you produce on the server is the snap the client sees
11:28 <+bridge> <Tater> huh I never knew the server could just save demos for all players
11:28 <+bridge> <Tater> how come that isn't used for something
11:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where would that be used?
11:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> teehistorian?
11:28 <+bridge> <Tater> post replays online?
11:28 <+bridge> <Tater> to the website
11:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, the idea is to get this done using teehistorian
11:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think Zwelf is working on that
11:29 <+bridge> <Tater> what benefit does teehistorian have
11:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> smaller file size
11:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> more space efficient iirc
11:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we produce ~1-2 GiB of teehistorian data per day
11:29 <+bridge> <Tater> so like the demo would be generated when you try to download it?
11:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
11:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's slower than I can buy hard drives
11:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so it's fine
11:30 <+bridge> <Tater> lol
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u buy hdd
11:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and do u use raid
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i understand if u dont
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> half size gone
11:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Double money gone xd
11:31 <+bridge> <Tater> drives are write only so idk if it matters much
11:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I use a zfs raidz2, I think
11:31 < Ryozuki> test
11:31 < Ryozuki> been long since i checked irc xd
11:31 <@heinrich5991> hi Ryozuki
11:32 < Ryozuki> so u dont need +v ?
11:32 < Ryozuki> or voice
11:32 <@heinrich5991> I just managed to set +n now
11:32 <@heinrich5991> so kicking the bot sufficed
11:32 < Ryozuki> is +n for registered?
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> per server or in general?
11:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in total
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> compressed or raw data?
11:32 < Ryozuki> 1gb after compression right
11:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> compressed I think
11:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> zstd
11:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> oh okay
11:32 < Ryozuki> whats the ratio more or less?
11:33 <+bridge> <Tater> probably good
11:33 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: I don't remember, can't check rn
11:33 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Do you know a number for 64 players - 24hrs?
11:33 < Ryozuki> im surprised quakenet didnt delete my account from inactivity
11:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I don't know that
11:33 < Ryozuki> rizon did sadge
11:33 <@heinrich5991> do you still have a freenode account? :p
11:33 <@heinrich5991> (I have bad news :p)
11:33 < Ryozuki> yep
11:34 < Ryozuki> inot freenode
11:34 < Ryozuki> libera
11:34 < Ryozuki> idk if i deleted my freenode acc
11:34 < Ryozuki> but im on libera anyway
11:34 <@heinrich5991> freenode deleted your freenod account
11:34 <@heinrich5991> it tried to kill itself in the most efficient way
11:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Would I be able to copy a teehistorian file after a new map has been voted? Or do I have to stop the server to not lose any information?
11:35 < Ryozuki> xD
11:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> teehistorian files are per-map
11:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so it's complete after a map change
11:35 < Ryozuki> quakenet should support sasl like libera
11:35 < Ryozuki> idk why they go this oldschool way
11:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the only thing not on a raid is my notebook
11:35 < Ryozuki> but well i didnt need to do anything cuz i had weechat automated
11:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because I only have one disk in there
11:36 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Ah I see, thats neat. Thanks
11:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm willing to archive KoG's teehistorian fiels as well, if you want me to
11:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> actually, I'm even interested in doing that ^^
11:36 <+bridge> <Tater> is it known how many finished in total exist?
11:36 <+bridge> <Tater> is it known how many finishes in total exist?

11:37 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Sure, we could upload them to a given endpoint if needed.

11:37 <+bridge> <Tater> lol
11:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> on china 10,000,000
11:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in total, we have ~22,000,000
11:38 <+bridge> <Tater> another game I play https://ch.tetr.io/ deleted replays which don't get accessed after a certain amount of time. but they get a lot more I think

11:38 <+bridge> <Tater> yes
11:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's probably less data than we have

12:05 <@heinrich5991> although I guess now you're in the spam prevention business, too :/
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> bru i built that feature just to avoid this very scenario
12:05 <@heinrich5991> why is this scenario bad?
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> because i have to ssh into my vps now
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> why is running one curl is hard
12:06 <@heinrich5991> because I'd have to look it up in the history
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> ill just build accounts and only give jupsti a pw
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> we have like 2 messages in dms xd
12:06 <@heinrich5991> perhaps you could make a curl endpoint to rejoin
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> i was hoping it never leaves
12:06 <@heinrich5991> then I don't have to learn anything new and you don't need to ssh into the vps
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> just alias it in ur bash rc xd
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> watever ill create accounts now .-.
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> still sad
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> it back on in read only mode for now
12:08 <@heinrich5991> I can also just mute it next time, if you prefer
12:08 <@heinrich5991> then it doesn't need to rejoin
12:10 <@heinrich5991> would that be better, ChillerDragon?
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer the curl :p
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> so i can unmute
12:13 <@heinrich5991> the kick you can unmute, too
12:13 <@heinrich5991> by joining the channel again
12:13 <@heinrich5991> but yea, the mute you can't
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> yea then i prefer kick

12:26 < Ryozuki> https://weechat.org/scripts/source/emoji.lua.html/
12:28 < Ryozuki> good thing weechat allows me to upgrade it without closing
12:28 < Ryozuki> with /upgrade
12:28 < Ryozuki> > WeeChat can restart the new binary, in place, using the /upgrade command: the buffer contents and non-SSL connections are preserved.
12:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > non-SSL connections are preserved.
12:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> suspicious
12:29 < Ryozuki> why
12:29 < Ryozuki> i guess it cant preserve ssl connections
12:29 < Ryozuki> > The SSL connections are lost during upgrade and are restored automatically after the upgrade (reload of SSL sessions is currently not possible with GnuTLS).
12:30 < Ryozuki> hi
12:30 < Ryozuki> i upgraded

15:48 <+bridge> <gerdoe> which one
16:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ask me
16:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
16:17 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I already let discord eat my computer anyway
17:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://plv.mpi-sws.org/c11comp/popl15.pdf
17:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ignoring the mismatched braces and the fact that the unsynchronized access invokes UB. Do you think there is a possibility that each thread ends up with a different value of `tid`?
17:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1113492756824858754/image0.jpg
17:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> I say it's possible if by some miracle all the execution lines up perfectly and it doesn't all get optimized to `tid = 0` since there is no sequence guarantee here
17:45 <+bridge> <Learath2> The answer sheet says it's not possible
17:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ub ub ub
17:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice naming
17:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> very readable
17:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's a uni professor. My standards aren't high. He obviously wants to make a point that access to i isn't synchronized but ignores the fact that such access immediately makes everything so undefined that his question makes no sense
18:07 <+bridge> <Chairn> i is probably optimized out...
18:07 <+bridge> <gerdoe> how?
18:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> it also works the other way around : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9371238/why-is-reading-lines-from-stdin-much-slower-in-c-than-python
18:14 <+bridge> <Chairn> 10 characters for int32, 19 for int64
18:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: best pw ever, thanks
18:17 <+bridge> <Chairn> damn, i didn't understand anything in that üòÑ
18:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> C itself is flawed
18:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is another issue
18:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot the name
18:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> damn
18:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im sad
18:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont remember the url
18:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe it was about strict aliasing
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> c has to make a step back: c--
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw i recommend this guy blog too
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.ralfj.de/
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot to tell u
18:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lot of insight
19:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar
19:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> >  ChillerDragon: best pw ever, thanks 
19:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice u in
19:25 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Jupeyy_Keks ddos on alive server
19:26 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> seems like they have different ips cause we can't kick them
19:46 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't know who the attacker is bcs I don't that problem in Repeek. Does it have a relation that the fng source code isn't based on ddnet so it hasn't a patch in it?
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, they are real connections
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he simply opens lot of connections
19:47 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :( hard to ban then
19:53 <+bridge> <ReiTW> that's not a ddos
19:53 <+bridge> <ReiTW> just a spam
19:54 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ddos of my chat!
19:54 <+bridge> <ReiTW> :justatest:
19:54 <+bridge> <ReiTW> our chat gets spammed too, but currently idc
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u collect the IPs?
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he can't have infinive of them
19:55 <+bridge> <ReiTW> no, basically we should have done that since the beginning but laziness > work
19:55 <+bridge> <ReiTW> we'll just use strace to get them & fill an ipset table lmao
19:55 <+bridge> <ReiTW> laziness lvl increased
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
20:10 <+bridge> <Chairn> i can't imagine when the whole internet will be on ipv6...
20:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> doesnt ipv6 make this easier
20:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it represents geographical coordinates or smth like that
20:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> i don't think so, there's just more of those
20:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> so does ipv4
20:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's sad, then that should be changed üòÑ
20:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes i have the feeling, companies want ddos and cyber crime xd
20:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can europe not prevent this cleanly
20:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't be impossible
20:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> although, they do not really represents coordinate afaik, it's just that the ICANN gives a or several ranges of ips to each country
20:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> but now, they also sell them directly to big companies too
20:55 <+bridge> <Zeral> is it possible to add a search bar into the f1 console to search for keywords?
20:56 <+bridge> <Robyt3> yes, has already been suggested #5815
20:56 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5815
20:56 <+bridge> <Zeral> i see, thx
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> afternoon
