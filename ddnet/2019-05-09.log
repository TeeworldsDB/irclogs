21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> XD
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen when are you planning to release?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the hand of the tee is transparent
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the current source
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I looked at the foot and it's not transparent
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i wanted to get @fokkonaut's time format thing and @timakro's isddnet in aswell (with a netobj instead of their netmsgs)
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I fixed the foot üòõ
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you missed the hand
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, so I'll wait for these fixes
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll fix the hand in a minute
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah hey
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the others will take a few days?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probs
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll do them tonight
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :o
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> give me tomorrow to test, and we can release tomorrow?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the skin selector only shows my current skin
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also a important bug to fix
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heh, true
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait what?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/ca888c56a20622951b6ea011dfcdb9277599281d#diff-4767dc694becb1f7e4a07ed2b9f4cfcbL611
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay that should have been obvious, but in my defense I was scared of @deen
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> scared? üòÑ
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why am I scary?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen how do u decide whether its for example 12.3.2 or 12.4?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Only bugs fixed -> 12.3.2
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Big features added -> 12.4
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anything inbetween -> ???
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was my huge patch that broke a lot of things, idk felt responsible üòõ
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> As long as you feel responsible I don't mind
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you make a big change and run off, then I'm mad
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im also scared when i do some changes t hat could break things
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this yellow thing a new feature
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/576140694536847400/unknown.png
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never saw yellow
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> :poggers:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> line highlight
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's old
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah ye xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q:  Is it normal for the prefixed skins to be displayed in the skin selector?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should we maybe hide those now that we have a proper prefix selector?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but then you don't see how the prefixed skins will actually look ingame
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, actually no
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the skin prefix only showed your own skin, not the other ones
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/576141829666242585/screenshot-20190509222146.png
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could employ some trickery in the loop to show the prefixed versions
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in the selector that is
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I don't have git set up on this computer, I wonder what I set my user.name to üòÑ
22:22 <+Ryozuki> u pinged Q on irc :D
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure Q can take it
22:24 <+Learath2> apparently i used my normal email in my commits
22:24 <+Learath2> I wonder why i don't get more spam
22:24 <+Ryozuki> maybe github protects is somehow or maybe spammers dont care bout u
22:24 <+Ryozuki> i also dont get spam on mine
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not protected in the circleci atleast
22:26 <+Learath2> I wonder how bors will feel if I push to master right now
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pissed
22:26 <+Ryozuki> he will hate u
22:26 <+Ryozuki> or she
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or it
22:27 <+Learath2> guess I'll make a PR :)
22:27 <+Ryozuki> jupstar u still dont know why that graphic bugs with opengl happens right?
22:28 <+Learath2> wair the hand shouldn't be transparent
22:28 <+Learath2> wait how do you even get the hand to show up?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/576143470742470676/unknown.png
22:28 <+Learath2> are tees supposed to have hands?
22:28 <+Learath2> so many questions
22:28 <+Ryozuki> ofc
22:28 <+Ryozuki> they must handle the weapons of mass destruction
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ how did you even see that the small hand is transparent lol
22:29 <+Ryozuki> they literally hold a grenade launcher thats bigger than the tee
22:30 <+Ryozuki> i only see second hand when u hook and u rly must be looking at it
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with pistol u see it directly i think
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tee focus in gores
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 for the prefix stuff: you shouldnt hide prefix skins, some people use it as their default skin. (this is also not implemeneted yet: if someone uses a prefix skin as normal skin, the  you turn on prefix, his skin will be *_vanilla)
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How does the CLight work? I mean how do I get a nice overview of it? I cant really understand that shit xd
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Rotation, speed, all that stuff is pretty confusing
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh now that bors is done
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hope you don't mind me pushing to master üòõ
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> learath what's the difference between char pos and char corepos
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, i have no idea, but there shouldn't be any difference iirc
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> great
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao I think the core pos is the "real" one
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are they different values?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is just confusing
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so `cl_text_entities_size` default value is 70 now, was that ok for the maintainer?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao what do you need? because they are different at different points
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> depends on exactly where you are using it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> saves
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> while saving?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> manipulating saves
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are you crafting a save?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the thing is if the tee isn't moving they will be the same and stable(tm)
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hmm
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, our saves save both the character pos and the core pos
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the core pos and the character pos only differ when interacting with stoppers while moving or getting hooked or things like that
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah k
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ does that look close enough to before the patch hit?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean for non gl3.3 users its only 70% of the size before
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> idc about it, but probs some ppl will cry xD
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't really follow that patch, is there a reason we don't have it at 100?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well, he wanted to make it configuratable, bcs he didnt like it so huge on his big monitor, but i also didnt see he made the default 70
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it was effectively 100 before we merged that patch, i guess we should make the default 100
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs yes, just wanted to let u know xd
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you said `str_next_token` wasn't too convenient to work with right? is there an interface you'd prefer?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/75c715a71224bd98c29d7d1283ceb6a6f0d62a02
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @Jupstar ‚ú™ does something break with the default being 100?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean, is it the same as before?
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does it break something?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it should, I didn't see any issue
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> See the commit i shared
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats the one that changed it to 70
23:58 <+Learath2> i don't think it's a problem, i think he just changed it to what he thought was reasonable
23:59 <+Learath2> which makes sense, but we should probably keep the old default for the people who are annoyed by every small change
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but is it the same size as before with 100?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why jupey said its only for non opengl3 users 70%
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, i have no idea
