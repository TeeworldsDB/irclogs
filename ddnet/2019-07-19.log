01:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> what are replays?
01:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FallenKN `cl_replays 1`, `save_replay`, `cl_replay_length`
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When using save_replay it will save the last seconds (amount in cl_replay_length)
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_replays need to be
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> oh since when is that a thing
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 12.5
01:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> current
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> ah ty
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why client command fokko
01:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why client command for showothers
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for not typing it everytime, correcvt
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for not typing it everytime, correct
01:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> oO
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> what's the difference between showothers and showall actually?
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> showothers shows players in other teams and showall sends all tees to the client, no matter how far they are away (for zooming out for example)
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I always get confused with all these options
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
01:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Btw, nice to see you active again
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FallenKN> wouldn't really call it active but less inactive then before :D
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> At least I see some messages from you regulary now
03:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Btw what about showing mapname instead of "Scoreboard" label on TAB
03:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Should be easy and helpful af
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not usefull xd
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> A lot of time I need to know the mapname
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Server Indo
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Info*
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Even before I started making database
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or just /mapinfo
03:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Evgesha there is already a pr for it
03:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Would be even better if it showed points as well
03:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> thatâ€™s too bloated
03:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But harder to make
03:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> imo
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yea too
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just look at /mapinfo
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you dont need to check these information like every 5 sec while you are playing
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Its uncomfortable
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> having map name is still neat
03:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> take 5 secs to write the command or on server enter look at the MOTD, all information is there
03:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> Iâ€™m not even sure if thereâ€™s a sane way to get points client side
03:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You would need to send some messages again, which is just useless
03:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> y
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> If the motd is on the client side also, you can just parse it. Its stupid, but works
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> XD
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> that doesnâ€™t count as sane way
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Yes, but works))))
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Also
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> What about fixing fucking dummy switching on gun while hammerfly
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Its annoying
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Just played with dummies with my friend
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> This problem appears tooo often
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> For him and me
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Im using "+toggle" for HF, he's using built-in bind
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Why not just NOT switch any weapon
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> I think thatâ€™s fixed on master
03:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> It would make lasering possible, for examole
03:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> It would make lasering possible, for example
03:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> You can still take laser on dummy, toggle hammerfly and he will laser you
03:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But then start switching
03:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So why not just let player switch the weapons himself
03:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> You can even make a setting for this "switch dummy on hammer while hammerfly"
03:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> The most annoying ddnet bug
03:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> switching to hammer when activating a hammerfly setting makes sense lol
03:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So if we think this way
03:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> We can go even further
03:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> And dont reset inputs while dummy is in hammerfly mode
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So you will be able to hold hook up as dummy and laser your player
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> then it wonâ€™t be a hammerfly setting anymore
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Yes
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> It would be for everything
03:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so you realize that you donâ€™t make sense
03:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> :ThinkSweat:
03:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> the purpose of it is to easily hammerfly with dummy
03:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> thatâ€™s it
03:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Also we found a bug I guess ðŸ¤”
03:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Copy moves is not overwriting hammerfly
03:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But im not 100% sure
03:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> could aslo argue the other way around would be a bug
03:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> could also argue the other way around would be a bug
03:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if I understand you correctly
03:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Im saying that copy moves shouls overwrite any input from dummy
03:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Even if hammerfly is on
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Sometimes you need to jump over freeze and fall together with dummy after hammerfly, its easy to do with copy moves
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Thats an example
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> k
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> When toggling copy moves you expect your dummy to copy moves
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Not still hammerfly
04:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> open an issue for it
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Also
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> (Yes, i have MORE)
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> My friend came up with an idea
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Its hard to make
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Or not so hard**
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Server sided btw
04:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Copy moves is very often brokes
04:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> i mean desynchronization of movements with player
04:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> When you're trying to pass solo with copy moves
04:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> It depends on the ping difference I guess
04:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So my friend suggested to send input info just once, from main
04:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> For both. Main and dummy
04:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> oO
04:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> the dummy is on a different connection
04:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But I don't know of its safe to do that, because it makes possible to write a cheat which would aay to server just "Tee named XXX is my dummy. Move it"
04:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But I don't know if its safe to do that, because it makes possible to write a cheat which would aay to server just "Tee named XXX is my dummy. Move it"
04:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But I don't know if its safe to do that, because it makes possible to write a cheat which would send to server just "Tee named XXX is my dummy. Move it"
04:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you could take control over other players
04:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Yes
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Thats what I mean
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> not gud
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But the idea eas good
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> But the idea was good
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> It needs some improvements
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> not worth it
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Maybe
04:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> youâ€™re gaining very little for a lot complexity
04:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Do you already fixed teleport prediction?
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> teleports canâ€™t be predicted
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Why
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> they are random
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Because of desrination point?
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> canâ€™t predict randomness
04:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Ok
04:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Another complex thing is server side prediction
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Maybe useless, not sure.
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I mean a feature when server ... Oh, its hard to explain
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> So did you play cs:go?
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yes
04:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> There is this feature
04:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> When you have like 500 ping
04:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> And shoot
04:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> You will hit the target if you did so on client
04:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Because server is comparing your ping and input delay
04:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> tw is way too fast paced for that
04:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> that works well for 3d games, but will look strange in 2d
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> No more client-sided bugs for now)
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> What about fizing servers already
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Ehats wrong with them
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Whats wrong with them
04:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Slow connecting and bugs with zoom
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> some attack I guess
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Russian is just impossible to play for most of people (but not me, Im living next to hoster ofc)
05:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc
08:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not a sv bug
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 when you are here please take a look at this last pr's last commit, I don't think it's correct tbh
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the score message we send is race not ddrace? ^^
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, check `CGameContext::SendRecord`
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the Record message that is
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the new `RaceShowRecord`?
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, I added it to emulate the old behaviour
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that branch of the if statement was taken for servers that are IsRace but !IsDDrace
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, sounds fair
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and showing the record is what it seemed to do, hence the name ðŸ˜„
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one more problem however, I just couldn't get the checkpoints working for the life of me
11:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the server always sends a `m_Check` of 0
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess `GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_RaceShowRecord && GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_RaceRecordMessage` could just be `GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_RaceShowRecord` then?
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not blocking for merge)
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you mean with checkpoints?
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that something that worked before that I broke?
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who uses checkpoints anyways?
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do racers use them?
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm not sure tbh, but I don't think checkpoint times work anymore
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh deen didn't even know where the negative time was coming from, he thought it was ghost ðŸ˜„
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (it's the checkpoint timer)
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where should it come from?
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from that ddrace record message?
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> from another message called sv_ddracetime
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we send both?
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the server never seems to send an m_Check != 0, I don't think you broke this
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah we do send both
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddracetime gets sent on checkpoints
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds broken
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe you need a working score backend?
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me find a map hosted on ddnet with checkpoints
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought we used the game type in the client to determine which of the messages we accept
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we'd only interpret all these messages as one kind
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even though we send both? ^^
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they are discrete messages
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> with different types
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, `DDRACETIME` vs `RECORD`
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk for a bit
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, checkpoints apparently need a working score backend, so they work fine on servers with one
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think we need to keep the `m_RaceRecordMessage` check there aswell, as if it's not true the server wouldn't be sending the record in the first place
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't understand how one can get so sick so quick
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> What?
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was fine 3 days ago, I had a slight cold 2 days ago, now I don't even feel like moving ðŸ˜„
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> :feelsbadman:
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Enough time to code now then:troll:
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 any objections to merging #1842 then? it looks fine
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 nope, you can go ahead, but I have a question about #1839, is m_Race actually the right thing to do here? between all other flags this one looks out of place
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I felt it was kinda right, it's for enabling race features like automatic demo recording and ghosts
13:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you think it should be renamed?
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I think it's fine now that I think about it that way
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it felt like a replacement to IsRace, so it felt like it was more of a gametype
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah

15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> day before yesterday?
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ðŸ‘€
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya english lacks some cool german words
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @archimede67 did u leave pc open all night oir what
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no sleep
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @archimede67 i tells me 31 mins only tho
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> its a laptop
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> so he's in sleep mode the night u know
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :think_bot:
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but not shut down
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aaa
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im so lazy
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making forms
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boring
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even with react
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> it depends
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> if its a big form and what is the data
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a form that is 474 lines of code
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> for what data xd
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uploading a manga info xd
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah ðŸ˜‚
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Ryozuki also ur timer resets on every file no?
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my time is not real
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you want it like that.
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ?
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> so change it
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know how?
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i did
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> its an plugin right
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @archimede67 https://streamable.com/io457
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this xd
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> oof
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its quite complex tbh
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the genre things
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i made it
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> am proud
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> gj
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> i have this
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> 
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601766393473531914/unknown.png
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @archimede67 wat does ur bot do
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y i have  same
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> many things but the cool thing is that u can code modules for it
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/601766634612326405/unknown.png
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but basic features are music, fun, nsfw, memes and i'll add some more
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> and also a web interface
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill make my own forum with react
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> where u can control ur bot, its modules and manage ur server through it
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> but its a lot of work
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> for 1 person
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> a forum with react, good luck xd
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why gl
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> because it needs to be complete
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will fit my needs
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> what are ur needs
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whathever my website needs are
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk yet
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok ðŸ˜‚
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok now i need to get back to my real work xd
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Way too much code to read, @Jupstar âœª do you happen to know what text containers do off the top of your head?
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they store text, like u give it a text and have it as a ID to a buffer in the GPU memory, instead of streaming it every frame
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, is there a limit to how many you can create?
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> VRAM, but basically no
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we really should get some documentation, atleast for the base interfaces :/
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even after looking at this thing for 10 years I don't know every part
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ur right, would be usefull for new coders ðŸ˜„
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah ur right, would be useful for new coders ðŸ˜„
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª While I have you here: I was thinking of replacing the color structs you use in the graphics code with the new common ones aswell, is there any immediate reason not to that comes to your mind?
18:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I left them untouched the last time around b/c I already broke enough and didn't want to piss off more people ðŸ˜„
18:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong the GPU gets the right color codes u can do what u want ;D
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> If you will make somw documentation I could join you as coder
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> If you will make somw documentation I could join as coder
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't get your hopes up, we've been meaning to get some documentation for atleast a decade ðŸ˜„
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> its pretty hard to get into ddnet stuff the first time
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Evgesha documentation might be too much to ask, but you can definitely ask questions if you do happen to poke the code some time
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> is it cpp
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> With opengl?
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> what i mean is how ddnet actually works, all the classes and functions and stuff
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> cpp, sdl, opengl
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Never used sdl before
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> ))))
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's all wrapped very well, you would most likely never interact with sdl or opengl at all
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Yes, I think so too
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> in fact @Learath2 knows it xd
23:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Yes> https://discord.gg/JEPR2P
