01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> pie
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> the entire snap chunk payload:

01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> ```

01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> ```
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> 
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> only the snap payload (content after size bytes):
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> 
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> ```
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> \x00\x03\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x14\x00\x00\x01\x0B\x00\xDA\xC8\xF0\x91\x02\xCC\xB0\xD0\xB1\x02\xDA\xE8\xD8\xF0\x0B\xFF\xFF\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFD\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFD\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFF\xFB\xF7\x0F\x40\xDE\xE4\xD0\xB1\x03\xFF\xAD\x98\xA1\x01\xFF\xFD\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFD\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFD\xFB\xF7\x0F\xFF\xFF\xFB\xF7\x0F\x00\x80\xFE\x07\x80\xFE\x07\x0A\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00
01:03 < bridge> <miguilim> ```
01:04 < bridge> <miguilim> since teeframe is a currently only a server implementation, it only encodes snaps, it cant decode, so I think I cant help much more than this
01:04 < bridge> <miguilim> since its a snap single and not a slice, you sure have the removed items, updated items, and unused 00 at the beginning
01:04 < bridge> <miguilim> so its 0 removed items
01:05 < bridge> <miguilim> 3 updated items
01:05 < bridge> <miguilim> 00 - unused
01:05 < bridge> <miguilim> since there is no removed items, all snap items sent have it item id, id, and payload
01:06 < bridge> <miguilim> first item is 6 - obj_game_info
01:06 < bridge> <miguilim> id is 0 - as obj_game_info id is always zero
01:08 < bridge> <miguilim> since delta tick in this case is current tick - (-1), there is no confirmed snap known by the client
01:09 < bridge> <miguilim> so this snap single payload contains all snaps items and game context the client should be aware of
01:09 < bridge> <miguilim> and because of that, all values are the real values and not the diff from the last delta snap
01:09 < bridge> <miguilim> since delta tick in this case is current tick - (-1), there is no confirmed snap known by the client (delta snap)
01:10 < bridge> <miguilim> since teeframe is currently only a server implementation, it only encodes snaps, it cant decode, so I think I cant help much more than this
01:15 < bridge> <miguilim> jesus, I think I copied the wrong packet

08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1215203600448364614/image.png?ex=65fbe58b&is=65e9708b&hm=7351f13cadf512f98fe5a72f1de1272355b0761dd7c195dea08f373e30cabf28&
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its llvm 18 time
09:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> :owo:
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> xar
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i know ur afk from discord but i enabled lto on gentoo
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot to do so
09:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also enabled o3 on some packages
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> now u have a fast
09:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> oh i just realized thats a bit annoying since its a pr upstream as well then you break your teeworlds pr if you merge it into community
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe just pr against community directly from a latest version.
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> git remote add communism https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> git fetch communism
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> git checkout community
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> git checkout -b your_epic_branch_name
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> then add changes there and pull directly here
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/pulls
09:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i might have the mirror bot do that actually to fix the pipeline problem for all branches
10:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> so annoying that the merge queue has to pass the pipeline before merge. Does not make much sense to me. The only relevant state is after merge.
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> btw you dont have to copy paste changes you can just run this
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> git cherry-pick b855a9db2cf0cd8fa6e5f56c68c78a0667d579d5
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
10:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> on the new branch and push
10:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do i have to be on teeworld or community-teeworlds? :justatest:
10:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> what is "be on"
10:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you can do that from your teeworlds/teeworlds fork its fine
10:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok
10:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you can do inter fork cross entanglement pullrequests
10:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> oh interesting so my parser falsely detected it as map download hmm thanks a lot
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> no time for that now and will forget later lol. But you can pr or issue all my infra is open source this should be located at zillyhuhn/server-config on github
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pls open an issue if you found a bug they get lost in this chat
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > can you give an example of when you'd use multiple cursors?
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 idk where to start so many times i need multiple cursors
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for example editing this piece of code 
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709810001.png
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or copy pasting a wall of text and transforming its structure
12:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> What would u want to edit in these lines?
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or doing this 
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709810175.png
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat doesn't matter usually if you want to edit something in those lines its the same for every line. So if you can do word jumps and have a separate clipboard and word boundaries for everyline its amazing
12:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> turn yaml to json etc
12:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ws Client broken again, reply didnt Work
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what didnt? work?
12:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Up is working - down is Not

12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> one is a reply from matrix the other is from irc which has no replies
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=vscode_multi_cursor.mp4&u=chiller if the function signature changes this could be an example
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with multicursor anything tedious becomes fun
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> s/anything/manything/ yes thats a word
12:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 😬
12:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1215260398748442654/nvim_rocks.mp4?ex=65fc1a71&is=65e9a571&hm=798bb4758d04c3eb07afead11d16397ed766f606e16b6c69411849b4a9d7a2b3&
12:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no doubt you can do every multicursor vscode action in vim
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it looks more complex to type and also more complex to reason about
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> id claim vscode is fast because it requires less keystrokes and less mental capacity 
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> another common use case is this one @heinrich5991 
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=vscode_multi_cursor2.mp4&u=chiller
12:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I kinda like writing macros
12:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Its fun xd
12:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But not fun when ut doesn't work first try
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes multicursor is very forgiving when it comes to mistakes
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> undo and corrections and tinkering is smooth
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if its only 2 or 3 lines its so nice because the overhead of multicursor is non existant 
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mostly there is a few twists so one fix macro usually doesnt catch all edge cases
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but a few different multi cursors do
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> json to yaml
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=vscode_multi_cursor3.mp4&u=chiller
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can do this all day
12:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Send json :santatrollet:
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ```{"name":"John","age":30,"car":null,"foo":"bar","baz":"bang","nob":"cat","skill":420}```
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat we should compete in some codewars site just reformatting code xd
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that a thing?
12:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if its not, it can become a thing xd
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for sure i could see this being fun for 5mins getting random snippets pvp'ing a friend first to refactor every tool allowed
12:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon in the 0.7 coding competition (he won because hes the only person who ever codes 0.7)
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> *pastes into chatgpt5*

12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao jq
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice one
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> again prime enjoyer detected hehe
12:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Its pretty useful thing
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice subst 
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye u pro
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but id still claim im faster :p
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess we never know
13:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> You are faster because you are pro
13:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And me nub
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> skill issue?
13:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont do that kind of refactoring often
13:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But yea, skill issue
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but using ! is bit chot
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lemme do speedrun using ! xd
13:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U can use bang in vscode
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=nvim_moment.mp4&u=chiller
13:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U can do this in vim
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if u need ! to be effective in vim you are basically bash enjoyer not vim enjoyer axaxax
13:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why would i spend 20 mins writing ugly ass regex when i can just use ! :thonk:
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> agree
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am big bash enjoyer and its no secret
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in bash you dont even need ! 
13:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I saw Minecraft server in bash vid
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> From prime
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye me too
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :kek:
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> That thing is so cursed :justatest:
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> made me think about minetee
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should learn mc protocol before discussing w heinrich again :D 
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. in vim,  I usually use macros for these
13:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I remember they use 9 digits after . For position in one block
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in prime vid the blog mentioned 4 bit per block xd. And the protocol we plan in #7666 has 41 BYTES per tile LMAOOOO
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if a minetee creeper explodes the removed tiles are basically ddos xd
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, looks nice. thanks for the example 🙂
13:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I didn't find a website where u can compete with others by refactoring code, and it goes into my todo project list
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
13:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But before that there're two ddnet related projects i have to finish first XD
13:44 < bridge> <matodor> 🥺 demo webviewer first pls
13:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Did u see that giga cool laggy map? xd
13:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I made a feature to render object containers aaand it just silently doesn't work
13:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> No errors, just empty screen
13:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Poggers
13:49 < bridge> <archimede67> https://ddnet.github.io/load_map.html
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oh ye, my demo viewer is completely useless
13:50 < bridge> <matodor> 👎🏻👎🏻
13:50 < bridge> <archimede67> https://ddnet.github.io
13:50 < bridge> <matodor> need pure js project
13:50 < bridge> <archimede67> Lmao
13:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :monkalaugh:
13:52 < bridge> <matodor> ✖️ client wrapper ✖️
13:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Then add server with ws and send requests from frontend
13:53 < bamcane> wow
13:54 < bamcane> there's a web demo render now??
13:54 < bridge> <matodor> just a client ported to web
13:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @chikowitz i did it 😏
13:55 < bamcane> hm
13:55 < bamcane> i couldn't load it, there's only a white screen be displayed
14:16 < bridge> <Lumpy ◐ω◑> what is it :thonk:
14:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Cant u read? ._.
14:18 < bridge> <Lumpy ◐ω◑> ye I read ddnet..
15:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> writing types for webgl calls from typless language is so much fun :pepeW:
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 c question
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> how do u benchmark a function
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```C
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> clock_t begin = clock();
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> /* here, do your time-consuming job */
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> clock_t end = clock();
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> double time_spent = (double)(end - begin) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> is tihs good enough?
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> time.h
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> That should be fine but you probably want a high precision time rather than just any time
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> I would also do it a couple thousand times in a loop and divide
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe do it a dozen times or so before you start timing to help the branch predictor. Idk it all depends on how accurate you need to get
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 how can u make sure it doesnt get optimized out
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> the fn call
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it optimize extern fns?
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> Put it in a separate TU and it won't be optimized indeed
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> tu?
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> the extern fn is from a static lib
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> my lib compiled from my lang
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> There is also a compiler attribute you can mark your function with but I don't remember
16:26 < bridge> <learath2> It it's extern from a static lib you are fine. It can't be optimized out completely unless you use LTO
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> This sort of micro benchmark on the function level is not very useful unless you already have a theory as to how it will turn out btw
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Because of emergent behaviour of compilers it's really hard to extrapolate from microbenchmarks to what happens in an overall program
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye i know
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 tbh this is for the lang im making at work
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> the boss wants a microbench
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> Oh btw, careful clock() iirc is the cpu clock. If there is any io or if your cores are contended you will get bad results
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> You want a quiet system, and you want to use a different source of timing if there is any io involved at all
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> Or if one solution involves offloading the computation to something that is not the CPU 😄
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 well its more like a regression bench
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> to know if we lose perf
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> The issue I was trying to highlight is that even if you do lose performance at this level, it might not change anything in the overall performance of your program. That's all, but I'm sure your boss already knows that.
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeye

18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> another pr merged into llvm
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> this one way bigger
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> got already more pr ideas
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> not enough ub
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> linux enjoyers, pls send help, why my sed not working :Zzz_7062057890308424505: 
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> 
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> ```bash
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> paul@ubuntu-hp:~/test2$ cat random2.cfg | grep password
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf>   password: "superduperpass"
18:59 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> paul@ubuntu-hp:~/test2$ sed -i 's/password:.{0,}/password:asd/g' random2.cfg

19:03 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> thanks a lot
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> it works
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> with -E
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> as i said
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ❯ sed -E 's/password:.{0,}/password: asd/' a
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> password: asd
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> -E enables fancier regex
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> sed is ancient
19:04 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :justatest: not listed on `man sed`
19:04 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> oh ok it does
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ❯ sed --help | rg E
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki>   -E, -r, --regexp-extended
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki>                  (for portability use POSIX -E).

19:04 < bridge> <zhn> xd
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why i read it as

22:09 < bridge> <cipy29> i'm trying to cross compile from fedora to windows, you guys ever got this error?
22:09 < bridge> <cipy29> 
22:09 < bridge> <cipy29> ```
22:09 < bridge> <cipy29> CMake Error at cmake/FindSSP.cmake:12 (message):
22:09 < bridge> <cipy29>   could not find ssp paths

22:09 < bridge> <cipy29>   CMakeLists.txt:544 (find_package)
22:09 < bridge> <cipy29> ```
22:12 < bridge> <robyt3> On Windows this error message usually means ddnet-libs are missing or not updated. I don't know how to get the ssp lib for cross compiling though.
22:12 < bridge> <cipy29> I got it here `/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/libssp-0.dll` but it seems like it doesn't see it
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Take a look at `FindSSP.cmake`
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> ye I tried fixit it like this (without comments)
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> ```
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> #set(SSP_COPY_FILES
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29>     #"/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/libssp-0.dll"
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> ```
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> but it didnt do it
22:14 < bridge> <cipy29> i was hoping someone got it before and someone knew quick fix xd, but if not, imma do more gpt4-ing xd
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you try cloning ddnet-libs already and building with precompiled libs or does that not work?
22:17 < bridge> <cipy29> nope, haven't tried, imma try
22:20 < bridge> <cipy29> haha, worked, thanks ❤️

23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> this one's interesting, what could've caused this? - our map has a graphical issue, but i dont think its related is it?:
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> `2024-03-07 22:51:10 I Warning: The width of texture "embedded: 5" is not divisible by 16, or the height is not divisible by 16, which might cause visual bugs.`
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i got this sent to by a player, he said joining other servers/maps works fine - and we currently have 20 players without any issues
23:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> update: redownloading the map helps, but im still curious as to why that happens/happened
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> This was a bug a while ago where loading the map into the editor and then saving it would corrupt the images right?
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> Are you on the newest version?
23:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh it didnt happen for me, it was a player on our server, and redownloading the map fixed the issue - he was on latest release
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> Hmm okay
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> Weird
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye i couldnt connect the dots on this one :D
23:35 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe his network gave up on him a ripped a few packets outta there
23:40 < bridge> <robyt3> If it happens again, copy the corrupted map and send it please. Invalid UTF-8 in image/sound names should already be checked with latest client though. Checks for invalid layer/group/envelope names will be added by the PR I just opened.
23:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Did this happen on an official DDNet server?
23:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> it happened on a teeworlds mod with latest ddnet
23:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe it was the skin name related crash, which should be fixed on the client side by the PR above and on the server-side on DDNet and KoG servers already
23:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> hmm maybe, i'll drop the stuff in here when it happens again and i cant figure it out myself!
23:46 < bridge> <robyt3> If you use Windows you should have a crash log (`.RTP` file), which should tell where the invalid UTF-8 comes from
