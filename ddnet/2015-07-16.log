00:10 < Learath2> deen: is timeout protection automatic ?
00:11 <@deen> Learath2: in what sense?
00:26 < Learath2> when you join after a timeout should it immediately work ?
00:26 < Savander> after Protection timeout msg
00:26 < Savander> i guess
00:26 < Savander> (like disconnect msg)
00:26 <@deen> no, needs 100 seconds until a regular timeout is register, you'll see a chat message
00:27 <@deen> maybe we can get rid of that in some nice way
00:37 < Learath2> well why is the 100 secs needed now ?
00:40 <@deen> that's the regular timeout
00:40 <@deen> The timeout codes are not exactly secret and some server admin could collect them
00:41 <@deen> and then they could take over players if there was no actual timeout necessary beforehand
00:48 < Learath2> dont see how we could detect actual timeouts except waiting for them to timout ofc :D
00:48 < Learath2> could maybe use some kind of a heartbeat
00:48 <@deen> we could at least use a shorter time for timeout protected timeouts maybe
00:49 <@deen> like 10 seconds instead of 100
00:49 <@deen> but not sure
00:49 < Savander> 30 seconds
00:49 <@deen> there are some bad things that can happen
00:49 < Savander> like in other games
00:49 < Savander> like cs:go
00:50 <@deen> for example you join the server and still have your old ip:port and the server thinks you're just back and all is fine, but your screen shows nothing. then you disconnect and the server actually disconnects you
00:53 < Learath2> why would yuor screen show nothing ?
00:56 < Learath2> ic
06:45 < Nazar> Hey ho ;-)
06:57 < o_be_one> hellow
06:57 < o_be_one> deen, we have dummy spoof attak in V3ROYAL GER (from xrothx)
06:58 < o_be_one> and something forcing tee to tell their ip (i broadcast to use ddnet official client to avoid this)
06:58 < o_be_one> well the port is always 1337, idk if they'll know how to change it
07:01 < FickMich> Hay gays
07:03 < Nazar> ONE TEE ONE
07:03 < Nazar> COME BACK SERVER
07:04 < Nazar> And bann the dummys
07:04 < Nazar> plz 
07:04 < Nazar> its fucking annoying
07:04 < Nazar> thx
07:07  * Nazar slaps o_be_one around a bit with a large fishbot
07:07 < Nazar> One tee one   lets block on V3royal...
09:18 <@EastByte> hi Nazar 
09:20 < Nazar> Hehey :)
09:22 <@EastByte> what's up?
09:48 <@EastByte> deen: any idea how to install nimble packages locally?
10:17 <@EastByte> oh by running nimble install without parameters
10:41 < Nazar> Nothing, why u ask?
10:42 <@EastByte> small talk and stuff
10:43 <@EastByte> there aren't many online at this time on workdays
10:44 <@EastByte> !ddnetpeak
10:44 < Nimda_6518> Current players on DDNet : 202
10:44 < Nimda_6518> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
12:14 <@EastByte>  eeeee: http://eastbit.net/priv/spooferincoming.webm piko is playing with ip spoofing
14:31 < Savander> ok, thats weird
14:32 < Savander> You remember, "shaking" problem?
14:32 < Savander> from yesterday
14:32 < Savander> It happens only on ddnet client
14:33 < Savander> and no, it not because of last update
14:33 < Savander> because i downloaded previous version, and it still was there
14:33 < Savander> i deleted configuration "settings_ddnet" but, screen still shaking
14:34 < Savander> "explanation. It looks like, client render too much. Move to left and stop, client render a bit left then back to proper position."
14:47 <@EastByte> why not capture the bug on video?
14:56 < Savander> wtf
14:56 < Savander> on demo it doesn't exists
14:57 <@EastByte> tees in demo player a predicted differently
14:57 <@EastByte> are*
14:57 <@EastByte> I guess it's some problem with the prediction
15:11 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbnVPvK-pE    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGwnuRa-Rk
15:11 < Savander> generally
15:11 < Savander> look at feets
15:12 < Savander> or somewhere
15:12 < Savander> when i touch a ground
15:12 < Savander> difference beetween first and second video
15:12 < Savander> and it's alwayes when i moving, jumping, hooking 
15:16 <@EastByte> I notice it in the first video
15:16 < Savander> first video on ddnet
15:16 < Savander> second on clear game
15:16 < Savander> from teeworlds.com
15:16 <@EastByte> right
15:16 < Learath2> I keep running into circular dependencies :(
15:18 < Savander> any ideaS?
15:18 <@EastByte> not really
15:19 <@EastByte> can't reproduce
15:19 < Savander> ;/
15:19 <@EastByte> did you try to remove all configs?
15:19 < Savander> yes
15:19 < Savander> i did it
15:20 <@EastByte> what operating system are you using?
15:20 <@EastByte> and architecture?
15:20 < Learath2> EastByte: how wrong would it be to slap everything into one file ?
15:20 < Savander> windows 7 64 bit, radeon hd 7950
15:21 < Savander> intel i5 2500k
15:21 <@EastByte> Savander: have you tried ddnet 64bit yet?
15:22 <@EastByte> Learath2: 'everything' ?
15:22 < Learath2> Savander: that looks horribly annoying 
15:22 < Learath2> plugins,plugin interface, the bot
15:24 < Savander> EastByte,  nope
15:24 < Savander> i'll
15:25 < Savander> wtf
15:25 < Savander> no shaking
15:25 < Learath2> \o/
15:25 <@EastByte> I know
15:25 < Savander> i didn't know even about ddnet 64bit
15:25 < Savander> but, then why teeworlds 32bit works perfectly :D
15:26 < Learath2> God knows
15:26 <@EastByte> back compatibility? :D
15:26 < Savander> .
15:26 <@EastByte> deen: 64bit fixed a problem for Savander, isn't that nice?
15:29 <@EastByte> Learath2: so the plugins need to have access to attributes/procs of the bot
15:29 <@EastByte> I think I understand why you have circular dependencies
15:29 < Learath2> The plugins atleast need the ability to send messages
15:30 < Learath2> that involves the plugin calling bots send msg function
15:30 <@EastByte> I guess you have to make a third interface then
15:32 <@EastByte> an interface where you put bot related procs like "send msg"
15:32 <@EastByte> then the plugins can simply import that
15:34 <@EastByte> Learath2: https://gist.github.com/east/4b86c06e28f72212b57c
15:36 < Learath2> and i just need to pass the plugins a handle onLoad :)
15:36 < Learath2> thanks
15:37 <@EastByte> yes
15:37 <@EastByte> also in C you would just pass a struct with callback pointers to prevent circular dependencies
15:39 < Learath2> In C i guess i'd let the plugins register their hooks by passing function pointers
15:39 <@EastByte> could be done like that yea
15:41 <@EastByte> hmm OOP actually is really important for me
15:42 <@EastByte> virtual calls are awesome
15:43 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: everyone considers oop to be something different, a more specific term for that concept is "interfaces" :)
15:44 < Learath2> never enjoyed oop
15:46 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: oh, specifically for that I should use 'interfaces' then
15:46 <@EastByte> oop is a huge topic
15:47 <@EastByte> when you start learning programming using java you'll hate it I guess^^
15:47 < Learath2> dont think ill ever learn java unless its forced down my throat :P
15:47 <@EastByte> take it!!! :p
15:48 < Learath2> System.out.println("NO!")
15:49 <@EastByte> throw new Exception("you forgot the semicolon");
15:50 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: if you can use java, you can likely also use scala
15:50 <@heinrich5991> (more haskellish, also runs on the JVM)
15:50 <@heinrich5991> (so it can likely be used instead of java for the same projects)
15:51 < Learath2> http://codepad.org/v79ngLYm
15:51 < Learath2> look at this madness
15:52 < Learath2> the only piece of java code i've ever written i guess
15:52 <@EastByte> have you ever done something different than calculators?
15:52 <@heinrich5991> :D
15:52 < Learath2> thats what i do whenever i start with a language 
15:52 < Learath2> if i dont like how it feels i just leave it
15:53 < Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/f1cc87187de85273205f
15:53 <@EastByte> sometimes you have to learn a lot until it feels right
15:54 < Learath2> does the exact same thing much prettier didnt need to learn for more then 10 mins to pull it off
15:54 <@EastByte> well nim already feels more comfortable than python^^ (my own opinion)
15:55 <@EastByte> also seems to be for lazy people
16:09 <@deen> Learath2: i usually write code in 1 file first and then split it up later
16:09 <@deen> better to keep it as simple as possible and only split up when it seems reasonable
16:10 <@deen> I think someone is sending me weird money
16:10 < Learath2> weird money ?
16:10 <@deen> I get a donation every day now from him^^
16:10 < Savander> he likes you
16:10 <@deen> i told him that costs him extra paypal fees but he continues
16:11 < Savander> motar2k
16:11 < Savander> sheik from Dubai
16:11 < Learath2> inb4 he is the owner of a drug cartel from mexico
16:11 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxYkiX6urU
16:11 < Savander> did you see glow
16:12 < Savander> while im moving
16:12 < Savander> ?
16:12 < Savander> on text, graphics
16:12 < Savander> around tee
16:12 < Savander> without tee
16:12 < Savander> ?
16:12 <@deen> not sure
16:13 <@deen> my screen is terrible, I'm happy when i can see a map at all^^
16:13 < Savander> okay, something wrong 
16:13 < Savander> at me
16:13 < Savander> da fuq
16:15 <@deen> about your screen prediction problems with ddnet 32bit, does it also happen with cl_predict 0?
16:15 <@deen> because that's really weird and you should only see something like that when you're lagging
16:15 < Savander> okaay
16:15 < Savander> i found a solution
16:15 < Savander> LOl
16:15 < Savander> my monitor -> settings -> "Response time"
16:16 < Savander> was "high"
16:16 < Savander> deen,  wait i'll check
16:16 < Savander> yes
16:16 < Savander> with cl_predit 0 it's still the same
16:16 <@deen> yeah, told you it can be monitor settings
16:17 < Savander> deen,  but it's different problem
16:17 < Savander> glowing isn't shaking :D
16:17 <@deen> ah
16:17 < Savander> and i found a solution for glowing
16:17 <@deen> ok, you have the shaking problem on video, so it's not your screen
16:17 < Savander> yup
16:17 < Savander> and it's only ddnet
16:17 < Savander> 32bit
16:17 <@deen> makes no sense that it happens only with ddnet 32bit
16:17 < Savander> form me too
16:17 < Savander> but
16:17 <@deen> it's like some calculation is wrong
16:17 < Savander> same settings
16:17 < Savander> on ddnet 64
16:18 <@deen> maybe i compile it with some bad stuff or gcc has a bug, i don't know =/
16:18 < Savander> looks like before, without shaking
16:18 < Savander> but no deen 
16:18 <@deen> did you buy a new computer?
16:18 < Savander> it's the same on previous version
16:18 < Savander> on same settings
16:18 < Savander> but, shaking started yesterday
16:18 < Savander> and it's WEIRD
16:18 <@deen> well, what did you do before the shaking started?
16:18 < Savander> nothing
16:19 < Savander> pressed update button
16:19 < Savander> then my config gone
16:19 < Savander> and then my screen started shaking
16:24 < Savander> Weird, when i run 32 bit client then i back to 64
16:24 < Savander> screen shaking
16:24 < Savander> i removed config
16:24 < Savander> and screen stoped shaking
16:24 < Savander> "what the hell?"D
16:24 < Savander> :D
16:24 <@EastByte> deen: the daily donations? he probably wants to dos the service by flooding money :P
16:26 < Savander> xDDD
16:28 < Savander> oh cmon
16:28 < Savander> probably found a solution?
16:29 < Savander> sv_predict and sv_predict_ddrace 0
16:29 < Savander> cause shaking
16:29 < Savander> o.O
16:29 < Savander> sry
16:29 < Savander> cl_
16:29 < Savander> xDD
16:30 < Savander> and now 32 bit works too
16:30 < Savander> em?
16:30 <@EastByte> so there still were some configs?
16:31 < Savander> i don't know
16:31 < Savander> i deleted settings
16:31 < Savander> and it was generated by client
16:31 <@EastByte> maybe from settings.cfg -> settings_ddnet.cfg ?
16:31 < Savander> settings.cfg was deleted too
16:31 <@EastByte> or in a different folder
16:32 < Savander> i don't know
16:32 <@EastByte> tw storage system is strange
16:32 < Savander> i can't tell you
16:32 < Savander> but still, why cl_predict 0 cause problem
16:32 < Savander> s
16:33 < Savander> i though it disable "prediction"
16:33 <@EastByte> oh you did cl_predict 0 now?
16:33 < Savander> so i shouldn't affect on game
16:33 < Savander> nie
16:33 < Savander> no
16:33 < Savander> XDD
16:33 < Savander> cl_predict 1 now
16:33 < Savander> cl_predict 0  cause problems
16:33 <@EastByte> sure....
16:33 <@EastByte> oh wait
16:33 < Savander> EastByte,  try yoursef
16:34 < Savander> yourself*
16:34 < Savander> im typing to fast, i should slow down..
16:34 <@EastByte> well, I think it doesn't disable prediction completely
16:34 <@EastByte> we have multiple types of predictin
16:34 < Savander> ahm
16:34 < Savander> cl_prediction_ddrace
16:35 <@EastByte> e.g. the client does interpolation between snaps to predict other players
16:35 <@EastByte> while your own tee is predicted using your key presses
16:36 <@EastByte> and cl_predict might disable the latter one
16:38 < Savander> yup
16:40 <@EastByte> afk
17:10 < Savander> deen, 
17:10 < Savander> code for south africa in ./save?
17:11 <@deen> Savander: ZAF
17:11 < Savander> thanks
17:33 <@deen> Savander: at http://ddnet.tw/status the ips bottom right corner show the short thing for saves now :P
17:33 <@deen> so ger.ddnet.tw => GER, zaf.ddnet.tw => ZAF
17:33 <@deen> but it's always the standard 3 letter code
17:36 < Savander> ah
17:36 < Savander> didn't knwo :D:D
17:36 < Savander> not always!
17:36 < Savander> GER2
17:37 < Savander> 4 letter!
17:37 < Savander> xD
17:40 < Tobii> GER2 is EUR^^
17:40 < Savander> ger2.ddnet.tw
17:40 < Tobii> save code is EUR
17:40 < Savander> DDNet GER2
17:41 < Savander> so it's not the same to ips
17:41 < Savander> ^^

17:49 < Savander> maybe we'll have more polish players? :>
18:21 <@deen> DDNet Race running now
18:21 <@deen> Savander: oh right, hm^^
18:22 < Savander> ^>^
19:39 <@deen> Anyone know when HellGate 3 was originally released on ddmax?
19:42 <@deen> Learath2: you maybe ^
19:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: are the ddmax maps on ddnet modified from original ddmax?
19:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, saavik fixed most of them in some way
19:56 <@deen> i don't know how she can fix hundreds of maps all alone, but she can
19:56 <@deen> mostly graphical fixes, cheats and reduced map size
20:33 < Nimda_6518> Samsara II by Meliodafu just released on Moderate at 2015-07-16 20:27
21:13 <@deen> damn, writing up the history of ddnet takes forever
21:14 < Savander> xD
21:14 <@EastByte> you are writing stuff?
21:14 <@deen> yeah
21:14 <@EastByte> nice
21:14 <@deen> and Hallowed wants an interview with me before the tournament haha
21:14 <@EastByte> prepare your voice then :)
21:16 < Savander> uu
21:16 < Savander> Polish translation should be to!
21:16 <@deen> but in german =/
21:16 < Savander> <haha>
21:16 <@deen> ask Saavik to live-translate
21:16 < Savander> i mean
