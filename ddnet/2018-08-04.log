17:34 <+Wohoo> hello all,
17:34 <+Wohoo> any developer only? question for you :)
17:36 <+Wohoo> *online
17:36 <+Learath2> Wohoo: ask away
17:40 <+Wohoo> what is the purpouse of: int m_NeededFaketuning in game/server/entities/character.h
17:41 <+Learath2> it's the faketuning flags of the character entity
17:42 <+Learath2> such as NOHOOK, JETPACK, NOHAMMER, NOJUMP, NOCOLL
17:42 <+Wohoo> ok, what a faketune is? Flag to make client aware of server status?
17:43 <+Learath2> it's a tune, that isn't a tune, hence faketune :P
17:43 <+Learath2> Allows us to add extra stuff to the tunings
17:46 <+Learath2> it's pretty ugly stuff tbh
17:46 <+Wohoo> there is a rule for fake tuning? faketune_nohammer exists while _nolaser not exist
17:46 <+Learath2> GameContext::SendTuningParams to see how it works
17:46 <+Learath2> what would nolaser be?
17:47 <+Wohoo> nothing, wondering if a weapon tuning should exist
17:47 <+Wohoo> *faketuning :)
17:48 <+Wohoo> you know i discovered faketuning because of this: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=6593
17:50 <+Learath2> it's for faking a tuning for one player, e.g. you have nohammer, but your friend doesn't in the same tunezone
17:52 <+Learath2> hmm, I don't actually remember why we made it like this
17:59 <+Wohoo> Does faketuning nocollision solve the overlay problem when show_others is active?
17:59 <+Learath2> overlay problem?
18:01 <+Wohoo> i remember in old client (don't know which), that i you change team, then showothers (0% alpha), client was avoing overlay rendering and tried to move you on side of other tee (even in different team)
18:02 <+Wohoo> like client was detecting a collision problem and tried to solve putting tees side by side, while they should be actually overlayed. Then this issue was solved
18:15 <+Wohoo> however thank you i will try to understand better this faketuning :)
18:45 <+tree> Learath2: he/she meant the "lag" if you use show_others without ddnet client but with 64p availability
