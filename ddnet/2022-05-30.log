01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> is it possible to fix the bot that shows records? currently, if someone is top1 and beats their own rank, the "previous time" shows the rank 2 instead of the previous r1
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> if that makes sense

09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> is the code for the discord bot on ddnet's github?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Yeah I don't understand this.
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Same thing on foots: they cannot be white for every skin, because some skins have grey foot by default.
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Double jump indicator is hard to check with grey foot, they became dark grey
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the eyes seem to be a bit off
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this is because of how we store ranks in our database. for team ranks we actually only store the best finish for each team, so we can't display the same team's old time
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for non-team ranks we show the previous best rank, even if it was by the same person
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> we have unsigned chars minetee already
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> i see on the ddnet page my last 10 finishes. are the rest not in the db or just not shown? in other words is there a history of all finishes i have made?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11534
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> just write it next time in github as an answer xD so everyone can learn from my mistake lel
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, there is a history of all, but we don't provide it on website.  The DB is available on https://ddnet.tw/stats/
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skyrocket1999> Hey guys
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skyrocket1999> do you mingle with girls?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MADEBANK> Hey there ! I noticed you all might be going through a phase and might need to loosen up a bit and by any chance would you be looking to buy any product ? (Xanax, Adderall, Molly, MDMA, Oxy, Coke, Meth & Weed/Wax etc; reasonable prices, discreet and fast delivery worldwide) you can add up on wickrme username; airpack
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ok but does this change any of the physics
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lmfao
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skyrocket1999> Now on topic
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can someone test teeinvader? seems broken to me
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> can someone test the map teeinvader? seems broken to me
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah I was lost ... it works xD I thought I broke it because of my rework of draggers
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> makes sense
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> sorry for asking again, but so you don't store all the teamranks? do you overwrite the teamrank if it is better and not save it at all, when it is worse? or is it somewhete in the db, but not easily accessable
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> sorry for asking again, but so you don't store all the teamranks? do you overwrite the teamrank if it is better and not save it at all, when it is worse? or is it somewhere in the db, but not easily accessable
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> i am asking for the same reason as my question with t0 ranks. if you want to have a history of all finishes with a certain team.
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> on the same map
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> they are saved for sure you can see the history using /times name
16:42 <+xq> No ranks are ever overwritten/deleted, they are still in the database.
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> deen wrote best finish
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> is rank something else as finish?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> ok nice
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really overwritten in db, so no way to get the old team ranks. but you can approximate them based on ranks, where we store all
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> Any tips on debugging c++ include errors? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5276 causes a bit overwhelming errors in my forks i find it quite difficult to read 200 lines of errors caused by one line of #include being wrong
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> test
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> thanks
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> ok got it. I spend the last half hour removing code to get an minimal example and then it was obvious. Probably not the best way but it worked
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> couldn't you use the same soft he used ?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> i thought thats more for removing unnecessary includes not fixing builds due to wrong includes. He even said in the pr that adding it to the CI does not make much sense because the tool needs so much manual attention
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> it also gives you the entire list of includes that you need, but it doesn't check for stuff like #ifdef(ANDROID)
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> the authors (googlers) use it mostly for adding all includes, so they can change includes without breaking the build or having to go through other includes when changing one
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its time to blow the dust from teeuniverse
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> sorry still not satisfied, so last question, you mean the team ranks are also saved as solo ranks. so if you would finish a map with team you get a team rank + t0 "database save" and then you could check who finished in t0 at exactly the same date and hour?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> is that what you mean by approximate?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess you can build yourself a script like this https://github.com/marzzzello/ddtime to get all team finishes...
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> ty
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just checked out the teamrace table
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> actually there are multiple team finishes ... 
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> so you do not have to use the t0 table... just querry the teamrace table
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/980942708707311626/unknown.png
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not for the same team, which means the entire set of members is the same
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> one player can be part of many different teams
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> nice nice, so t0 is complete info. and then i will look for t0 finishes with same time stamp and same time. but still in a very rare case people could finish in t0 at the same timestamp with same racetime so i wouldn't know if it was team or not
