15:49 < bridge> <davide55> Yes TG is Telegram
15:49 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe later we can meet in game, sure
15:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have tw installed?
15:49 < bridge> <davide55> Yeah but I'm busy atm
15:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shit
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok lets do it tomorrow then :) 
16:41 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> why is that weapon change has more delay than attacks? It happens with me often that i press 1 (hammer) and click after that but the previous weapons hit goes off and only after  changes the weapon. Laser also has some weird stuff when change to that
16:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> if shooting a weapon, your weapon swap is linked to the cooldown of the weapon, for example shooting a laser and immediatly trying to swap to hammer by pressing 1 will delay until you "could" shoot the laser again before actually swapping

17:13 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Any idea how this could be solved?
17:24 < bridge> <0xdeen> Don't run the final packaging step
17:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> it's not required for you, try another target, like the server or client directly
17:34 < bridge> <hamidreza6> It's still there

17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> What problem are you trying to solve by forcing the client to start with admin privileges? This seems like a bad idea that's likely to cause issues.
17:42 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Due to some features implemented inside the client, admin rights is needed or they won't function properly
17:44 < bridge> <robyt3> You'll likely run into more issue because users have to run the client as admin. One bug and the client could delete your user's system files without warning. Would be better if you a) don't need admin rights, or b) use a separate program that only does the necessary steps that need admin rights.

17:55 < bridge> <nouaa> yo, I'm curious if implementing a CAPTCHA verification system on both the client and server sides could be advantageous. introducing it might help prevent fake or spoofed clients from connecting and unfairly appearing at the top of the server browser, which has been, and still is today an issue. perhaps there's another way to prevent such attacks?
18:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> captchas are probably easier to solve for AI than for many humans
19:40 < bridge> <louis> why not just blacklist spoofers from master
19:41 < bridge> <louis> ah that wouldn't solve client spoofers ig
20:12 < bridge> <reitw> spoofed clients are not an issue anymore afaik
