06:17 < bridge> <louis> tele should be predictable anyways üòÖ
06:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any maintainer awake that can help me avoid a git conflict?
06:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke ima conflict my own ass then
08:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 strings done üòè (i don't really understand this `OFFSET` business but it works xd)
08:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273895596847267883/image.png?ex=66c0473a&is=66bef5ba&hm=ea3cb456677c06f7bfe66e242cd9a961c26ab76320a6d532fa7e087ef2a8ee5c&
09:02 < bridge> <learath2> I thought you were generating NASM not MASM
09:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im using `as`
09:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no `nasm` anymore
09:06 < bridge> <learath2> I guess the gnu assembler addresses the same way masm does
09:06 < bridge> <learath2> Idk never used as
09:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i tried to generate similar stuff as gcc but it didn't work with `OFFSET FLAT` so I just  dropped last keyword xD
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf? How do i get a snap character m_Vel.y of 128 in the client side sometimes when walking left or right on a flat surface? Do i print the wrong stuff or is that some kind of bug?
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``const CNetObj_Character *pPrevChar = &m_pClient->m_Snap.m_aCharacters[ClientId].m_Prev;``
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zwelf i always assumed that once the max walking speed on the ground is reached jumping or landing on the floor does no longer affect the speed
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that incorrect?
09:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1273905456708059210/walkspeed.mp4?ex=66c05068&is=66befee8&hm=6926be674a6197e8d54d8e320d495e717993e585b332dee11e860435b5802964&
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I hold down "d" to walk the entire time. And it seems like falling slows me down a bit. Is that correct?
09:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> air drag maybe
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how did i not know that xd
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I made a flat map and finished by only walking first then i did it again and jumped a bit
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723793815.png
09:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So if you get bored while speedrunning don't do random jumps!
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so that all seems correct. But I still don't understand where vel y 128 is coming from when walking left or right
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that maybe a gravity race condition bug that never caused any issues because the client then predicts it away because it knows that the tee is grounded
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/vel128_on_floor.mp4
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> WOAH
09:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Think of it like formula 1 downforce üòÑ
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
09:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i think that should be fixed on the server side. Its weird to only sometimes apply this downforce.
09:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> ground control

09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ms is making gh ugly
09:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> light theme is making it ugly
09:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> shame on you

09:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> dark theme master race

09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> wait a minute
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> you said white theme
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> not light theme
09:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes its a racism joke
09:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> aha
10:07 < bridge> <cocibaka> Why servers lagginng some time verry bad?
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which server?
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rus?

10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cocibaka you can see the current server load here https://ddnet.org/status/ sometimes there is ddos for example. You can also ask the others if they lagg too. Its either the server or maybe you.
10:09 < bridge> <cocibaka> There no Niger?
10:09 < bridge> <cocibaka> Sadly
10:10 < bridge> <cocibaka> Bro im waiting you too much
10:10 < bridge> <cocibaka> Learn write faster
10:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> who thought it would be a good idea to make `strings.Trim` function work as it currently does(golang), this son of a bitch took me 40 mins to debug :pepeW:
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you play on niger servers? @cocibaka 
10:12 < bridge> <cocibaka> Idk. Im just joining to server where is minimum ping
10:12 < bridge> <cocibaka> Is around 80-150
10:13 < bridge> <cocibaka> In midnight 80 ping
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm i think the velocity thing is a floating point issue
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> floats are so annoying
10:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> üëÄ
10:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> try strings.TrimSpace
10:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._.
10:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i used TrimPrefix
10:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> trimleft
10:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nop
10:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> same problem with trimleft
10:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what was the problem wiht `strings.Trim`?
10:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what did it do that it shouldn't?
10:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i THOUGHT it would just remove the passed string
10:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's called cutset
10:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> > Trim returns a slice of the string s with all leading and trailing Unicode code points contained in cutset removed.
10:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> not prefix
10:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> dat's what it actually does
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. sounds similar like in python or rust
10:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> but you found TrimPrefix
10:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> so all's good
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip
10:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.trim
10:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> this function was called from reflect code and i thought the problem was there, so I spent most of the time trying to find a bug there xd
10:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the funny thing is that i have like 20 tests to test the thing and it didn't happen there even once
10:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> at least you habe tests \:D
10:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> have
10:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's the only thing I wrote tests for
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> new record:

11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what does the constexpr do here? ``static constexpr float MOVEMENT_INFORMATION_LINE_HEIGHT = 8.0f;``
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that this expression is evaluated at compile time
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but cpp is really weird about this rule for functions
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thus there is also consteval
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which expression?
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the assignment to your const
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it ensures it is set in the .data section or what?
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> such internal things shouldnt matter to you, or do you write asm code or smth?
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since it's static it's most likely inlined anyway
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I mean i understand it for stuff like ``static int foo = 2 + 2`` where it evaluates 4
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ so it does nothing?
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i care because of this 
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723801361.png
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well what answer do you want to here.
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a static int foo = 2+2 
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> _could_ be created at runtime (even if unlikely)
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the entire line is weird to me
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is it static? why is it constexpr? why is it not a #define or enum
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could say constexpr is the better new hipster way for #defines
11:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `enum`s can't be floats, `#define`s aren't typed
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
11:45 < bridge> <louis> that seems hella risky
11:45 < bridge> <louis> also in real life gravity still applies if you're standing on the ground
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im also fine with making it apply on the ground but then at least consistently
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sometimes 0 and sometimes 128 is so weird
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why static tho @heinrich5991 
11:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> static means it's only instantiated once per program, I think
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè üòè üòè
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teeworlds is so realistic
11:52 < bridge> <louis> yes :justatest:
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 u here?
11:58 < bridge> <learath2> Sure
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nvm
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> Ok üò≠
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i blamed wrong
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought you added AIM to seven/network.py
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but heinrich did
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/0d916e2ef6a18e76bca60cad27b23360ac4c1b6c#diff-f17727e47d30fb26a947d1ed4cf86c4b1f936598be1689d6d2aace665bd60a94 did you ever test if that works?
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah i see that only works on custom 0.7 servers ok nvm heinrich i got it
12:10 < bridge> <.puch> chillerdragon we don't have any bridge for zcatch?
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Not that I know of
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But i am somewhat working on it
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I rage quitted on 0.7 skin colors last time xd
12:11 < bridge> <.puch> ah yes I understand xddddd
12:11 < bridge> <.puch> is it true 0.7 is based on svg?
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no 
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also png like 0.6
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you want a broken zcatch try ``sv_gametype zcatch`` xd
12:12 < bridge> <.puch> okok
12:12 < bridge> <.puch> nah nah it will be fine xd
12:12 < bridge> <.puch> and you're talking through irc?
12:13 < bridge> <.puch> why not discord?
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont like discord
12:13 < bridge> <.puch> ok that's why you didn't answer to my messages yesterday
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on discord? ye i only log  in like once a year
12:13 < bridge> <.puch> okok fine hopefully I found you here
12:13 < bridge> <.puch> ^^
14:05 < bridge> <.puch> chiller i set up webhook it's working great üôÇ
14:08 < bridge> <.puch> chillerdragon i also got an idea for the gctf tournament. We could automate games with a kind of team password you write in teamchat
14:10 < bridge> <.puch> both team write it in teamchat to launch the game then result is officially put in discord
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am not organizing the tournaments. Are you @.puch ? Depends if it would be useful for the organizers. I assume they are happy with a tournament server that posts names and stats to discord. Adding a password that has to be typed correctly by every player and manually matched by organizers sounds like more work than before.
14:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
14:55 < bridge> <matodor> https://tee.lol/
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like that hidden easter egg
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> help me, what's the easter egg?
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i scammed you sry
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why did u do the site?
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like what thought led to this
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .lol sounds expensive xd
14:59 < bridge> <matodor> this is not my domain but i made a 5 minute design for it üòÑ
14:59 < bridge> <matodor> 2$
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> per?
14:59 < bridge> <matodor> year
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wat ok
15:00 < bridge> <matodor> but first year, renew 25$
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow 25$ is a lot again üòÑ

15:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also amazing website! I hope you will keep paying for it!
15:11 < bridge> <unkownuser0758_28133> best website ever
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to see `.dragon` tld
15:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Soo long
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i actually want `.star`
15:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I want to have .x tld
15:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or better .0
15:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Checkout my cool website at: o.0
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would probably be taken in less than a ms if it would start to be sold xD
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> short names are so impossible to get :c
15:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just gotta have some good connections to the lizards that rule the world and they can get you some
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best teeworlds website is ofc https://zillyhuhn.com/
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why even huhn?
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Full of css bugs
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs my name
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ChillerDragon
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> huhn and dragons are related?.. yeah ok
15:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nono
15:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs like Learath2 -> lerato
15:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or Robyt3 -> rosbit
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it should be zilldoragon
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> zillerdoragon
15:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So many ways to butcher that name
15:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought zillyhuhn is the shortest and cleanest
15:19 < bridge> <patiga> sillydrag
15:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok that‚Äôs also cool
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> huhuhu

15:20 < bridge> <patiga> right now üòÖ
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stop procrastinating then

15:21 < bridge> <patiga> huh actually it finished a while ago
15:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Average rust experience
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bit true xd

15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the exec is 1gb, no wonder cargo clean, cleans 200 gb
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Even stripped it fat
15:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait till asmr client drops
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, without removing dead code
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just insane
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga WAAT it doesnt need mapres anymore
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but where does it get them from?
15:27 < bridge> <patiga> https://crates.io/crates/twstorage
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and where does that get it from?= xd
15:27 < bridge> <patiga> it searches for a ddnet installation
15:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> /usr/share/games/ddnet
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
15:28 < bridge> <patiga> also in the cwd, and in the directory of the the binary that was called
15:28 < bridge> <patiga> and ofc cfg directory in the usual places
15:28 < bridge> <patiga> for the data directory, it also looks for a steam installation
15:29 < bridge> <patiga> macos is still todo tho
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> \~/Library/Application\\ Support Moment
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i was just interested in how much VRAM it uses for the map "nostalgia"

15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you have stats how much of these is caused by resources?
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like textures (not the one used for rendering)
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jopsti switched from windows to temple os
15:30 < bridge> <patiga> ah tilemap textures? no I have no stats yet
15:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When buy gnome pro
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i mean like tilemap textures should not count towards "normal" resources.
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's easier to see what is actually causing huge allocations here
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that tool is epyc tho
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never seen a better taskmanager for gpus

15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly it doesnt detect it based on my config
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it can also read so much stuff from the GPU

15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bye terminal

15:56 < bridge> <patiga> eeeeh
15:56 < bridge> <patiga> yea but no
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that purple is green hurts me tho xDD

15:57 < bridge> <patiga> I agree that I need to do it at some point, but I don't wanna do all the work for it
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mpv eschewed UI for the longest time, I think ^^
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah :/
15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> main reason i still have to use vlc
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vlc really sucks with all the bugs, but the amount of things u can change is insane xd
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mpv has UI nowadays
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basic UI though, so maybe you mean that
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are few things i dislike about mpv actually
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in vlc u can force a single global instance
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i can click through music without destroying the window every time
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The year of the Linux desktop
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> linux desktop is already best
16:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Says the kde enjoyer
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> KDE is just working
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do i want more from a WM
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we all know openbox is masterrace
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> year of linux desktop is when wayland is stable
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so never
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> >600 issues already
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> massive grave
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow and 70 prs open
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> massive lazy maintainers xdd
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: every 5th pr from you is closed xdd
16:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> chillinsky from eastern europe
16:36 < bridge> <.puch> No I don't plan anything. Don't worry that was just an idea ^^. Anyway the team password could only be for the team captain or thing like that
16:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ every 5th pr i open is not merged yes. And every 5h issue opend is a bug introduced by me <:justatest:572499997178986510>
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tja xd
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it makes you happy, i bet i coded much more bugs in my life than you
16:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am hoping to get it stable before the rc -.-
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better learn rust
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and help create smth new
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> world changing
16:51 < bridge> <teero777> rewrite wayland in rust
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is the solution
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you understood it
16:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> more world changing than 0.7?
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.7 changed the world
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not in a good sense
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
16:51 < bridge> <teero777> go develop 0.8, 0.7 was flop
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> or make some exploit that only works on 0.6 that can't be fixed so ppl stop playing it
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clever
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon why dont u get ddnet admin at this point
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your influence is infinite
16:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but not in a good way -.-
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u sad now
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now that 0.7 was merged
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> understandable
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like me
16:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why would i be sad? xd
16:55 < bridge> <agent.sluffy> How to do ban apeal ticket
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> #‚úâ-create-a-ticket
16:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The demo cutting bug is pretty bad but other than that im happy with how smooth it went to far
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oke
16:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i coded demos on a fakin beach in some abandoned island in the middle of the ocean cuz heinrich said no demos no 0.7 xd
16:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would have shipped it with no 0.7 demo support xd
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why didnt he leave the "no demo" part out?
16:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk ask him hes here but i guess its nice to have working demos for 0.7 too i get it. I just would have done it in two prs so it can be audited and tested more partially.
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am too shy
16:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But imo the demo support can be left out for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666 otherwise that will be the infinite blocker
16:58 < bridge> <teero777> why would implementing that for a demo be hard?
16:59 < bridge> <teero777> isn't it just taking the initial world and then applying the block change netmsgs?
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because you can skip in demos without replaying everything between
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> just replay the stuff in between?
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> demos are not that heavy
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea thats one of my proposals
17:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still sounds like work and im not sure if it would be accepted even
17:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also backwards sounds pain
17:02 < bridge> <teero777> isn't that also the reason for sometimes bugged replays? for example your teammates are in the wrong team
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Seeking is already pretty slow though. Seeking in a 4 hours demo takes my FPS down to around 20
17:04 < bridge> <teero777> what do you mean with seeking?
17:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Using the demo player seekbar
17:04 < bridge> <robyt3> If you scroll through with mouse or keyboard
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait, our demos have no index?
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice, ppl install ddpg
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> support the new
17:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Demos have keyframes, but we still need to replay some ticks to reach the correct one
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but why does it depend on the length then
17:06 < bridge> <zhn> wat
17:06 < bridge> <teero777> could you go through the whole demo and just pick out the block change msgs?
17:07 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but doing that almost every single frame while the user is using the seekbar would still be slow I assume
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> or precompute the states once you load a demo
17:07 < bridge> <teero777> i assume that would work
17:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I also thought that might be the most realistic, but then you need to delta encode the states or you'd be storing a lot of maps if you copy the entire map state for a single block being broken in minete
17:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I also thought that might be the most realistic, but then you need to delta encode the states or you'd be storing a lot of maps if you copy the entire map state for a single block being broken in minetee
17:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I think the length is less relevant, FPS also go down a lot with 2 minute demos if they contain many players
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly i dont have a demo ui yet, else i could test against ddnet.
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but currently i pack quite a few snapshots into a chunk
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so maybe it's not optimal
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean 200 fps isnt bad i guess xd
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like every operation must run at 200000 fps
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or 20 fps
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok not nice but
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it runs at at least 200 fps on ddnet
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on a multeasymap demo i have
17:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpii is nightly master?
17:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how can you load demos on windows with invalid headers?
17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the demo with the sha256sum ``44bd5094edd036086999edc165d09521602ca03ad0a63f8021f669107eb05977`` loads for you?
17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah wait do i have to unzip it? xd
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg you sent a zip xd
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whom do you talk to xd
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> muprii sent a zip
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> murpii
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such trol
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do you smoke again
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried to playback a zip file
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in issues?
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not assume he sent an actual zip
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dude
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you use github in a terminal
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot no why?
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah nvm
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> github only allows .zip uploads
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> blame github I guess
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes thats why everyone just renames the files to .zip
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that really works?
17:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> sounds like a good plan
17:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, interesting
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> am i the only one who thought thats common practice?
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723821554.png
17:20 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> hi, i have a question what non-standard symbols can i use to create a name/clan name in ddnet? is there some list or something like that, i just tried and some were displayed correctly and some just became a square
17:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ok good night everyone. I promise i will look at the demo bug tomorrow. If rossbit didn't fix it already by then xd
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> Anything supported by our font
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could open the font in a viewer for that. but tbh just try it out
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> search for unicode in your search engine
17:23 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> ok tu
17:23 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> ok ty
17:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe for Android we should just put the user files in `/sdcard/.DDNet` instead of the app's external storage, at least everyone can access them then. All the others APIs are not suitable for sharing the entire config folder so other apps could modify it. Or we make this a choice you can make in the proposed launcher app.
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have no sdcard :c
17:25 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> oh
17:25 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1274026221272825969/image.png?ex=66c0c0e1&is=66bf6f61&hm=439d0f6067db704fafdd50f867b8bed830776415412c5050a59294abf72bfa78&
17:25 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> limited
17:25 < bridge> <robyt3> `/sdcard` is a symlink that always points to some emulated storage location as far as I understand it
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> unicodes use many bytes
17:26 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> k
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly our current network protocol clamps by bytes rather than unicode code points
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok, i can also see if that exists on my phone
17:27 < bridge> <robyt3> It should point to `/storage/emulated/0` and maybe handle multi-user devices better than just using that path directly
17:27 < bridge> <Tyrone> jupstar <3
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi ‚ù§Ô∏è
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only get permission denied on terminal
17:29 < bridge> <robyt3> If you do `ls /sdcard` or what exactly?
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, and if i do cd/sdcard/data (where data is a dir i can access) it doesnt work either
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i can also quickly check with a adb shell
17:29 < bridge> <robyt3> `ls /sdcard` works for me
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah nice
17:30 < bridge> <robyt3> If we create our own folder inside that it should be accessible to everyone
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in adb it works
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except my terminal app
17:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should optimally be something that works with the google play store
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
17:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. not violating android's platform guidelines
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but before we cannot alter game data
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i prefer hacks
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and get the ban on playstore üò¨
17:31 < bridge> <robyt3> I see folder of other apps in my `/storage/emulated/0` so I assume it's allowed
17:31 < bridge> <robyt3> I see folders of other apps in my `/storage/emulated/0` so I assume it's allowed
17:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Otherwise Google has provided absolutely no API for this use case
17:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well then it's good üôÇ
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why do they allow this, but not modify the app's data dir
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so random
17:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but only for the user data, right? like the `%APPDATA%/DDNet`
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> But even this might not be so easy
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57788878/android-10-what-are-my-options-to-save-files-on-external-storage-into-a-directo
17:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think they pretend that users can't modify an app's data
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> We might have to declare `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` we want to modify external storage in general
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> And this is not allowed in the Play Store unless it is a vital part of the app
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this OS üò≠
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it turns into apple
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> (This entire dicussion is why I don't like the Play Store)
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does `getExternalFilesDir` work maybe?
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (as mentioned in an stackoverflow answer)
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> That's what we are using already, new Android versions also make that private
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> So you can only look at the files with Googles "Files" app
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and look in bold
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that not ok?
17:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, not edit?
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
17:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wonder how other apps are doing it
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nextcloud uses the media storage
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Media Storage would only be a valid use case for sharing screenshots that we record with the users gallery
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Media Storage would only be a valid use case for sharing screenshots that we record with the users' gallery
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think it allows modifying the files either
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my nextcloud dir
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1274029157197807667/image.png?ex=66c0c39d&is=66bf721d&hm=276384c52b1033f485e12155d9fba94f06a0dc69a5358d198e86a99f48f54fce&
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .7z is a real 7z
17:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I only see this as an option for non-Google Play store version
17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> (using /sdcard directly)
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh, so that already violates the guidelines or what
17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, we are not a file manager, we'd have to convince reviewers in the app description already that changing game assets is a vital game mechanic
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> android hurts me rn
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> time to add wget to F1 console xdd
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the next alternative is adding a file manager into DDNet :justatest:
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can the editor load from anywhere? xd
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> accessing other files should be easier over the files APIs
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Users clicks "Import Asset" button, this opens the file selector app to open a PNG file
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe in the long run we need databases for all assets
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if customization is important for us
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> got to go now, I'll try to work on the touch controls tomorrow, json loading is still missing but then the controls are technically adjustable (although you'd first have to root your phone to edit the file)
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> EPYC
17:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> amazing üòÆ
17:50 < bridge> <0xdeen> Party time!
18:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> ü•≥
18:12 < bridge> <matodor> chiller sorry for the hate, the 07 skins tab is only available on 07 server, I thought it was always visible in the settings and you can use 07 skins on any server ddrace
18:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Thats why i tried to ask you what your problem with 0.7 is because it confused me a bit xd
19:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Patiga is there a way to turn off errors in twmap? A lot of my old maps just don't load because twmap is complaing about something
19:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @patiga
19:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks i kinda expected it :C 
19:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> discord names are all lowercase right?
19:06 < bridge> <patiga> not really as of yet. you can turn off some errors if you use the rust library, but that is also only possible for loading maps, not saving maps
19:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @patiga also when review https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-py/-/merge_requests/3 i have it manually installed on my machine and i couldnt live without it anymore
19:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> loading only is fine heinrich tasked me to do datascience on every map ever built
19:07 < bridge> <patiga> oh apparently I haven't properly set up email notifications for that repo :o
19:22 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: do you want to close #3? https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-py/-/issues/3
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes?
19:24 < bridge> <patiga> (ah right, that merge request isn't merged yet)
19:24 < bridge> <patiga> I'll remove the `Py` prefix everywhere, I just forgot the annotations
19:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what i thought
19:32 < bridge> <zhn> @chillerdragon fix the 07 feet i beg u
19:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats super low on my prio list is there a open bug for it somewhere even? wats broken about them
19:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 well cloning my old git mirror of your maps archive didn't go so well xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1723829740.png
19:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> twmap will fail on the majority of the maps anyways i don't think that will be any use
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> they're nouis like
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> shifted to left
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> as always
19:41 < bridge> <zhn> was an issue since 2014 ig xd
19:41 < bridge> <patiga> depending on the error, the rust library could put a fix in place which happens on map parsing, or another parse method that does a lot more fixes
19:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so the pyson version is the free trial to get hooked?
19:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then you get converted to the crab cult?
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> ^^
19:43 < bridge> <patiga> these things could then also be brought to python
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn so you mean the official tw repo did a design decision you do not like and i ported it into ddnet? 
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea im so not gonna touch that :p you can fix it if you want to. Feet look good to me
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon: at the start of twmap, I often ran the parser over all maps from heinrich's archive and fixed the most common errors
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> I haven't done that in a while
19:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there arent really new maps in the archieve i assume
19:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but new errors in twmap :D 
19:46 < bridge> <patiga> but new errors
19:47 < bridge> <patiga> yea ^^
19:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> quality library
19:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> adding errors xd
19:47 < bridge> <patiga> and I also didn't fix everything
19:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such a rust moment
19:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ok im retrying the sleep thing. Somehow i failed earlier. Thanks for the merge @patiga I hope you will manage to publish it with the types smoothly.
19:50 < bridge> <patiga> that sleep thing you talk about sounds nice
19:51 < bridge> <patiga> if you need it now, I would also start the compatibility with all the maps
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It would be nice at some point for sure. But I don't think I need it now. If it passed all ddnet maps i assume it will pass most kog maps and that should be enough data science for heinrich
19:53 < bridge> <patiga> nice :)

20:39 < bridge> <zhn> ye i mean the official tw repo left a shitton years old bug in skin render and you ported it into ddnet xd
20:39 < bridge> <zhn> no blame but feet's weird
21:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 i decided to use `lea` to handle string literals xd
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> Eh I guess
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @0xdeen why does ger10 have two IP addresses?
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> $ host ger10.dnet.org
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ger10.dnet.org has address 76.223.54.146
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ger10.dnet.org has address 13.248.169.48
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that intended?
22:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> woops, my fault. dnet.org instead of ddnet.org
22:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry
22:32 < bridge> <7.ix> wait
22:34 < bridge> <reitw> lol dnet.org is pretty close
