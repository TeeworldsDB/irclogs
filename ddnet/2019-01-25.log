19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> I ran into a problem while trying to compile ddnet client
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> It's about something in library links in c++
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> but I don't know exactly which one
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/538427644048310272/unknown.png
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> what's wrong, what should I do?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @DDNet can u help me, my dear?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> ðŸ˜„
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fudgy> DDnet CAN back plz ðŸ˜¢
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> oof down
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> removed*
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye itâ€™s shutdown
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> "removed" lol wth
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/538441336727273473/2v2zaf33k6c21.png
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it wasnâ€™t really used it seems
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Ryozuki ðŸ˜‚
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @Ryozuki lol easy decision for me
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> can I suggest that ddnet stops hosting everything other than ddrace?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> solves our problems, solves their problems
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> more vague please
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> their zcatch kills off our zcatch community
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> /mute jxsl13
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> some ppl hate the centralization of mods around their servers, thus they are getting ddoses
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ddosed
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I guess their involvement lead to bad developments in the zcatch community, as they released that 10 player limit zcatch that was by far not considering what zcatch needed, but more considering what their ranking system lacked
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as an easy fix to the problem of easy wins the limit was most likely increased from 5 to 10, leading to zcatch servers not getting enough players to play a normal round, leading to decline of players
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> diversity is good too
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> decentralization
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> is diversity
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as in 0.5.1 where everyone hosted literally their own home server, ppl had more fun and did not play the same stuff 24/7 as they do nowadays
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fudgy> ok so now I cant do good race times on ddnet rip xd
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fudgy> rip canadia server
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont rlly agree with that suggestion
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet hosts fng servers in many locations and its not killing off the fng community
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> y
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> Speaking for zcatch mainly, but all kinds opinions are interesting to read
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> so keep them coming
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> generelly i think, aslong as no server forces u to play on it, it doesn't matter who hosts the server( if you got lags u use a different server etc.)
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> problem is ppl don't use a different.
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but why? bcs it works good enough for them
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> also I do not like the thought of ppl hosting randomly servers, especially mods that they do not care about at all. it's just because they can, not because they actively want to support it, maybe because there is demand, tho I like the idea of hosting servers that are not really hosted to get ppl to know those mods and maybe build a community of their own and start hosting thos emods themselves.
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> it's ok to host in regions where the player base is not that dense as in europe
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well noby is a good example of that this doesn't mean they support these ppl
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> noby cares, makes shit for his servers and ppl like it
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only bcs u play a mod doesnt mean u care more about hosting a good server
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if ddnet has free power on their servers, and ppl want to play fng, why shouldn't they host it
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> "because they do not care shit"
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and?
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u care so much, make ur own improved version of zcatch
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its good people will go there
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> problem fixed
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> not rly
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trust me yes
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> community still dies
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this seems like you're advocating to not share the server so ddnet won't host the improved version
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound like an all-win to me
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> the improved version is open source, lol
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (@Ryozuki)
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or what do you mean with "to not share the server
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he said that to me
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ah, don't quite understand, tho
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ddnet might not win with it, but the hoster will for sure
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah it wont be open source
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but lifei s hard
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everybody loses if it's not open-source
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so maybe ddnet shouldn't host things if the outcome of this is that things become closed source
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so how would u make it so u can gain popularity vs ddnet?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being open source
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when ddnet can use ur version too
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ask ddnet kindly to not host the server, like jxsl13 just did?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its a solution
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he cares about hosters being bad
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I think I'm speaking for those ppl who actually just state their opinion by ddosing the servers of ddnet
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a random dude
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can host zcatch
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without caring
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, listening to ddosers doesn't sound too good. I'm out
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jxsl13 are u justifying the people that ddos ddnet?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if so u lost my respect
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I'm not saying that I ddos, I'm saying that I state what those ppl try to state with their ddosing
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im out too
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> that's seemingly a problem of ddnet
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well teeworlds uses mit license, go closed source make a better server, ppl will come
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> very simple
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> now we are acting like children ðŸ˜„
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> don't wanan hear what's happening
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> didn't see, didn't happen
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's your choice, but i don't see the reason ddnet is killing things, if you the mod dev is actually the last instance controlling if ddnet even is able to host ur server
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as i said, it's like with noby, he is also kinda closed source, ppl like it, ppl come
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the only question left is, why is it so important to you, that ppl use ur host? bcs u pay for it? or bcs of attention?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> my point is: I want kindly ask ddnet to stop hosting savanders mod, as it kills off our community, as the mod has a player limit of 10 players, which causes ppl to loose interest in the mod, because you cannot get enough players to play a round of zcatch.
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> there is one server that is at most full and ppl do not want to play on any other server or at leasttry to play there, because it is nearly impossible to get 10 players to play on that seconds server
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you realize that people are free to choose on what server they play? if another server would be better (subjectively), they would just play there
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you realize that people are free to choose on what server they play? if another server would be better (subjectively for many people), they would just play there
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> they want to play in that onse server, that's full and not join another (even ddnet) server to start filling that second server. as those ppl try to enter the first server, but cannot, they leave the mod and play any other mod there may be or they like
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> one*
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes but if there was another better server, they would start to play there
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> did you not understand?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ddnet hosts literally 10 same zcatch serversd
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> why are those 10 servers not full
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> even if there are more than enough players to fill them, ppl try to join that one server
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> where players already play
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as they are most likely afraid that the second server tehy would start to fill would not to fill to that 10 player limit
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but if another server would really be better for the majority, people would start to play there and it would shift towards it
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> that's the same argument
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why don't u change that player limit then?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did ddnet decline that request?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I do not host ddnet servers, how can I?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did u ask them?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I am doing right now
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u should be a bit more clear about ur questions, then ppl would understand them ðŸ˜„
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> it's not about having a better mod, it's about stopping my community die
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I only read "shutdown everything that's not ddnet"
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I only read "shutdown everything that's not ddrace"
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe other communies experience the same problems
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> who knows
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I speak mainly for zcatch and I would not mind if they hosted all of the zcatch servers, that do not have that 10 player limit
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesn't really make sense tho, how can a supposedly worse server make a community die if there is a better alternative
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why do you guys not start to play there
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ask them
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> and it's not about being better
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> it's about the tendency that's happening that most ppl, I guess, do not see as they do not play zcatch for like 8 years
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk, you seem to know the reason why people play on ddnet and not there
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> on 0.5.1/2 ppl played zcatch for hours
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> on multiple servers
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> same with instagib
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did ddnet kill instagib too?
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not really related
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> now as I looked at my statistics, unique names kind of played like 30 minutes
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think fng split it a bit, i was zcatch laser player too, but most ppl swapped to fng
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> fng existed way beyong zcatch
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and many ppl just stopped playing
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe not that many servers after openfng was released
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as it's a clonse of the original fng
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> conle
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> clone
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well times change things, maybe in 2 years the ppl dont like fng anymore and play zcatch again
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo gores got more popular in the last 2 years too
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> not with those tendencies
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I'm not sure if shutting the ddnet one down would help much if it's the most played server
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe change the mod?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if ppl are getting really interested in zcatch again, they will fill more servers ^^
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or player limit needed to end a round?
