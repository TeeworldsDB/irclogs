20:36 <@EastByte> I have no macro for that
20:36 <@EastByte> heinrich5991 needs to do that
20:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> op me i'll do it by hand
20:37 <@EastByte> Q doesn't allow me to op you I think
20:38 <@EastByte> oh, it does
20:38 <+Ryozuki> thx
20:40 <@Learath2> didn't even bother changing ip :P
20:40 <@EastByte> well that takes him 20 seconds it seems
20:41 <@Learath2> well he just changed his name to Savander :D
20:42 <@EastByte> 17 seconds
20:42 <@Learath2> that's quite fast indeed
20:42 <@Learath2> SP | Someone is that you?
20:43 <@EastByte> disconnect once = no, disconnect twice = yes
20:43 <+Ryozuki> vali, maskelin, sp someone
20:43 <+Ryozuki> who cares
20:43 <+Ryozuki> same trolls
20:44 <+Ryozuki> siO also
20:44 <+Ryozuki> (shorefire)
20:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> V;
20:45 <+Ryozuki> he is now on #teeworlds
20:46 <@EastByte> if you keep caring about him he does his job pretty well
20:50 <+Ryozuki> he is troll
21:32 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> btw, kick and spec votes are still disabled. would be nice if someone could make sure to fix them and reenable on servers
21:34 <@Learath2> #753...
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> and #721 :I
21:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i tried so hard and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter
21:53 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> why don't we add #752? ðŸ˜¦
21:53 <@deen> someone has to add it. I'm not doing DDNet stuff right now
21:53 <@deen> i just keep getting bug reports abut kick/spec, didn't follow what happened
21:54 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> @Learath2 merge merge merge ðŸ˜„
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i won't merge my own commits
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we should review stuff before merging and im obv biased
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if you know what you want to write it's hard to percieve when it's wrong
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> maybe @HMH  could do it : )
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> or heinrich5991, or anyone who has time to review
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> well, im working on some math proofs currently, so no time for that :/
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Welf> i hope its algebra and not analysis
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> anaylsis, well i guess you actually call it calculus tho
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> but dont worry there is also some algebra stuff waiting
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'm supposed to be working on some math proofs
23:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Welf> me too
