04:47 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
04:53 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:51 < xrothx> Hello
10:52 <@deen> hi xrothx 
10:52 < xrothx> ger2? 
10:52 <@deen> because of the common ping problems with Deutsche Telekom
10:52 < xrothx> Okay, 
10:52 <@deen> it's a weak server so far, I'm mainly interested in testing the ddos protection
10:53 < xrothx> Okay
10:53 < xrothx> So you will switch soon? 
10:53 <@deen> if it has good ping for everyone and the ddos protection works well, I will consider it
10:54 <@deen> when do you have to prolong the GER server?
10:54 < xrothx> I heard that I had a 2h downtime yesterday? :o
10:54 <@deen> you did?
10:54 < xrothx> I will check it now
10:54 <@deen> i didn't see GER being down
10:54 < xrothx> A player told me? but he is the only one telling this
10:54 < xrothx> No, me neither
10:54 <@deen> just the usual complaints about 120 ping
11:05 < xrothx> Alright
11:06 < xrothx> lets say 5/12/14
11:06 < xrothx> then I should know it
11:06 <@deen> ok
11:07 < xrothx> its pretty sad though :)
11:07 <@deen> there also were discussions here about how to use 2 servers together so you always have the best ping
11:07 <@deen> xrothx: i agree, apart from the Deutsche Telekom problem the server is the best we've ever had
11:08 <@deen> But I tried to solve it from both sides and nothing is happening
11:08 < xrothx> Alright
11:08 < xrothx> Well, let me know then :)
11:08 <@deen> so maybe we can keep GER1
11:09 <@deen> and use GER2 as a tunnel to GER1, so people can play on the same server, but with low ping
11:09 < xrothx> How will ger2 react against ddos attacks etc
11:09 <@deen> yeah, that's the question
11:09 <@deen> we only had a small attack so far and that was fine
11:09 < xrothx> I can ask a test attack from a friend? 
11:09 <@deen> today will be tournament, will be interesting to see
11:09 < xrothx> Alright
11:09 <@deen> hmm
11:09 <@deen> 1) Why do your friends do ddos attacks?
11:10 <@deen> 2) The hoster would not like that I guess
11:10 <@deen> 3) Especially if I ask you to do it, because then I'm responsible
11:10 < xrothx> 1) Its not a friend, its more like a contact I not want to get angry :)
11:10 < xrothx> 2) Hoster provides ddos protected, he should be able to handle it
11:10 <@deen> but yeah, i would be very curious to see how a strong ddos attack affects the server
11:11 < xrothx> 3) You didn't ask me a shit :)
11:11 < xrothx> I just ask for a test stressing & it is allowed on own services for test purposes
11:11 < xrothx> if you think it could help
11:11 <@deen> I don't think it's allowed to ddos your own server
11:12 <@deen> but it would definitely help in the decision
11:13 < xrothx> afk 
11:13 < xrothx> will talk later
11:36 <@deen> so much for GER2
11:36 <@deen> suddenly ping 120 for many as well..
11:37 <@deen> and down again, hm
11:42 < laxa> I think stress test should/is allowed
11:43 < laxa> ask the hoster if you can stress test the server to test the ddos protection then
12:27 < xrothx> Stress testing is allowed i thought
12:41 <@EastByte> is stress testing even defined?
12:41 <@heinrich5991> xrothx: why do you think it's allowed?
12:41 <@EastByte> why would your provider allow you to run an attack at their host
12:42 <@heinrich5991> yea
12:45 < xrothx> because you do not harm anyone.
12:45 < xrothx> you only test the reliability of your services
12:46 <@EastByte> you harm no one except all the clients using a service at your provider
12:47 <@EastByte> remember that many datacenters do not have unlimited bandwidth like ovh

15:54 < Nimda> east is currently playing random on server : hello deen.
15:54 <@deen> ^^
15:55 <@EastByte> my node twstat daemon is running for 35 days now
15:56 <@EastByte> I didn't expect nodejs to work well on 256mb ram
16:09 <@deen> I sometimes get complaints that we have too many servers
16:09 <@deen> as I see it we have 50% of the players in TW and 25% of the servers, so it's ok
16:15 <@EastByte> I think the number of servers doesn't matter
16:16 <@EastByte> they are online, so players can join an empty server and select a map
16:21 < xrothx> anything to do against flybot? 
16:21 <@deen> xrothx: ban the people and tell them to stop using it (in other order)
16:21 < xrothx> Its not fair & really anoying
16:21 < xrothx> deen:  I do, but most people have dynamic ip
16:21 <@deen> i tried to program a solution but didn't succeed
16:22 < xrothx> A ban should be more effective, like, name ban or ip range or so 
16:23 <@deen> please no range bans

17:00 < Learath2> deen: didnt code tw for a while did we leave dbg_msgs in ?
17:01 <@EastByte> yea
17:01 <@EastByte> and deen made it threaded iirc?
17:02 < Learath2> what threaded ?
17:02 <@EastByte> there was something about dbg msgs and threads
17:03 < Learath2> i think calling dbg_msg on a thread now outputs to the main console
17:13 <@deen> GER2 lagging again
17:16 <@deen> again the node where it leaves Deutsche Telekom network
17:16 <@deen> great
17:18 <@deen> i've been pinging the server for weeks without lags and now that I buy it they start laggin
17:18 <@deen> g
17:21 <@EastByte> :D
17:21 <@deen> deutsche telekom is really overloaded
17:23 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/freezejump.webm
17:24 <@EastByte> this is pretty funny
17:24 <@EastByte> but I don't understand why I got the first dj back
17:24 <@EastByte> at the second I'm on the edge
17:24 <@deen> that's normal
17:24 <@deen> when you jump quickly enough
17:24 <@deen> (and have luck)
17:24 <@deen> you can jump before the next tick happens
17:24 <@deen> so you get jump before you get freezed
17:25 <@EastByte> lol
17:25 <@EastByte> that means you can jump over freeze without limits?
17:25 <@deen> if you hit the right moment with tick
17:25 <@EastByte> I guess a bot can do that
17:25 <@deen> human can too
17:26 <@EastByte> why havn't I seen this before then?
17:26 <@deen> when i wanted to map I did a part where you needed to do that
17:26 <@deen> was fun but a bit hard
17:26 <@deen> i don't know, i see it all the time^^
17:27 <@EastByte> well theoretically you can fly over freeze without limit
17:27 <@deen> only when there is unfreeze 1 tile above
17:27 <@deen> and i think you need to fly down pretty fast
17:27 <@EastByte> ah
17:27 <@deen> normal jump is not enough probably
17:27 <@EastByte> okay then
17:29 <@deen> at least GER2 never changes route
17:39 < xrothx> http://prntscr.com/59bxrr
17:39 < xrothx> How is that possible
17:43 < Tobii> deen: lag spikes on eur
17:45 <@EastByte> Tobii: eur has been really unstable this weekend
17:47 < Tobii> xrothx: whats the problem on this screenshot?
17:48 < xrothx> team? I disabled it though
17:53 < Tobii> doesn't matter either, because you shouldn't be able to change it
17:54 < Tobii> after passing start line
19:06 <@deen> xrothx: strange

21:07 <@EastByte> deen: while tournament I did some eur tw ping checks
21:07 <@EastByte> it's kind of interesting
21:08 <@EastByte> the first time I opened the serverlist every eur server had a ping of 80
21:08 <@EastByte> then I changed my ip
21:09 <@EastByte> and still both eur ips ping of 80
21:09 <@EastByte> then I changed it again
21:09 <@EastByte> and both eur ips had a ping of 30
21:09 <@deen> damn routing problems everywhere
21:09 <@EastByte> I changed it again and the 92. ip had a highping but 37. normal ping
21:10 <@EastByte> well
21:10 <@EastByte> not sure whether it's a routing problem in this case
21:10 <@EastByte> might also be some ddos mitigation issue
21:10 <@EastByte> but the thing is, we really need multiple ips per gameserver :)
21:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/uiFZqg
21:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 4d4d8ad def: Fix compile warnings
21:26 <@deen> so, expecting ddos now on GER2
21:28 <@EastByte> expecting?
21:30 <@deen> usual ddosers are on the server
21:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/EfzbrQ
21:40 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 97fc1ad def: New entities for better visibility of hookables
23:00 <@deen> seems like i'm not the only one interested in fuzzing: https://fuzzing-project.org/
23:28 < xrothx> deen: 
23:28 < xrothx> I might be wrong, but it seems like CAN adn CHN are pretty useless ?
23:33 <@deen> xrothx: china is pretty empty but i wouldn't call it useless
23:34 <@deen> there are some chinese players
23:34 <@deen> and canada had 20 players earlier today
23:34 <@deen> players on CAN today: 195
23:34 <@deen> players on CHN today: 102
23:34 < xrothx> ok
23:34 < xrothx> Not totally useless then 
23:34 <@deen> so yeah, not the most popular servers, but they're sponsored
23:34 < xrothx> howmany on ger btw?
23:35 <@deen> since we have 3 european servers it's probably pretty split now^^
23:35 < xrothx> np
23:36 <@deen> GER: 2946, GER2: 1324, EUR: 1696
23:36 < xrothx> xO
23:36 <@deen> of course with some overlap
23:36 <@deen> that's just unique ips per server counted
23:36 < xrothx> I see
23:36 < xrothx> But thqts q nice amount
23:37 <@deen> 2261 people used ddnet client today
23:37 < xrothx> btw deen  there is a bug you should fix
23:37 <@deen> ?
23:37 < xrothx> the time is saved, but not shown after you left
23:38 <@deen> i don't understand
23:38 < xrothx> royal server
23:38 <@deen> what time is saved?
23:38 < xrothx> The best racetime isnt showed after you left
23:39 <@deen> ah yeah
23:39 <@deen> it was like that for all of ddrace
23:39 <@deen> i only changed it for sql-based servers
23:40 < xrothx> Can you change it again?
23:40 <@deen> somehow i don't want to fix file based server
23:40 <@deen> hmmm
23:40 <@deen> i didn't know race time even matters for block server
23:40 < xrothx> and should I ask those ddosers online to test GER2?
23:40 <@deen> i couldn't ask you to do that, but if you notice that they are attacking it, tell me please
23:46 <@deen> somehow i didn't see any attack during tournament
23:46 <@deen> except on GER but no problem for the ddos protection
23:58 < xrothx> good night
23:58 < xrothx> bye
23:59 <@deen> bye
