00:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon ur pr doesnt really effect my change
00:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sleep!
00:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes you are right
00:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i also need sleep maybe we can still yolo it in like that
00:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** looks like you dont kill in ``DecreaseHealthAndKill`` are players supposed to not die in tsmash when hammered to 0 hp?
00:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yes you even clarified in the comment
00:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg i need sleep bye xd

09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> on other news, i nearly got my fat32 filesystem to work with SATA/AHCI instead of PATA
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is a increase from max 16mb/s to 1.5gb/s
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> (well qemu has a 1.5gb limit)
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think sata limit is 6
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently writing the composition instead of inheritance for robyt, it's annoying because it's so much more code but maybe I'm just lazy
10:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa you farmed so many reviews your ddnet C++ style became flawless üöÄ
10:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what even is composition instead of inheritance xd
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> asks the maintainer omg
10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maintainer btw
10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 i merged physics breaking changes for you! now you merge config breaking changes for me! https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10711
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> inheritance is when a class inherits from another
10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i got 20 prs open that are ready ._.
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> like class A : public B;
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> composition is class A { B m_B;}
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> composition is `class A { B m_B;}`
10:37 < bridge> <learath2> Are we sure we don't want to keep the numbers as special aliases to `mod` and `helper` for old times sake?
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> like `class A : public B;`
10:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 I would love to do it. If i have the greenlight from the miesmuschel maintainers
10:38 < bridge> <Assa> I hope robyt likes the 1000+ LOC coming from composition instead of inheritance
10:38 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't be against it. Who didn't want it?
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i would have to investigate
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think heinrich or deen
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe it was also C++ code not user facing configs
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so more #7777 deprecation
10:38 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
10:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 yea idk i dont find it anymore. We could rush it in quickly before heinrich can react xd
10:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i will do it
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> Let's think, what would be the issue with it
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> You'd have to handle numbers as special, so they can't be names of access_levels
10:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah thanks for explaining @Assa. Look at this contributor explain the maintainer how the world works
10:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 lerato when do we make @Assa maintainer?
10:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i guess composition could be cool its more reusable. OOP sounds nice until you end up with diamond inhertiance shit
10:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 the numbers blocking access levels is fine
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, idk, 2 maintainers wanting to make everything go lightspeed might be too much
10:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the biggest pain point is code complexity and that we might have to support it forever
10:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 hrhrh the fakin cant merge your own and need 2 maintainer rule rly slows shit down
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure you can make it simple enough and if simple enough support forever is fine I guess
10:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 ok then when i burn out from ddnet in 2 weeks and stop merge everything I will be as stale maintainer as you my big role model. Then you can make assa maintainer ez?
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> That's the entire point of the rule
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> This isn't some bleeding edge playground, it's supposed to be fairly stable üòÑ
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet-rs mentioned
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, just give it a go, unless someone else sees a flaw we are both missing we can just merge it
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont miss flaws
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just disagree with heinrich what a flaw is 
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cronically
10:48 < bridge> <kebscs> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9845
10:49 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon approve, now that you're a maintainer
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> I am just trying to improve the game at some critical points
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs <:justatest:572499997178986510> im scared
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i already wrote big wall of text as maintainer
10:49 < bridge> <kebscs> Who else going to do that
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** should convince other maintainers
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs lerato the goatedest of all
10:50 < bridge> <kebscs> Heinrich wants to give context how many reactions there is instead of actually commenting
10:50 < bridge> <kebscs> Rly useful
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> my current goals:
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> - make map rendering blazingly fast
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> - make editor use map rendering, so it's not slow turtle editor
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> - recorder tiles
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> I think I like all your PRs. I would just worry about you and chiller just approving all of eachothers PRs immediately üòÑ
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> you can make rules and just forbid that
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> you can make rules and just forbid that; to clarify: forbid merging not approving
10:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> requires 2 maintainers excluding assa and chiller if its an assa or chiller pr
10:52 < bridge> <learath2> Most specificest of rules üòÑ
10:52 < bridge> <Assa> but practical
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao all maintainers are equal, but some maintainers are more equal
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> * lerato 2025
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> yeah but that's actually true, we are all more specialized in different regions of the code
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> if you don't agree with that, continue heinrichs QUIC PR
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> if you don't agree with that, continue heinrichs QUIC PR (most dead slap argument I ever gave lol)
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> I would approve fast input but I'm like 70% sure all of you are just having a placebo trip
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We can use his historical comment to plot the +1 votes over time and make a point xd
10:53 < bridge> <kebscs> Even the aoe video?
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> Is he immune to placebo?
10:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> merge4merge uwu
10:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @learath2 i get motion sick without fst input lmao
10:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i might be placebo'ing tho
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> It is possible, idk that's why I said there it's very hard to measure whether this actually improves anything
10:57 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we can just merge it and allow disabling it? The people who might possibly hate it the most are veterans, who can just flip it back
10:59 < bridge> <kebscs> Yes, it's proposed as compeletly optional, off by default
10:59 < bridge> <kebscs> So people don't have to change to tclient solely for just this 1 feature
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> Also more in general, stuff like votes and reactions to things like this is extreeemely biased. We have 5k players, maybe 100 of them are involved enough to react to anything.
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> 
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> Especially when someone well known in the community is involved with pushing for it. Look at the old team colors thing. All of Aoe's friends showed up to vote. Mostly all players playing since 0.5.2
11:01 < bridge> <learath2> Most players never hear about votes, new features. I think it's our job to advocate for their needs too. Not just the needs of the 30 people who are hyperinvolved
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> I am more in favor of adding something like a community manager, the community can collect issues and features they want and the community manager goes to devs and looks how it could be done
11:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich is strong technically but I think it‚Äôs fair that he doesn‚Äôt rush his opinion when it comes to deeply gameplay relevant things. As josspit loves to say it: you don‚Äôt get a green name without stopping to play
11:02 < bridge> <kebscs> My bad forgot it's ddnet, let's do nothing
11:02 < bridge> <kebscs> Nothing ever happens
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> The hard part is finding the "community". We keep ending up polling a very small non-representative portion of the community
11:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> force every player to have a github account
11:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> :kek:
11:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You will get lynched for that by extreme gores players haha. Go let them blind test it.
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: another reason why I don‚Äôt feel like approving fast input is that I never tried it and also don‚Äôt want to try it xd
11:04 < bridge> <learath2> Nothing ever happens, meanwhile ChillerDragon is merging like 80 PRs a second
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I also don‚Äôt use anti ping
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And a too high mouse senses
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I want to cap my skill
11:04 < bridge> <learath2> I wish we could facilitate this. It would be the proper way to see if my hypothesis that everyone is tripping on placebo is true
11:05 < bridge> <0xdeen> I think polling is not be the best way to determine direction for DDNet. Need someone at the top with a vision, and then just do it. Polls are too easy to game.
11:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Of what, random fixes/reactors?
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Otherwise my ungodly skill could be confused with botting
11:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Name 1 actual feature not added by me last 6months
11:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Don't think there's more than 2
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> How is this a good metric of anything? At 2 features per month we'll end up with a mess in a year
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> Amount of features is a genuinely horrible metric
11:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: yes voting is rigged but I value aoe 0.5 friends opinion more than 12yo Russian tiktoker who plays since 2 weeks and never downloaded ddnet. And thinks voldemort is the main client. But I am also trying to advertise GitHub to get more players into the discussion
11:07 < bridge> <kebscs> Definetly not what I said
11:07 < bridge> <kebscs> 1 feature in last 6 months equal to 1 in 6 months
11:07 < bridge> <kebscs> Not 2 every month
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> If by some miracle you could take a representative sample of the playerbase, maybe? But then a lot of people will be very upset when we have to add clan war features for the blocker players
11:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also I think opinions of players that care more and will stay longer matter more
11:08 < bridge> <learath2> So, how many new features a month you think is the appropriate amount?
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> The correct answer is that there is no "appropriate amount of new features per month". Sometimes there just isn't anything worth adding, and that is fine. It's what happens as projects mature
11:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I agree proper dictators are good. But we have nobody that is active enough .\_.
11:09 < bridge> <kebscs> This isn't why nothing gets added
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> The new switch targets look very promising. They will probably be the next major feature to be added
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> You and I seem to disagree on "what is worth adding", that seems to be the main issue here
11:10 < bridge> <texandnonik> would like to have bucket tool , i know that it's definetly possible with automaping rule , just don't know how .
11:10 < bridge> <texandnonik> can someone make or send me if he have it ?
11:10 < bridge> <texandnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408015426952237148/image.png?ex=68a8340d&is=68a6e28d&hm=b75697cea75f66cc8f11a82dda58779965088b45864ab77f1315b9f4aefbe409&

11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Aha, maybe time we finally use a breadth first search
11:11 < bridge> <kebscs> Nothings worth adding if you don't add anything
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> That doesn't make sense
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> It's circular
11:11 < bridge> <kebscs> I code a feature/make a request for 1 and it's in endless "discussion"
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon look what you've done, now I made it a composition and you have 27 files to look at
11:12 < bridge> <kebscs> Very easy for you to take 0 action and keep discussing
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> That's why we say ask us before making stuff to anyone that shows up
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> The discussions are how you figure out whether something is worth adding. You come in there with the a priori assumption that it is worth adding, because if not why did you even code it
11:13 < bridge> <kebscs> OK I asked about fast input 6 months ago now what
11:14 < bridge> <kebscs> Who's discussing, I see just 1 maintainer typing how many reactions the issue has
11:14 < bridge> <Assa> since it's highly discussed and not outright rejected, the assumption that it's worth adding can be made
11:15 < bridge> <kebscs> Ppl be quitting the game before any action gets taken
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> Like just fork it and do whatever you want? Idk what to tell you. I'm not going to merge something because it has X thumbs up emojis and you are annoyed at us
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: der deutsche Redaktor mit dem gro√üen K
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Refaktor
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Autocomplete aah
11:17 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea that's why people move to tclient
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Like what even is the demand here?
11:17 < bridge> <kebscs> And say ddnet client is shit
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Feel free to, we even encourage it
11:17 < bridge> <learath2> Have all the features you like
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> it's Vulkan an not Vulcan, it's Refactor and not Refaktor, can't we just delete one letter?
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> lang too inefficient
11:18 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea gonna add new tiles asap thanks for your input
11:18 < bridge> <Assa> we don't do Atomredaktors anymore
11:20 < bridge> <learath2> New tiles are usually not that hard to get in. I think almost everyone got their new tiles in
11:20 < bridge> <learath2> You'll see when louis finishes up with his switch targets. They'll probably take at most a week
11:20 < bridge> <kebscs> Last new tile added 3.5 years ago
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> new tiles are very hard to get in, we have multiple finished unmerged tiles in PRs
11:22 < bridge> <Assa> that's actually wrong, last tile was the new speeders this year
11:22 < bridge> <texandnonik> I don't mind automap rule for it . If you are talking about my suggestion.
11:22 < bridge> <kebscs> Not a new tile
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> There is probably something wrong with them. We aren't that strict on tiles
11:23 < bridge> <Assa> it factually is, a new tile with tile id 29 in speedlayer, it has some different properties to the old ones
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> Probably lacking a map along with the tile
11:23 < bridge> <kebscs> There's probably something wrong, new feature probably placebo. Nothing ever happens
11:23 < bridge> <Assa> plase take a look a tune lock tiles
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> Keep being snarky, I'm sure that'll help
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot I haven‚Äôt done anything .\_.
11:24 < bridge> <kebscs> You're trolling, I'm doing it back
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> I have been very matter of fact and professional at every point of this conversation
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> You have been implicitly badmouthing people and making snarky remarks for the last hour
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> I know it's annoying to not get your things merged. But that doesn't give you the right to be an ass
11:25 < bridge> <kebscs> üòÇ üòÇ
11:26 < bridge> <Assa> guys please, you don't make the situation better if keep on going like this
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Case and point
11:27 < bridge> <kebscs> You're probably right
11:27 < bridge> <kebscs> Can't tell need more discussion
11:27 < bridge> <kebscs> Well get back to you in a year to not discuss too much though
11:27 < bridge> <Assa> I'd certainly look into your fast input PR
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not touching anything you make with a 6ft pole, you can ask someone else to review your work. I'd rather not work with you in any manner, let alone as a collaborator
11:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Mb for doing anything for the game
11:29 < bridge> <Assa> ^
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> We appreciate all your contributions. I personally just don't want to interact with you anymore, so someone else can handle your stuff
11:29 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure you both did something for the game and that this should be valued
11:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: rude
11:30 < bridge> <kebscs> Big loss, 1 merge a year less
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> good vibes only
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao @kebscs
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> we now have chillerdragon, he merges new features blazingly fast
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> :justatest:  as long as they're not mine
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes blazingly merging reverts of kebs features
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> and you keep going, quite bold, anyway, I'll just ignore you, you are far too toxic for my taste and it just leaves a bad taste on the rest of my day whenever I talk with you
11:32 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
11:32 < bridge> <Assa> the weather is nice here, lets all go touch some grass!
11:36 < bridge> <chairn> yeah, no more 40¬∞C outside
11:36 < bridge> <chairn> a good fresh 24¬∞C
11:37 < bridge> <Assa> 22¬∞C is room temperature, here it's 19¬∞C (I enjoy it tbh)
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon: You can merge the fast input thing if you believe it's an actual improvement btw. I was considering merging it when Aoe also contacted me about it last week
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> Well technically Tater still needs to PR is
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> Well technically Tater still needs to PR it
11:44 < bridge> <Assa> Well technically he doesn't have to, since everything is running unde GPL3, but this would be a dick move
11:44 < bridge> <Assa> Well technically he doesn't have to, since everything is running under GPL3, but this would be a dick move
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> Well technically he doesn't have to (and somebody else does it), since everything is running under GPL3, but this would be a dick move
11:45 < bridge> <learath2> I think he is the one that came up with it, I'd rather he gets the commit credit for it. If he doesn't care for it then someone else can add it too
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> @totar :owo:
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> Is tclient gpl3? ddnet is zlib with our binary releases being gplv2
11:46 < bridge> <totar> I didn't define a license other than explcitly granting the upstream repo to use any code without permission
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> then you technically broke license law afait
11:47 < bridge> <totar> in what way
11:47 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/8f16118425afe2c4c34736c0f22f43bde654d37d/license.txt#L19
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> Well feel free to PR fast input if you'd like to see it in the client
11:48 < bridge> <totar> I still have that license
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> then I didn't say anything :owo:
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> did you put your own code under no license or just add it to the repo?
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> this is important here
11:48 < bridge> <totar> idk the ddnet license confused me at the time I forked the project
11:48 < bridge> <totar> so I just didn't change anything
11:49 < bridge> <totar> why is it important?
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> then you published the tater client with the gplv3 license (assuming it's on github)
11:49 < bridge> <totar> where does the gplv3 come from
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> teeworlds
11:50 < bridge> <totar> I can license the code I wrote under whatever I want
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> teeworlds isn't gplv3, it's also zlib
11:50 < bridge> <kebscs> How does the license work that even new added files need to have shareef as owner at the top?
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i gave my thumbs up now,
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> unless they relicensed it for 0.7
11:51 < bridge> <Assa> technically everything you add to the repo falls under the current contained license. You can switch the license to another one, then new code falls under the new license
11:51 < bridge> <Assa> but if sb clones your project from the old license, and the old license allows it, it's legal
11:51 < bridge> <Assa> even if the new license forbids it
11:52 < bridge> <totar> you can license code that you've written as any extra license you want
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> if more ppl use tclient than ddnet i think ddnet is missing out on something
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> you can also write at the top of each file author and license and it's licensed that way than
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> this is not very clear btw, that's why some projects explicitly require you to sign a contributor agreement
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i say this cuz i saw some gores post about tclient over ddnet)
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well im no maintainer so u can ignore me
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> which we don't have
11:53 < bridge> <totar> ok KoG it's the most popular client but I expect that's not the case for ddnet, there's simply not enough downloads for that to be the case
11:53 < bridge> <totar> on KoG it's the most popular client but I expect that's not the case for ddnet, there's simply not enough downloads for that to be the case
11:53 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea saw that too, was surprised
11:53 < bridge> <learath2> yeah, so if someone wanted to be extremely annoying, they could try to rescind their contributions, then we'd decline, then they could sue, which idk which way it'd go because at the very least there didn't use to be precedent
11:53 < bridge> <kebscs> And I don't see a lot of improvements expect fast input
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> some projects require u to bring a firmed letter from ur employer that ur code is licensed under the repo license, this is because some ppl have inj their contracts that all their code is company property even in free time, and if not stated it can be vague, gnu projects require this
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> some projects require u to bring a signed letter from ur employer that ur code is licensed under the repo license, this is because some ppl have inj their contracts that all their code is company property even in free time, and if not stated it can be vague, gnu projects require this
11:54 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is very annoying too, I think it's also one of the reasons matricks kinda stopped working on teeworlds iirc. His employer had a clause like that at the time
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah in ddnet hard cuz ddnet ha ssteam visibility but the point stands imho
11:55 < bridge> <kebscs> Makes sense, idk how easy it is to just switch the license without legal problems or smth
11:55 < bridge> <totar> https://tooomm.github.io/github-release-stats/?username=sjrc6&repository=TaterClient-ddnet
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know where i saw this written in detail? in osdev wiki about licensing ur kernel xd
11:55 < bridge> <kebscs> 13k every version is good
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> I open sourced a project at work and had to give my employer the rights of this work (even if it's open source licensed), because it was made at work and not at home and I was technically paid for it
11:55 < bridge> <kebscs> Very nice
11:56 < bridge> <totar> thanks :)
11:56 < bridge> <kebscs> Is this website accurate?
11:56 < bridge> <totar> I assume yes
11:56 < bridge> <totar> I think it pulls directly from github
11:57 < bridge> <totar> I remember there was a way you could get this info somewhere on github but it's not as nice
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye, but some contracts extend this to free off work time
11:57 < bridge> <Assa> you forget, that most people probably installed both clients and some only have steam releases to work with. I assume tater client has no steam page?
11:57 < bridge> <kebscs> Thought my project would have more downloads since it had a lot of traffic on github stats
11:57 < bridge> <kebscs> But that website shows 100k so idk
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> what project
11:58 < bridge> <Assa> I think this would be illegal here; imagine my company now owns some part of ddnet :kek:
11:58 < bridge> <kebscs> Kbotext
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> don't most clients just use our app id to show up on steam?
11:59 < bridge> <Assa> This would certainly not be the case, because ddnet is really not work related
11:59 < bridge> <kebscs> With how popular it is, and it brought 1k discord members in no time, the website shows 8k downloads
11:59 < bridge> <kebscs> With how popular it is, and it brought 1k discord members in no time, the website shows 8k downloads for latest rls
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> When you are under employment contract, the code you write during office hours is usually owned by those paying your salary, unless your contract explicitly says otherwise.
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> In some countries[which?], a working contract could encompass all the work you do in a certain field of knowledge, as long as the contract is valid, and sometimes even beyond that. That means that, if you are hired to write code at day, the code you write after office hours at home might also be legal property of your employer, the reasoning being that, since your employer paid you for working (and gaining experience) in a certain field, that exper
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> This might sound strange to you, outrageous even. But you really should have a talk with your superior. At best, your superior will see that you really are a dedicated software engineer, happy about having such an enthusiastic individual under contract, and tell you to go ahead with your spare-time project. At worst, you will be told that you cannot work on that project - before you have churned out 10k lines of source code and been sued by your em
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> This is not a joke, or something to be taken lightly. You could lose your job, and a fortune in money on top of that, should your employer play it rough and sue you for breach of contract. The Free Software Foundation requires you to present papers signed by your superiors before accepting your code submissions, and they don't do so because they enjoy bureaucracy.
11:59 < bridge> <totar> btw if it wasn't clear, I'm granting a full rights license for any code I've published to tclient to the ddnet organization, who can publish it under whatever license it wants.
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> put that in gh
12:00 < bridge> <learath2> I think you don't even need to say this unless you have anything special changed with your license on your fork. The zlib license pretty much allows anyone and everyone to yoink it
12:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.osdev.org/Licensing
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> @essigautomat btw where did you come up with gplv3? I don't think any teeworlds based project has ever been under gplv3 üòÑ
12:01 < bridge> <learath2> I can only think of our binary releases being gplv2
12:01 < bridge> <Assa> as I said, ddnet is not work related. If the company says "I thought you C++" I'd sue.
12:02 < bridge> <Assa> as I said, ddnet is not work related. If the company says "I taught you C++" I'd sue.
12:03 < bridge> <Assa> I think i have it wrong in my head, I released a lot under gplv3
12:03 < bridge> <Assa> like "no warranty, you can't sue me, but you need to put your code open source as well if you use mine"
12:04 < bridge> <totar> that's fine then üòä
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just saying it as info
12:04 < bridge> <learath2> I think this is very dependent on the jurisdiction btw, a lot of them limit what you can as the employer claim
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this is mostly american probs
12:04 < bridge> <0xdeen> Even if it's representative I don't think it's good. It will just be an average opinion and you end up with an average game. If there is a vision, you can make something great.
12:04 < bridge> <Assa> country of "freedom"
12:05 < bridge> <totar> my contract says literally nothing about ownership of code I write for other purposes. I think even during work hours if I write code for something else I would still own it.
12:05 < bridge> <totar> I was surprised
12:05 < bridge> <kebscs> "representative sample of the playerbase" isn't just the people on discord server?
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> I bet it would be completely illegal in the EU to make you sign some of the things that US companies make you sign
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> it is.
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine says smth about not competing in same field and not going to another company thats considered competition, but they have to give me a bonus in salary for that afaik, and i dont see it stated explicitly at my payroll so maybe it doesnt even hold
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> regarldess if i ever release my kernel ill wipe all git logs and set it to something silly
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> just in case
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe anonymous release
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ez
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> this might be one of the few things the US is ahead on, the FTC iirc banned non-competes
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i probs wont do anything remotely useful but i already have 12k lines of code)
12:09 < bridge> <Assa> mine only has a clause, that I need to follow the scientific practice (lol)
12:09 < bridge> <pilonpl> Surely in sane countries that's not a valid contract?? I think it only makes sense if your work somehow hurts the company but even then i think it applies only for a specific amount of time.
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but a contract can say lot of stuff and employees might believe it, companies are alloweed to write nything but what matters is if it holds in court
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i bet they usually would lose
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway im on friendly terms with my company this is just legal assurance
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> Typical issue, you might be right but the rich has a huge advantage
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> well luckily having a legal battle in eu is cheaper than us
12:12 < bridge> <kebscs> What's wrong with non-competes? imo it's logical that you don't want your employer to share stuff directly to the competition
12:13 < bridge> <totar> competition is good for the market
12:13 < bridge> <kebscs> Yea but this is like sharing secrets
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
12:13 < bridge> <totar> obviously sharing WHILE you're working for the company I think is still banned
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is NDA and there is non compete
12:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur always under a NDA
12:14 < bridge> <totar> that too
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ucant leak company secrets never iirc
12:14 < bridge> <learath2> The FTC argued that it's keeping wages down, and stifles innovation
12:14 < bridge> <totar> which is pretty obviously true if you think about it for 2 seocnds
12:14 < bridge> <totar> which is pretty obviously true if you think about it for 2 seconds
12:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> Honestly it's hard to tell
12:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> It costs money to develop anything so it's necessary in some way to prevent others from stealing it
12:15 < bridge> <kebscs> For people probably it's better, for employers not so much
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> Non-competes are banned, not non-disclosures, nor are you exempt from copyright law
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> You can't just steal stuff
12:16 < bridge> <totar> even though this is written on paper usually poaching people from another company somehow allows them to create very similar product. I think in practice if you can't prove that they stole the secrets there's still lots of secret stealing
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> The biggest issue with it is probably stealing stuff like customer lists
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> If you can compete in the same market, you can call up your old clients from the old company and undercut your old company given you know their margins and overheads
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc, its all hard to prove
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> forexample if i have a rly good backend idea that speedsu p things
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is not public ever
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i go another company and impl it
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its never user facing
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl would just notice app faster
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u cant proof i stole it
12:19 < bridge> <totar> also smart people will figure out a way to do it slightly differently but accomplishes the same thing if it really matters
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> So maybe it should just be the risk you take as a company?
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> tbh I guess none of this legislation was envisioned with stuff like software in mind, it's all ancient stuff dealing with things like patents on physical inventions
12:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> You can always try to keep employees who could possibly know a lot of stuff about what made your product successful
12:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> Pay them more or something idk
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> That's what they do
12:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> Maybe this is was never a real issue to begin with
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc, this is why meta pays 100M to some employees
12:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> Maybe this was never a real issue to begin with
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw one get into meta ai labs with that amounyt
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> amount*
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> some ppl value is extremely high
12:21 < bridge> <totar> my dad is listed as inventor for many things that are basically software patents, it's always funny they have to define a huge setup where it's like a machine that performs the software in order to patent it.
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> top AI people get silly amounts of money
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> Did you ever see patents for game mechanics? Pokemons capture thing is quite funny too
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1m8nonn/metas_facebook_superintelligence_team_leaked_all/

13:18 < bridge> <Assa> a lot of people ask in the dev channel for some reasons
13:18 < bridge> <Assa> maybe because here are all the smart nerds who know what to do and know how to help them
13:19 < bridge> <kebscs> ü§ì
13:19 < bridge> <kebscs> real real
13:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> no because its the first channel u can write in
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> really? :pepeW:
13:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah most people dont care where they write
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> maybe we should move tickets to the top then
13:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> most questions should go into #questions, but they dont know it exists
13:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> we cant, admins can
13:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> where a louis
13:21 < bridge> <Assa> we, as in, we the people of this community
13:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> community relies on admins
13:22 < bridge> <bosasha> nice thx
13:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> @louis.place very friendly reminder, that we are all waiting for the glorious targets to come into existance :brownbear:
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> xD
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> okay 1 : 0 for kebs
13:23 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> if I klick on his profile, he is working in VSCode on a skin renderer for his website
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure a module for this exists already
13:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> klick?
13:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> obviously the correct spelling is klik
13:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> there are at least 3 existing skin renderers out there https://teedata.net/skin-renderer, https://teeassembler.developer.li/, https://l0lmanph.legtux.org/tw/tee_assembler/
13:29 < bridge> <kebscs> how do you find them
13:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> google skills
13:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> "teeworlds skin renderer", "teeworlds skin assembler"
13:43 < bridge> <kebscs> fast input approved and 3 maintainers commenting on the issue??
13:43 < bridge> <kebscs> bullying works üòÇ
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fr fr
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I dont like the current state that everything is stale until maintainers get spammed. But that is how it is currently.
13:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> quic quic quic quic
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why the hell should fast input not be optional and default off xD
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller if you merge a non optional fast input i cry :lol:
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have the feeling only tater and me even understand the feature xD
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and teero probs too
14:03 < bridge> <melon> hey! I understand it
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Default off, nothing else gets merged!
14:04 < bridge> <melon> @ceogran is that a bot.
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, he spent the last 50 years to spam emoji reactions on discord
14:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> no he is just fast af
14:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You can do fast reactions if you hold shift while the reaction menu is up
14:05 < bridge> <melon> .......
14:05 < bridge> <chairn> TIL
14:05 < bridge> <melon> Am I the only person who's read #welcome :pepeW:
14:06 < bridge> <melon> Developer was clean when Heinrich was here :pepecry:
14:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to initiate the purge
14:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh yeah, purge me daddy
14:07 < bridge> <chairn> #developer has always been #off-topic for @Developer
14:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> *bans risu*
14:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> spamming reactions?
14:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats obscene!!
14:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ‚ú™ noted, i totally agree with you. And value your opinion on this way more than heinrichs. Fast input will be off by default.
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Well duh, obviously no one really understands it
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Understanding it takes actual thinking, "fast" sounds good to me
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Ship it
14:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lerato go finish some insane gores
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> No need, it's simple logic really, "slow" input would be bad, therefore "fast" input must be good
14:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 when merge all my prs?
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 19 left
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon is it `ivec2 m_Maxima;` `ivec2 m_vMaxima;` or `ivec2 m_aMaxima;`?
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** m_Maxima
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> but it's a vector
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** v is for ``std::vector``
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> with operator[]
14:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** v for vendetta
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> You should put good adjectives before your PR titles. For example try, "Implement good client side profanity filter" and "Add epic 128 player support"
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> I did it correctly, but only by luck
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 like fast input?
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly, very easy to understand that one. It's regular input, but fast
14:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** noted
14:56 < bridge> <kebscs> i like Feature: Implement quad clustering ‚ö°
14:56 < bridge> <kebscs> ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> I use boring workds like :"Refactor:", "Clean up:", "Bug fix:", "Feature:"
14:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** trump ah prs. GREAT input flag
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> Try a rocket emoji or a fire emoji instead
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> go test it and you know why the zap is there üòÑ
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> exactly, because gpu on fire
14:57 < bridge> <kebscs> i get 1k fps doesnt really matter if i get more
14:57 < bridge> <kebscs> i have a lot fps to spare for new features
14:58 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs I also like this one: #4523
14:58 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4523

14:58 < bridge> <Assa> but your gpu does less if you cap your fps, so you have more power to render  "other videos" on the other monitor
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> That link though
14:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> XDDDDDDDD
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sad but honestly so true.. Normal management talking
14:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** probably has my github credentials in there somewhere
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> no cap
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> bigger number
15:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: thanks for your github account
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> If you use mongodb I merge quicker
15:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat ono
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what that jwt is for but it might actually be for your entire account
15:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yikes
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> "Implement Amazing rendering, FPS go BRRR üìà "

15:01 < bridge> <learath2> and inside the pr text, try to use absolute figures, and don't give any baselines
15:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs yea idk? am i in trouble?
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> as I already said to robyt, no point in making benchmarks on a draft, if the based upon PR is not merged
15:03 < bridge> <kebscs> probably no
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> emperical benchmarks it is
15:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i may or may not have nudes on my github
15:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am in serious trouble if my github gets cracked i just realized
15:06 < bridge> <Assa> why don't you host your own home cloud like a reasonable dev
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont want to end up like ryo deleting my own backups
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> then don't make any :p
15:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** smart
15:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cant lose backups if you dont have any
15:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** üß†
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa also lets be honest microsoft has probably better security than my own cloud x
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I assume that jwt is smartly tied to my location, cookies or device smh
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> yeah only the admins, and the ai that trains on your data has access
15:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> oh and the antivirus
15:11 < bridge> <Assa> my cloud has military grade security (SSL/TLS üòÆ )
15:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i hope chatgpt doesnt dox me since its trained on my private secrets
15:12 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> can someone help me with it ?
15:12 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408076233375223889/image.png?ex=68a86cae&is=68a71b2e&hm=fd3fe8ae775a704b2e34e80e119f3055effcf05071ae145593cfe1ac57d8a872&
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i tried to get it to leak closed source code before
15:12 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> oh wait its on german xD
15:12 < bridge> <Assa> you are missing ddls in your ddnet directory
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ja schnitzel
15:12 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> where i can download it
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @osamabinballin5636 how does the folder look like where your DDNet.exe is?
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://ddnet.org/downloads/
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> dir fehlen die DLLs, hast du einen neuen client einfach in den download ordner gezogen? ^ nicht nur den client kopieren, auch die DLLs
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe your antivirus deleted the ddl? <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
15:13 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> you mean this?
15:13 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408076493707411587/image.png?ex=68a86cec&is=68a71b6c&hm=27aea84f69837ecc0f1f55daca41575b89308eafa275234e10048ad46a7c61d4&
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa $english
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes @osamabinballin5636 
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> yeye i am just helping
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> go call the police
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see plenty of ddls
15:13 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> ne wollte tats√§chlich discord komplett l√∂schen wusste ned das ddnet ne datei hat namens discord xD
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** dlls
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @osamabinballin5636 based
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** discord hater
15:14 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> sE
15:14 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> xD
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** was hast du gemacht? alle datein mit discord im namen gel√∂scht? xd
15:14 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> ok reinstall it but what is with the config?
15:14 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> ja xD
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> yeah ddnet has a discord integration :kek:
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its in %APPDATA%
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** should be save
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also you dont have to delete the old to get a new
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just slap a new folder next to it
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or even just copy paste the discord dll from the new one into your old
15:15 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> also kann ich denn ordner l√∂schen die einstellungen bleiben hauptsache ich l√∂sch nix in appdata?
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** vermutlich
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** au√üer du hast custom sachen in deinen ordner gepackt
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> ls -r /* | grep "discord | <somthing somthing xarg | rm -rf $file
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wie zb skins oder so
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> ls -r /* | grep "discord" | <somthing somthing xarg | rm -rf $file
15:15 < bridge> <Assa> ls -r /* | grep "discord" | <somthing somthing xarg> | rm -rf $file
15:15 < bridge> <osamabinballin5636> ne geht nur um sens usw
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** die sollte(tm) save sein
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> fast input is not placebo
15:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can confirm
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> chillerdragon can you remove the max 1 week limit of !remind?
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It 100% isnt placebo, it gives up to 20ms faster response
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Feedback*
15:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Who said it is?
15:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> learath was sure it was placebo
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> ?? bro how can it be placebo if there is a difference
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> fast input is basically a must for gorss
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> fast input is basically a must for gores
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok ok chill
15:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> he doesnt play the game
15:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> he cant know
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It Haas e pros and cons
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He's admin
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It Has pros and cons
15:36 < bridge> <teero777> right, admins are forbidden from playing I forgot
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Exactly
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> just be inactive as fuck and they will throw the admin role at you
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> I think jupstar might almost qualify
15:37 < bridge> <teero777> Just a bit more
15:44 < bridge> <lomination> Well, a placebo makes a difference, otherwise it's not called placebo but useless
15:45 < bridge> <teero777> placebo means that there is no literal difference but you perceive one.
15:50 < bridge> <lomination> Aren't you better if you believe that you are better?
15:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki @teero777 complained about the 1 week limit. What are your thoughts?
15:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I actually like the limit because i eventually restart the bot. Maybe saving reminders to disk should be done before increasing the limit
15:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> he is talking with a deen
15:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> trying to recover wiki
15:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> u cant see the channel
16:12 < bridge> <Assa> I'd write them in an sqlite tbh
16:12 < bridge> <Assa> and I would not add reminders if the time is over the limit
16:12 < bridge> <Assa> instead print an error message or something
16:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> the bot is written in js so shall it be in json
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> something something local file storage
16:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> csv the best
16:15 < bridge> <Assa> then I put "!remind 10 don't forget to add , and ; to file" and see how your csv holds
16:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> escape with json.stringify
16:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Has to be webscale
16:16 < bridge> <Assa> I did machine learning for an antigen company and they had data like that, csv is aweful
16:16 < bridge> <Assa> I did machine learning for an antigen company and they had data like that, csv can be aweful
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> sqlite > rest
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> hot take
