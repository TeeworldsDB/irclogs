00:09 < bridge> <alw5> ready to get flamed
00:10 < bridge> <kebscs> its alright
00:10 < bridge> <kebscs> feel like it fits under settings file more but other than that is ok
00:11 < bridge> <alw5> i can move it
00:12 < bridge> <alw5> yea true
00:12 < bridge> <alw5> i thought it would be below it
00:12 < bridge> <alw5> but then i realised it wasnt
00:12 < bridge> <alw5> and then i forgot
00:13 < bridge> <alw5> i thought it would because its below the code
00:13 < bridge> <alw5> of the settings file but ig not
03:28 < bridge> <louis> shouldnt it be in the ddnet tab?
05:26 < bridge> <thrava> I found the kick voting is seems to be separated between teams, but I can't find where decided it to be different from normal voting, whether it's server-side or client-side logic?
05:28 < bridge> <thrava> Or how can I implement custom team voting
05:30 < bridge> <thrava> I implemented team tuning but I need team voting feature to let it actually completed
07:01 < bridge> <zhn> wait we had buildwars all the time and no one knew it?
07:02 < bridge> <zhn> btw added tdtw feet animations on top of ddnet

08:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> no like 10 months ago
08:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> why all fish repos are not updated
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> fish is old
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> not that old
08:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but the rust port should bring new life
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> fairly niche too
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i think itâ€™s third behind zsh
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> in popularity
08:12 < bridge> <teero777> What are the benefits of fish compared to zsh?
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it was just more intuitive
08:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> one big downside is its not posix
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> highlighting and history with no setup was what got me into it
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and then i realized itâ€™s crazy powerful for real scripting applications
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> no it isnâ€™t POSIX compatible but personally i think of it like a different type of script
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should check nushell
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> e.g. https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/string.html
08:14 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of things like this

11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> its how u truly learn

11:19 < bridge> <Sans> no idea where I might even look for this
11:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> syntax is something you just get into - it's mostly knowing how to do task X logically.
11:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
11:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> knowing the syntax of a 2D vector is one thing.
11:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> knowing how to work with it is another
11:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> getting into the OOP mindset when working in c++ is the thing that confused me the most
11:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> classes, structs, enums, public, private, protected, friends, STL
11:20 < bridge> <Sans> oop is no problem, I prefer it over functional paradigm
11:20 < bridge> <Sans> it's just C++ as a whole is scary
11:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> idk i like rust more - it just feels more humane to work in :kek:
11:20 < bridge> <Sans> structs, friends and STL I have no idea what they are
11:21 < bridge> <Sans> I might guess structs are the equivalent of typescript interfaces?
11:21 < bridge> <Sans> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
11:21 < bridge> <Sans> I'm learning by comparison
11:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/stl.pdf
11:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
11:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> give it a read, it's awesome
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> structs are classes with different defaults in cpp
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> every field is public
11:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> also structs are public by default
11:22 < bridge> <Sans> so, a glorified typescript interface
11:22 < bridge> <Sans> easy enough to remember
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think ddnet only uses structs for POD
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which means no inheritence or containers
11:23 < bridge> <Sans> another acronym
11:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only plain old data
11:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> eh not really, structs have actual allocation, IIRC typescript handles that differently?
11:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> i only ever used typescript once for a discord bot :kekw:
11:23 < bridge> <Sans> interfaces are basically abstract classes
11:23 < bridge> <Sans> I suppose
11:24 < bridge> <Sans> You just don't initialize them
11:24 < bridge> <Sans> You just don't define them the same way
11:24 < bridge> <meloÆž> ah so it's some compile-time stuff
11:24 < bridge> <meloÆž> ew
11:24 < bridge> <Sans> yeah
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> They're useful mostly when it's not worth the effort to write a class for an object
11:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> compile time in ts ðŸ˜¬
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> and they're more flexible
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> :Bruh:
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> why do ppl crap on TS
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> it's awesome
11:25 < bridge> <Sans> (compared to js)
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> memory, pointers, arrays, etc
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> typescript is better than pyson, but that's about it
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜¬
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> C is easier to learn this

11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++ has too much magic
11:26 < bridge> <meloÆž> C makes it easier to bite your tongue
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
11:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> lets go rust mentioned
11:26 < bridge> <Ewan> thereâ€™s a lot to it my bwoah
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++ makes it even easier, but i just mean C is good to learn what pointers are and manual memory management
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> then once you know how it works you move to rust
11:27 < bridge> <Sans> arrays are easy enough, pointers might take a bit to get used to, and holy mother of jesus if i touch memory I'll make my ram sticks explode
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> disagreed
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if you dont know pointers u dont know arrays
11:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> i wonder when your zig phase will start :kekw:
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> makes it even easier to shoot ur foot
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> modern c++ initiatives are focused on making the language safer
11:27 < bridge> <Sans> arrays are just a list of values no?
11:27 < bridge> <Sans> im comparing everything to TS, sorry
11:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> i remember reading something along the lines of:
11:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
11:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> C makes it easier to shoot your foot
11:27 < bridge> <meloÆž> if you manage to do that in C++, you shoot off your whole leg
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> conceptually sure
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> they are directly related to pointers in c/++
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> theres a lot
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i always feel like cpp has too many ways to solve an issue.
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u have modern cpp, old cpp, c
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> managed, unmanaged
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and usually you mix all xd
11:29 < bridge> <Sans> at any rate, I wanna finish this small experiment, can someone guide me to where might I print something to F1 on startup?
11:29 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329759379351670815/image.png?ex=678b826d&is=678a30ed&hm=0a41fcef49cade4b4657296b8122e1442b554f694d3380f3efc3c0a2d273ad98&
11:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> i wonder if there is even a reason to use array over vectors?
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> a growable array is usually made of 3 components, the pointer that points at the start of the data, which is laid in memory contiguously
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ptr -> (some place in the heap) x1,x2,x3
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> current_length
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> capacity
11:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> hol up - array's are fixed size aren't they
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
11:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> `growable array` makes no sense
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> array is a ambiguous word
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
11:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> maybe i just suck at english
11:29 < bridge> <meloÆž> LOL
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i said growable array so its growable
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> simply after the console was initialized xd
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> growable array = vector
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> this is an arbitrarily named structure
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> distinct from the specific array syntax
11:30 < bridge> <Sans> no idea where that is or what file to even search for
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ig u could look in engine/client.cpp or gameclient.cpp
11:30 < bridge> <Sans> I call it F1, but idk how it's called in the project
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> CConsole oninit fn
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they have oninit functions or similar
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ripgrep is ur friend
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> also if ur on windows switch to gentoo right now
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also if you are on gentoo, buy the best CPU now
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is not a threat (it is)
11:31 < bridge> <Sans> I'm too lazy to dual boot
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also if you buy the best CPU, buy the best GPU too
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> then dont dual boot
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :deen_star:
11:31 < bridge> <meloÆž> Ryozuki trying to convert people to gentoo like some sort of Jehovah's Witness
11:31 < bridge> <Ewan> also if youâ€™re on gentoo, sell it bcs their package cache will make it unnecessary soon

11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> what games u play

11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> valorant is crazy
11:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> valorant: true
11:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
11:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> every other game: absolutely false
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> and poe 1 and 2
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> have u played poe2 early access
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think eac has linux support
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u tick a checkmark
11:32 < bridge> <meloÆž> it's really only vanguard that's running on kernel level that's ass
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is stupid af
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> opt in per game
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> on dev side
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, stupid
11:32 < bridge> <Sans> So far I just added a new settings tab and added that
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> just enable it always
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @sans._. i have a blog post series on ddnet coding, maybe a bit outdated but works https://edgl.dev/categories/ddracenetwork/
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> sticking with windows for valorant is something I will never understand
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> that game has zero charisma
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i played it like 5 times i just dont get it
11:33 < bridge> <Sans> If you can get it running on any linux distro I'll switch to it
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt marvel hearoes the hype now
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> not yet
11:33 < bridge> <Sans> otherwise I'll have my windows OS with a side of microsoft bullshit
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> give it 18mos
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft i heard valorant is mostly played bi egirls
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft i heard valorant is mostly played by egirls
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> checks out
11:34 < bridge> <meloÆž> i dont want some cringy ahh people uwu'ing in my ear, that's why i played counter strike for most of my live. the screaming toxicity is what gets me going in games
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> same
11:34 < bridge> <Sans> wrong, it's played by dudes pretending to be egirls
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> my sister played it
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> she is not a egirl tho
11:34 < bridge> <Sans> well, she's a dude now
11:34 < bridge> <meloÆž> your sister a dude now
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ur sister sounds moral
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> she mostly plays the sims 4
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk what the appeal is
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> lfg
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but she has lot of hours
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> much better than valorant
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it scratches an itch in the ape brain
11:35 < bridge> <Sans> anything less than 500 and she can still go back to having a normal life, go go go
11:35 < bridge> <Sans> 
11:35 < bridge> <Sans> make her quit this god forsaken game <a:elmoburn:737726333798449172>
11:35 < bridge> <totar> that's good but learning how the components work is the definitely the easiest way to add powerful features without interfering with the rest of the code.
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imagine being a sims4 pro
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> she had over 1 or 2k idk
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i think his goal is to learn tho
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> so
11:36 < bridge> <Sans> how might I do that? just a new file with whatever I need in it right?
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to tinker with cmake then
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> look at other component class structures
11:36 < bridge> <meloÆž> our cmake file is horrible anyway, cmake allows to recursively add files, IIRC we're only not doing that because of some antibot shii
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> their class and member definitions are rly important and you should see how it works pretty quick
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> countryflag_de
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> countryflag_en
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> countryflag*
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> *
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> *
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> *
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> *
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> *
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> horrible.
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> globbing for source files is considered bad practice
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz heinrich says glob is evil
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> why is it bad practice :( `*.h *.cpp` and you're gucchi
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> Gucchi
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> You live in the same continent bro
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> why is it bad practice :( `*.h *.cpp` and you're gucci
11:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> god damn it.
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> high potential for mistakes ig
11:38 < bridge> <totar> imo we should be globbing for asset files
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> and itâ€™s just better to be explicit
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd rather glob source than assets xd
11:38 < bridge> <totar> rly?
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> source needs to compile
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> assets can easily be unused
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> globbing allows a threat actor do add a file easier
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but tbh, i'd probs wildcard both xD
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs i dealing with the cmake stuff is just annoying indeed
11:39 < bridge> <totar> I don't think specifying the assets makes it any less likely one gets unused
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> who wants coconut milk
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329762030688796713/image.png?ex=678b84e5&is=678a3365&hm=cb85198bd55e457e2cc2eaff2ec22336cdfef8fd95149ceb5690b38323e9c4fd&
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> especially bcs we have no tools to automate stuff. u need to manually place them in alphabetically order
11:39 < bridge> <meloÆž> i thought you stopperd playing ffXIV
11:39 < bridge> <meloÆž> i thought you stopped playing ffXIV
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> additionally my file explorer disagrees with the order we chose xD
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol no
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> can you ever quit a game like that
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> im nearly full leveled on all
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329762166907211776/image.png?ex=678b8506&is=678a3386&hm=ddb5302de1fbb3b8cbdbe9d8c6c8e48e9908b16dbcdb58ac8f34df98ed5d24d3&
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> small ad
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i learned this like last month but apparently my dad just still plays his star wars mmo all day
11:40 < bridge> <totar> a lot of the assets literally can't be unused if they exist in the folder
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 185 days played as ingame hours
11:40 < bridge> <totar> the client will always load them and error if it's wrong
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant leave
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im playing more ddnet now
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> proof
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329762411640787034/image.png?ex=678b8540&is=678a33c0&hm=0fb76cedf3762efcbfe9363fe214aa8276c45d18dfc03f3f2db274c4f061a940&
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ill have to add your name to friends
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody i like in usa plays anymore
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's almost addiciton level again, nice
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> my skill is still somewhat there
11:42 < bridge> <meloÆž> i'm still unsure what's bad practice about `file(GLOB_RECURSE GAME_SERVER src/game/server/*.c src/game/server/*.cpp src/game/server/*.h)` for example, we're bound to the src path `src/game/server` anyway for example :(
11:42 < bridge> <Ewan> that is actually really solid work lol
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> like riding a bike
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just finishing ez maps
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> probably none. it's simply a matter of taste
11:43 < bridge> <louis> ur not an asian eboy u wouldnt understand
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> he is from romania tho
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> discord is such a stalker tool
11:44 < bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily, there is a valid case to be made for a generation time & compile time discrepancies
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ppl just put their info there
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> a wildcard motivates you to more easily create files, potentially making your logic split more cleanly, resulting in a better code structure.
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329763272714616854/image.png?ex=678b860e&is=678a348e&hm=f39ec46a8b5d45df93137a54b8a380fba7beac51cc71523587aebd88a261d6d2&
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but how slow should a glob be xd
11:44 < bridge> <Ewan> if a dev added a new file upstream and you pulled, but didnâ€™t have a need to change cmakelists or run cmake again, you will get confusing linker errors when trying to compile
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i doubt parsing the cmake script is much faster
11:45 < bridge> <totar> the alphabetical order thing is annoying af
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> agreed
11:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> why dont we switch to mason
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> overkill and stupid
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> meson isnâ€™t there
11:45 < bridge> <totar> I'm more annoyed that cmake doesn't tell you how to fix it when you do it wrong
11:46 < bridge> <totar> or at least which line the ordering broke at
11:46 < bridge> <totar> it just tells you "something in this list is wrong"
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> will that never be removed from ur acc?
11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> why would they
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how did u even get it?
11:47 < bridge> <totar> it becomes invisible after 10 years I think
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, imagine u 13y old kiddie xd
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not my acc its sans
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and yeah its there forever
11:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the vac ban lasts a set amount of time, but the history should stay imo
11:47 < bridge> <totar> 7 years actually
11:48 < bridge> <oxyzo.> im going to get a vac ban in those 10 years
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never had a vac
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329764231180193792/image.png?ex=678b86f2&is=678a3572&hm=eb22329a971bf69923b5ae5a2cce6f6aaa26acc12dc54e8e4e8bb12a4de2c5bd&
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> me neither
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i only have 9yrs of service
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> feelsbadman
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> young
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> im old
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 24
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i made acc when i was 10 ig
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> u old fart
11:49 < bridge> <totar> the shame is part of the punishment
11:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for me steam is down rn lol
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329764585103691797/image.png?ex=678b8746&is=678a35c6&hm=8c7d523e6b8439d45bc1a69d4448b7f10db90440052d1d0770288c245e1d371f&
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well steamcommunity to be precise

11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329764685708529705/IMG_7419.png?ex=678b875e&is=678a35de&hm=131446e8d4637658cfc299e6c1825321ef5d546453edddfe6deecc997f228576&
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:50 < bridge> <louis> level 79 wow
11:50 < bridge> <louis> how many badges did u buy
11:50 < bridge> <louis> cards
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt buy badges
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use points to buy season badge
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> in point shop
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> it gives lot of lvls
11:50 < bridge> <louis> ah ok
11:50 < bridge> <louis> i use points to get anime pfps and bgs lmfao
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> thatâ€™s the thing about steam i could never get with lol
11:50 < bridge> <Ewan> all the marketplace shit
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanna buy games man and then play them
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the most annoying thing about steam is, that it's 32 bit and the loading times are just insanely bad xd
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s quite sad how the desktop app ended up
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> my cat is sleeping profoundly
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329765090211266571/PXL_20250117_105106556.jpg?ex=678b87bf&is=678a363f&hm=b59a4ce621dbd430753a404de4455ce6c58fe50fc7f2bc6594665a4015c8ec47&
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> going from vgui straight to web is sad
11:52 < bridge> <louis> marketplace is a good invention
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329765197900025897/image.png?ex=678b87d9&is=678a3659&hm=8e15f6eae5fb62adafc25a728273e695a917d245fdd43717d66bd118a9bc3c6a&
11:52 < bridge> <louis> allows u to make $0.50/hour playing csgo
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> man i am longer in steam than learath on this world
11:52 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :greenthing:
11:52 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
11:52 < bridge> <totar> I haven't had many issues with the webness of the steam app in the last couple years
11:53 < bridge> <Ewan> windows user spotted
11:53 < bridge> <louis> it just feels sluggish
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> heroic games launcher is made in typescript too, but is just trillion times faster
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i hope they add steam support some day
11:53 < bridge> <Ewan> apps shouldnâ€™t need hardware acceleration to feel snappy in day to day use
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> thatâ€™s the epic alternative right? ironic cuz epic actually makes theirs in unreal and itâ€™s somehow worse
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> epic & gog
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> the thing is if anyone in the gaming industry knows how to architect a large scale C++ project itâ€™s valve
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and they choose web for what 90% of ppl will see valve as
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and they donâ€™t even do it well
11:56 < bridge> <Ewan> not even cpp strictly but a language where you have to think about stuff
11:57 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> how to change ddnet language?
11:57 < bridge> <totar> Open settings -> Press "Language"
11:57 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> I meant something else
11:57 < bridge> <Ewan> im not buying what youâ€™re selling skibidi man
11:58 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> how to make it say something else instead of the name play
11:58 < bridge> <Ewan> how to formulate a question in a logical way
11:58 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> wtf im selling
11:58 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> my english language in C4
11:58 < bridge> <Ewan> Iâ€™m going to strap c4 to your chest
11:59 < bridge> <louis> search the entire project for "Play", find where the button is defined, then change the string
11:59 < bridge> <louis> are you familiar with programming? if not then learn the basics before u try to mod ddnet
11:59 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i need to modify source code?
11:59 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
11:59 < bridge> <Ewan> or open a hex editor and search
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s all in .data
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> the cosntants at least
12:00 < bridge> <totar> you could make a new translation file and put it in the folder
12:00 < bridge> <Ewan> he was in here trolling other day

12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> devs speak english so i guess youâ€™ll have to live with it
12:09 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bro why not Chinese
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> most of the devs donâ€™t speak chinese
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> this chat is mostly american and european rn
12:09 < bridge> <Sans> There is chinese
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> he means default
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> ah
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> Is there anything that chooses the language on first startup?
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s locale dependent
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> so if someone's PC is in korean, the game is by default in korean
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> right
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> ?
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> youâ€™d hope so
12:10 < bridge> <Sans> :Bruh:
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but iâ€™ve never tested xD
12:11 < bridge> <Sans> i aint changing my system's locale to check that
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> exactly
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but yeah thatâ€™s how itâ€™s worked historically
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean locale goes back really far
12:11 < bridge> <Sans> sadly still no DDNet Thai
12:11 < bridge> <Sans> :sad:
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> detection has always been important not just for language but processing data too
12:11 < bridge> <Sans> how so?
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> before unicode, how do u determine which charset do u need
12:12 < bridge> <Sans> oh
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> before unicode, how do u determine which charset u need
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> or encoding ig
12:12 < bridge> <Sans> Yeah I get what you mean
12:12 < bridge> <Sans> idk
12:12 < bridge> <Sans> that's why computer wizards exist
12:12 < bridge> <Sans> some of them even know ancient languages like fortran
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> do you know a stoned smurf
12:13 < bridge> <Sans> @stoned_smurf bro the devs are onto you, run!
12:13 < bridge> <Sans> yeah, that guy
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you are the same guyâ€¦
12:13 < bridge> <Sans> wdym?
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i just know he knew a sans
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> from ddnet
12:14 < bridge> <Sans> im probably the single-most known player with Sans as their name (ig Sans3108 because Sans is taken by someone in china)
12:14 < bridge> <Sans> im probably the single-most known player with Sans as their name (ign Sans3108 because Sans is taken by someone in china)
12:15 < bridge> <Ewan> sans undertale
12:15 < bridge> <Sans> This is pain and suffering at it's peak, why can't we use external apps :(
12:15 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329771177547268166/image.png?ex=678b8d6a&is=678a3bea&hm=99f9f3c7758672629c8f6316be132cc55fdf9c4c30fcea5c5d828a87877cc97a&
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> who needs that
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> why
12:16 < bridge> <Sans> why not?
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> thereâ€™s gotta be a reason why
12:16 < bridge> <Sans> It's a discord bot, a tool
12:16 < bridge> <Sans> tools are made to be used
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> especially considering this chat is also bridged to irc and matrix so discord specific features are not translatable
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a very new concept in discord
12:16 < bridge> <Sans> not really
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> and i have to say, they probably should have asked users first
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> this channel is pure
12:17 < bridge> <Sans> very easily translatable
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody uses this shit
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> to thrill rust and ddnet
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and linux
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> except for discord bot circlejerk groups
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and vulkan
12:17 < bridge> <Sans> I have about a billion people disagreeing with you
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never seen someone use a app in discord
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i think we have different use cases here
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> weâ€™re here to conversate
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> with speech
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> written word
12:18 < bridge> <Sans> :Bruh:
12:18 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329771745112231936/image.png?ex=678b8df1&is=678a3c71&hm=240a09e8b8547b7dfedb519a9d9e1b26df181d18060eb9796214da5e276e71c7&
12:18 < bridge> <louis> tools are invisible if you don't want them though
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps an image
12:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i activated c4 by mistake
12:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i have no more house
12:18 < bridge> <Sans> defuse it
12:19 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> to late
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s too late
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
12:19 < bridge> <Sans> nah, you got 40 seconds
12:19 < bridge> <Sans> the code is 7355608
12:19 < bridge> <teero777> Create an implosion with the same strength
12:19 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it's already boomed
12:19 < bridge> <Sans> damn, there's always next round ig
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i hit you with a hammer and then you explode
12:20 < bridge> <Sans> that's not very scientifically accurate of you
12:20 < bridge> <Sans> smh
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you have to wait a little bit
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and i have to be the bomb first
12:21 < bridge> <Sans> You have more chances for the hammer to phase through me than for me to explode on impact
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> tsk
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> this guy doesnâ€™t play bomb tag
12:22 < bridge> <Sans> bomb tag is just hot potato
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> no because you explode
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you donâ€™t burn your hand slightly
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you literally explode
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> high stakes game
12:24 < bridge> <Sans> How does one print something to the F1 console?
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> Because external apps are not audited at all. So people just make spammer apps
12:29 < bridge> <Sans> aw
12:39 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> why
12:39 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> ahy
12:39 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> why
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> like any of us know
12:40 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> why when i adding own lang
12:40 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it doesn't apper in languages tab
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought you meant in general
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno
12:41 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> dk u think i stupid
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> no itâ€™s just a really hard question
12:47 < bridge> <Sans> How do I get the name of the player here? This keeps ending up as "Nameless Tee"
12:47 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329779172805050428/image.png?ex=678b94dc&is=678a435c&hm=d4b24f55442c50d0d5c064510b4679a0cad3e53edb19ae5d00d9dbee4e054873&
12:48 < bridge> <Sans> nvm my name was set to Nameless Tee
12:48 < bridge> <Sans> oops
12:55 < bridge> <Sans> :owo: I've done it, I'm so proud of myself
12:55 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329781036569067621/image.png?ex=678b9699&is=678a4519&hm=dc2927383a92717aeec06e8f2902130f3336d1882863cbd84d52bd21a8a5985d&
13:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> :poggers2:
13:00 < bridge> <Sans> New goal: re-create fussel's client
13:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> :pepeW:
13:01 < bridge> <Sans> jk, im nowhere near that level of expert
13:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> :pepeW: :pepeW:
14:30 < bridge> <oxyzo.> add minecraft in ddnet settings
14:45 < bridge> <zhn> @robyt3 CFlow fits really well in vanilla, thanks for this opened treasure :P
15:08 < bridge> <swarfey> yeah i did not promote it anywhere, only ogs from my server know it :x
15:09 < bridge> <swarfey> what are tdtw animations?
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ixn4RLcAhg
15:23 < bridge> <zhn> 10 year old thing already xd
15:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> so silly
15:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> i love it
15:25 < bridge> <swarfey> i wonder how it looks like on hammerhit maps
15:27 < bridge> <zhn> just try it out :P
15:43 < bridge> <Sans> that's so cute but very distracting XD
15:46 < bridge> <zhn> looks really good on fast paced mods ngl
15:47 < bridge> <zhn> for me at least
15:47 < bridge> <zhn> i can better feel the tee positioning
15:51 < bridge> <bencie.> @jupeyy_keks is it possible to host a multiplayer editor session through the terminal?
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes, but that currently requires you to self compile the editor-server
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `cargo run --release -p editor-server -- path.map password port`
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the path of the map must be inside `~/.config/ddnet-editor-server`.
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If you start the server once it should also create that dir
15:54 < bridge> <bencie.> tysm!
15:54 < bridge> <bencie.> :owo:
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh btw when it started it will show the cert hash
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is suddenly always required sadly
16:07 < bridge> <meloÆž> Thank you for this btw
16:07 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
16:07 < bridge> <meloÆž> Can't wait to test this out on my vps when i'm home
16:08 < bridge> <bencie.> i asked for that exact reason ^^
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i never tested on a vps btw
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> might require weird deps
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but should work
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if it worked give me feedback what u had to do xd
16:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> I will be trying to Livestream the multiplayer editor consistently until we actually have a finished map - feel free to add any issue that you have on the issue tracker on GitHub, jupstar and maybe me will try to fix em then :greenthing:
16:10 < bridge> <bencie.> sure we found some annoyances with souly
16:13 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> bro why print("helo world") not working
16:13 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> it gives me an error
16:13 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> like there no such command in c++
16:14 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329831263795675146/image-41.png?ex=678bc560&is=678a73e0&hm=02ae09de31d694555af7f45162492b430792ab5d967ec9f8f297f6976d7115d9&
16:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> exactly, it's either printf for a formatted stdout, or just use std::cout <<
16:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> Also your file has no extension
16:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> You may want to start a YouTube tutorial for the absolute basics ^^
16:15 < bridge> <bencie.> im not even sure if we missed these features or theyre actually not in there, i couldnt find them in your issue:
16:15 < bridge> <bencie.> - no confirmation that you're hosting, i was confused whether it successfully staretd or not (also, hosting twice on the same port crashes game)
16:15 < bridge> <bencie.> - can't move layers up and down
16:15 < bridge> <bencie.> 
16:15 < bridge> <bencie.> should i add these?
16:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i writed aimbot by mistake
16:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what should i do
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> add everything
16:16 < bridge> <bencie.> aight
16:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> you can see connected people on the lop left, the icon will change when someone is connected, but a 'live' thingie seems nice
16:16 < bridge> <oxyzo.> write ddnet by mistake to fix it
16:16 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> ohh ok
16:16 < bridge> <bencie.> yea but if they havent connected
16:16 < bridge> <bencie.> or in my case, i did the wrong port so they couldnt connect anyways
16:17 < bridge> <bencie.> i had no way of telling if im hosting or not
16:17 < bridge> <bencie.> or in my case, i did the wrong port the first time so they couldnt connect anyways
16:17 < bridge> <meloÆž> Fair, just a way to display all your hosting data and like a green ball somewhere indicating that you're hosting or smith :owo:
16:17 < bridge> <bencie.> yeah!
16:17 < bridge> <meloÆž> Fair, just a way to display all your hosting data and like a green ball somewhere indicating that you're hosting or smth :owo:
16:17 < bridge> <bencie.> thatd also be good because if you choose random port, then you dont know what port ur hosting on
16:18 < bridge> <bencie.> thatd also be good because if you choose random port (0, which is the default) , then you dont know what port ur hosting on
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well theoretically you always host your map. bcs the whole editor is built around the network functionality, even if u map alone
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the host ui just lets u define a port
16:18 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> also guys
16:19 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> is steam recording better than obs?
16:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> So you're actually spying on me 24/7 - got it
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @bencie. btw if u have suggestions for all issues you find, please add them too, even if they are just unfinished thoughts
16:19 < bridge> <meloÆž> No idea
16:20 < bridge> <bencie.> alright
16:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> Bencie, formatting for check boxes is `- [ ]`
16:20 < bridge> <meloÆž> :owo:
16:20 < bridge> <bencie.> ye got it thanks
16:21 < bridge> <bencie.> :D
16:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> most epic markdown feature imo
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: im debugging my server again
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> the issue is so bad that i cant find the bug even with the help of wireshark
18:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> the packets are exactly the same that libtw2 server sents
18:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> so cool
18:47 < bridge> <zhn> what an issue
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> connection xd
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> client doesnt receive snapshots
18:48 < bridge> <zhn> does it connect at least?
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> stuck here
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329870035287539834/image.png?ex=678be97c&is=678a97fc&hm=d420857b5903984bf6a5dfb385fc866fbe0838fb315ada66f1d0e2232507ab35&
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> even though i send snap single packets
18:49 < bridge> <zhn> but you don't need to afair
18:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> still stuck on that screen
18:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> hmm
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> everything looks fine here
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329870653326884985/image.png?ex=678bea0f&is=678a988f&hm=dc05b85e4326033fb07f1035c7db0ee42f57c656b5bd508b01a83f23c91fafe5&
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> so the client knows about the map, tunes and etc
18:53 < bridge> <swampboloto_33693> 19.0 when
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> do you send it as 1 packet?
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> i fixed it xd
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> I think you do need a couple full snaps before the client enters the game properly
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> delta tick was wrong
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> damn
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> lol
18:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> lets gooo
18:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329871385350111234/image.png?ex=678beabe&is=678a993e&hm=cb7f0e07a1e5e4e0d7ea539b7dbe3e6644aec5b7ad5b03ce94b457ded9e9481c&
18:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> ecs framework for teeworlds server coming soon
18:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> just wait a few years
18:55 < bridge> <zhn> don't tell me you are using bevy ecs
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> im not
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> i used it in previous implementation
18:55 < bridge> <zhn> what do you use now?
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://docs.rs/evenio/latest/evenio/
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> i kinda like it
18:56 < bridge> <zhn> have you ever tried edict :justatest:
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> never heard of that
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> i know about flecs
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> its kinda cool
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> but too much stuff that i dont need at all
18:57 < bridge> <zhn> flecs is a c library
18:57 < bridge> <zhn> afair
18:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is rust wrapper
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> try it out :justatest:
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> maybe i should write the server using 4 different ecs libraries
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> what could possibly go wrong
19:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> if i run into limitations with evenio i might consider using it
19:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> since the author of the library disappeared for 7 months
19:02 < bridge> <thrava> anyone have an idea about team voting?
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> you can just ask roman to fix a bug for you in edict or request a feature
19:03 < bridge> <zhn> he will do it for real :justatest:
19:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> can he write a teeworlds server for me
19:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> :kek:
19:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> one of the reasons i use ecs is to avoid dealing with the borrow checker
19:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> shame on me
19:05 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> ## Hey, it would be really nice if you could use groups for groups to make mapping more clear
19:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea it would
19:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> but backwards compatibility
19:07 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> why should there be a problem?
19:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> because there will be
19:07 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> the old maps just wouldnt use it
19:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> what about old clients
19:07 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> and how are new things implemented?
19:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> make an issue on github, start implementing it or ask someone else to implement it, make a pr, get rejected or approved
19:08 < bridge> <learath2> You can probably hack it in a backwards compatible way where it will look awful on old clients editors but work ingame
19:08 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> pr?
19:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> pull request
19:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> with the updates to the code
19:09 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> how to do it?
19:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> do you know how to code in c++?
19:10 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> not really
19:10 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> maybe just a tiny little bit
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> afair there is already an issue about that on github
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> lemme find it
19:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7892
19:12 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> so they already work on it?
19:12 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> or what does it mean?
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> no
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> no one works on it
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> its just an issue
19:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> good idea
19:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> we can make a snow mega group and not spam the editor layer ui
19:25 < bridge> <cosmicxenor> ok and when do we know if they will work on it?
19:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> they wont
19:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> welcome to ddnet
20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> big oopsies
20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329898647915335730/image.png?ex=678c0421&is=678ab2a1&hm=b1ecef4bf785503e18966212040eecce8df8130e98b09b89aed85cc30afd093e&
21:37 < bridge> <isowner> hi, i found an openssl lib in cmakelists, im tried just include
21:37 < bridge> <isowner> ```cpp
21:37 < bridge> <isowner> #include <openssl/aes.h>
21:38 < bridge> <isowner> #include <openssl/rand.h>
21:38 < bridge> <isowner> ```
21:38 < bridge> <isowner> but have error "cannot open openssl..."
21:38 < bridge> <isowner> how can i include it?(in engine/client/client.cpp)
21:38 < bridge> <bp_unmoggable> Does ddnet still officialy support x32 builds? Or will it be removed from ddnet site in the future
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you install OpenSSL with the header files? When running cmake it should show that OpenSSL was found
21:43 < bridge> <isowner> oh.. yea, im not installed it, where i may find his sources or ready dll?
21:43 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases or your package manager if you use MSYS2
21:44 < bridge> <isowner> thanks
21:45 < bridge> <tombrider1337> I think @0xdeen was considering removing 32bit support, not sure. Would like to know too
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> thereâ€™s no guarantee they will be kept, 32 bit computers account for an incredibly small amount of people now & a new, somewhat detrimental 32 bit specific bug was found recently
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> btw what was up with that
21:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Windows 11 doesn't even have a 32 bit version anymore
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> did u ever get to the bottom of that though
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> curious
21:47 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it was related to rust not supporting 32 bit anymore so we are using an older version to build now
21:48 < bridge> <tombrider1337> tclient is step ahead and doesn't even provide 32bit since beginning lol
21:48 < bridge> <isowner> idk how i may build it. he doesn't have cmakelists
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> You can download a binary release not the source code
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know how to build it either
21:50 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> guys
21:50 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> fast
21:50 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what should i do if i wrote aimbot
21:50 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> by mistake
21:51 < bridge> <isowner> lol
21:51 < bridge> <isowner> how
21:51 < bridge> <tombrider1337> I think you gotta open a PR on ddnet github asap
21:52 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> to make aimbot as default ddnet feature?
21:52 < bridge> <isowner> HAHAHAHAH
21:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 what addressed are compared in this if statement? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2b1cc28933aa0121bcb9cbd16ae3e7012a85ce77/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1367
21:52 < bridge> <tombrider1337> I mean you can try
21:52 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> oh
21:52 < bridge> <isowner> where binaries ðŸ˜­
21:52 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> I'll try
21:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 what addresses are compared in this if statement? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2b1cc28933aa0121bcb9cbd16ae3e7012a85ce77/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1367
21:53 < bridge> <isowner> on github only sources
21:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be the address of the server you are connected to and the address of the server info packet
21:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah
21:53 < bridge> <robyt3> The `.tar.gz` files are the binary releases
21:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Please don't unless you want to get banned
21:55 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> idk, I've tried to write better cursor precision, and it turned out like this
22:12 < bridge> <isowner> no, these files also contain sources
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> yea tell him what it is lol
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> :monkaS:
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> guess you'll have build it yourself, read the README files
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329922211078864927/image.png?ex=678c1a13&is=678ac893&hm=ae82ccd0af3196da70b9ee3f6d1a894433aa7af97a0af6161ce0e06b4ec5b95f&
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Windows 32bit
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet.org/downloads
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> oh you're the other guy
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to obtain it first, if it's in a package manager you could use package config or cmake's find_package, alternatively you can download the source and put it in a separate folder
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> they should have specific building/include instructions
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if using a local copy you might try add_subdirectory, or build it manualkly & include its /include & link its /lib
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> if using a local copy you might try add_subdirectory, or build it manually & include its /include & link its /lib (target_include_directories/target_link_libraries)
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> there's not one way to do it
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you could also try fetch_content which uses git to download it, and should expose a package for find_package if you do it right
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> mb @ bp_unmoggable lmfao
22:36 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what does assertion mean
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i assert that your condition evaluates to true
22:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> so assertion error is if condition is false?
22:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
22:53 < bridge> <Ewan> there are different types of assertions, whenever you see one when playing DDNet it probably means an unforeseeable error occurred but it just wants to crash elegantly
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> but they are also used heavily in unit testing and even const logic to prevent the thing from even being compiled if those conditions are not met
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> e.g. static_assert
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> so there are different kinds but yeah the idea is just to ensure that everything is as expected so to speak
