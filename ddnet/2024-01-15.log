00:01 < bridge> <super3559> can you tell me how you did it?
00:02 < bridge> <gerdoe> build no 2800 btw!!
00:31 < bridge> <super3559> i need help with cmake to build the source code
00:33 < bridge> <teero777> what exactly
00:34 < bridge> <super3559> apparently it din't recognize visual studio code
00:34 < bridge> <super3559> even if i had it installed
00:34 < bridge> <super3559> and oppened in another tab
00:35 < bridge> <super3559> i looked it up and it said
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> what did not recognize vscode?
00:37 < bridge> <teero777> if you mean cmake. vscode does not have an integrated compiler. if youre on windows then use visual studio community
00:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> don't!
00:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> install compiler and cmake
00:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> then you will be able to work with vscode
00:46 < bridge> <teero777> ik msvc is bad. but its easier xdd
01:01 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> on windows you can ofc use visual studio or any other IDE, you'd just want the visual studio build tools
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ???
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> don't use vscode because it doesn't come with a compiler?
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> thats not what i mean xddd
01:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh wait i just reread that :kek:
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> cmake-gui doesnt work for vscode right?
01:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ?
01:03 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
01:03 < bridge> <reitw> @blaiszephyr get back to work
01:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> u
01:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> its 3 am @reitw :(
01:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 1 am*
01:03 < bridge> <reitw> 24/24
01:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> its 1 am @reitw :(
01:03 < bridge> <reitw> 7d/7 u should be
01:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> on windows you can ofc use vsc or any other IDE, you'd just want the visual studio build tools
01:08 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but for context to actually answer the question: to build the source code on windows you'd want 5 things, an IDE of your choice (you're not forced to use visual studio community no worries), cmake, rust, python, and most importantly the visual studio build tools for c++
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> you should probably use msys instead
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> then you need 1 thing
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> and some packages
01:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> it has cmake plugin to work with
01:08 < bridge> <Ewan> also don't download cmake standalone even if using visu al studio, it comes with it...
01:10 < bridge> <teero777> I remember it was a real hastle to setup using vscode
01:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> huh, TiL, didnt know that actually - i just took my knowledge from when i was doing it and i remember using standalone
01:10 < bridge> <gerdoe> nah requires literally 1 click
01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> you did it the silly way :greenthing:
01:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> always!
01:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but for context to actually answer the question: to build the source code on windows you'd want 4 things, an IDE of your choice (you're not forced to use visual studio community no worries),  rust, python, and most importantly the visual studio build tools for c++
01:14 < bridge> <teero777> ig I just haven't compiled ddnet on windows since 2019 üíÄ
01:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> good for you btw
01:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> but since tw is using cmake there's nothing left to struggle with xd
01:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> using bam was kind of adventure
01:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> dude bam was so good
01:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> still remember that fancy BoToX script to build tw with bam
01:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> still is
01:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> well in terms of, using it as a build tool for ddnet
01:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> only if you have no need to connect it with any other cmake-based project i guess?
01:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> i don't remember actually
01:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> anyone has timeout on https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/ ?
01:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> no
01:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> no, i can access everything just fine
01:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> seems im special then
01:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> bruh
01:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ||when are we cooking ddnet 2.0 btw? if i get an ingame ping of "where accounts" one more time, im gonna recreate the definition of a genocide||
01:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ||when are we cooking ddnet 2.0 btw? if i get an ingame ping of "where accounts" one more time, im gonna recreate the definition of a genocide (INGAME!)||
01:22 < bridge> <teero777> haha the edit
01:22 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :justatest:
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ZillyInsta/cfg press t enter votes.cfg
01:40 < bridge> <gerdoe> stop using 100500 repos for one purpose xd
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want to share all my configs in one repo?
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That would be a mess
01:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> i mean you could place it in zilly-insta itself
01:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> so it would be pre-configuried server
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No I separate code and configs in my infra
01:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also my code is aiming to be generic for all and my configs are personal
01:48 < bridge> <teero777> So you think ddnet at 100tps would feel different?
01:48 < bridge> <teero777> Do you think ddnet at 100tps would feel different?
01:52 < bridge> <gerdoe> ofc
01:52 < bridge> <gerdoe> you could make it as generic one but okey xd
05:43 < ChillerDragon> fred do you know/use http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn ?
05:44 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie ^
06:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
06:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but isnt all mirrors the same
06:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or were you just default mirrors all the way before because you were privileged to have everything work for you by default.
06:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/help/
06:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just google translate + copy and paste
06:59 < ChillerDragon> looks legit to me but i would feel better if you say they are legit
07:03 < ChillerDragon> i mean can everyone get a .edu.cn domain? if not are all educational institutions trustworthy? Or could this mirror spread malware?

08:05 < bridge> <bts._.> :owo:
08:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
08:38 < ChillerDragon> jopsti the cursed c++ code u know what its for?
08:38 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/225b729199586346be3b0549dc56742136bcdbef/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L154-L155
08:39 < ChillerDragon> i am facing issues with registering rcon commands in the gamecontroller because it gets deleted on map change and the command callbacks stay registered but then point to invalid memory
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it just creates a new and fresh gamecontext
08:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> at the existing memory
08:44 < ChillerDragon> yes but why 
08:44 < ChillerDragon> to keep pointers valid?
08:44 < ChillerDragon> or is it another reason
08:45 < ChillerDragon> I think we need the same hack for gamecontrollers as well
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> that is valid syntax tf?
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> Gm ‚òï
09:02 < ChillerDragon> average C++ code
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah that's the part I dislike
09:05 < ChillerDragon> yes so u must be pro at it
09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It has quite some side effects
09:06 < ChillerDragon> anyways i think the hack does not work for controllers because its not always recreating it might also be a different controller
09:06 < bridge> <teero777> I'm getting CGameWorld flashbacks
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah dunno. Just don't touch it xdd
09:06 < ChillerDragon> i need to fix a bug
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah check If constructor is called
09:06 < ChillerDragon> i think vanilla has the bug too o.O
09:06 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller check #showroom
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ez
09:07 < bridge> <teero777> Raud damit. Spill the beans
09:07 < bridge> <teero777> Raus damit. Spill the beans
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ask matricks if he can give me teeworlds repo
09:08 < bridge> <teero777> ok
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thx
09:08 < bridge> <teero777> @mtrcks give jupsti tw repo pls
09:08 < bridge> <teero777> Thanks
09:08 < ChillerDragon> +1
09:09 < ChillerDragon> no trol jopsti is pro allowing him to merge tw prs too would be epic

10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> their example
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
10:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> do u know any good books/articles about compilers, assembly and stuff? :justatest:
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> dragon book
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
10:59 < bridge> <teero777> ah its rust ;(
10:59 < bridge> <teero777> ah its rust only ;(
11:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hellooooooooo thereeee
11:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my server is empty af all the time, i want to add a bot to be always present
11:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> or maybe 3
11:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> money money money
12:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ask chiller - He loves taking about His ~~illegally scripted Bots~~ Server Bots
12:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> illegally ?
12:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can a cute tee bot be illegal ?
12:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> where in the code, a new tee be made ?
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> tee factory
12:11 < bridge> <kekomonter> If bots in players list, then this will be illegal, I think
12:15 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin have a look at ``dbg_dummies``
12:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can i control the debug dummies ?
12:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to add a player to the server and control it
12:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> your server will stay empty in the list, it your goal is to announce them as players so your server will go up in the list. that's not allowed and they have to be excluded.
12:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> like a shop kipper or a god who chats to other players and guide them or something üòÇ
12:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> your server will stay empty in the list, if your goal is to announce them as players so your server will go up in the list. that's not allowed and they have to be excluded.
12:21 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it will be awsome if i learn both sides
12:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules
12:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> for start how can i add a player to server and announce it as a real player
12:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it will be on lan of course
12:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> that's what we're trying to say you mustn't
12:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xfaulty also for you, since I think your max clients amount is wrong
12:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the players in game will see the dummy/bot but they shouldn't appear on the masterseverlist/they shouldn't be registered
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i mostly want to add them so if a player joined the server, he won't feel lonely,
12:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> that's ok
12:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i don't want to rank up my server
12:25 < ChillerDragon> yes you can control dbg dummies
12:26 < ChillerDragon> might need some code adjustments i think but these are a good starting point
12:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thanks
12:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and what i need to pass when building ?
12:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> --dbg ?
12:27 < bridge> <diariesvexar> find more player to join üòâ
12:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok üòâ
12:57 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Why so? I have no server side bots on the map
12:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah
13:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i added
13:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
13:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> #define CONF_DEBUG
13:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ``` 
13:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in main.cpp, is dbg_dummies are now enabled ?
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U shouldn't do that
13:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the right way
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Defines in single CPP files can lead to odr issues
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Add it to compiler flags
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If some header defines it. U can also make it work there
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But afair its in cmake
13:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i didn't see a define of it anywhere in the code
13:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how :thonk:
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Look how cmakelists did it
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> Look to find where CONF_DEBUG is normally set
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i added this to my cmakelists 
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> add_compile_definitions(CONF_DEBUG)
13:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the debug dummies are weird
13:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's so cool that there is characters in the game but your sv is empty :poggers2:

13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> by then you mean "when"?
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but the thing is, when i change rcx to smth else it works :pepeW:
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yep xd
13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> do now that syscalls modify rcx
13:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh....
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> > RCX and R11 are clobbered by the SYSCALL instruction itself. From the instruction set reference: after saving the address of the instruction following SYSCALL into RCX). RFLAGS gets stored into R11

13:59 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing your println does a syscall ruining rcx, case closed
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> do know that syscalls modify rcx
14:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks üòÑ
14:01 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> you didnt Push rcx before using it in println ? Was that the issue ? (I Just wanna understand it)
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> theorically rcx is callee saved but sycalls are special
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> rcx is not saved
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> so he had to push ye
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> The registers RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, R11 are considered volatile (caller-saved). The registers RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, RSP, R12, R13, R14, and R15 are considered nonvolatile (callee-saved).
14:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ah sweet so i did Kind of get it :gigachad:

14:12 < bridge> <super3559> one was created

15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now fix it üòè
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Isn't it simply called ddnet
15:09 < bridge> <super3559> idk im not fiding naything
15:09 < bridge> <super3559> anything*
15:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the hard part for is not fixing it, it's the github.
15:09 < bridge> <super3559> that the application
15:09 < bridge> <super3559> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1196456171964465232/image.png?ex=65b7b1a4&is=65a53ca4&hm=28480802e0628aebfc2d0cf098e33b55de7740d5cde288035aa0c30b5bbe615d&
15:09 < bridge> <super3559> i have no idea what to doo
15:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the hard part for me is not fixing it, it's the github.
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Project explorer
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I see
15:10 < bridge> <super3559> where
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BTW the indicator still makes sense for weak bounce
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So this isn't a 100% issue
15:10 < bridge> <super3559> the only thing i see is solution explorer
15:10 < bridge> <super3559> no project explorer
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno. Google
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then that
15:11 < bridge> <super3559> now what?

15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is game client
15:11 < bridge> <super3559> oh im blind
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rest u gotta find out yourself
15:12 < bridge> <super3559> i have this from the readme.rmd or txt
15:12 < bridge> <super3559> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1196456846916063232/image.png?ex=65b7b245&is=65a53d45&hm=0e0e2555a2b2036126e9515f1ea6b626cb2a80794aa3ad7ebc278b4f57df8c4f&
15:13 < bridge> <super3559> it worked
15:13 < bridge> <super3559> pog
15:16 < bridge> <super3559> apparently when chaing the GAME_TICK_SPEED to 25 the air acceleration and the hook timer is still at normal
15:17 < bridge> <super3559> because it's acting weird for me
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u know about this
15:26 < bridge> <super3559> there is also the air controls which seem to be normal
15:26 < bridge> <super3559> which is pretty weird
15:26 < bridge> <learath2> Not specifically "dangling else" but I do know of shift reduce conflicts for LR parsers in general
15:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> there is two server.h
15:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the main difference ?
15:35 < bridge> <super3559> why does changing the SERVER_TICK_SPEED doesn't change some things like hook timer or air acceleration and max speed
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u have a ubuntu at hand
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know where can i find 
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki>  ld: cannot find /usr/lib64/Scrt1.o: No such file or directory
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ld: cannot find /usr/lib64/crti.o: No such file or directory

15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ld: cannot find /usr/lib64/crti.o: No such file or directory
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> in ubuntu
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should setup a local qemu with ubuntu
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ci runs ubuntu blegh
15:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I do have an installation of ubuntu. If I can help ;)
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mr.gh0s7 tell me if u find those files
15:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> install libc-dev just in case
15:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> k lemme reboot into Ubuntu
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, soz
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> is virt-manager the mostl ightweight?
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know a lightweight qemu frontend
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> gnome-boxes looks like the one requiring least pkgs on my gentoo
15:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> no I don't have them
15:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> this didn't install them
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u check
15:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm searching if they're in a pkg rn
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mr.gh0s7 it would be weird if they arent in ur system tbh
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just they may be in another path
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u have rust
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> cargo install fd
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> cd /
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> fd Scrt1.o
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, I always used virt-manager or qemu directly
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess virt manager it is
15:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah theyre in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-nu
15:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah theyre in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
15:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> no I don't think so should I install it?
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont worry ill just get ubuntu in qemu
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill need it for the future anyway
15:48 < bridge> <Ewan> aaaa
15:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you dont need a frontend
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you can use the built in gtk or sdl windowing
15:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it is the most lightweight
15:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I had ubuntu for a UE5 debbugging session.
15:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use antiX btw
15:50 < bridge> <Ewan> just start it on the command line
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 why does virt manager pull in pulseaudio
15:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> whats the difference between CServer class and IServer class ?
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ill use qemu from cli
15:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i use windows
15:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i feel like a stranger here
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> IServer is a interface
15:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can instantiate a interface directly because its "abstract"
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> so CServer implements the IServer interface, like a contract
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant instantiate a interface directly because its "abstract"
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i meant cant, was a typo
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> I was making myself a portfolio website, then I remembered I have nothing to put in one
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> u do
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> just in ddnet
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> you did lot of things
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> list them
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> in my case it would be
15:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> tbh I don't know what I would put in one either
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Telegun
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Some commands
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Moderate rcon command
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Some fixed here and there
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> with more detail ofc
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> Split ddnet into like 10 projects? That's smart üòÑ
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> I actually have a massive ddnet pr coming up
15:58 < bridge> <super3559> alright so seem like the air accel doesn't get affected by SERVER_TICK_SPEED
15:59 < bridge> <super3559> so you need to change that acordingly
15:59 < bridge> <super3559> weird
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 make small projects
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> also you can "half make" interesting projects
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> like my ryoOS
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> Ryooos
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> just showing a bootable OS amazes ppl
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont feel guilty, 80% of ppl dont know how to make even the shit os i did
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its worth it
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> (percentage invented by me not scientifically accurate, if anyone says no % please)
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> And the 15% that know how will put you down about it being not that hard yet can't do it themselves
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> honestly its pretty fun
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://os.phil-opp.com/
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> here btw
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> making the memory allocator was fun
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and handling double faults
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> I messed around with an efi bootloader once upon a time
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and learning about triple faults
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> Then I found refind, it's so good that I didn't mess around with it more
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im waiting for the next version of this tutorial cuz rust now is way better for freestanding
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 does qemu use emptyy space with qcow2
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> or only used space counts as used
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok looks like it grows and doesnt occupy unused
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚ùØ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow 25G
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> Formatting 'disk.qcow', fmt=qcow2 cluster_size=65536 extended_l2=off compression_type=zlib size=26843545600 lazy_refcounts=off refcount_bits=16

16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> does this look ok
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg ubuntu has a keyboard identifier
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> it asks u to press keys
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> it detected spanish

16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> so fancy
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> its been long since i used such new installer
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> Cool space age tech
16:22 < bridge> <super3559> is there even a way to change something so that the whole physic system goes at half speed
16:22 < bridge> <super3559> for my own server
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: the key word is message filters

16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> safe rust also guarantees that, I think
16:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you create an issue? there was a race issue on windows IIRC
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> I already did, you are about to get there on the backlog
16:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you want to do? it's behind cloudflare. so fetching frequently might annoy cloudflare
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o`
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its here in ubuntu
16:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz ubuntu is special
16:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: copyright year doesn't have any legal meaning. you can just remove it
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's good so that everyone only uses the interface and no one looks into the hidden class details
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> all functions are `extern` by default, dunno why they were marked like that
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> save the password hashed, not in clear-text
16:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i read the username and passwords from the file and set them to players who are logedin
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm betting on windows.h
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can pass `warn::Ignore` if you don't like the parameter
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I knew it üòÑ
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no. if you have an integer that's not 0, it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ‚Ä¶
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so == 1 is not the opposite of == 0
16:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do u scroll through all the messages since u were online last time? :justatest:
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did \o/ ^^
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you install `build-essentials`?
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup, thanks üôÇ

16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you should at least hash the password before saving it to a file. we have the `sha256()` function you could use for that
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> save the hash, not the password itself
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when you want to check whether the password is correct, hash it and compre it to the hash in the fil
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when you want to check whether the password is correct, hash it and compre it to the hash in the file
16:55 < bridge> <devinci24> yes. I did some more tests yesterday to make things clear for myself.
16:55 < bridge> <devinci24> In C you can compare pointers to booleans (ints can get you a warning as they do not get interpreted as booleans unless casted or the pointer is null), while on cpp you can't (or that's what I could get from my very limited amount of tests).
16:55 < bridge> <devinci24> Idk for some reason I though every int could magically be a boolean + didn't know that was a pointer.
16:55 < bridge> <devinci24> I just confused some stuff + said something clearly wrong ^^'
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> in c and cpp u can do if(ptr)
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> in C it wont work either if u do if(ptr == 1) to check for non-nullability
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ptr is not null if it is not 0
16:56 < bridge> <devinci24> yes ofc. that's what I've always done ig. But again, for some reason I though it was the same as ptr == number. which is clearly not
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> in a binary operation
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> such as the comparision
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> x == y
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> value types are coerced, to a type of one of boths
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> either typeof(x) or typeof(y)
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> iitcv
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> so it will not be coerced to a boolean
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to do the thing you had in mind, you can do
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `if((bool)pointer == 1)`
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it'd be pretty unreadable, so don't ^^
16:58 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah that's why I said "unless casted or the pointer is null", but that's a bit stupid or unreadable as you said
16:59 < bridge> <learath2> Y not `if(!!pointer)` or `if(pointer)`?
17:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> I wanna do a discord status bot for online players and stuff that's frequently updated.
17:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> currently not running into any issues, yet.
17:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> frequency is like 8 or 16 seconds
17:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> every minute is definitely okay, every 5 seconds or so is probably still okay
17:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's okay
17:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> k, thanks for the feedback
17:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> also tried locally with a frequency of one second but at some point discord starts to throttle/rate limit my message updates so it's pointless.
17:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> every second is probably a bit excessive
17:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> i was just wondering why this even implemented that way
17:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is your proposed alternative?
17:30 < bridge> <gerdoe> if it's used for logging only then - just log warn!
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the idea was that I also want to use it for tests, and perhaps in the dissector
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in tests, I panic
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in debug builds, I log
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in production builds, I ignore
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the dissector thing didn't happen though
17:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> debug_assert?
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't seem to solve the problem
17:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess I could provide a configuration for the crate instead of a function parameter
17:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since the last use case (wireshark dissector) didn't manifest so far
17:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (it doesn't allow me to distinguish between debug builds and tests)
17:39 < bridge> <gerdoe> some fancy macro with #[cfg(...)] debug_assert on panic/ignore case and warn on logging case
17:40 < bridge> <gerdoe> as you said
17:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't understand your solution
17:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you make it more obvious for me?
17:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, I'm gone for now. I'll read your answers though
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> macro_rules! warn_if {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>   ($cond:expr, $($args: tt)*) => {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>     if cfg!(feature = "warn_debug_assert") {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>         debug_assert!($cond, $($args)*);
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>     }
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>     else {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>         if !$cond {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>             println!($($args)*); // log::warn!($($args)*);
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>         }
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>     }
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>   }
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> }
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> 
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> fn main() {
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe>     warn_if!("ddnet" == "5991", "{} is {}", "something", "wrong");
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> }```
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> something like this
18:00 < bridge> <gerdoe> warn_if -> warn_assert*
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a programming language with localized errors üòè
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want that for edlang
18:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Watafak why do people use it? Do you have some source for that?
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think cpp has that
18:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> or msvc idk
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> interesting

20:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what do you think about pre-commit hooks?
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> Cool
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> I had one on my main pc that wouldn't let me commit if I don't fix style
20:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> cant it just run prettier itself before commit? xd

20:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i always play on those which doesnt requite account
20:40 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> hi
22:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> use anki üôÇ
22:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, that makes it hard to test. e.g. hard to test that the warnings are emitted, but also even just adding these cfgs for tests (and probably not all tests)
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> msvc has localized errors, indeed
22:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> i don't understand honestly
