04:01 < bridge_> <sans._.> You could look at the org page on github and check out the contributors
04:02 < bridge_> <sans._.> You could look at the org page on github and check out the people, or check contributors for the different repos
08:09 < bridge_> <reitw> Actually more than teeworlds, which is more than 0

11:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a graphic i made
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im bad at this
11:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why comic font xd
11:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else looks good
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its default from excalidraw
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://excalidraw.com/
11:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah for the school kids
11:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lmao
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not comic sans tho
11:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tru
11:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its hand written -like
11:27 < bridge_> <avolicious> Best software ever made üòÑ I use it daily in work
11:27 < bridge_> <learath2> I used excalidraw a lot when adding hand drawn stuff to my notes
11:28 < bridge_> <avolicious> In the past I used drawio a lot, but it was too complicated
11:28 < bridge_> <avolicious> excalidraw just does its job & it does it good tho. FigJam is a good alternative, its super simple aswell üôÇ
11:38 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I used excalidraw in obsidian then gave up
11:38 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I just heard about this today https://graphite.rs/
11:50 < bridge_> <patiga> For the Rust crowd: I created twstorage (https://crates.io/crates/twstorage), its mostly functionality from `storage.cpp`
11:50 < bridge_> <patiga> You can use it to find the local data and config directory of ddnet/teeworlds. It also provides methods (for now only `open_file`) to access these directories, with logic to first scan the config directory and then afterwards the data directory

11:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> epuc
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is ofc your choice, but are you sure you want it to be sync instead of being async?
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if someone some day uses it, you might have to maintain both versions ^^
11:55 < bridge_> <teero777> hey how do i draw a bezier curve correctly? are there any helper functions within ddnet?
11:56 < bridge_> <teero777> well i don't actually want a bezier curve.
11:57 < bridge_> <patiga> I haven't really put thought into that yet, good idea actually. Until now I usually wrote everything sync, and found some async stuff not that useful I needed to add a dependency to simply make it sync. I might also be using them wrong :D
11:57 < bridge_> <patiga> I'm open for async function in there ofc, though sync function do also make sense I think
11:58 < bridge_> <teero777> like this im not sure how its called xd
11:58 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1234805957553422336/image.png?ex=66321229&is=6630c0a9&hm=8fbeca3c367386da53e4cf3643080113b43d7e466dd17345b6a86aa69a668399&
11:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think u can also add pollers that simply wait for async tasks in place
11:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ryo shared one once
11:58 < bridge_> <patiga> yup, thats the dependency ^^
11:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> polster or smth
11:58 < bridge_> <teero777> a spline?
11:58 < bridge_> <patiga> thats the standard one
11:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i personally use tokio for most stuff
11:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's og and fast and can do basically anything
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> ```rs
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> pub fn interpolate<T>(frac: f32, curve: CurveKind<T>) -> f32 {
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>     use CurveKind::*;
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>     match curve {
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Step => 0.,
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Linear => frac,
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Slow => frac.powi(3),
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Fast => 1. - (1. - frac).powi(3),
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         // TODO: Implement Bezier curves
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Smooth | Bezier(_) => 3. * frac.powi(2) - 2. * frac.powi(3),
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>         Unknown(_) => 0.5,
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga>     }
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> }
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> ```
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> *cough* I should also implement bezier at some point *cough*
11:59 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> pro
11:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> me too xD
11:59 < bridge_> <patiga> that would be the `Smooth` curve type, judging from your drawing
11:59 < bridge_> <melo∆û> Epico ‚ù§Ô∏è
12:00 < bridge_> <teero777> in c++ üò≠
12:00 < bridge_> <teero777> anyway i solved it
12:00 < bridge_> <teero777> thx :D
12:01 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> I should learn rust
12:06 < bridge_> <patiga> the calculation is relatively simple: linear interpolation with a fraction between 0 and 1: `3 * frac^2 - 2 * frac^3`
12:08 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> :owo:
12:08 < bridge_> <melo∆û> This isnt linear Interpolation tho IS it ?
12:08 < bridge_> <melo∆û> This isnt linear Interpolation tho is it ?
12:08 < bridge_> <patiga> well you modify the factor for the linear interpolation
12:08 < bridge_> <patiga> so it isn't linear anymore, but you still use the function for the linear interpolation
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> epic patiga lib moment
12:11 < bridge_> <melo∆û> I See
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I think it is time some creates an awesome-tw-libraries repo listing all ready to use libraries so users know what they can use
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because some things are hard to find or nobody even dares to search for them
12:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just do it

14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he was active on github
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and in discord since yesterday
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it was not rewind time yet
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
14:13 < bridge_> <Peakies> I was disappointed in myself and I was disappointed in wanting to solve a problem :cammo:
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the path is the goal. maybe you at least learned something new
14:18 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah I noticed that solving problem is not everything it's should be readable and understandable for others (I can't understand my codes too :D)
14:25 < bridge_> <melo∆û> Thats Part of the learning process, Check my First ever PR to ddnet, i felt so stupid :kek:
14:25 < bridge_> <melo∆û> Ah i meant my Second one, the First one was Just a refactor
14:29 < bridge_> <Peakies> Yeah senpai I saw your PR before üòõ
14:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is my first one:
14:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/861
14:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
14:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 62 commits xDDD
14:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> back when i didnt know about force pushing
14:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> Now I understand why you can handle 400+ tee on your server and I can barely handle 112 tee üôÇ
14:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i wrote the physics in GPU language to run it on my GPU?
14:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be cool af, ngl
14:55 < bridge_> <Peakies> üëç üòã
14:55 < bridge_> <Peakies> you wrote with Rust right ?
14:55 < bridge_> <Peakies> you wrote it with Rust right ?
14:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only write rust since 1.5 years
14:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before that i wrote all stuff in cpp
14:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also nowadays i'd probably write it with a vulkan-like backend, instead of OpenGL
14:56 < bridge_> <Peakies> hmmm cool
15:01 < bridge_> <Peakies> I was going to create server to be able handle at least 128 slot for special events to be able celebrating that events on that port but I have a few problem on client side that `m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter` is null after 112+ connected tee and it's cuz of opening scoreboard, You don't have this problem on yours right ?
15:02 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> It can only handle 64
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, safe rust doesn't really use pointers anyway.
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but my rust version is more scalable.
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Btw just bcs i had 400+ chars on my server, that doesn't mean that it could handle 400 connections from other ppl
15:03 < bridge_> <Peakies> even on your server ?
15:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never tested that
15:03 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> The client itself can handle 64 clients only, the server has to exchange these slots for each client dynamically
15:04 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah I noticed that even when I connect 128 dummy my pred increase like 2x as normal
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1227001251955474562/image.png?ex=663205b7&is=6630b437&hm=0c3a63bea50ababa56c68639e46ca1c0d11cec9b29e01249da40c449063bb90f&
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean here are like 1000 entries in the scoreboard
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's hard to read bcs of the colors
15:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but locally i could read it
15:04 < bridge_> <Peakies> I read you commits and use it but didn't solve them problem of vanishing some characters and stuck on opened scoreboard
15:05 < bridge_> <Peakies> I liked your scoreboard üòÑ
15:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Well, that's what happens when you just take the commits/code.
15:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> It's a complicated thing to realize this feature
15:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> So
15:05 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah could be better with a light color or something
15:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> If you want to solve all edge cases it's gonna be hard work
15:06 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> There are countless commits in F-DDrace regarding the 128p translation layer
15:06 < bridge_> <Peakies> Yeah it's take more time can't solve with copy pasting in 1 hour of work
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep, i'll soon work on client ui again to fix such stuff üòÑ
15:06 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> haha
15:06 < bridge_> <Peakies> Like to see it
15:06 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> It'll probably be easier taking ddnet's 64p<->16p algorithm
15:07 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> and adjusting that to suit 128p<->64p translation
15:07 < bridge_> <Peakies> I don't know maybe I should completely use your source as my main and add my client to server api to or don't know
15:07 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> You can do that, but my server is 0.7 based, with a lot of features and things basically
15:07 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> So, dont know if it'll suit your usecase
15:08 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah that a problem too
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in this mod i have 256 player support btw
15:08 < bridge_> <Peakies> it's 0.7
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's based on vanilla
15:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Based on it, but ddnet can join
15:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> And has full support
15:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> biggest problem is the 128p code is all around the whole source code
15:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> so you'll definitely forget some parts when taking itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
15:08 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah I saw that and I asked once about netmessageex support on it
15:09 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> F-DDrace has that
15:09 < bridge_> <Peakies> I want to use for both block and ddrace
15:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Hm, fddrace does not have every current ddnet feature
15:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> and it uses custom tiles which might nowadays be used by ddnet
15:10 < bridge_> <Peakies> cuz my server right now are completely with custom client you know I have soundboard and animated emoticon that need to use netmessageex to send or receive data
15:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> ah
15:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> If you have custom client anyways, then just fix ur client to support 128p
15:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Then ur server doesnt need this compatibility code
15:10 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah that the case for ddrace I might got problem if use your gamemode
15:11 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> NET_MAX_CLIENTS=128 fix all crashes along the way and there we go
15:11 < bridge_> <Peakies> that the problem I can do it like by adding scollable scoreboard or something like that to show whole player list but don't know how to fix vanishing or that m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter is become null in some points
15:12 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> You dont need all of that anymore
15:12 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Dont use this algorithm
15:12 < bridge_> <Peakies> I already did to solve some problem but it's not perfect yet
15:12 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> In client ?
15:12 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah
15:12 < bridge_> <Peakies> on server side I think it's work fine for everything
15:12 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Remove the compatibility code algorithms and then no character should be missing cuz the server will send every 128 tees
15:13 < bridge_> <Peakies> problem is on client side that can't show everything and it's problem only happening when I want to see whole 128 player in my screen if I move every from some of them it's work fine
15:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> yeah thats because of the algorithm
15:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> remove it
15:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Your client is capable of showing all tees
15:14 < bridge_> <Peakies> don't know about it or where is it
15:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> gameworld.cpp is the translation
15:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i thi j
15:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> think
15:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> anyways i gtg
15:14 < bridge_> <Peakies> oh I'll check thank for your guide ‚ù§Ô∏è
15:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Np, im just unsure whether we talked past each other but ye xd
15:15 < bridge_> <Peakies> thank you too ‚ù§Ô∏è
15:15 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah we talked before on discord's dm
15:15 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> 4 years ago
15:15 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> 5
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah about scroll on ddnet scoreboard
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> üòÑ
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> I am stucking on this for 5 years wtf
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> =))
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf xD
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> I should move on I think
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u use a custom client anyway right?
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> I show you before
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you send the source code?
15:16 < bridge_> <Peakies> that one that has intro movie
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i remember
15:17 < bridge_> <Peakies> it's for the company that i work for them can't share source code üò¶
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you use windows?
15:17 < bridge_> <Peakies> yes
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
15:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with linux you could use "sanitizers" then you'd quickly find out why it crashes exactly
15:17 < bridge_> <Peakies> I just support on windows cuz my 99% of players playing on windows

15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u said there is a null ptr
15:18 < bridge_> <Peakies> yes but don't crash
15:18 < bridge_> <Peakies> just opening scoreboard and I can't move or see myself
15:18 < bridge_> <Peakies> but every other tee can move
15:19 < bridge_> <Peakies> I can record by OBS if you want to see what exactly happening
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok but i feel like there is a buffer overflow or smth
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why should an essential var like m_pLocalPlayer be null for no reason
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sry but i can only help with reading source.. anything else is random guessing
15:20 < bridge_> <Peakies> I think when I disconnect and reconnecting again it's get fix again or don't know don't remember it exactly let me check
15:20 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah I know
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok, anyway, if u can additionally install linux to your windows, and can compile the client there
15:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u'd have an easier time

15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it's hard to get better by just doing random coding.
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You need a goal and design for this goal
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> visualize what you want to create and design your code for it
15:24 < bridge_> <Peakies> Maybe I skip basics
15:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u can't get further with code, write comments and leave code out
15:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try to explain to yourself what you want
15:24 < bridge_> <Peakies> I never used comments but I should cuz it's really help to myself I know it
15:25 < bridge_> <Peakies> I never used comments but I should cuz it's really help to me I know it
15:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also never shy away from rewriting stuff. sometimes it's normal that you do it completely wrong
15:26 < bridge_> <Peakies> I do sometime I completely remove everything and start it again I'm not lazy üòÑ
15:27 < bridge_> <Peakies> Well for screen switch I start coding from zero 3 times but didn't get what I wanted to achieve
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep but that is because this isn't really easy.
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You first have to understand the workflow
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> windows sees you change screen -> sends an event -> sdl polls all events -> our SDL stuff in input.cpp handles events -> you update variables related to screen (like gfx_screen)
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think that should already be enough, but i don't know what exactly the original issue was. probably some variables were not updated, because the screen resolution changed etc.
15:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also find our graphics code a bit messy
15:30 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah variables won't update on settings->graphics and need to get resize after switch by hoykeys
15:31 < bridge_> <Peakies> I fixed  when we switch using  it's drop down menu

16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which tool was used for this
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your renderer?
16:02 < bridge_> <patiga> yes
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does the image that you create do post processing?

16:03 < bridge_> <patiga> no
16:03 < bridge_> <patiga> in particular that cloud
16:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it store the alpha values?
16:03 < bridge_> <patiga> how do you mean? it only uses the color channels, no depth etc
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you fetch that image from the GPU directly?
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as is?
16:04 < bridge_> <patiga> yes
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and do you make sure alpha values are set to 255?
16:04 < bridge_> <patiga> best way I know of at least for wgpu
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else:
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are mipmaps active in that image?
16:04 < bridge_> <patiga> yes
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it happen without?
16:05 < bridge_> <patiga> hm unsure
16:05 < bridge_> <patiga> will test next time i'm on my laptop
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1234868523042471979/image.png?ex=66324c6e&is=6630faee&hm=7052a8d9887218b27afa3416a43f5921dab9a4a4f16496cfaba1893738ee62a4&
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i force a high LOD index it happens
16:08 < bridge_> <patiga> so higher mip level, right?
16:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
16:08 < bridge_> <patiga> but...
16:08 < bridge_> <patiga> isnt that a bug?
16:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> certainly
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is not a desired behavior
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for your pixel art tool it's ofc problematic

16:10 < bridge_> <patiga> > Revert "Dilate & optimize non-dilated images" 
16:10 < bridge_> <patiga> 
16:10 < bridge_> <patiga> ^ last commit in the history of that file
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are dilated
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> already checked
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dilate only expands a few pixels
16:11 < bridge_> <patiga> ah
16:12 < bridge_> <patiga> nearest neighbor but only within a certain distance I guess?
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume it's mostly bcs the amount of mipmaps you create.
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> every mipmap blits between black and non black transparent pixels
16:13 < bridge_> <patiga> its only a rly low resolution btw üòÖ
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the more often you do it, the more black u get
16:13 < bridge_> <patiga> so more extensive dilation would help, right?
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might have other side effects tho
16:14 < bridge_> <patiga> hm, anything in particular?
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mixing red with green is probably not desired either xD
16:15 < bridge_> <patiga> but dilation just didnt do anything for many pixels here. simply giving each pixel a valid color would've helped here
16:15 < bridge_> <patiga> I don't want to change how dilation works, only find a wa to not give up pixels with no suitable neighbour
16:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's defs better than the current thing üòÑ
16:17 < bridge_> <patiga> I don't think any pixel on the cloud mapres is black at all ^^
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you need dilate in rust:
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/d5009f76e5909be7b8e4be7bda16af1e2118c58b/lib/graphics/src/image.rs#L8
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but untested xdd
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you are free to use it ^^
16:17 < bridge_> <patiga> thanks :)
16:18 < bridge_> <patiga> or a compute shader? xd
16:18 < bridge_> <patiga> nah, I dont think thats a good usecase
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd honestly just disable mipmaps in your case. or don't take such a high mipmap
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> strictly speaking you could say mipmaps are also just a hack
16:19 < bridge_> <patiga> wait I think I know the fix
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you want a custom shader, u could simply fetch the texels from texture manually and do interpolation
16:20 < bridge_> <patiga> I should sample smarter for the mipmaps. not simple blit
16:20 < bridge_> <patiga> take the alpha value into account of the neighbouring pixels
16:20 < bridge_> <patiga> that sounds like perfect fix actually
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could also rewrite you code to use pre multiplied alpha
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> especially if you do the calculation on the GPU anyway
16:21 < bridge_> <patiga> for the rendering or creation of mipmaps?
16:21 < bridge_> <patiga> I'll need to take a look at premul  alpha gain
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the biggest flaw of pre multiplied textures is creating mipmaps (precision loss here) and precision loss generally. but if u directly do it on the GPU it should be better i guess
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for all of your rendering
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so do the pre multiplying in the fragment shader i mean
16:22 < bridge_> <patiga> huh I'll read up on that next, then
16:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not beforehand
16:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so not really pre multiplied xdd
16:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> multiplied on the fly
16:23 < bridge_> <patiga> alrighto ^^
16:23 < bridge_> <patiga> thanks a ton for the debugging discussion, I enjoyed it :music:

17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> Hi all! I want to offer you an idea to expand our favorite editor
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> Maybe someone suggested this, but I didn‚Äôt delve into the proposals
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> 
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> I would prefer to see "triggers" in the game that activate/change something when activated by tee's hitbox or tee's action
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> I think this will be an extended version of Switch, but it will be called differently
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> 
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> Speaking of switch, it would be a good idea to combine them with quad or tele, speedup, tune, switch e.t.c layer
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> 
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> My main idea was that mappers of our game would be able to add triggers to their maps, which, for example, would be able to move/activate tiles when they
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> Or change the color/quad when the trigger is turned on
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> You can also make the trigger turn on under some conditions, for example, is there 2 tee on them, or only when 5 tee at the same time
17:17 < bridge_> <1234503178> 
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> I think this can be implemented, because the game Geometry Dash (where the idea comes from) is made in C++, as is DDraceNetwork, based on the fact that Cocos2d-x only supports C++
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> And I also think that the trigger action code is already publicly available from gd, I don‚Äôt think it would be difficult to transfer it to our game
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> .

17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> .
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> I would also like to see 3D graphics in the game, like on map "acq" but only there it works a little strangely (in circles)
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> Although this breaks the concept of the game a little, because it is called a 2D shooter, it is possible to ‚Äúdeepen‚Äù the game at least a little
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> 
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> I would also like to ask why they won‚Äôt add 0.01 pixel movement of tiles to the game (I don‚Äôt know what this measurement is called)
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> I studied this a little, and noticed that only the texture can be moved by 0.01, but the tile itself cannot
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> Just explain how it works and why you can‚Äôt move the tile by 0.01, it seems like a good idea too
17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> .

17:18 < bridge_> <1234503178> .

17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u sum it up in 2 sentences?
17:23 < bridge_> <avolicious> GPT says: 
17:23 < bridge_> <avolicious> > The author proposes adding "triggers" to the game that can activate or change elements based on tee actions, similar to concepts from another game like Geometry Dash. They also suggest enhancements like 3D graphics and finer tile movement, questioning color blending inconsistencies within the game.
17:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3d graphics? i'm in
17:27 < bridge_> <1234503178> Sorry, I meant something else, most likely the translator is not working well
17:28 < bridge_> <1234503178> üëç
17:31 < bridge_> <1234503178> a little off topic, but I was surprised by this GPT, which shortened my text by 9 times

18:15 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> thats the only thing this gpt fella is good at
18:29 < bridge_> <melo∆û> what is it with the LLM generated things at the moment?
18:29 < bridge_> <melo∆û> they are so stressful to read
18:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> walls of text are always stressful

20:23 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks the color mixing is curious, is it perhaps an unintuitive result of how alpha is handled?
20:26 < bridge_> <learath2> It some how ends up with a hue closer to yellow than red, meanwhile the red and yellow being combined lie perfectly on 0 deg hue for red and 60 deg hue for yellow
20:34 < bridge_> <learath2> Depending on which one is on top, it ends up closer to that one üòÑ
20:35 < bridge_> <learath2> @1234503178 I guess that should explain how that works albeit in a crude manner. Idk why it happens, jupstar is the rendering wizard, he'd know better
21:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> LMFAO
21:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> another nobody trying to profit off the work of an open source project
21:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> get a job
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i'd not call it unintuitive, it's not happeening at the same time. one of the colors is first mixed with white
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then the other is added to that mixed color
