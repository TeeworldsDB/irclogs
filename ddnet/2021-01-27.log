08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first troll on github since ever lol
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: this one? xd https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3551
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh btw @deen next up would be eval_if_cmd if you want to give feedback here already then it would be nice https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2846
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <w13z> HEY, im new in discord, but is possible add this?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <w13z> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/803980769726824478/AWDAWDAW.png
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <w13z> is possible create new console command, example: cl_showhud_healthammo_numbers???

14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: Even more overkill in my opinion ðŸ˜„
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Backwards-compatible Teeworlds commands
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think I'm fine with your PR, do you want it merged so we can get it out in the next version?
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> @deen i am tired of maintaining a ddnet and a vanilla config thats why eval_if_cmd is so useful to write one cfg for all clients
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen how did you notice the maximum? got a notification for that?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 sure ðŸ™‚
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen since we are close to release how what do we do? Is it okay to add more to a release candidate? :P
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah if that's a problem, we can delay the PR until after the release
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 im not sure if eval_if is stronger for abuse than current configs are anyway
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> could you provide an example?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 it's always around 16:00, so I just check around that time
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 sure, add it
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 your statements sounds like if i can get my ddnet client to have a aimbot its legal
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> I get what you mean and we all probably somehow used it like that
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that has been the policy so far
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we get to that point, the policy might be changed, but I'd like to avoid that headache
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> i mean there is a full on rifle aimbot in ddnet client already
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see the problem? ^^
19:13 <+ChillerDragon> set dummy weapon to rifle and activate hammerfly and u are unfrozen
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd like to avoid exactly that
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> hm
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> pls dont fix the client xd i need that bot
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> Well yea I can not ensure that one feature day one can abuse eval_if in combination with new config variables to build something fishy
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> wait but since its merged in vanilla already does that mean ddnet servers will ban vanilla clients @heinrich5991 ?
19:16 <+ChillerDragon> road to hard fork ddnet i guess 
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unlikely
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> then the mess is already there
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, vanilla doesn't have dummy, for example
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> but ye good catch i like that you think of such things
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> fair
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> what about adjusting the rule?
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> while ur at it fix rules completley :D
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> the whole complain about staff and faking part is bad as well
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> im tired of keeping up with cool kids deepfly hax and aim lock binds just make it illeagl :p
19:20 <+ChillerDragon> wouldnt it tw console was strong and it can be used to build nice things and when its used for bad its illegal?
19:20 <+ChillerDragon> i wish irc could edit messages xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @chillerdragon would be better to have a version config cmd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then you could check if version >= ur specifc version
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If not exists its 0
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In vanilla for example
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah no, it says no such command then right
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> yea retriving the version is useful
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> also thats where eval_if_cmd comes into play to check which command or config provides a version
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 werent u the maim guy? I currently reboot machine when i mess up my maim xd any idea on how to get my mouse back after doing a selection screenshot while tw runs in fullscreen?
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> it stays the fucking marker plus thing and i can not click things when in my super key gnome menu
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The automatic reconnect in the client just got me too many connections in a short time ðŸ˜„
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 this is apparently an old config option, you need to reset it somehow
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk which though
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why did we say it was a bad idea to do a queue for joining full servers?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it was deen saying that we want players to join servers and not wait in queues
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> queues promote waiting
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of just finding another server
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats deen argument iirc
