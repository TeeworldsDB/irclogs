00:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> do we have the commit where we fixed that ?
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> dunno what that is
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> you could check whether it is spoofed

00:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> uh, they spoofing zCatch ?;/
01:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I saw that one on DDNet as well
01:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> they filled whole one server, 64slots
01:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> not immediately clear whether it's spoofing or not
01:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 will check in a min or so

01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 try installing it ðŸ˜›
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I have no idea, why they doing it
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ;d
10:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> @heinrich5991 When I put the driver through the driver manager, they work somehow crookedly. I see how I on the screen pulls some kind of strip
10:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> @heinrich5991 And in the game itself, like some kind of delay. Because when I press the fire button or the hook button, nothing happens
16:35 <@Nimda> Cave Fly by Im 'corneum just released on Solo at 2018-01-20 16:30
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> yo does some1 know how i can get coordinates of tiles serverside?
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i my case for example i need the first finish tile the server finds.
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i did this and it works horrible... it prints random numbers and random stuff happens on the server. Idk maybe some memory ripping
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/z5Rv0/745ecf7d60.png
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon check `src/game/server/gamemodes/ddrace.cpp`
20:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ty
20:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i dont find something there .-.
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> OH WAIT
20:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i guess i found something^^ lemme play around
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <Ryozuki> optimization flag '--float-store' is not supported :o
21:29 <+Ryozuki> i compiled using gnu gcc
21:29 <+Ryozuki> (it's a warning, -Wignored-optimization-argument)
21:30 <+Learath2> on windows?
21:30 <+Ryozuki> linux
21:30 <+Ryozuki> gcc 7.2.0
21:31 <+Learath2> well there was a float issue in windows which is why we added the flag
21:31 <+Learath2> but whatever fix I tell you I can't be certain of without trying
21:34 <+Ryozuki> oh, i was compiling with clang++
21:34 <+Ryozuki> so its clang that doesn't support that flag
21:34 <+Ryozuki> maybe we should handle clang in the cmakelists.txt too
21:36 <+Learath2> heinrich5991 loves handling the CMake stuff :) I'm sure he'll figure something out :P
21:36 <+Ryozuki> i guess :D
21:39 <+Ryozuki> btw, i think the irclink doesn't handle colors to well
21:39 <+Ryozuki> test test test
21:40 <+Ryozuki> i noticed it also on the release message
21:52 <+Ryozuki> Learath2: btw the pr is fixed
21:52 <+Learath2> which pr is fixed?
21:53 <+Ryozuki> vote_no command
21:53 <+Learath2> heinrich5991 can merge it after he clears his review :)
21:54 <+Ryozuki> Learath2: btw, travis is failing because treats warnings as errors, and it is compiling with clang
21:54 <+Ryozuki> it gets the same warning i got
21:54 <+Ryozuki> :)

23:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> its linux !?
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> wooo, i love that design
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yep
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> looks perfect
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> KDevelop integrates so well with kde xd
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜„
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Looks like Visual Studio
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Can you check, if you are able to install JetBrains softwares ?
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> like phpstorm, intelija ?
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> its possible
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> but im not gonna pay
23:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> intellija is free
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜‰
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> kdevelop also works for php
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜‰
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I know, but JetBrains has
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> super cool and perfectly good
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i don't program in java
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Inteligence
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> But, it support everything else
23:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> as well
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah, but paying
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> and i like the ide i use now xD
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I didn't find anything better than JetBrains to be honest
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I know, i just asked if it is compatible
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> with linux
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah they make linux distributions too
23:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> (like, if it works good, or it's just bad version of compatibility, like WINE)
23:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> hmm, you making me curious
23:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i think its native
23:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> didnt tested it
23:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Maybe I will give a chance
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i wanted to get out of visual studio
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> somewhen
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> since i dont like microsoft
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> understandable ðŸ˜‰
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> :P
23:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> but visual studio is a GREAT IDE
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> rly powerfull
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> specially for c#
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Personally, I will never get rid of windows.
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Yea, but prefers Rider ðŸ˜„
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i want to, but games don't let me
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> from jetBrians
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> i just love workflow
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> maybe because im using Phpstorm since 2 years
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> idk
23:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i still haven't good decent drivers for my gpu card in linux
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> so i cant play well in it
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> specially it bugs a lot with 144hz when playing
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> and after you play with 144hz, you can't go back to 60hz xd
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> too big difference ?
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> its smooooth
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> there is big difference
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> trust me
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> you should try it once on your life xD
23:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Maybe oneday
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜„
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it's too expensive  atm
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜‹
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> only makes sense to buy one if you play games
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I play, but not a lot
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and not very often
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> in tw you notice it a lot tho
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> rocket league mostly

23:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> bubt probably, i will back to this game
23:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> all the time
23:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> because its best
23:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Because of the sentiment;) and nostalgy
23:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> oh no, I wasn't here to say VS is a horrible bloated mess that works as well for coding as a bulldozer works as a means of transport :/
