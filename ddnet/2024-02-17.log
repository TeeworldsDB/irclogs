00:34 < bridge> <learath2> There is no "delta value"
00:48 < bridge> <miguilim> the second byte of a snap single chunk is the delta number I'm talking about
00:51 < bridge> <miguilim> Although I dont know if this is the problem here
01:28 < bridge> <miguilim> nvmd the delta tick was wrong XD
01:37 < bridge> <miguilim> thats something :feelsamazingman:

01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> yes. ask chiller tho he's the expert
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> my life
02:12 < bridge> <teero777> Just think of something that you wouldn't have thought of if you hadn't known to think of something you wouldn't have thought. That always gives me random ideas and reminds me of other approaches
05:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> My fever stopped <:poggers2:1008007455936094328> now that i can think straight again i realized how easy the hack is to fix the python bug
05:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll this works https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/aH
05:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I will still fix it in the lib it self cleanly but for now you can just set the size to None and it will calculate the correct one for you https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1708143370.png
05:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i fucking hate python for caching constructor arguments across different objects its the most stupid thing that could ever be done
05:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like wtf pyson ``msg = MsgClSay()`` is creating a new object of the MsgClSay class. Who in their right mind would expect that pyson sets its header size to whatever the first instance of MsgClSay had
05:53 < bridge> <va_ll> wow, thank you very much
06:00 < bridge> <va_ll> and how to authorize in rcon and so that the bot can use commands in f2
06:02 < bridge> <va_ll> and how to authorize in rcon and so that the bot can use commands in f2?
07:22 < bridge> <remakepower> That mod snap the players clientid = -1 to hide players info, maybe it will make some client crashed (huh?
07:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ðŸ’ª :owo:
09:00 < bridge> <pisstine> ChillerDragon: You might be aware of this but I didn't see it anywhere on the bug checklist for ddnet 0.7 (besides for ddnet-insta servers), but on any 0.7 vanilla server every player's skin gets reset to 0.6 default when any server setting vote is passed until rejoining or map is changed. You can set your skin back to the 0.7 skin by just reselecting it in 'Tee 0.7', but everyone else will remain 0.6 default. Still loving the client n much better
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't you give him a issue on github
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't you open a issue for him on github
09:50 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't you open a issue for ChillerDragon on github
10:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pisstine cool thanks for reporting. I think I was not aware of that. I activated issues on my fork so you can open issues here now https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/issues you can also comment in the pr here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pisstine i attached it to the known issues in the pr and will have a look as soon as i find some time to do some bug fixing again c:
10:29 < bridge> <nouaa> allow 0.7 to die, chiller
10:48 < bridge> <learath2> <a:huh:640511171765600257>
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> It's too late. He is the 0.7
10:53 < bridge> <nouaa> there must be a way of remedying this
10:53 < bridge> <nouaa> :owo:
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> Brainwashing
10:54 < bridge> <nouaa> was thinking of a much simpler way, but yea..
10:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll here you go I added !rcon command :3 UwU https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/x3
10:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> You might wanna change this line unless your password is the same as mine o.O ``auth = MsgRconAuth(password = "x")``
10:59 < bridge> <va_ll> Thank you
11:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.8 release would change my mind hehe
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am this close to looking into element code. Its the worst piece of software ever built omg
11:33 < bridge> <matodor> 1.0 xD
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah pls conquer the tw repo
11:44 < bridge> <zhn> no why its common practice
12:42 < bridge> <va_ll> Is it possible to somehow make the client work without while True:?
12:43 < bridge> <va_ll> and so that the other part of the code below while True: can be executed while the client is running
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll put it in a thread or rewrite in ruby axaxax
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my ruby lib has built in thread support
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds_network/tree/master so in here you can say detach: True and get a thread pog
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @va_ll what code is it that you want to run? Does it have a tick? You can also call your tick from within the while loop.
13:18 < bridge> <va_ll> I wanted to install a discord bot along with the bot client
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> install?
13:18 < bridge> <va_ll> translator)
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then install it before the while starts
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also learn english)
13:19 < bridge> <va_ll> )
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i can only smile and laugh in russian thats about it ..
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im trying
13:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: when learn russki axaxaxaxa?)
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude all these translator ppl really motivate me to do so
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but im such a slow learner i always rq after 5mins of lookin into rus
13:21 < bridge> <diariesvexar> motivate to learn Russian language ?
13:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Start with slurs YEP
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes @diariesvexar i speak germand and english the other relevant language that is spoken in my tw ping zone is russian
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so thats the only thing i am missing to communicate with everyone
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even the 8yo turks speak flawless english
13:22 < bridge> <diariesvexar> maybe learning Persian would be nice ðŸ˜„
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are bubble
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like china etc
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are not relevant to me
13:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When learn ukrainian owo?
13:23 < bridge> <diariesvexar> oh you left us alone don't want to deal with us I see ðŸ˜„
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can not respond to that without being a dick
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar wot where are you from?
13:23 < bridge> <diariesvexar> Iran
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o
13:24 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that because my English level are shit ðŸ˜„
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well i mean you have the whole firewall intranet thing going on
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are partly cut off anyways
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then your community does further cutting off with custom client enforcement
13:24 < bridge> <diariesvexar> let's not talk about Iran internet and firewalls ðŸ˜„
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and you are just too far out of my ping zone so i will never play with any of you
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you are not interesting for me no offense :D 
13:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you have in plans adding nitro to ur chat?
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd watfak is that @MilkeeyCat 
13:25 < bridge> <diariesvexar> yeah it's fine I understand what you talking about ðŸ˜„
13:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do u know discord nitro?
13:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Like u get useless cosmetics for $10 a month
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar its always the russians that come with the translator english. All others i either never speak to or they know english
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat ye ik
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but how would that work for us? @MilkeeyCat 
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U get useless cosmetics and u donate either to ddnet or me ðŸ˜„
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such trol
13:27 < bridge> <diariesvexar> we talked a few time before on discord's DM but you didn't know that I was Iranian so you respond politely, so i think i was lucky back then ðŸ˜„
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ur rich anyways
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U dont need moni
13:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what i mean @diariesvexar its only the russians where the communication is sooooo bad
13:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat and ukranians mostly speak russian anyways
13:28 < bridge> <diariesvexar> shit ðŸ˜„
13:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: with ur chat u can send custom emojis, make thist feature paid
13:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :santatrollet:
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but i just cba to code payment system
13:30 < bridge> <diariesvexar> but I like them cuz their talented like Chinese and German people have great mind  to write new features
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar Im sure there is a bunch of chinese with HORRIBLE to non existant english. But those do not start conversations with me. Because they are not on the same tw servers or discords.
13:31 < bridge> <diariesvexar> yeah that make sense
13:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: imagine being lazy to get millions dollars a month
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat right .. from which users?
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> will you pay?
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who else is there
13:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Am poor
13:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> If i had a job, i would think about wasting my $10 in /dev/null
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:32 < bridge> <diariesvexar> jobless poor programmers ðŸ˜¦
13:33 < bridge> <diariesvexar> we should build our community with that title

13:35 < bridge> <diariesvexar> we talked again after 4 years
13:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no sorry i do not remember anyone going by the name diariesvexar :c 
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah the "dont know" was not about you was it? cring xd
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but im curious now what was the discord name you used to write with me?
13:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar also i do not see images anymore :( just that you sent something not what
13:54 < bridge> <diariesvexar> 4 years ago i don't remember my name
13:54 < bridge> <diariesvexar> again maybe don't know =))
13:55 < bridge> <diariesvexar> 2x again don't remember so just know I was send you a hotfix about your serverside bot to fix crashes on windows
13:55 < bridge> <diariesvexar> that's too bad ðŸ˜¦
13:56 < bridge> <diariesvexar> it's a video of my Iranian custom client that you can play it, it's not like other clients
13:56 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is there any platform to share video with you ?
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @diariesvexar you can share videos here if i feel like booting matrix which i do not right now. You can always share non discord videos/images by putting in urls to external sites. Or shoot me an email to chillerdragon@gmail.com or add @zillyhuhn on wire
14:01 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I understand that email part so i just do that ðŸ˜„
14:01 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I understood that email part so i just do that ðŸ˜„

22:22 < bridge> <chairn> this is perfectly legal
23:12 < bridge> <patiga> I don't know enough C++, is it really? Looks dangling to me
23:12 < bridge> <patiga> ah coz static?
23:13 < bridge> <chairn> static variable lifetime is program lifetime
23:13 < bridge> <patiga> so whenever the function is called anywhere, they all modify the same "return value"
23:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and as a bonus the intialization of result must be thread safe 
23:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and will slow down all further calls of the function
23:31 < bridge> <chairn> initialization is done once, all calls will just perform the addition and the store. I don't get the second part of your message
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it will have to check if initialized for ever
23:32 < bridge> <chairn> no? initialization is done at program startup of library loading
23:32 < bridge> <chairn> no? initialization is done at program startup or library loading
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not if the static is inside a function
23:33 < bridge> <chairn> static variables are initialized once, not every function calls
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's not what i said
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u said at program startup
23:34 < bridge> <chairn> then i don't get what you say
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but it happens when the function is called
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only once, but has to check
23:35 < bridge> <chairn> afaik, there is no check as C/C++ mandates initialization occurs before program starts
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> since c++11 it has to intialize it in a thread safe way
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> note i only talk about intialization
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> writing it is still not thread safe
