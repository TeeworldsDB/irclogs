00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> how to install 32 bit nvidia driver? multilib seems like it works different from arch
00:28 < bridge> <chairn> echo would also work with bash variables which are not necessarily in the environment
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
00:28 < bridge> <chairn> although quite unlikely to be honest
00:29 < bridge> <chairn> but you never know
00:32 < bridge> <learath2> the use flag `abi_x86_32`
01:58 < bridge> <Ewan> frustrating
01:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i see a pull request on SDL claiming to add explicit support for unscaled display modes but i see nothing reflecting that in the docs
01:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and the diff is weird
01:58 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/4301>
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> related <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/5450>
02:02 < bridge> <Ewan> all this marked as solved but still unsure how to actually disable scaling on wayland. the normal hi dpi hint does not seem to do anything
03:30 < bridge> <remakepower> Wayland has some minor problems to solve now(not ddnet)
06:12 < bridge> <Ewan> theoretically this one is already solved
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> Is it possible to do that?
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> 
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> make a tee mark in the editor in the form of a dot
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> 
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> and when it moves, you'll see that it's a line.
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> 
07:48 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> as well as the direction of weapons, laser, shotgun and grenade.

10:11 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> It would also be useful to add to the " tools" search engine, for example, it is difficult for me to find teleport to 8 on the map.
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> turns out older mesa package from ubtuntu works on my VPS, finally 😄
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/amd64/mesa-vulkan-drivers/download
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bullseye is too old, and bookworm is too new(contains the bug https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/9442)
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what a mess lmao
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft what even is unscaled
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and why u care so much
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah is it related to high dpi
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: btw you know whats funny?
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u keep pressing F5 on the image it shows the map animation xD
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.aliveclan.de:3001/?skin_name=greyfox&map_name=pkm&zoom=0.15&body=12189440&feet=8386048&dir_y=-1&eyes=surprised
10:30 < bridge> <totar> wtf is this api
10:30 < bridge> <totar> it rendered on a specific map? thats crazy
10:30 < bridge> <totar> it renderes on a specific map? thats crazy
10:31 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> .
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it renders the game using a surfaceless vulkan implementation 😄
10:31 < bridge> <totar> do they even use it for anything
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if anybody wants skin previews
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's now open to use
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you want to have indicators to where projectiles are going?
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i dont understand your request
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also please don't push msgs so fast
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if nobody answers, then nobody answers
10:36 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> Yeah, and there's a tee mark
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> im wondering if this is more eficient for skin rendering than just blending the image pixel by pixel urself with the image crate
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you ask me if it's complete overkill to have a surfaceless vulkan driver loaded?
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes for sure xdd
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well is possible i guess. but don't expect any developer to me motivated to add it.. best is you add it yourself
10:39 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> how?
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only real advantage is that u can easily add rendering for particles, map rendering, etc.
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. with javascript loading the whole map would make the first image slow (on the client)
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> here is the source code
10:40 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> :0
10:40 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> I don't understand any of this.
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then, time to learn coding
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 4 months u can then start implementing your request xd
10:41 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> ._.
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go full tryhard and u can do it in 1 month
10:41 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> 😭
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stop any life u have, and go waste your whole time for coding
10:43 < bridge> <exosphere_endosphere> well, thank you.

11:00 < ChillerDragon> trol
11:00 < ChillerDragon> they commited merge markers
11:01 < ChillerDragon> the webkit fork that powers a 40k stars js hype project is full of failed merge conflicts? :D
11:02 < ChillerDragon> been there for 8 months bru. Truely scary. Just proofs nobody is checking opensource code. It could be full of bitcoin miners and nobody would know.
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's fork
11:02 < ChillerDragon> yes
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who cares about a fork lmao
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has 60 stars
11:03 < ChillerDragon> 40k stars care
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no the fork has 60 stars
11:03 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/oven-sh/bun
11:03 < ChillerDragon> but isnt the fork used for this?
11:03 < ChillerDragon> or why do they have a random fork flying around
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they started as fork
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then split it
11:03 < ChillerDragon> yea maybe
11:04 < ChillerDragon> bit odd tho still isnt it?
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder what even happens with that on html
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean html might just ignore these tags xD
11:04 < ChillerDragon> you cant break html
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> exactly
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> http://pg.ddnet.org:3002/?skin_name=Bob&zoom=0.1&eyes=happy
11:05 < ChillerDragon> cutie
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :3
11:05 < ChillerDragon> when high res
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask ravie
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he probs has the SVG versions
11:05 < ChillerDragon> i mean at least the mapres i finished
11:06 < ChillerDragon> grass and dooads
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> actually good idea tbh
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i used the ones from data dir from ddnet
11:06 < ChillerDragon> might look weird with the pixelated skin tho
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i favor HD skins
11:06 < ChillerDragon> gotta ask ravie too then
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but only 100 from 800 have HD versions xd
11:07 < ChillerDragon> F
11:07 < ChillerDragon> jopsti wat should i do today?
11:07 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 in c++ or 0.7 in assembly?
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.7 in vulkan surfaceless
11:08 < ChillerDragon> yikes
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should i tell ya smth
11:08 < ChillerDragon> wot
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my main motivation was, bcs u always liked headless client so much
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i wanted THE headless client. a headless client that can even render smth visisble xd
11:09 < ChillerDragon> main motiviation behind what?
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> creating the above
11:09 < ChillerDragon> which
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the skin/map renderer lmao
11:09 < ChillerDragon> a
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's realtime rendered using vulkan without a surface
11:09 < ChillerDragon> i see
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, awesome story right
11:10 < ChillerDragon> not really my kink tho
11:10 < ChillerDragon> but truely a good story
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now you feel motivated to start coding rust using vulkan
11:10 < ChillerDragon> very
11:10 < ChillerDragon> i need headless clients that can do networking
11:10 < ChillerDragon> so i can use them for gaming on my vps
11:11 < ChillerDragon> or use tmux for window splitting
11:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Surfaceless demo rendering would be cool
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah xd
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: do you still need smth you can do?
11:40 < ChillerDragon> i got all the things
11:41 < ChillerDragon> i just need help to choose
11:41 < ChillerDragon> i decided to procrastinate and break my gdb setup for now after that i will probably debug my assembly
11:41 < ChillerDragon> you will hear from me again when i get stuck in assembly land
11:42 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when blog post on how to hack running ddnet servers with gdb?
11:46 < bridge> <logik_1499> Is it possible to convert demo ddnet into trim or other files?
11:47 < ChillerDragon> whats trim
11:47 < ChillerDragon> is that a video format?
11:47 < bridge> <logik_1499> ye
11:47 < ChillerDragon> link
11:48 < ChillerDragon> or do you mean trimming as in cutting?
11:48 < ChillerDragon> there are cut buttons in the demo player
11:48 < bridge> <logik_1499> no
11:48 < ChillerDragon> could you link the trim video format then
11:48 < ChillerDragon> idk what that is
11:49 < bridge> <robyt3> You can render demos to mp4 files ingame. If trim is a video format then you should be able to convert mp4 to trim.
11:50 < ChillerDragon> but is trim a video format?
11:51 < bridge> <robyt3> He answered yes, but I can find no info on the format, possibly because it has a bad name for a video format (trim already means something else)
11:51 < ChillerDragon> @logik_1499 what file extension does the format usually have?
11:52 < bridge> <logik_1499> mp4
11:52 < ChillerDragon> oh yea
11:52 < ChillerDragon> you can convert demos to mp4
11:52 < ChillerDragon> by recording them
11:52 < ChillerDragon> the ddnet client has even ffmpeg integrated
11:52 < ChillerDragon> who calls mp4 trim?
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Use the "Render" button
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150368415119319091/image.png
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> It renders the video to an mp4 file in the `videos` folder
11:53 < bridge> <logik_1499> thank you)
11:53 < bridge> <robyt3> You an encode the mp4 differently later if you want to
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> But why do you call mp4 trim?
11:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Never heard that before
11:54 < ChillerDragon> also super curious where that is coming from
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sq
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> silent quit
11:55 < ChillerDragon> ah he is russian maybe its llanguage barrier
11:55 < ChillerDragon> you know how i know he is russian?
11:55 < ChillerDragon> he made the russian smiley xd
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes xD
11:55 < ChillerDragon> xxxd
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thought about that too xDD
11:56 < ChillerDragon> eng: mp4 rus: trim
11:56 < ChillerDragon> ez
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> http://pg.ddnet.org:3002/?skin_name=Bob&zoom=0.1&eyes=happy
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my new meme tool
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> trim = mp4?
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> http://pg.ddnet.org:3002/?skin_name=Bob&zoom=0.1&eyes=surprised
11:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
11:57 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Discord preview for this skins isn't loading for me anymore
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah neither xD
11:57 < ChillerDragon> on irc weechat neither
11:57 < ChillerDragon> so thats a bit sadge
11:57 < ChillerDragon> gotta fix chat.zillyhuhn.com
11:58 < ChillerDragon> by writing some formal letter to quake studio requesting an irc unban
12:00 < bridge> <chairn> me neither
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://aliveclan.de/images/icon.png
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> either discord blocked it, or my VPS.. or it simply times out or smth
12:01 < bridge> <robyt3> It works in the browser for me
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it still worked with the current vps
12:01 < ChillerDragon> maybe cross origin
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am in browser
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
12:01 < ChillerDragon> you dont have ssl
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> HTTP-Statuscode 502 (Bad Gateway)

12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> used wrong url, which doesn't have the SSL cert

12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.aliveclan.de:3001/?skin_name=Bob&zoom=0.1&eyes=happy
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gonna fix them all
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
12:36 < ChillerDragon> TIL nasm does optimizations. So the assembly compiled to bytecode may contain different op codes than the one in the assembly code lol. 
12:37 < ChillerDragon> too many abstractions time to switch to writing op code manually
13:48 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150397416638513183/demo-skipping-overhaul.png
13:48 < bridge> <robyt3> @murpi ^
13:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Top is the old version, bottom is my proposed overhaul of the skipping buttons
13:52 < bridge> <murpi> :0
13:52 < bridge> <murpi> That's hella gud! Thanks for working on this :D
13:52 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think it should be config variable though. It will stay while the client is open but reset to 5s when restarting.
13:53 < bridge> <murpi> Ye, that's totally fine
13:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe someone can find better icons for speed increase/decrease, looks a bit odd to me still
14:11 < bridge> <Iza> That’s cool, have you found out what the bug is with the 1 frame delay with the coordinates/angle display?
14:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I got a rough idea how to fix it, but I haven't investigated what's all affected by the bug and if the fix would cause issues somewhere else.
15:47 < bridge> <nikhard> And make it so that you can select several intervals, and then drag them out into a new file, glued together like:
15:47 < bridge> <nikhard> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150427346537566218/image.png
15:48 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not possible with the demo format
15:48 < bridge> <nikhard> :(
15:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure if demos with several missing ticks in the middle would work
16:23 < ChillerDragon> omg sos how do computers work
16:23 < ChillerDragon> somehow this call instruction https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr/blob/9930b8999fe63552e56556094c8fa53e44c459b4/teeworlds_asmr.asm#L376 overwrites this memory in the bss section https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr/blob/9930b8999fe63552e56556094c8fa53e44c459b4/teeworlds_asmr.asm#L138 
16:23 < ChillerDragon> !?
16:23 < bridge> <YADDB> Command not found!
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least that's what u think it does xd
16:36 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1694356644.png
16:36 < ChillerDragon> how would you interpret it?
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the top bytes have value 03
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the whole location has xxxxx03
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's how i interpret that
16:39 < ChillerDragon> oh interesting
16:39 < ChillerDragon> yea idk sometimes it also prints 0x000000000003
16:39 < ChillerDragon> not sure what that means or who influences that
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it probably requested the top bytes
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the register is 64bit
16:40 < ChillerDragon> so i should give my socket label more than 1 byte in case it gets interpreted as 64 bit
16:40 < ChillerDragon> bloat
16:40 < ChillerDragon> but sounds good
16:40 < ChillerDragon> thanks jopsti lemme try
16:41 < ChillerDragon> HOLY SHIT THATS IT
16:41 < ChillerDragon> i spent the whole day debugging that bs xd
16:41 < ChillerDragon> jopsti ur tru genius
16:44 < ChillerDragon> hmm or i just offsetet the problem somewhere else by realigning memory xd
17:07 < ChillerDragon> d
17:07 < ChillerDragon> opsi i slipped
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki which I/O Scheduler are you using?
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 probs the default ?
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont remember rn
18:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> why
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats the best for a nvme m2 ssd?
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> none, I think nvme just defaults to no scheduler nowadays
19:40 < bridge> <chairn> so probably fifo scheduler, you need to have a scheduler, otherwise concurrent writes would be lost to oblivion
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> Well yeah, it's called `none` but there has to be some queue 😄
20:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 have u seen the aclaimed japanese movie named Ikiru?

22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah i feel that xd
22:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Overred
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i support all  these activists.. but never moved my butt a single meter for anything xDDD
22:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im busy listening to a guy explaing period
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
22:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s very woke and on Brand to be LGBTQIA’s supporter
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just remembered i wanted to rq
22:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s the video you sent
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> eminem is gay?
22:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also I love annoying homoph people
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> finished the video
22:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok ok
23:00 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why they had 5 rounds when they got him at round 2
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i told u my dreams... that's the most personal thing i ever shared. keep it secret thanks good night
23:00 < bridge> <Ewan> this dpi shit is rly frustrating
23:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You watched the whole video already?
23:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pro watcher
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> fix my dpi
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> whatever xd i just change resolution to 1080p and have my monitor scale it
23:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wats your monitor?
23:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You wait with dpi question until mr Vulkan went to bed?
23:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it's impossible
23:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 4k 32"
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the problem is that linux high dpi is dogshit
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> gnome does it the best out of all DEs i've tried (which is all)
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and gnome's approach is still not amazing
23:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use Wayland
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i am
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> not the problem
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also what's wrong with kde
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Isn't it like Windows basically
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> since linux doesn't have anything like a Windows manifest to tell the OS/WM/DE/relevant OS component whether or not it needs to be scaled on a high dpi screen, GNOME will just tell the app that its viewport is whatever % smaller than it rly is so that Mutter can scale it up by the user-specified scale % and get the right resolution and scale
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but this is totally unnecessary a lot of the time because the app is perfectly capable of rendering at that scale on its own
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> e.g. ddnet, at 2k if my gnome scale is at 200% ddnet thinks that the max. res is 1080p so it'll render there & gnome scales by 200%
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> on windows this problem doesn't exist
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Disable high dpi
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In settings
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i told u it's a 4k 32" screen
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i would have to get inches from the monitor
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean in ddnet
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Inside client
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't do anything iirc
23:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Blame sdl
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> the problem is not just ddnet btw it's pretty much every app
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it's wayland's approach. or gnome's implememtation that predates wayland's dpi spec
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> and yeai did
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> sdl discord
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1150540433051631616/image.png
23:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean that's basically what browsers do xd
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> browsers use DIPs
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it's different
23:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the website uses it
23:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah it supports multiple things xd
