00:00 < bridge> <Sans> Salt works best without context, tho might sound weird if it's used in something like
00:00 < bridge> <Sans> 
00:00 < bridge> <Sans> "_Jump_ over this obstacle"
00:00 < bridge> <Sans> "_Salt_ peste acest obstacol" (Correct form would "Sari" here)
00:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> Best it to just check the settings/controls tab for these strings. If you can code a bit you can just grep for it
00:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
00:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> `Localize("Jump" `

06:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> dude is actually going to get a perfect score on the private leaderboard
06:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> meanwhile I'm stuck trying to destructure a 4-tuple because I'm *supposed* to use pattern matching for those
06:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I can't use pattern matching with the restrictions I've set
06:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> i don't even attempt so i don't feel bad about myself
06:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I thought I had a solution with `uncurry` but what I actually need is `uncurry4` and I don't have that
06:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't want to use whatever random library that happens to include the relevant functions, might as well cheat and write one
06:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Or maybe give up on using regex and simply handle the the string by hand? I'm sure that won't be painful
06:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> curry mentioned, let's goooooo
06:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love knowing the solution the instant I read the problem description but spending an hour on a technical problem due to the weird restrictions I set on myself

08:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because f, a, b, c, and d are all big big stinky

09:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it wasn't happening a lot until recent years
09:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> now you gotta animate every menu in the game
09:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: wouldn't that just feel too slow?
09:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok so the way you do animated menus is
09:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1. if you animate the positions of menu items, do it real fast
09:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 2. if you animate the positions of menu items, do it visually only so the menu is operable before it is fully visible
09:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 3. avoid animating the positions of menu items in complex menus where the user is likely to perform many actions quickly
09:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> please tell that too apple asap
09:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> please tell that to apple asap
09:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 2 is very arguable, in some cases it becomes unintuitive if the menu items aren't where they appear to be
09:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but for cases where items quickly slide in from the side of the screen it's best that they're clickable even when they're not yet visible
09:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but for cases where for example items quickly slide in from the side of the screen it's best that they're clickable even when they're not yet visible
09:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess you could split it into two categories:
09:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1. static menus that animate when you open them (rule 2 applies)
09:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 2. dynamic menus that move around as you use them (rule 2 absolutely does not apply) (an example of this is something like the osu! song select menu)
09:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess you could split it into two categories:
09:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 1. static menus that animate when you open them

10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> My name has a special n :feelsbadman:
10:30 < bridge> <kebscs> Isn't it going to be confusing spec yourself?
10:31 < bridge> <kebscs> When you go into spec your tee is always in the middle so you're always going to spec yourself
10:31 < bridge> <Solly> N with long right leg
10:31 < bridge> <kebscs> New players won't even notice why they can't move
10:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> Love you Deen :kek:
10:32 < bridge> <0xdeen> Sorry, never noticed the weird n you have before
10:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's not weird :cammo:
10:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> some people really want to spec themselves for reasons. i'm thinking going the other way, maybe adding visual indications for spec mode changes
10:35 < bridge> <kebscs> There's already spec menu
10:35 < bridge> <kebscs> For left clicking its confusing that's why I didn't add it on the original pr
10:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah
10:36 < bridge> <kebscs> If I left click I generally want to spec someone not myself
10:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it feels like inconsistency really
10:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i guess let's revert again
10:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:
10:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do i revert to all the way before or do i keep the clicking on yourself in demo
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc
10:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly eitherway people are clearly triggering self spec even with spec menu
10:40 < bridge> <0xdeen> @tsfreddie So should https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9321 go into 18.8 or not?
10:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
10:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I like the idea of being able to click yourself but then again I'm a radical generality enjoyer
10:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @0xdeen make sure you don't have 84a0303 in 18.8 too
10:42 < bridge> <kebscs> I made click to spec so new players can spec someone without knowing about spec menu
10:43 < bridge> <kebscs> It doesn't make sense to spec yourself 99% of time
10:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's why i kinda want to remove them in spec menu
10:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i did
10:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
11:52 < bridge> <aegisub> Not really, no
11:52 < bridge> <aegisub> There are some libraries that have functions like fst4 but there's no easy general way
11:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and I can't believe I didn't get regex when I installed the compiler
11:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I thought that was the sort of thing that comes default with modern languages
11:53 < bridge> <aegisub> I guess you could allow yourself to define your own fst4/snd4/etc functions since it's a bit of an oddity that haskell doesn't have those - in theory they should be built-in for any inductive data type

12:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was ready to go too, so I don't think your timezone advantage changed anything

20:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> github hates me

20:41 < bridge> <kebscs> why cant we keep in menu and not left click
20:41 < bridge> <kebscs> like last 2 months
20:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just think it is weird that you are not allowed to do something when it is clearly available via other interactions (console excluded)
20:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but if you hate the excluding the first tee out of freeview very very much. i guess we could revert it. but we should definitely allow clicking on local tee in demo right? (not reverting all the way back)
20:45 < bridge> <kebscs> demo is good
20:46 < bridge> <kebscs> excluding first in freeview or hardcoding a delay feels bad
20:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> can we at least try it? still got a few days.
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> idk feel insonsistent
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> how would you tell theres smth like that
20:48 < bridge> <kebscs> idk feel inconsistent
20:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you don't, but i doubt it would trigger people too. cuz i don't see a senario where you spec in and out of a single tee without any other interactions (move your mouse or look away a bit)
20:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also keeping in menu does not solve anything for confusion cuz i regularly get people asking in chn why they can't move the camera after pause.
20:54 < bridge> <kebscs> I also dont know why its in the menu
20:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i honestly thinks specing yourself is generally weird. but i got pushback
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was removed for rc1
20:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what about a config to allow self spectating (in menu and clicking) maybe?
20:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so it is consistent and there if people really want it
20:57 < bridge> <kebscs> Maybe
20:57 < bridge> <kebscs> But multiview with local player is useful
20:57 < bridge> <kebscs> So it can be in menu i guess
20:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok i'll grey it out when self spec is not turned on instead of removing it and allow multiview self always
20:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> multiview needed some fixing too but we'll deal with it next version after auto spec cam is in.
21:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do we have a plan?
21:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is that okay?
22:00 < bridge> <kebscs> being greyed out when its already there would probably feel bad
22:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nah. i don't care anymore
22:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im doing that
22:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i am getting some sleep first tho
22:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's 5am:kek:
