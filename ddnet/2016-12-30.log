11:34 < QQ_> hey @deen i have a question about mysql (ddnet) i need to remove a player rank from an map like kobra and update his point , whats the command i must use for mysql ?
11:35 <@deen> QQ_: sth like "delete from record_race where Name = 'foobar';"
11:35 <@deen> and same with record_teamrace if it's a teamrank
11:35 < QQ_> player name is 'newspaper' and map name is 'kobra' and his point is '530'
11:35 <@deen> we update points with a script
11:35 <@deen> where Name = 'foobar' and Map = 'Kobra'
11:36 < QQ_> and about update his point ?
11:36 <@deen> you want to do it manually?
11:36 < QQ_> yes from consol
