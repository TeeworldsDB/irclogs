12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> github down
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> online again
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It goes to the Ubuntu/Debian maintainers of the DDNet package @ChillerDragon
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Right side here: https://packages.debian.org/sid/ddnet
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Fuck this, filebased scoresystem doesnt work again on my linux server. Why does it only work sometimes?!
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now it works again
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .____.
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont get this
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what doesnt work?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> file problems can be caused by permission errors and missing directorys or incorrect paths
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hello, I'm advertising for my new blog post where I talk about my new hardware, my first experience with Arch Linux and my Windows virtual machine for gaming! https://timakro.de/blog/new-hardware-switching-to-arch-linux/

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro did you give proton a try, I was looking to do a passthrough setup until I tried proton
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works quite well really
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> proton is gud
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> First time I replied to a scam email :/
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Worked something like this: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/spot-chinese-domain-name-scam/
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because I didn't recognize it as a scam
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 i guess, but don't want to do that. tried it with one game, it worked okayish, i had some issue which i don't remember why i went to dual booting again. then it doesn't work for every game, there's performance issues, it won't work with new gpu features like raytracing for a long time, and the portion of games i have in shops other than steam is growing
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i really appreciate what they're doing with proton but i'm sick of wine + games
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some games definitely don't work well yeah
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the ones I frequently play work fine, and I keep a dual boot for anything new I want to try, but I certainly do understand the desire for passthrough
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah i remember it was overcooked i tried it with
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think in home streaming didnt work
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah that's a good approach
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would love to have passthrough if only i could get the card to be used on linux when the vm isnt booted up
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i just switched after proton came
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but trying if proton works and otherwise using dual booting sounds good
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have pretty good experience with wine tbh
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> DXVK = even newer games work
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep, i pretty much decided to play any gpu heavy games on windows now, just teeworlds on linux right now ^^
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thats sad, i'd like to push the usage stats towards linux
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i didn't have a good experience with wine, i don't really know what proton does different or if it's just that wine has gotten much better but proton works really well for a lot of the games
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like dark souls works amazingly e.g.
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess they just do the testing and configuring for you
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 proton converts directx calls to vulkan calls
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they got valve support so
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think wine uses opengl
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i believe they contributed major stuff to wine
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> proton is basically many wine versions
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it always uses the wine version worked best
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and some other tricks
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wine 4 got vulkan
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they got envy
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> might be that thats the work of valve actually ^^
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no diea
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> proton doesn't do anything iirc, it's like that tool lutris or sth
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no idea
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well you need to use wine staging ofc
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no its not valve work
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that wine is working on vulkan too
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont use dxvk
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i just know they paid people to work on wine
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best would be to make all games linux available natively
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is it so hard
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> directx
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs linux = 100000 differences xD
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its microsoft marketing shit
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually u cant only blame microsoft
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they made shady things to remove opengl on windows vista
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh it's quite hard to have your game not work cross platform nowadays
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and their whole marketing saying opengl is worse
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there needs to be more standard between all the tools, drivers etc
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª windows pushes their standards by putting millions
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah modern game engines support alot of cross plattform
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> directx is the only thing I can think of being a half decent reason
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not the way to go
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but be honest SDL is the proof it doesnt really work good xD
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what doesnt work good
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too many bugs and work arounds always
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ehh idk
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but for big productions it might still be a lot of money that goes into all the overhead of QA and testing
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/01/Why-you-should-use-OpenGL-and-not-DirectX M$$$
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd really be okay with them releasing it untested for linux to begin with
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> and the linux market is so so tiny
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro because windows marketing
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and because
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that would help fuel the market
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> they would never do that, big companies are so scared of their name getting destroyed because something isn't working or not supported well
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> opengl and directx are just apis/interfaces basically, they don't specify alot of the underlaying implementation
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the main reason is windows comes preinstalled on the computers
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl dont want the hassle to install a OS
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directx is not hugely different, so yes, use opengl xD
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc directx does do some things that aren't too easy to emulate with opengl
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wine people were complaining about it a couple years ago ðŸ˜›
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directx tries to support alot of extensions too
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like ray tracing xD
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```Microsoft initiated a fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) campaign against OpenGL around the release of Windows Vista. In 2003, Microsoft left the OpenGL Architecture Review Board -- showing that they no longer had any interest in the future of OpenGL. Then in 2005, they gave presentations at SIGGRAPH (special interest group for graphics) and WinHEC (Windows Hardware Engineerin <message clipped>
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i'm not sure but doesn't every engine support either opengl or vulkan?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro they may do their own game engine too
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and unreal engine games are usually released on epic shit store which is windows only
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tbh all opengl versions before 4.0 are mess xD
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkan is the solution
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª the blog is a bit old already xd
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unreal and unity support opengl, vulkan and directx iirc
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3.3 = 4.0 without tesselation btw
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there was no vulkan back in time
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unity sucks
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> godot best
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are a lot of unreal engine games that aren't released on epic store
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://godotengine.org/
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pubg is powered by ue4 e.g.
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do they want force it in future @Learath2 ?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 yeah u dont know if they will force it
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't seen any talks relating to that @Jupstar âœª
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> knowing they have been buying game releases
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it wouldnt suprise me
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt they will, they already make a metric fuckton of money from the sales of ue games
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's also very nice that the entire engine source is available to you
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki is godot pure opengl?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the stupid comparisions they made back in time, as if brighness change means it improved, but dumb users believed it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575408495537553411/comparison.png
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª yes i think they will also add vulkan
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its MIT and no royalities
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> interessing, they probs ran into insane amount of driver bugs already XD
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> basically all old AMD cards xD
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or more like ATI
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª unlike us in this game they got shitload more contributors
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the end thats why enginers are made
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u dotn have to hassle wiht it
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> godot hmm, where do i know this
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deal*
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they had a couple GSoC projects up
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats gsoc
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> google summer of code
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=GSoC
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, I wanted to finish up their JavaClassWrapper
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wait, is there smth like this for duckduckgo!?
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but then I noticed that I don't really have time for anything but school :/
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to learn kotlin and see why its better than java
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im 2 lazy
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lmddgtfy.com ?

21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> uhh it even introduces typos
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> in the animation
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm supposed to be polishing my Java, but instead I'm helping people with their c++ homework

21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a thing for CS homework, I just cant stop doing other peoples
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wow in only 4 years
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not bad
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜›
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i usually have 1 commit / 10 years xd
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i run the cemu wii u emulator on my windows vm to replay zelda botw
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> emulator in virtual machine ðŸ˜„
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm playing botw on switch, right now ðŸ˜›
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i played it on wii u and then sold my wii u ^^
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> such a great game
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the game looks great without these stencil outline effects xD
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> saw a video while ago
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh and in 60fps full hd ðŸ˜„
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the sheer size of the map still surprises me
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love that shader/effect
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the cell shading look is nice
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> stylized graphics done well look soo good
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks*
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hate it xD
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> tbh when you have a higher resolution you begin to see the limits of this style
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cemu are the people that wouldn't make their emulator open source right?
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> right :/
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, remember reading the stupidest statement about open source from the guy
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> actually they seem to be supportive once you hack into it via replacing shared libraries and prove that your skilled
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> see cemuhook
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> actually they seem to be supportive once you hack into it via replacing shared libraries and prove that you're skilled
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they should really just release the source
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> as they put it they are scared of getting overrun with patches
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but they are free not to accept any PR
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and people would be free to fork, i think it's just ego as always
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they probably don't want people using a forked "cemu" that would be getting patched for random games
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yes
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe they stole information from nintendo
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or that ðŸ˜„
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the community might force them to add the hack fixes then
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rpcs3 e.g. is doing quite well
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they don't accept any hacks either
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to contribute a little to rpcs3 but playstation 3 is such a weird machine
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i agree the source should be public, but i also understand them, it's there income after all, probably scary
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i can't image
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, they get paid for it?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> its crowd funded or patreon
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> not sure
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it makes more sense now
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://www.patreon.com/cemu
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> money is always the problem in this world ðŸ˜„
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I highly doubt anyone would stop funding them tbh
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should try coding an emulator sometime, maybe a n64 one
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª dont tell me u like borderlands graphics
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> those look horrib le xd
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how ppl like that
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as i said, i hate cell shading xd
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> borderlands is not really my thing, game looks too realistic for it to go well with stylized graphics imho
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota 2 best
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its linux native
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyone want to do some code review for me? just a skim over
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it smth big
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/83c3fb0bb92b4d9c31cf4aea38a4faa2 just 300 lines
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that huge image though... discord pls
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fire!!
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really like coding in c++
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i thought it was ddnet xd
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no it's not ddnet, if it was ddnet I'd have put up a PR ðŸ˜›
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a friends homework, it works for a quick go at it, but I'm not too sure of the OOP and the usage of c++
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CStockItem{t...} is ... here a spread operator?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that was totally unnecessary, but kinda yeah
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u use a spread op to initialize 2 values? :o
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> told you, totally unnecessary ðŸ˜„
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why is it a template
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for the spread
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I can pass on ðŸ˜ƒ
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this some code for mcdonalds xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> basically
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TAX_RATE 0.08
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a nice tax
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here its 21%
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Specifically I'm not too sure about `CStockItem` and it's derived classes
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the naming is definitly bad
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ignore that they are basically the same (it was required by the homework to use polymorphism for it)
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CStockFluidItem
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would be better
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im bad at naming too xd
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but CStockItemType2 3 looks bad
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep definitely, I should have defined an enum with the types and named the classes properly
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would also remove the template i dont know why its used
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how about the `std::static_pointer_cast<CStockItem>(std::make_shared<CStockItemType1>(Count, Price, Name, Type));` ðŸ˜„
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It makes my eyes bleed
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> std::vector<std::tuple<std::shared_ptr<CStockItem>, int>> m_vIngredients;
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it rly need to be a pointer
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, because the stock decreases as people order
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I need to point to the item and not have a copy of it
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also `std::tuple` is so awkward to use, is `std::get` really the way to use it properly?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575415901285777438/unknown.png
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this definitly looks ugly xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah it makes me sad to see that part
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i dont like working with data structures and the c++ standard library
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 3 item types have a int and a double right? i think u dont inheritance here
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could rly have only one class
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I told you that already
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups im blind
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "ignore that they are basically the same (it was required by the homework to use polymorphism for it)" ðŸ˜›
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never would have made such an abomination if I didn't have to
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u did it or a friend??
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant see u doing this
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tuples have a v.first and v.second
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did it as a quick coding exercise
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess std::get is a way to get them but u can do it directly
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was a friends homework, i just like doing those for some reason
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro what else is there? boost data structures?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i present u smth that will make u die: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/any
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 there is nothing else
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you could use another language
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> or hack ddnet
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> and dont touch data
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> xD
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really use c++ for anything, I'm more of a C person
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coding in C is so simple and i like it
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but c++ sometimes its a mess xd
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does vulkan also work as a complex state machine like opengl?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> std::any? what does that even
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 hold any value type
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ddnet doesn't use the standard library for data structures and the data is not too complicated
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u have to cast it with
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> like all my prs to ddnet are mostly simple logic things
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> std::any_cast
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kinda like the teeworlds safe-space ðŸ˜›
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yes ðŸ˜ƒ
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no `std::map<std::string, std::shared_ptr<CItem>>;`
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i will fix 5 more issues next october @deen
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro xd
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt got my tshirt
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so sad
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I got mine
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 i've seen worse when i did a-star xD
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they forgot me :(
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like std::map
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that example was pretty tame ðŸ™‚
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i made a homing grenade in teeworlds for chillerdragons mod with a star
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it was terror
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> nooo your t-shirt ðŸ˜¦
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> they ripped you off
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -.-
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want to learn more c++, but I also want to stay the fuck away from it at the same time
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm conflicted
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i feel with you
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually hated java but i made some mc plugins and kinda enjoyed it so i have confusing thoughts
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, I also made a mc plugin or two back in the day
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think you can't know and use ALL c++, everyone's just using a subspace of features, right?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> knowing all c++ is impossible
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro yeah surely, but c++ people seem atleast more fluent with the standard library and the template metaprogramming stuff
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 best thing is <=> a.k.a spaceship operator coming in c++20 :troll:
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3 way comparision
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what I HAVE to practice more is OOP itself
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i find ur code a ugly example of oop
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i am bad reviewing since i never done it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so bad at designing out the structure, I mean I always end up with sth that works
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's never very clean OOP, like that example, all the classes depended on eachother, very bad encapsulation
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i have zero experience with the architecture of big projects with OOP
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u dont make a cstockitem interface and implement it with diferent classes
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> IStockItem
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> how is this game called in english
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> this dict.cc says ludo
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://www.dict.cc/?s=mensch%20%C3%A4rgere%20dich%20nicht
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oop in big projects if well done its pleasure to code in well idk if i ever used a big project
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i did this with c++ oop
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki that's what I had in mind at the beginning, but then I was like, y not just make it a base instead of having an interface
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but mc forge uses lot of it and its fun
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> my architecture was TERRIBLE
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interfaces are good
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro huh, some guy around here was asking for people to code ludo for him
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you did it for him? ðŸ˜›
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds interfaces
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent good imo
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like them
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they just useless
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> people would take turns, there was an AI you could play against and it was making sure the rules were not broken
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ahem, not talking about that
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 hav u participated in a ludum dare?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would enjoy doing it if i had any time xdd
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> u want to look at this code again let me find it ^^
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> always wanted to, I either don't have the time or I'm way too depressed
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a vicious cycle
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but man why they never do a ludum dare in summer
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i got nothing to do
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they do it in april and october
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro where is that fckn homing missile :( Why did you delete it?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fck it
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I would def do one in summer
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hahaha
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh https://gamesdonequick.com/ its soon ^^ always fun to watch
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki siO does gamejams every so often
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the homing missile still haunting me, quite ironic, like it would be homing towards me
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro please send code
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i dont have it anymore
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whaaat
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hy
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why*
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro how did you have it follow? linear interpolation?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> the pathfinding was tile based
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah there was some interpolation to make it look smooth
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hi fokko
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, i have made a very simple version of a homing missile, but without real path finding xD its in https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/homing_missile.cpp
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like was it just every tick taking a step towards you on the shortest path?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi jao
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i dont know anymore
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think it had an performance issue haha
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds like a fun project
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i needed to cap the distance, i never made it so that it could distribute the load accross multiple ticks
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 35 mins @timakro
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575421032840560640/unknown.png
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> lmfao so its very short game
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol no
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> if 35 mins speedrun any% then its short af
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn, they got it all the way down to 35
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @DingusFighter it's not glitchless lol
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye this guy dumb
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i never saw a speedrun of this game
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no idea how it works
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a inbounds portal run :D
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575421480507015168/unknown.png
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> they just run for the castle?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always fun to watch
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> do you need to finish the 4 shrines on the plateau?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro watch it
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> speedruns are amazing to watch
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> and if ur creator of the game ur gonna shit urself 100%
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i would find it funny
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> anyone saw the celeste speedrun of last agdq?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was gud
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i played that game so this was impressive
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> just play kaizo :troll:
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro you are not willing to redo the a* right? xD
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> NO
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :lol:
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but a tip: if you try to do the pathfinding in one tick you run into performance problems
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> just use anti ping + aimbot :troll:
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> unless you just want to go a range of 30 tiles or so
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well idk the range
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how to do it in multiple ticks then,m
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> might be more
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it cant be 30 must be much more i guess
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but it became a problem
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah it becomes super hard then ^^
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sounds like too much for me xD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> you can do it in one tick and just cap it
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont have any idea of a* :o
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i just looked at wikipedia
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> LOl
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro botw speedrun used to abuse the magnet and blocks, dunnho how they do it now
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i watched a few lets play episodes of my favorite channel, they thought they could use the physics engine to build a seesaw and catapult themselves to the shrine on the mountain. it was very disappointing ^^
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut the idea is you have an acceleration vector that always points towards the tee from the projectile, apply it each tick until your velocity vector is inline
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro ðŸ˜„
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut or you can do proper pathfinding yeah
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> getting a grenade bullet to look floating is hard enough, the code is in the chillerdragon mod ðŸ˜„
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have it already :p
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i made a straight grenade
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> its_a_rocket_then
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao nice
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pic
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/straight_grenade.cpp
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thanks ryo
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could even do a* every third tick or sth
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why m_Owner != -1 and m_Owner >= 0
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in other news, matcha is pretty enjoyable
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao ?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :thonkery:
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> read correctly
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> makes sense
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i could make it both >= 0
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> m_Owner >= 0 <=> m_Owner != -1
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki what does <=> do in c++20?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> spaceship operator
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 3 way comparison
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 3 way comparision
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also I saw std:ðŸ—º:contains in c++20, why wasn't that in before is beyond me ðŸ˜›
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> WOW
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice emoji
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-way_comparison
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `std::map::contains`

22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 spaceship operator is called
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> <=> sounds useful in some cases
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575426220108283946/unknown.png
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modules
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if c++ got a good lib packagement
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such pleasure
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its pain rn
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially thanks to windows
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 how is <=> usefull
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> isnt it always true
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575426487247831051/unknown.png
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a < b || a == b || a > b
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `a < b || a == b || a > b`
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0 means ==
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's useful the same way strcmp is useful
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. when sorting
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol true
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think -1 is <
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I made droppable weapons guys
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with f4
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it will drop in watch direction
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> item drop hack confirmed
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> ban fokko
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it will disappear on collision with shield
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://foonathan.net/blog/2018/09/07/three-way-comparison.html
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and it can use teleporter, speedup, stopper tiles
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> teleporter
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sounds too mathematical for 2300
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao yea
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look at this xd
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/575427359381913601/unknown.png
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes c++17 allows initializer in if
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> droppable weapons could be a cool idea for a coop map maybe
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i added flags, which you can drop witu f3, and you can hook them and they also can use tp, and they can use checkpoints aswell amd kill tiles (ofc also speedup and stopper)
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally initializers in if statements, i've waited so long
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> declarations* actually
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++20 may include ranges
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> weird
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like python?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would be fun
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for x in 1..10
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like that c++ adds this stuff, I hate the syntax they go for though
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ranges would probably end up something like `std::range<int>(1, 10)`
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i made it so that you can drop 5 weapons of each type at max, if you drop a 6th grenade for example, the first will be reset. (or after i think 5 min after drop, they begin to despawn aswell)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that won't work too well for ddrace
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why did you do it like that?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because you could easily spawn
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it'd be nice for a vanilla or zombie type thing
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you pickup and drop
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> standing in a weapon
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tile*
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> entity*
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, i'd totally make pickups that disappear after picking up first
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a weeb followed me, anyone knows him?

23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 also have them, i have a vanillamode (can be given to single players)
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> might be a cool map idea for ddrace maps aswell
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> anime guy
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true learath2
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao y xd
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some interesting coop can be explored
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thought the same
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dropping weapons?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would need to make pred code too
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have fun
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 if youre interested in the code, just look at my repo, whether you press f4 is checked in CL_VOTE in gamecontext, the drop itself is in character::DropWeapon and it will then spawn a new CWeapon (weapon.cpp) https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki no? Its an entit  of type CPickup
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> enitity*
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont drop it as in affected by gravity
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ok
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm we had difeent ideas
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or i understood wrong
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, it doesn't move when dropped?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see!
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 see CWeapon::HandleDropped()
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dropping weapon with speed towerads partner
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a cool feature we could have
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Improvements can always be made
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yes, it should act like throwing flags on block
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> and bounce xD
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no idk
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye bounce
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro it does right now
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check the mod, compile, test xd
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my mod* xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but projectiles dont have gravity in the base game, right?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> oh wait
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> not projectiles
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> weapons
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Pickups
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah a flag is a pickup as well?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a flag is a CFlag
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> still both have gravity?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes ofc
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> flags do have gravity in vanilla
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ever killed holding a flag?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes we know flags have gravity ðŸ˜›
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we are wondering if your weapons have gravity
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check HandleDropped()
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> does cflag inherit cpickup?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they can also use speedups, teleporter (yes, also cp) and stopper tiles
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro ?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> just wonder where the gravity code is
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe its for every entity
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all entities are affected by gravity?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you want it, yes
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Vel
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> there are not that many entities in the base game
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Vel = Tuning->Gravity!
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Vel = Tuning->Gravity
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ddrace added all this sstuff thats not moving
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ddrace added all this stuff thats not moving
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 look into CWeapon::HandleDropped(), the first line of it tells the gravity
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how does it look without prediction?
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Never checked actually
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can try it on my server
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> type my name, join press f4
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i also wonder where is the gravity code for the flag
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check flag.cpp
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> HandleDropped()
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Vanilla has it inside of gamemodes/ctf.cpp
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in the Tick function, aswell as positioning
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Pos = m_pCarryingCharacter->m_Pos
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i moved it into flag.cpp
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont want a `for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)` inside of my ddrace.cpp
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and then checking for flags
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> all entities inherit from CEntity, which contains m_Pos, m_Vel and that stuff
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Gravity is basically m_Vel.y = Tuning()->Gravity;

23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 interesting for you could be the flag hooking, go on my server, grab a flag and drop it with f3, you can see you can hook it. The original hook flag code is by Blue, but he made it fucking crash unsafe and very rushed und unpolished I made it way better and added extra stuf to the flags, you can check most of the code in gamecore, but some in character (search for FLAG_RED in both files)
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sadly, no prediction. But that cant be fixed i guess
